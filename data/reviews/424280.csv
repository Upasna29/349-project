The developer needs a high-five and someone needs to shout them a coffee. Actually, I'll do it. I love this game.\n\nI spend a lot of time sifting through Steam for good games.

You encounter a continuous stream of enemies which come in the form of wolves. This is referencing the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, one would assume.  The game play is simple to learn, but very challenging to become slightly good at.  The game is all about leader boards, competing against your friends and other players world wide. The more points you score from carrying out combos of strikes, and the longer you last before your Pig becomes bacon sandwiches all contribute to your final score.  You will find it tricky enough to break the one minute barrier most of the time, but when you do you soon come up against an increasingly challenging onslaught of wolves wielding axes, chainsaws, and riding rockets trying to be your end.\n\nIt is easy to see why this game has been released on so many platforms, but it is certainly a game more suited for either using a controller on for PC, or the touchscreen of phones. I tried playing using the keyboard controls and it is just a huge fumble-fest to say the least. Once trying to use the Xbox controller, you will see a noticeable difference in the way you are able to play the game.\n\nIron Snout’s art style is pleasantly presented in a simplistic cartoon form, nothing too fancy, and this is another element which makes it undoubtedly clear that this is a mobile port that has reached the PC platform. I personally would of liked to have seen a little variety in the background or maybe some different styles of enemies design being thrown at you rather than the same sprites over and over again. That being said, you can’t ask for much more from a free-to-play game.\n\nIf you like the sort of game where you can pick up and play for a few minutes and then put it back down again, then Iron Snout is going to tick that box for you, you’ll find it difficult to play this game for long periods of time, I think I maybe played it at most for 10 minutes at a time, any more than that and you’ll simply grow bored of the repetitive gameplay; but because of how quick it is to get into a game, and how quick games usually are to finish, this is the sort of game that has you keep coming back for more. The large amount of replay ability from this factor is definitely one of the strongest points from this title.\n\nAlthough Iron Snout is a free to play game, it doesn’t come with all of the regular free to play baggage we have come to expect such as microtransactions or pay-wall barriers, this is simply put, a game that you can play to it’s full potential, for free - No hidden catches.  It’s worth a small amount of your time to try it out and experience it  for yourself. I for one have also downloaded this game onto my phone for that extra hit of Beat’em up bacon action on the go too. I urge you too, to try this little game out.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

You might get lucky if it's just one wolf but what if the pack track you down? They'll pull your legs off like they need them for some kind of terrible wolf-centipede experiment back at their wolf labs.\n\nIron Snout shows you what's up and gives you the hard-hitting self defence techniques you need to survive. Hold your ground and PUNCH that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the face. POW POW POW. What now, ♥♥♥♥♥? JUMPING UPPERCUT. There goes his hat and his basket, catch it on the way down and THROW IT AT HIS FILTHY SLOBBERING FACE. OH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, his entire HEAD came off. But quick, his buddy's trying to lob an axe at you! DEFLECT! What the crap, where did I get this machete from?\n\nIron Snout is addictive carnage. I don't remember where I got this chainsaw, maybe somewhere in the last gang of wolves I frantically kicked to death, but the only way they're getting it back is between their beady little grandma-eating eyes.\n\nI show off some basic tenets of uppercutting these beautiful animals cleanly and humanely into their graves below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQaWgemK8rM","January 27","true","0.8"," 64 of 82 people (78%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","78","64","82","67","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/424280/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Incredibly addicting little beat 'em up. Need to waste a couple of minutes? Play Iron Snout! It's free!\n\nYou're the Kung Fu Pig, the very pinnacle of self-defense. Instead of running away when murder-crazy cartoon wolves come at you, you punch them.\n\nWhen they come, you smash them\nGameplay is very simple, yet challenging: arrow keys (or ASDW) left and right are attacks (the faster you hit buttons the faster you hit baddies), up is jump and down is crouch or dive. Wolves come at you at steady pace, few at first but then several at the same time and your task is to beat them all up before they kill you.\n\nVarious kinds of wolves carry items that can all be used against them. Butcher knives, hats and baskets can be thrown, and punching a wolf towards a rocket wolf explodes the whole bunch! Someone throws a knife at you that you can either deflect back with weapons or even grab and throw back to their face. The combo potential is great and fun to explore.\n\nThe challenge is the fact you can't move around. When two rockets are circling around and a wolf with a pongo stick is coming from one direction and a chainsaw dude and knife thrower from another, it's a feat to escape unharmed if they all come to the middle at the same time. In those situations you wish you could go and beat one side of enemies before the rest come at you.\n\nPolished little gem\nActually the whole game is seen in few minutes, when you've seen all the seven enemy types and fought against a small horde of them at the same time. Still, it's addicting and fun to keep going for the highscores. 100% completion (achievement-wise) however takes roughly 5 hours because of a couple grindy cheevos.\n\nIt's polished and technically works great, assuming you can get over the cartoon graphics and the casual mobile vibe. It's very alt+tab-friendly so I found it convenient to play it at the same time as playing a clicker game in another window.\n\nRather miraculously it is totally free. I think it says something about the game that I wouldn't have minded paying a couple of bucks to play this.","January 31","true","5.6"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","39","44","6","4"

Fight for your 10 bacon lives and slice through masses of bodies until the weapon break. Ripoff their heads or just impale a wulf on a branch. Woohoo, it's getting gory here.

There are many good things I found about this game:\n1. It's free. 2. You play as a pig fighting an endless amount of wolves. 3. It's download time is incredible (Without exaggeration, it took no more than 1 second for me to download.)\n\nThere are however, a few downsides. It gets pretty repetitive quickly, considering the fact that there are only two gamemodes (both gamemodes are exactly the same; one of them just gives you less health.)\nBesides that however; I had a lot of fun playing this game.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to try it.","February 21","true","1.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

I've attached a video if you want to check out some actual gameplay, but let me break down what I think about this game.\n\nIron Snout is very simple.  You click up, down, left, right, and that's it.  You kill wolves with punches, kicks, or by using weapons that you take from your killed foes.  The simplicity of the game comes from the fact that it is also for mobile devices.  Although simple there are many ways to kill the wolves or combo your attacks making the fighting even more interesting as you must react quickly to the oncoming enemies.  Every time I'd die, I'd want to keep going again and again to beat my highscore.  Sure there is only one mode and there's no upgrade system, but for being Free this game is absolutley amazing.  It's a must try, after all it's free.\n\nImprovements that could be made are possibly different playable pigs, different backdrops or stages, more weapons or enemy times, or maybe even a power up system.  However for being free, it's great as is.  If things such as the ones listed were added, it deserves to have a price set.\n\nPros:\n-Simple\n-Fun art and animations\n-Creative\n-FREE (like seriously there's no shop or anything)\n-Available for mobile\n\nCons (if any):\n-Only one mode\n-Only one background/stage\n\nCheck out some gameplay and feedback here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJjSsjEaNg","January 29","true","1.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

I like games that I can pick up and put down in a moment's notice, so this suits my needs wonderfully.\n\nThe controls are elegant and simple. The rules are easy to remember: you are a pig ninja, wolves are jerks, kill wolves. It is simple enough so that you can immediately start having fun with it, while leaving room for style and improvement. I can see youtube gamers showing off their ridiculous high-scores for this game in the near future.\n\nThat being said, there is a reason this game is free-to-play. The whole game has two settings: normal and 1-hp. If you're not a psychotic perfectionist or from Korea, you will probably check out 1-hp setting, play it a few times, then go back to the normal setting forever.\n\nStill, I can see this game eventually becoming something I would pay actual money for and I really hope the game makers will continue to update.","February 22","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachheadquarters/recommended/424280/","peachheadquarters","Mands","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachheadquarters/","5 products in account","Iron Snout is a free game with colorful and cute graphics, goofy sound effects, and a simple yet addicting game concept.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I saw the intro video and fell in love with its simple and cute artwork. Soon after, I installed the game mainly to hear the hilarious sound effects and to throw a few wolves around. About 10 minutes in, I knew that I was going to be spending a lot more time on this game than I had planned.\n\nThis game offers a short and helpful tutorial at the beginning that you can play over and over until you master the controls. The controls that this game requires are used only by the arrow buttons. By hitting the arrows in a certain order, you can punch/kick (left and right attack) and spin to attack (upper and lower attack) as well as jump over(dodge) the wolves that are coming at you. After getting used to the controls, you can start to get fancy by grabbing the weapons from the wolves and turn around and use them to defend yourself or to kill them.\n\nAs you play, on the upper right of the screen, the game will keep track of how many wolves you killed in that match. After you lose all of your lives (displayed by pieces of bacon on the upper left of the screen), there will be a new screen that appears on the right that will display your match stats. It will display your length of the match, how many strikes you had, how many hits you had, your best combo, your number of weapon kills, your projectile kills, projectiles dodged, items you caught, and most importantly…the number of heads you knocked off.\n\nIron Snout is both comical and satisfying. I highly suggest giving it a try, especially because it is free! It is for gamers of all ages. Kids will enjoy the simplistic concept as well as the goofiness of the game. Older gamers will enjoy the ability to collect a variety of in game achievements as well as competitively aim for high combo kills. After a long day at work, this game is just what you want to play to unwind. You may even find yourself laughing to yourself and addicted just as I found myself.","January 27","true","3.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

It's been developped by a lithuanian indie dev on the GameMaker engine (which is not bad, just limits the options for the game) and it's free. 100% free, not even skins, soundtracks (which by the way is gifted to you as soon as you install the game) or game power-ups.\n\nWhen I started playing it a month ago or so, it had only 2 modes:\nNormal mode: about 10 lifes (I can't believe I've never stopped to count them...) and thousands of wolves to beat.\n1 HP mode: pretty self-explanatory, same but only with 1 life.\nHowever, recently a new mode has been added, which allows local "PvP". It's like a volleyball game between pigs, except that the ball bleeds when you hit it... and there are wolves hanging around trying to kill you... but yeah it's very similar.\n\n10/10, the game gives what it promises, the trailer is an exact reflex of any gameplay.","March 2","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style is easily adaptable and would be suitable for a kid, even with the blood switched on.  Lastly, it can be played with one hand, whilst doing something else with the other, such as smoking, eating, or TV zapping (three of the average American's favourite pastimes!).

It's been developped by a lithuanian indie dev on the GameMaker engine (which is not bad, just limits the options for the game) and it's free. 100% free, not even skins, soundtracks (which by the way is gifted to you as soon as you install the game) or game power-ups.\n\nWhen I started playing it a month ago or so, it had only 2 modes:\nNormal mode: about 10 lifes (I can't believe I've never stopped to count them...) and thousands of wolves to beat.\n1 HP mode: pretty self-explanatory, same but only with 1 life.\nHowever, recently a new mode has been added, which allows local "PvP". It's like a volleyball game between pigs, except that the ball bleeds when you hit it... and there are wolves hanging around trying to kill you... but yeah it's very similar.\n\n10/10, the game gives what it promises, the trailer is an exact reflex of any gameplay.","March 2","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed Iron Snout's gameplay and look, which are both simple yet effective. It's very stimulating and requires either concentrated, or subconcious performance in order to get far. The art style is easily adaptable and would be suitable for a kid, even with the blood switched on.  Lastly, it can be played with one hand, whilst doing something else with the other, such as smoking, eating, or TV zapping (three of the average American's favourite pastimes!). I've had a while of fun, and so can you!

This game can be played for hours or minutes it just depends on the type of person you are for me i use this game to pass the time give it a few attempts of beating my high score and thats me done.\n\nIts a simple game that anyone can play, for a free game everything is as you would expect, and there is only one thing i can say about this game, download it to you libary and give it a try.\n\nFor me its a great game especially as it is free and you will only find this out if you try it.","January 29","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's WAY more addicting than it should be. It's actually fairly difficult as well, though mostly because certain attacks do more damage to your pig, which I think isn't really fair. All attacks should simply take off one slice of bacon from your meter, but that's just what I think. Anyways, it's very fast paced and once the enemies start coming more rapidly and frequently, you are forced to pull off much faster and much more ridiculous combos, of which look pretty cool. There are a few improvements I would like to see to this game to make it a bit better, and maybe give you an actual reason to keep playing. For one, I think an upgrades system could be well integrated into this game. For example, kills give you money, and then with that money you buy upgrades for your pig such as new attacks, combos take longer to dissapear, dual weilding weapons, attacks do more damage, triple jump, stuff like that. A few gamemodes, perhaps could work well. I want to see one that starts you off, as if you were at level 1000. Since the game gets progessively more chaotic and crazy as you kill more wolves, for example, at around 20 it's fairly chill, but begins getting pretty ridiculous at, say, 100. It should start you off immediately at a really high number, and maybe you have less health. Y'know, like a hard/cruel mode. It would let you see a lot of really cool combos, since there would be wolves coming from literally everywhere. So all in all, this is a surprisingly fun game, and it's free, so there's really no reason NOT to download it.","January 31","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Addicting gameplay, smooth graphics, and it's free and it has acheivements. Who the hell wouldn't get that?\n\nIt's simplistic, fun, and a good game to play if you're ever feeling bored. There's barely any lag, and with no currency as far as I know of, you won't be finding people at the top of the leaderboard just because they bought enough gems. This counts as major bonus points for me. Wouldn't you rather try to get to the top of the leaderboards in a nice, inexpensive way and not have people constantly beating you out because you have no money whatsoever? What's that? You have money? Get in line.\n\nOn the other hand, this game certainly has some drawbacks. For one, it is way too addicting. Sure, you laugh now, but just you wait. Soon you'll be among us, just one among the raging hordes of crazed ninja pigs that laugh in the face of an unending wolf army.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know.

Well, I can't really think of any, so you'll just have to deal with my own unimportant complaints.\n\nThe music is pretty meh. Standard and generic by any means, and I suggest plugging in some headphones and playing the songs that you prefer. Anything's fine, just make sure it compliments those sweet fighting techniques that your pig manages to pull off.\n\nCustomization is very limited as well, and it really isn't even there to begin with. I don't think they should go all out with gems and such, but maybe just add in a few costumes here in there that you can earn with each achievement. I myself don't endorse this, but I know I need at least two complaints or people'll start calling me biased or something. Which I am. You should get this game.\n\nAnd now, to conclude this message, I shall end with the most generic and annoying thing to ever happen in a review.\n\n11/10 would get humped by a mini-wolf again.","May 11","true","30.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

This leads to an interesting mix up alongside enemy patterns to develop a psuedo-strategy element in a fast paced button mashing extravaganza.\n\nNot a very long game, but has replay value.\nFor it's length, it has a pretty good assortment of variable enemies and items.\nSince it's free, it's well worth it to play.","March 9","true","10.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are tons of moves, many of which can be strung together in inventive ways to form multiple-hit combos. You can also pick up and use weapons dropped by the wolves, though I still haven't figured out exactly how to do that (did it a few times by luck). Game would be tons better with a comprehensive movelist and specific instructions on how to perform certain actions.

Yes, it's a 5 minute time-waster and certainly not something you'll sink hours and hours into, but I guarantee that you'll come back to it everytime you have a few minutes to spare and want to just HAVE FUN. Because that's what this game is... fun.\n\nThe gameplay is deceptively simple, as you can do pretty well just by button mashing to start with, but after a few games you begin to realise that there is actually a LOT more depth to the controls... and once you get the hang of how the pig moves and the timings of the different wolves you'll find yourself plucking cleavers from mid air to hurl back at them and performing split kicks that would put Jean Claude Van Damme to shame.\n\nSeriously, the game is slick as hell, fun to play and rather addictive, with that all important "just one more game" factor set rather high. And it's free! So, really, you have no excuse not to play this little gem...","January 27","true","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This game deserves the same praise One Finger Death Punch got because it's honestly good and it's one great way to pass time, it's ♥♥♥♥ing free with achievements plus you get to reenact the three little pigs in a brutal 1 vs all to death, minus the 2 other piggies and add like... 100+ wolves!\n\nThis game does everything right in it's genre first off there's only one graphical option and that's for switching from windowed or to fullscreen it's up to you if you think that's a good point or not. It works damn well with a keyboard/mouse and also a controller. The game looks pretty for it's comical style cartoon graphics, it's funny and just straight to the point too. The tutorial is super short like 5-10 seconds flat and without a hiccup you're straight into the game, the sound effects are pretty neat cute and simple. There's a couple of other options as well like turning off the music etc simple stuff. There is also plenty of enemy types to mix things up and in all honesty the game is not easy especially when you're further up the counter in the 100's. There's also no in-game shop or microtranactions it's straight up free nothing more nothing less and a big bonus is it's only like a 5-10mb game super small for what it is.\n\nThere's nothing really bad about the game it's free and fun... other than maybe having one graphical option? I also guess it wouldn't hurt to want to be able to customize the piggy but other than that the games pretty perfect no real complaints.\n\nIf you are or were a big fan of One Finger Death Punch then give this game a shot you won't be disappointed since it's straight up free, simple and fun!","January 27","true","1.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","1"

When i first began playing it, i thought it was stupid. But then i realized how addicting it was. This game sucked me in and made me crazy, just like when i smoked weed. Its like you're spinning in circles, not realizing your about to throw up. The intense feelings that this game gives you while you're fighting endless hordes of wolves is like fighting an entire army by yourself. When you play this. You are determined to beat your friends score ( If you have any ), to slip in the leader board, to get to the top 10........ And once you do... you feel as if you solved the rubix cube.... you feel as if you got an B+ on your math quiz, or conquered the world..... This game... will make you insane.... But its worth it. Just like good ol' cocaine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would als0 like to say the music is epic. It makes you feel like your slaying demons in hell with your bare fists, the music will make your heart pump fasttttt.\n\n\nAnyways. This game is like cocaine, so get it if you think you can handle it. Because its like eating crispy bacon.","January 30","true","3.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It deserves to be on Steam and the developer is also working hard for the game\nAny known issues are being fixed constantly by him so please have patience guys coding games and making them is hard.\nThe game is fun and unique, it gives a new idea to a mini game. It did honestly suprise me about how smooth it is in all honesty it isn't like the other mini games, you can see that thought was put into this and it was tested several times before release.\nThe graphics are : adorable I am sorry but they kind of are and this games makes you the most adorable murderous piggy the world has ever seen. I mean I can use this as stress relief, angry at someone? Pretend the enemies are that person and your high score flies.\nThe game also has some smart features to make it more exciting like being able to pick up items in it and throw them on enemies... sometimes some very weird ones like a basket.

This game is fairly difficult yet enjoyable. My friend and i have been playing it for ages to get a higher score than eachother, which is good and adds some interesting competitive aspects to the game. The controller support is a nice touch, i personally use a controller, as it feels great to kick back and relax. Also, THIS GAME IS FREE! No shops, no micro-payments, nothing, just pure fun. I reccomend this game, but would love to see some updates where more levels are added as you get higher scores or play for longer or something, which would then make way for new weapons, enemies and map takedowns, such as the tree impailing death. All-in-all, you may as well play it becuase it's free, so just play iy","January 28","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Playing this game will explain the real reason why Jews don't eat ham or bacon.\n\nThis game is essentially a free-version of One Finger Death Punch, only the piggy isn't nearly as powerful as One-Finger-Death-Punch-Guy.  OFDPG has the potential to use a ton of weapons and kill with a single punch using his bare hands.  The Pig kills in 3-5 hits, depending on who he's up against.   There are some cool things in this game like being able to duck and jump (and attack in midair), so that's pretty neat.\n\nReferences in this game seem to come from the stories "3 Little Pigs", "Little Red Riding Hood", and "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer".  Interesting humor for the Dev to throw in...though I'm not sure what Rudolph has to do with wolves....\n\nPROS:\nFree\nFast-paced button-mashing action\nAchievements\nEasy to pick up and play\nSmall download (10 MB)\n\nCONS:\nLack of enemy variety\nSome achievements are a bit grindy\nCan get a little boring after a while\n\nIf you can't afford OFDP, then this would be a nice free substitute for you to pick up.  Even if you own OFDP and just want another 100% Achievement game, then you'll enjoy this for a bit.   A nice casual game for a slow day.  You should be able to 100% this within 7 hours.\n\n6/10  Pretty Good.","February 3","true","9.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The game starts out with some basic moves to defend against the incoming wolves. Soon you begin to notice that you can disarm beaten wolves as well, which allows you to fight back using their weapons. This is where a tactical layer of the game comes into play: Should I try to catch the incoming cleaver out of the air or should I duck below it, so it hits the wolf on the other side? Should I throw the cleaver into the wolf wielding the chainsaw or should I let it come close so I got a chance to grab the chainsaw for myself?\nThe more you play, the better you get at finding the best solutions for the different combinations of enemies the game throws at you and soon you will find yourself escaping from seemingly impossible situations with ease.\n\nSince the game is free & small in filesize there is no reason not to try it.

It's an action-packed fast-paced highscore wolf killing extravaganza experience with responsive and intuitive controllers, using only the keypad. Once you get the hang of it, you'll start doing great combos, chopping wolf heads, and throwing them to other unsuspecting spear-pogo-jumping packs.\n\nWhat you see is what you get. Other than achievements, the experience defines itself as just going past your high score, so don't expect many reasons for replayability. It's 100% free like flash games back in the day, so at the very least you don't lose anything, and, in my opinion, it's totally worth having it around for those short gaming bursts you might need every now and then.","January 27","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can play it either as a "bash it until it breaks", or you can actually try to think as a true fighter... duck here, dodge there - let the wolves do *your* job!

A very simplistic, yet addictive game where you play as a poor pig surrounded by knife-wielding, rocket-hugging pack of wolves. The gameplay is rather straight-forward, nothing much to do except surviving as long as you can. I'd love to see useless custom skins for the pig, new ennemies, backgrounds and fluff for this game, congrats to the developper for his first Steam release!","January 27","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is an excellent time waster game.\n\nStory:\nThere's really not much of a story. You play as a pig and you kill waves and waves of wolves that are after him for god knows what. But this game is really not about the story. But the main goal of the game is the get the highest score which you get one point every time you kill one wolf. You can also track and post your scores online and see how you are at the game with the rest of the world.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is where the game shines and is the reason you'll keep coming back. You control the pig with W,S,A,D, he can jump,duck,kick, and punch left, right and up.  The control is spot on and really satisfying to kill wolves. You also will be able to grab weapons from the wolves you kill, you can grab hats, chainsaws and more to add to your combo score much easier. All in all the gameplay is very fun and additive although can get repetitive if played in long sittings.\n\nGraphics:\nVery simple but very nice 2D art of the wolves and pigs for such a simple games the graphics look very nice and slick. But i wish there was more backgrounds to choose from than just the same tree only background.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this game. It's free, can get highly additive and is great fun for anyone looking to kill a few minutes before going somewhere. I say overall i would give it a download and is fun for any type of gamer looking for a fun quick game to play.\n\n","January 28","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
