Your goal is one of simple revenge; you will track this genocidal fiend through caverns, mountains and forests in a bid to bring him to bloody justice.\n\nThe various conundrums are largely of the pull box here to hold button there variety with many of their immediate objectives in aid of laying waste to the army of mindless adventurers that lurk throughout the game to impede your progress. Lever-armed spike traps, mangling boulders and destructible outcrops are all in place to assist in their deaths, as well as the opportunity to lure the greedy idiots into harm's way with treasure chests.\n\nThe entire experience is unashamedly meta; the enemies refer to their in-game exploits as if controlled by the worst kind of WoW enthusiast. In as little as the first few minutes, there is a direct LEEEEROOOYYY JEEENNNKIIIINNNS skit played out in front of you. Some of the jokes are maybe a little too easy but considering the rate they fly out at, the humour feels immersive and complimentary to the game, rather than an awkward distraction.\n\nThere are a few frustrating quirks in the physics; the clutter created by assassinating an adventurer or freeing a boulder sometimes reacts to you standing on it by inexplicably spearing you in the face, killing you instantly. This alone isn't too much a big deal as you have an infinite amount of lives but it's a different story when combined with the somewhat bizarre checkpoint system. A checkpoint will only allow you to respawn by it a very limited number of times before it sends you backwards to a previous checkpoint. Die enough times and you're spawning back at the level's beginning. There's no real penalty to it as you retain all progress made within the stage; you just have to jump, climb and run back to where you were which seems to be little more than a cynical penalty for experimentation, especially in the later levels.\n\nStill, these are minor flaws when compared to what should undoubtedly be the main draw of Goblins and Grottos. The game possesses a powerful map editor which allows you create custom levels and campaigns for sharing online, even going as far as to let you write your own dialogue and plot for your NPCs. It could honestly use a basic tutorial just for the sake of eliminating half an hour's worth of random clicking but, that aside, there's hours of creative madness to be had with it.\n\nOur resident channel aristocrat Sir Durbadae gave the first level a crack. Check it out below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDAeHbDOm4Y","December 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","29","35","6","2"

Imagine mario maker, but now you can make cutscenes and dialogues which open up so many more ways to be creative.\nThe graphics and animations are cute and are well up to the standard set by other games using pixelated graphics that have been released recently. I was one of the lucky few who got to play in the closed beta and I'm not gonna lie, back then (especially in earlier patches) there was alot of physics bugs; however most if not all of them seem to be fixed for the early acess release. On a technical level, this game has less bugs and glitches then the majority of ealry access games.\nThe controls are very simple and easy to pick up. The map maker and the amount of creativity involved in creating your own levels is where this game really shines, however, The map maker interface is simple and easy to use, and the sheer amount of possibilities is what in my opinion makes this game so enjoyable. Sharing maps with friends and playing the top maps online is what this game is all about, and the fact that it has dialogues and cutscenes that you can make makes it even better.\nIn conclusion this game is driven by the excellent map maker and map sharing system, which is backed up by a very well functioning and technically sound game. I give this game 9/10.","December 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

For RPing geeks like us who sometimes mindlessly slayed goblins, orcs, and monsters by the dozen, here is the situation seen from the other perspective: you get to play the little green guy, this time. So you'd better avoid the big armored adventurers who'd slice you in half in one single swing from their sword or axe and you've got to find indirect (and sometimes devious) ways to lead them to their deaths...\n\nI like the humor of this game (some lines made me laugh out loud). The pixel art is full of charm, and what starts up as an unassuming game soon shows its subtleties. Variations and subtleties of control let you do more things in more ways than you'd think possible at first. The more I'm playing it, the more fun it gets.\n\nIt's still an early access game: you'll go through some part of the story without thinking twice and you'll be stalled for a couple of hours on some other levels.. But the developers are constantly working on it, rebalancing things, readjusting levels, fixing minor issues. They reply almost in real time on the forums and they work hard on their game levels and on their game mechanics.\n\nSo, the game is already good and it's likely to get better. If you think you're into this sort of game, you should really give this one a try... :)","January 2","true","7.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Getting up in the morning, playing the story mode (With all the funny jokes that are in it), and seeing who can complete a level the fastest with my brother. GOBLINS AND GROTTOS is a really good game that shows lots of potential.\n\nCONTROLS (8/10)\n\nThe controls in GOBLINS AND GROTTOS are nice and they work well. There could be more control configurations, such as W A S D and SPACE for moving, MOUSE 1 to grab things, and MOUSE 2 to pick up and throw things. Other than that, the controls are nice.\n\nSOUNDS (9/10)\n\nThe audio soundtrack is an odd collection that really captures the essence of the game itself. You can hear the nice music in the background as the Goblin parkours his way through each level. The speech of the knights are also very comical, and give you a good laugh. It would be good if the sounds were quite distorted. It would also be good if you could import sounds in the mapmaker.\n\nGRAPHICS (9.5/10)\n\nThe graphics are wonderfully drawn, with lods of details and colours. The animations and illustrations lure you into the story of the Goblin. I quite like the distortion effect when any object is underwater.\n\nBALANCE BETWEEN CHALLENGING AND IMPOSSIBLE (8/10)\n\nAt first, it was challenging, but now, I can do most levels in a breeze. Then there is some very challenging levels which I like, and levels that are more like puzzles. The balance between challenging and impossible is pretty good.\n\nSTORY/HUMOR (9/10)\n\nThe humor in GOBLINS AND GROTTOS is very effective and funny. The sounds that the knights make are very humorous. The Story itself doesn't have too much depth though. From what I can tell it is just the Goblin wants revenge because the Paladin killed his father.\n\nMAPMAKER (9/10)\n\nThe Mapmaker is a really nice feature that allows the community to share maps with each other, and compete for the number 1 spot. At first, the Mapmaker is a little bit difficult to understand, but when you make more maps, it is very nice. It can be quite time consuming creating a map, but when it is done, you feel a great sense of accomplishment. In my opinion it is even better than Mario Maker because you can make your own storys and cutscenes and be creative.\n\nOVERALL RATING: (8.75/10)\n","December 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game exerts creativity from the map editor, challenging puzzles, superb 8 bit artwork, and funny dialogue that you don't normally see in a platformer. The simplicity of the game makes you appreciate that retro feel of it if as if you were playing this gem from the 90s. A huge bonus feature of this game is the map editor where you can customize and share your maps with other people! The maps you can create are agility, story, puzzle, or just plain silly! As I played the first little bit there's a few changes that I would hope to see in the future:\n\n1. The map editor selection screen needs to be simplified and organized by categories\n\n2. Whenever your selecting an item in the map editor it should have some stats of what it is...for the cave moss I didn't realize that it's a object and I thought it was just tangible debris\n\n3. The triggers for scene cuts should have an option for a preview! As well previewing levers, patrols, and etc.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with the game and would recommend it to anybody who loves 8 bit games!

You play as the nameless Goblin, whose entire family was slaughtered by a level 100 paladin who appears to have been power-levelling his n00b buddy. On your quest for revenge you'll make your way through caves, dungeons, and forests inhabited by adventurers that call to mind every sort of MMO player you can think of -- and all of them are trying to kill YOU for phat lewtz and xp. You're only a weak little unarmed goblin, unable to gain levels like the adventurers do (and they do -- if you die they gain experience and can level up and gain better abilities!) and unable to really fight back except through your own cunning, using the environment to either make your escape or defeat those who would hunt you.\n\nThe traps work well and are incredibly satisfying to deploy. They can either be very simple -- a spike pit or a lever that drops a barrel, for instance -- or more complex -- knocking down a chest of loot in order to distract a knight and set him up for something else. Right now there are stationary spikes, lever-operated spikes, flame traps, boulders, slippery surfaces,  arrow traps, water, chains to swing from and climb, and probably a lot of things that I'm forgetting (plus more coming all the time, as the game is still in Early Access and the developers are actively working on it and update it regularly). In addition, there are explosive kegs, throwable bombs, an ever-expanding variety of adventurers who attack you in many different ways, and a ton of props and pieces that are moveable or even throwable (small rocks, skulls, boxes, barrels, tables, etc.). There are potentially multiple ways of completing levels, and your final score is based on how fast you complete it and how many points you earn (or lose) by defeating adventurers, eating muffins, or dying along the way.\n\nThe Official Story is currently ten levels long, but will clearly be continued in the future (as I said above, the game is currently in Early Access). I found it a good mix of entertaining and challenging, and I'm eager to see where the simple but fun story goes.\n\nThe real meat of the game, though, is the custom level editor, which is a blast to fool around with. It's fairly simple to figure out, and you can make your own levels as simple or complex as you want to, then upload them for other people to play. All the tools used in the official story are available to you here, including music, dialogue, and even a cutscene editor in case you want to make a more complex story for your levels. There is already an active community uploading custom maps, and I had a ton of fun playing them all and then trying to perfect my approach to each of them. Some levels are quick and simple and give you the same rush as playing a game of Sonic the Hedgehog or just screwing around in Assassin's Creed -- you know what I mean, that thrill of just running through as quickly as possible, trying to hit all the right spots in just the right way to shave fractions of a second off of your time. Others are intended to be story-focused, or silly impossible challenges, or my favorite: incredibly difficult, punishing levels designed to push your skills to the max.  The only regret I had was that I ran out of maps before I ran out of desire to play more, but players and the developers are sharing more maps all the time. I'm working on one of my own right now, and the design and building process is very satisfying.\n\nThe music in this game is excellent. There aren't a ton of tracks yet, but all of them are quirky and fit the "feel" of the game perfectly. I have yet to get tired of ANY of the music, which is really important in a game like this I think, and a real accomplishment. The developers have also made the soundtrack available to you to download for free, if you are so inclined, and that's another small gesture that I really appreciate.\n\nThe sound effects are one of my favorite things. None of the characters "speak" coherently out loud -- their dialogue goes into speech bubbles, but they all make various nonsense noises (sort of like the Sims): chit-chat, alarm, chasing, dying. Each type of character has a unique sound and feel, from the brutish warrior type to the hoity-toity "speech" of the Elf Queen. I personally never get tired of listening to the wizard adventurers jabber away in the background. It's almost a shame that I have to kill them so I don't get a fireball to the face.\n\nOverall, I absolutely would rate this game 10/10. It's addictive, with just the right blend of fun and challenge, skill and humor, good for long sessions or just a quick run-through or two. The devs have real love for their material, and it shows. The game is worth the price even in Early Access, and it's getting better all the time, with regular updates from devs and player-made maps (or maps of your own) to keep you occupied in between updates. The devs are also active on their forums, very helpful if you have any questions, and actively consider recommendations and ideas from the community.\n\nIf you like platformers, or goblins, or MMO humor, or, y'know, FUN, pick up Goblins and Grottos and give it a try.","February 20","true","23.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

In fact, this is my very first review, but Goblins and Grottos deserves more props and hopefully more support from gamers than it is probably getting.\n\nWhy? Because it is devious fun and a great puzzle game with a lot of potential. It's also a full game right now, and pretty dang fun.\n\nImagine for a moment, playing a weak, almost defenseless goblin in a world where cliched fantasy heroes with the AI personality of MMO players slaughter you and your kin as if you were level -10 pond scum. Now imagine proving them idiots as you lure them into traps, drop things on them, drown them, get them to kill each other, blow them up with dynamite and bombs, and generally wreak havoc on these mighty morons.\n\nNow Imagine a world that makes fun of fantasy tropes and memes in every action with clever jokes and situations and features a story of revenge told from the other side of fantasy: The goblin side!\n\nNow mix that with clever and sometimes difficult puzzles that can only be solved with a mixture of using the heroes to your advantage, using trapdoors, chains, and rolling on top of boulders to get around (And occasionally squishing heroes as you roll over them). You have to think to survive in this game.\n\nDoes that sound fun? Because that's not all. Goblins and Grottos features a full map editor so you can make your own devious levels and populate them with your own twisted creations.\n\nJust buy it. It's a fun game and has longevity built into it.\n\nPlus, it's fun to play a weakling for a change. Like any decent goblin, you'll find yourself dying over and over again, in comical ways, blowing yourself up, drowning yourself, doing everything you did to heroes to yourself. And it's fun, because you're reminded by all the smoking, shattered, broken corpses of yourself throughout the level that you made progress on your quest to defeat the ultimate paladin, and you're only a hundred or so deaths away from revenge!","December 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
