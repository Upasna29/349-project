It does, mostly effectively, distill the engaging mechanics of the first game into a non-linear, more compact format. Indonesian folklore, as it was in the original game, is still terrifyingly hardcore.\n\nCriticisms so far:\n-Combat, much like in DreadOut, can be frustrating. Linda moves with all the agility and speed expected of an Asian girl being menaced by ghosts (read: exactly none) and weapon switching/readying can be clunky. A few enemies can easily gain on Linda and keep her knocked down, extending boss fights by virtue of having to resurrect with each death.\n-Most of the environments are simply revisited areas from the original DreadOut with some minor changes. However, all except a few of the ghosts are brand new enemies. All of the new ghosts I've encountered are compelling and interesting, particularly the "Mother" Kami encountered in the sewers.\n-It's clear the English localization is not done by a native speaker. It can add to the atmosphere in some places, but in many of the documents and files the sentence structure becomes wonky if not outright unintelligible.\n-While there is an "unemployed person" (as the game calls it, but it's pretty obvious he's a janitor) that provides hints, that resource is pretty quickly run dry. Solutions to puzzles, or much more often just figuring out what triggers the next ghostly event, can seem completely esoteric.","March 24","true","14.6"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","30","37","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitesoma/recommended/418950/","whitesoma","Soma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitesoma/","1907 products in account","DreadOut is a title that takes heavy inspiration from Tecmo's Project Zero series (Fatal Frame in the USA), where the main character, usually a young woman, explore haunted locations and fight ghosts using a camera.\n\nKeepers of the Dark is a stand alone title that takes place during the middle of the main game, although it has little to no story in it. It features a hub-like main area from where you can access eight different locations with the purpose of hunting down a ghost in each of them (albeit each location usually has more than one). After doing so you'll be teleported back to the hub to repeat the process until you can open the final door (which will unlock at 8 ghosts defeated) and fight the last boss.\n\nAltough a bunch of them are new, most of these areas are taken straight from the main game or even the demo, though they feature some new elements related to the new ghosts.\nIn addition, some spirits won't appear immediately until you meet certain conditions, like collecting a number of items which may be located in different areas of the game, meaning that a bit of backtracking is required at times.\n\nCombat is exactly the same as the main game, a very simplified version of Project Zero. No limited films, no upgrading system, no special functions or anything of that kind. It's just your phone, which includes a flashlight, and an actual camera with zooming capabilities and a flash function for a short but powerful gleam of light (which will not actually damage enemies). Basically a weapon to fight in the dark and one to fight at long range.\n\nAnd like the main game, that's the general vibe of KotD: a low budget, unpolished and simplified version of Project Zero with some interesting ideas and moments. One of my favorites is in the school area, where you have to take a photo of a ghost possessing a specific statue among a large number of them. Doing so will force the spirit to run into another statue in a different part of the level, but this will also cause the previous statue to follow you around when it's out of the camera's view. You'll hear the sounds of the statue moving behind you, you'll turn around and see it in a different position, getting closer and closer to you. It's a nice and creepy idea, which actually made me smile instead of frighten me. But in a good way, if that make sense.\n\nIf you liked DreadOut, Keepers of the Dark is for you. It's light on story and even shorter, but it's more of the same setting and mechanics, and that might be enough. If you miss Project Zero, give the main game and KotD a try: just remember to keep your expectations in check.","March 27","true","5.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

Don't get me wrong, these games are full of intriguing ideas, fascinating ghost lore, and are spooky-as-all-♥♥♥♥.  But they're just not much FUN.  The boss fights, in particular, are at times maddeningly awkward, so what in Satan's good ♥♥♥♥ing name were these people thinking when they decided to make an entire side-game full of almost nothing BUT boss fights?  And that idiotic "Limbo" ♥♥♥♥ has gone NOWHERE, I might add...all of which means that you get to visit it even more often than you did in the first game.  GENIUS!\n\nI really do have to hand it to Digital Happiness for learning ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from the mistakes of their first game.  I'm still giving this a pretty decent rating, as you'll see below, but we're definitely moving backwards here, not forwards.  I was hoping this game would be an IMPROVEMENT over the original, but no such dice.\n\nI think I'm relieved to see the company's recent announcement, re taking a break from the DreadOut universe for the time being.  Perhaps they can go away, try some other styles of games, and in the process learn something about how great games are actually made.  Right now they're making really GOOD games...but the potential for greatness is definitely there.  They just have to start listening to the people who actually PLAY their product - and I don't just mean their back-slapping cronies - and make adjustments accordingly.\n\nSuffice it to say, if you found the "scissor ghost" in the first game even more aggravating than I did - no mean feat, let me tell you! - you should probably just stay well away.  Only recommended to masochists and/or folk so horror-obsessed that they just can't keep themselves away (like my idiot self).\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","April 11","true","4.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","16","22","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/418950/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark is the second installment of the DreadOut series and a standalone expansion to the original DreadOut. If you haven't played the original DreadOut before I recommend you go play that first since the story starts there. Don't worry, I also got a review for that one. For those of you who have played the original DreadOut, here's my review with pros and cons below if you're too lazy to read:\n\nFirst things first: the story. The story revolves around Linda, our protagonist, who, after the events of the original DreadOut, got transported into the spirit realm (or at least one part of it). We start our game in Limbo where we can see an astral showreel of what has been going on in the first game through pictures and audio. When we head to the bright light, we are greeted by a kind of hub world that features eight doors with eight different realms to go visit. Your ultimate goal is to do whatever it takes to get back to the real world and leave the spirit realm. And that's about it really, nothing else happens. Which is kind of a letdown for me.\n\nAnd what will you be doing for the most part? Right, you'll banish spirits just like in the original DreadOut. Gameplay wise the mechanics are all the same, nothing really changed. Except now you got the big camera and your phone right from the start. There's a bunch of interesting ghosts to banish and items to collect and even one or two puzzles here and there but that's about it. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed that it didn't hold anything too new and fresh and interesting. At least most of the spirits you will have to banish are new, each with different mechanics and strategies to defeat them. So that's a plus.\n\nBut are those spirits scary at all? Well, that's a difficult question to answer. You see, the original DreadOut had problems with holding its horror factor during its first chapter but experienced a very neat comeback in its second chapter with all-new spirits and spookyscariness. KOTD struggles to even conjure up any feeling of terror or horror right from the start and doesn't get too innovative later on either. In the original DreadOut I felt at least uneasy in some areas but in this game I just went up to the spirits, took a few hits maybe, and banished them. Yes, there were some jump scares but most of them were cheap, unlike in the original DreadOut where they were well-placed in my opinion. So the overall horror is severely lacking. In some areas I can sure see why people would get uneasy, given all the phobias some people have but it doesn't really go beyond that.\n\nAnd getting to banish some of those spirits is a pain in the butt. Seriously. Some of them are trial and error, some can kill you in one hit and you gotta start over from Limbo, some are just plain annoying with how much mobility they have in contrast to you so you can't hit them properly and it just takes ages. But again, at least the spirits were new and fresh and not recycled, I can respect that.\n\nSo, since the horror isn't any good, does the music at least get some atmosphere going? Well, it does. When it plays. Most of the time there's silence though. Thing is, when you trigger certain events the music and your surroundings change and the first time around, it made me feel uneasy for a bit so that was commendable indeed.\nOn another note: The menu music is REALLY good, where can I find that track? I want it.\n\nAside from all of that, the game has some eastereggs, some hidden references to other things in the genre (although I suppose the game itself is a huge reference to Fatal Frame) and a neat aesthetic.\nAlso, the devs have finally fixed the texture resolution which was horrible in the original DreadOut and they have fixed the ridiculous loading times. Huge plus right there.\n\nNow, let's get onto some real nitpickin'.\nThe camera movement. It just confuses me. Why, exactly, does my camera stutter every couple of centimeters when I'm in Limbo or the hub world? Annoys the hell outta me. The third place this happens in is the last level and the fight against the end boss. It made the fight unnessecarily difficult because as soon as I looked around my camera stuttered a couple meters sideways and I couldn't aim properly.\nAlso what they didn't fix are the Kuntilanak and the Sundel Bolong getting bugged out when you fight against them. Makes the fight really annoying as soon as you try to banish them since they just constantly port around the whole place.\nAnd some of the fights are just plain unfair, leaving you in Limbo way too often and it just steals your time.\n\nAt least the game got no crashes, steady framerate, nice graphics and boob physics. So they did something right. Also I kinda adore the Indoseian theme of it all. Which is why I give this game a thumbs up in the end.\n\n\nPros and Cons:\n\n+ neat aesthetic\n+ new spirits\n+ fixed graphics and loading times\n+ fantstic OST\n+ boob physics\n\n- heavy camera stuttering in some areas\n- bland presentation with a hub world instead of an interconnected set of places\n- unnessecarily difficult boss fights which are unfair at times\n- bland continuation of the story\n- horror = zero\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nAll in all I think it's commendable if you really liked the original DreadOut (like me) but I'd still say: get it when it's on sale, it's not worth full price. I'll give it a solid boob physics out of ten. Although I respect that the developers tried something new with the new spirits they put in the game but it still isn't enough to get me to praise it more than I did.","May 27","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/418950/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","While I reluctantly gave a thumbs down to the base version of DreadOut, citing too many gameplay problems and pacing issues, I must say, this one was pretty good. It's not a significant difference, but it works better for what it is.\n\nKOTD recycles several of the maps from the base game and shortens them down. Rather than exploring inch by inch, you're more on an easter egg hunt to find various components needed to pick fights with the local boss ghost. Some of these components are scattered behind other areas, so you'll do some backtracking. Compared to the first game, the bosses here aren't quite as tough. Granted, Linda (the protagonist) is still incredibly slow and couldn't dodge a slowly rolling wiffle ball, but the monsters really don't deal that much damage this time. This is a good thing, because respawning in can still leave you point blank with a boss, which can leave you taking free hits.\n\nWhat this game does well, is focus on the ghosts. They are interesting and at times downright nightmarish. The design quality on them is a bit mixed, but for the most part, they look good and the weak of heart will have darkened pants after a while.\n\nThe game is basically a boss rush. Regrettably, there's a lot less to see and fewer places to go, so if you liked the exploring and 'what is that and why the hell is there' moments of the first game, you won't really see that here. It's less linear this time in terms of allowing you to decide what areas to visit, but there's not quite as much to do. What honestly took me the most time was simply trying to figure out what to do, as the game explains generally little in any detail.\n\nThat said, if you haven't played the base game of DreadOut before, you're not really going to make any sense of what's going on in this one. Even for those who have played the old one, this game doesn't really explain a whole lot and the story is kind of weak, to be frank. Basically, you're going to play this for the sheer style and not so much the substance.\n\nThis is admittedly a mixed review, but it's not a bad game, so I am going to Recommend it. Although it could have been longer and there could have been more content; what it does, it does well. Now, let's break it down a little further here.\n\nPros:\nVery stylish: Bosses generally look pretty cool and some are definitely scary as heck. Really does a great job of selling the idea of indonesian mythology, a little taste of that culture, and the supernatural. If they really followed through on a more in depth game and polished it, DreadOut could be less a thing inspired by Fatal Frame and more an experience like an overseas Silent Hill. The design potential is there.\n\nGreat nightmare fuel: The Kami boss, the entire Ceramic Woman stage, the undead fetus swarm... in that one particular area when it finally dawns on you that they're there of all places. These are definitely memorable moments.\n\nChallenge: Feels just about right this time. At times inconsistent, but there's nothing quite as rage inducing at the Scissor Ghost encounter from the first one.\n\nFull Upgraded: You don't need to collect trinkets to get stronger this time and you have both cameras. Linda's hunt for items is about awakening the bosses and she's ready for action this time.\n\nCons:\nNot a lot of content: It's a boss rush, the maps are small, and there's almost no lesser wandering ghosts. Lesser ghosts don't get added to the Ghostpedia when beaten this time. Areas can feel very empty with little to do in them.\n\nInconsistent Art: While some ghosts are really well done, a few are quite muddled in appearance. The maps are okay, but on the PS1 side of quality. Most notably, the trucks in the game look like kid's toys and don't fit the world's design.\n\nNo costumes: Regular DreadOut had several. Linda just gets her basic outfit this time. Eh? This is kind of a minor quibble, but it's a shame still.\n\nHard to follow: The story isn't well explained in game. Regular DreadOut made a bit more sense... it's not really well defined what you're doing this time or why. It can basically be summed up as 'stuff happened, run around, game ends'. Additionally, triggering certain bosses can be esoteric and vague.","March 31","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The first DreadOut isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's a lo-fi game with lots of souls to it, and I truly enjoyed it, enough to 100%.\nSure enough, I wasted no time in getting KotD and... well, it doesn't measure up to a bar that was kinda low to begin with.\n\nKotD is pretty much just a Boss Rush type thing, with eight different areas, each with one or two bosses, and an item fetch puzzle or two to deal with; problem is, combat certainly wasn't the first game's strong suit, and pretty much all you'll get here is more combat. The boss designs are truly nice and show the creative capabilities of the devs, but that's about all the praise I can give. Pretty much all but one of them boil down to "back away while taking pictures" and even that isn't particularly fun, as bosses tend to have movesets wildly incompatible with your slow character and stunlock you with annoying frequency.\n\nAll but two of the stages are recycled from the base game (with small changes at times, yeah, but still the same areas), so even exploring is off the table. The game has some nice set pieces, but even then they're badly executed - having a ghost girl count down to chasing you is legitimately spooky at first... and not very much on the fourth or fifth time it happens. The story is pretty much nonexistent and/or vague to the point of meaning nothing at all. Seriously, if there was any useful plot to be gleaned, I have no idea what it is.\n\nTo sum, good bosses with bad combat, barely any new areas to see, annoying gimmicks and backtracking and just about no development of the story. Not AWFUL for the price, but it's something I wish I had watched on Youtube instead. I'll be waiting for a new game from these devs, though, as I still have faith in them.","April 4","false","5.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RAH-EGO/recommended/418950/","RAH-EGO","RAH-EGO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RAH-EGO/","57 products in account","DreadOut is the most fun I've had with a game in a long time. The creativity behind this series' scares is astounding. While many games implement the "Slender" approach to horror (i.e. “There's the monster! Don't look at it!”), DreadOut takes its cues from the Fatal Frame series. The player is forced to confront a plethora of frightening specters with nothing more than a phone camera for a weapon. The main character, Linda Melinda (actual name), finds herself trapped in a hallway lined with doors and guarded by an unsettling caretaker. Each door leads to a different realm full of unique spirits that must be banished. This is where the game shines. Forget the usual "objects flying across the room, loud noises, spooky jump-scares" horror tropes. DreadOut is a different animal. Some ghosts take the form of titan-sized monsters thundering out of the gloom. Others are disembodied heads slithering around a dark cistern on long hair. Others want to play games and perform for whatever unfortunate soul happens to find them. One even drags itself quickly after Linda in a maze of mannequins, stopping whenever the player turns to look at it. Jump-scares are discarded in favor of actual tension with creepy payoffs. It's GOOD, not to mention refreshing. But there are some negatives that need mentioned. Firstly, expect graphics that look like they came from the early Xbox 360 era. The team behind this game is small and based in Indonesia. They do what they can. Secondly, whoever translated this into English is in dire need of some lessons. (I assume future patches will improve the translation.) Thirdly, the game takes place near the end of Act 2 of the original DreadOut; so I strongly recommend playing that beforehand. Fourthly, the sound is a little buggy sometimes, but the effects themselves are very grotesque and eerie. Fifthly, and most disappointingly, there are very few puzzles in this game. The original DreadOut had some legitimately challenging puzzles to solve. This is mostly just a gallery of boss fights. On top of that, the levels are on the small side with limited room for exploration. The original game had lots of secret places to search, and it's sad to see that aspect missing here. Lastly, Linda is a silent protagonist and the secondary characters are on the shallow side. But there's something endearing about her. Despite never saying anything, Linda is oddly lovable. Maybe the player bonds with her through shared, traumatic experiences; or maybe having to watch her reactions to search for spirits forms a connection between character and player. For whatever reason, she's nearly iconic, and far more memorable than the usual horror protagonist. The same can be said about the game itself. DreadOut offers scares that are not easily forgotten. This is a must-have for any fan of the horror genre. The faint of heart need not apply.","April 1","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Good balance of exploration, "combat," and puzzles.\n- Great visuals for fans of dark, gloomy, Silent Hill-esque ambience\n- There is a surprising amount of content given the price of the game, especially if you're going to complete all the objectives for every room\n\nCons\n\n- Despite being expanded slightly in some parts, a lot of the maps are identical to their counterparts in the first game.\n- Some ghosts are so easy to banish it's more of a joke/chore, whereas others can be a little frustrating, especially having to 'resurect' after each death.\n- Only one new 'non-ghost' (?) character. The others from the first game don't return.\n- Although each room has it's own ghosts and respective stories, taken together, the game doesn't actually expand the story from the first all that much.\n\n\nOverall: Definitely reccommended for those who liked the first Dreadout game. I would also reccomend to fans of Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, and Asian-themed horror in general, although I would suggest trying the previous game first.","March 27","true","9.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

To put it in simple terms, the game puts you in a world where you have to banish various spirits which vary in overall challenge.  In general, they are not that hard, but they can be frustrating.   Some are tricky because they are invisible to the naked eye while others are visible, wbut will instant kill you the moment you get too close to them.    In terms of scaryness, it was mild.  Very cery creepy in that you feel so alone, yet you aren't truly alone, and so many creepy themes and what not.   The lack of weapons means you have to use your camera and phone carefully.   There are a few unavoidable jump scares, but the main two jump scares, are there mainly if you forget that you should use your camera to scope out an area..\n\n\nI hate jumpscare games, but admitly I palyed music in the background, and was fine.  Now that i know what to expect, Ill play through it again, but with volume up so I can enjoy the creepyness of the background ambience.   Overall, the game was enjoyable, length for the price was fair and the achievements are straight forward.  Once you get over the initial spook factor, it becomes less scary, but hey, at least it'll  get you the first time around.","March 27","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's very suitable for horror game lover.  But I'm expecting more that sexy Linda has more abilities like rolling or something to dodge with easily from monsters when they're attacking especially when facing final boss in each door, they keep hitting Linda, poor her :( maybe I can't control Linda with very well. Some bosses were very aggressive and berserk like Nine Tail for example, but more than that this game is very awesome to explored. I recommend this game for other horror lovers to try it, I'm pretty sure you'll like it especially if you finished Dreadout Act 1 & 2. Thank you once more for your impressive horror games, Digital Happiness Developers. Keep it up ;)\n\nMy general rating about this game:\n8/10\n\nPositive:\n+the dark atmosphere caught me well, good enough for horror gaming.\n+great new monsters / demons  to be fought and creepy enough.\n+awesome soundtrack when facing final bosses\n+the price is fair enough and worth playing\n\nNegative:\n- the ending was quite ambiguous. Hardly to tell it's good / bad ending that happened to the fate of Linda.\n- lack of method for Linda / playable character during battle mode against bosses / other demons. At least she could rolling to avoid their attacks. But since Linda didn't have limit for life span / transferred to Limbo infinitely every time she dies, it's fair enough. But still, make me frustrated looking at Linda for often getting punched.\n\nSorry if you think my grammar is bad, I'll try to improve more. Just hoping to understand my words, not a big deal.

Even after dying you come back standing right beside the boss not even able to move without getting knocked down then having to wait forever for the girl to stand back up just to be knocked back down again. I like the concept of the game and the design of your creatures, however it is to frustrating to enjoy the scare when all thats happening is you getting knocked down  and over powered at every second without even having a chance. Therefore i have given this game a bad review and probably will not continue to play it and will recommend people to stay scarce from it aswell. Please make this game more enjoyable to play then maybe ill give it another go. thanks alot for the crap game.","March 31","false","2.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Seems kinda weird.\n\nGameplay With Commentary:\nhttps://youtu.be/BBmRMLX07Oc\n\nBut, after playing a little more, the game has made my heart sink here and there. In one instance I had a little puppet girl following me and that scared me pretty good and am pretty happy with how it did. So the game seems like a puzzle game, you use a camera to kill some ghost and have to find ways to bypass the others. I think after the intro of the game is done and you play for a little it does get better.\n\nFor the price I would say it's an okay game. But still would not recommend the game to friends, unless they liked Fatal Frame.\n\nMy rating for this game is 6/10","March 24","false","1.0"," 13 of 87 people (15%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","15","13","87","6","0"

I love reading about the ghosts once you defeat them. Just something very new and exciting about playing this game. The atmosphere is really top notch, which is very important to me. It's frustrating getting knocked to the ground my bosses just to stand up and get knocked down again, but I can live with an annoying thing here and there. This "DLC" adds a good chunk of everything I loved from the full game. It's cool going back and forth through areas and finding clues and items to help solve stuff in other areas. It's less linear than the full game in that way.","April 25","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
