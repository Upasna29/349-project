So far, the game is a user-friendly point and click adventure, where you can only interact with objects in the proper sequence. The objectives are fairly straightforward. You can inspect various objects, but you can’t pick up anything that isn’t your current objective. The game has a few puzzles, but so far, nothing too complex. In between the point and click gameplay, there are choices in dialog selection, and other things that require you to react.\n\nThe story starts after a near-human extinction event, with what’s left of humanity trying to wake the survivors and rebuild. You don’t really know what exactly happened, but the mystery very intriguing.  When the episode ends, you probably won’t want to stop playing.\n\nFor the most part, your decisions in episode 1 seem to have the same or very similar outcome, but there was one set of actions that I did on my 3rd playthrough that resulted in a slightly different ending. It’s hard to say right now how much of an impact this will have on the later episodes, but for now, at least the game is showing potential that your decisions may have some weight to them. I still don't know why more save slots haven't been added though; I would like to play episode 2 again to try out different decisions, but I'm afraid it will make me start over.\n\nPros:nice graphics style, that is very similar to many of Telltale's games\nreally good narrative, and the sound effects and voice acting were done well\nplaying in the past timeline as well as the present timeline is a great way to understand the backstory (it's a nice change from just finding objects or notes for information)\nreally intriguing story, that will leave you wanting more\nCons:the controls cannot be changed and there is no controller support\na couple minor graphical issues: in some scenes the view seemed to jump/flicker to a different view, and there was also a door that after you blow it off the hinges, the door comes off as a different shape than where it came from\nthere was sometimes a delay after interacting with objects before you could click on the back button and start moving again UPDATED: Seems like this has been fixed.\ncharacters sometimes walk in small circles when attempting to interact with some objects\ngame forces you to replay episode 1 before starting episode 2 (even though I already completed episode 1 three times)\nSTILL only 1 save slot, so it makes it a lot harder to replay to test out different choices\nBoth Episode 1 and Episode 2 each take 30-60 minutes to complete, depending on the player, and what decisions are made. You can replay the game to try making other decisions, but you can’t skip any of the cut scenes, so it is repetitive. Also, there was one part in episode 2 that I didn't agree with, and I would have liked to have had a choice to let me choose otherwise, but it doesn't change my review.\n\nI don’t know exactly how long the next three episodes will be, but if they last about the same as the first episode, I can see waiting for a slight sale even though it’s priced similarly to some other Telltale adventure games. I am looking forward to finding out what happened, I hope the following episodes don’t take too long to release. You might want to wait for all the episodes to release because you will most likely be left wanting more story immediately.","March 24","true","4.5"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","49","61","4","0"

Here's why:\n\nI love Fallout and Telltale, and this game is basically a Telltale style Fallout game, and I love it.\nNow, that is not the best comparison. But it is a decent one, that is somewhat accurate. The game has some similar aspects to Fallout and is a game almost exactly the same in style as Telltale, even down to the graphics style.\n\nThe story and the lore is amazing. My only problem with this game, and the only thing that broke my immersion was the voice acting. There were a few moments where voice acting broke my immersion, since it wasn't too great. But that is my only problem with this game.\n\nWithout giving spoilers, the story is amazing. I was hooked, and didn't want to turnthe game off (even though I had too, but I'm so excited to finish the story).\n\nI only bought Episode 1 since I was a skeptic with this game, even though I was excited for it. But I know I'll definitly be buying the upgrade pack.\n\nEDIT: Just saw that they put part of my review in the teaser trailer for Ep. 2. That's awesome, I love to see that some devs actually look at the reviews. So hyped for Episode 2, only 27 days to go!","March 24","true","1.2"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

Sounds unfair to put it that way but the resemblance is undeniable and honestly I don't think they have tried to hide it having "X will remember that" situations. The game looks great, it really does but for some reason it's locked at 30 fps. I completed this first episode in about an hour, taking my time and exploring most places. It's not much but if you consider there's 4 more episodes it's quite alright. My main critique is the puzzles. They are time consuming puzzles more than anything like fun or interesting. The story is still unclear. I like how mysterious it becomes. I thought it was all about the end of the world happening but I was pleasantly surprised to see there's two sides of the story, maybe coming together the more we approach the end.\n\nHere's the full first episode on a let's play (spoilers):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEpWg6uXw4c","March 24","true","1.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonoridge/recommended/351940/","jonoridge","Jonoridge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonoridge/","242 products in account","Episode 1 ReviewA lot of people are reviewing episode 1 and mentioning Fallout and TellTale games and I think that is a fair assessment. I, personally get strong vibes of Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also reminds me of Zero Escape, a puzzle visual novel on 3DS and Vita. Anyways, on to the review.\n\nLength\nEpisode 1 is relatively short and introductory, it took me 50-55 minutes to complete, I felt I was relatively observant, I looked around each room, examined everything I thought I could before progressing so expect about that playtime for you, give or take 10 minutes.\n\nIntro\nYou play as two characters, one from the past who is tasked with making sure that the survivors who were cryogenically frozen are all okay. These people are called janitors, they themselves get frozen as well and only wake up if there are issues. The other character you play is in the present, their job is to wake up all these sleeping survivors who for reasons unbeknownst to them, haven't woken up yet despite the surface being safe to live in again.\n\nControls & Gameplay\nThe controls are super easy, you click on where you want to move to and what you want to interact with. The only keyboard control I remember inputting was the 'E' button for certain basic QTE's. There are some relative basic puzzles featured but nothing that will have you scratching your head or maybe I've just been playing The Witness too much! Also at certain points you can choose what your character has to say, I'm not entirely sure how much influence these have on your playthrough yet but you see the typical "character x will remember that" text during certain decisions so I'm assuming we'll see the outcomes as we progress into later episodes. If you enjoy the gameplay approach of the TellTale games and Life is Strange then you'll also enjoy the game very much.\n\nStory\nThe story for me is where it shines, alongside the atmosphere. Even though it's very much an introduction, there are very subtle hints as to what is going on. For the first episode, it does all the right things, presents you with loads of questions as to what is going wrong and leaves you wanting for more. It's hard for me to talk too much about story without giving spoilers, especially as the first episode is relatively short, so I'll just say if you're familiar with and enjoyed the premise of  2001: A Space Odyssey, Fallout or Zero Escape then the story of this game will interest you.\n\nConstructive Criticism\nIf I were to criticise it for anything, I guess it would be the length of the first episode. It is a tad short, I'm hoping future episodes will be a bit longer. I think there were a few minor camera angle issues as well, but nothing that negatively affected the experience.\n\nVerdict\nAll in all, I'd recommend giving the game a try at the current price. It's hard to say how much your decisions influence the game at this point, but if the 'premise' at least has you interested. I find it very hard to believe after playing episode 1 you won't want to, no, need to play more. I hope these episodes arrive rather quickly!\n","March 27","true","0.9"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

If you like Telltale style of gameplay, you will most likely enjoy this. The graphics are just OK and the animation is not going to win any awards. However, the voice acting and music on the other hand are top quality.\n\nThe opening of the story is most likely nothing new to many and the overall setting will definitely feel familiar. But if you're like me, the post apocalyptic setting just never gets old (I thoroughly enjoy experiencing one developers vision over another). I do appreciate the way the game tells it's story, which I don't want to spoil for those planning on giving the game a whirl.\n\nThe Descendants reflects HEAVY inspiration from the Fallout series and the movie Air (starring Norman Reedus), which is totally not a bad thing for us post apocalyptic junkies.\n\nOf course, the game is episodic, so there's no way to truly tell exactly where this is headed. All I can say is that so far I am absolutely hooked and bought the rest of the episodes immediately after finishing the first one.\n\nThe puzzles won't require much thinking as it's really just a matter of finding item "x" or very easily determining a simplistic order of operations. But trust me, you're not playing this for the puzzles or the gameplay. You're playing this for the expertly presented drama and the "Oh ♥♥♥♥!" moments set in a great looking science fiction environment.\n\nOverall, there's not a whole lot here, but what is here is absolutely worth the asking price. $2.99 for 1 hour seems fair to me.\n\nI'll update this review as I play each episode. I truly hope the game can keep this  level of tension and intrigue in it's story, but only time will tell.\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nI almost didn't play it. Apparently, the devs screwed something up with the save files and the game doesn't recognize that you've beaten the first episode and tries to tell you that you have to beat episode one first...even though you already did. Luckily I found a quick copy, paste, rename file fix from the steam forums.\n\nOnce I got passed that, episode 2 was just as impressive as the first episode. At this point, I would recommend that you wait until all episodes are released before purchasing any of this game for 2 reasons:\n\n1) Episode 1 ended with a teaser trailer for episode 2. However, episode 2's cliffhanger did not end with a trailer for 2. Instead, I got credits. ♥♥♥♥ing credits. I hope this isn't the end! I'm gonna be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if I payed for all episodes and only get 2.\n\n2) The BS workaround to get my save to work was unacceptable. I bought all of the episodes in advance and they should work as continued progress upon download.\n\nI do recommend the game, but wait until all of the episodes are confirmed. So put it on your wishlist.","April 10","true","2.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This game honestly had me positively surprised. I went in with very low expectations, thinking it'd be a pretty boring game, but really, this was pretty entertaining! This game has a really captivating storyline that takes place in a very interesting - almost mysterious - environment which leaves you asking more questions than you can get the answer to (the cliffhangers!). I really love how the player's choice of different interactions paves the way for variety in the gameplay, adds a whole new dynamic and not just a dull gameplay where you sit and wait for something to happen. During certain missions you also have to solve puzzles which I think is a nice addition. You have to have an eye for details.\n\nApart from the relatively short first episode I wouldn't say I have a lot to complain about. Although it wouldn't hurt with a bit more to do considering the environment which is very rich with details. The developers should take that into account and probably let the player interact more with what is around them, but at the same time I can understand that it'd be annoying to press everything only to find out it doesn't provide something useful to the progression of the game.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this first episode a 7,5 / 10 in ratings. Definitely worth playing. After all though, thi is in fact the first point & click game I've played so I don't really have anything to compare it with, but I can say this won't be the last one for me.

That is my biggest concern this far. Humanity has destroyed earth ending it by nuking the whole surface. Luckily the governments built the “arks”. They held 4.000 of the most important people underground and made sure that there would be a tomorrow for mankind. You get to play the story throughout two separate timelines. First you play as Mia, a janitor, tasked with maintaining Ark 01. And you also play as Glen, two hundred years later. And Glen tries to find out why Ark 01 never opened when the other arks did.\n\nIts an intriguing story set in a wonderful apocalypse environment. The graphics isn’t amazing but I believe its better than both The walking dead and Life is strange. Gameplay is point and click puzzles mixed with a lot of dialog and dialog options just like expected. For me the puzzles was somewhat too easy but that could be just me. Something that I really like though was that in the end of the episode every failure I made in the puzzles during my gameplay resulted in one dead member of Ark 01.

Reminds me of a Fallout themed Telltale game.\n+ Graphics and sounds are okay.\n+ Flashbacks.\n+ Few easy problem solving scenarios.\n\n- Voice acting is mediocre and some characters sound a bit lazy.\n- Moving around happens with your mouse. I wish you could move your character with arrow keys/WASD instead.\n- The camera angle feels clumsy. Sometimes it takes more time to progress in game just because you didn't find something that was hidden behind something you only find if you know exactly where to click.\n- The characters don't have nearly any face impressions. They blink and might smile but I wish they'd look more "alive".\n- One minor bug: In the first playable scene the character's teeth move out of his mouth when he walks around.\n\nThe first episode wasn't too bad but it was too short (1 h) and too easy. The characters need more depth to them. Will all these things in mind, I'd buy this game if you're a fan of this genre or if the game's on sale.","April 23","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I hope that the next episodes will be much more refined as this game feels like it's only half done.\nThe characters are painfully slow and unremarkable. There are only so many items and I mostly regretted taking a look at them. Why isn't there a cutscene with the guitar? Why saying the exact same thing about the dressers _after_ you used them? The puzzles are the easiest I've ever seen and The Descendant don't even have that illusion that Telltale games do, about you shaping your own in-game future. There are only about 3 events where you can shape anything, but.. well, let's just say, unfortunately this has been a huge disappointment so far.","March 31","false","1.0"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

Instead of focusing on interesting characters, their personal relations and choices, we get cardboard cutout protagonists who don't have enough of a personality to even be called stereotypes.\n\nIt's the post-apocalypse again. And as established by post-apocalyptic rules, there's also a cryogenic vault. We get to follow two separate ventures into said vault; One maintenance crew shortly after and during the ICBM's hitting their targets, and one search & rescue crew hundreds of years later, wading through the derelict bunker.\n\nI'm going to call these people the janitor woman of the past and the bicentennial rescue man, because that is pretty much the whole extent of what we get to know about these people during the first episode. Both of them are accompanied by an authoritarian sidekick figure who they can choose to either snub or obey in the game's few dialogue choices. Otherwise, the reason for their existence seems to be to feed us stuff to do.\n\nUnfortunately, the stuff they're providing is very, very formulaic. Turn a valve. Flip a switch. Connect some wires -- Yes, I realize a janitor's regular day probably isn't that flashy in real life either, but come on! There's not an ounce of creativity at display here. The only thing missing is a hidden object scene.\n\nI could maybe overlook the mundane puzzles if the gameplay was closer to Telltale's standards, but sadly that isn't the case. The camera angles have a tendency to mess up navigation since the viewpoint is usually switched when the character is already way too close to the screen border. However, a much bigger problem is the game's insistence on administering the clickable hotspots with a pipette.\n\nEven if you can deduce a solution in advance, you usually have to try and fail or simply do the wrong thing first for the correct item to gain clickability. Did I mention that you also have to be reasonably close to a thing for it to show its icon in the first place? Well, you do.\n\nI don't know. I'm all for new contenders entering the episodic adventure game space, but this here is not cutting it at all. With last years' Life is Strange, the bar originally set by Telltale has been raised; You cannot lower the standard well below the median and expect people to get hooked. During the final minutes of the first episode there's some very minor story intrigue, but nothing that'd compel me to buy the rest of the season. Nice facial animations, though.","March 24","false","0.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","23","43","0","0"

I dont like Point&Clicks so here's my 2 cents:\n\nPros:\n+ price tag (2,5€ for EP1)\n+ Scifi (Im huge sucker for any Scifi/Cyberpunk)\n+ Rather nice 3D graphics\n\nCons:\n- Characters, this game lacks of em. Intresting characters, characters with some personality, you don't find em here. I've had more fun reading the sides of milk carton than listening these characters.\n- Characters only have one line for every item you click. It get's boring really fast specially when stuck in some puzzle. In DreamFall Chapers there's 3-4 lines for everything you click.\n- Story seems to be dual'ish about time before and what is now. You play chatecter in past and present. I'ts really cliche. But it's just a EP1 so maybe it will go different direction. I only played less than 2hr so take this with grain and salt.\n\nIm gonna recomend this game, it might not be exactly for me but for this price if you like scifi, story driven, point&click  give it a shot!","May 20","true","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But they are not trying to make you believe this either. It is a casual Point & Click game. The environment is set in a dystopian future, that makes you think of "Fallout" at first, but after playing for a while you notice that this is perhaps the only similarity to this game. The story can probably best be described as: solve the mystery.\nThe Descendant also contains some simple puzzle elements, you will not be frustrated and forget the rest (a.k.a losing focus). The sound and the atmosphere is good and contributes to the feeling of a conspiracy (being watched). A haunted house or shelter. The music is helping the game to preserve the momentum.\n\nUpdate: Regarding opinions about the length of the episode. You can easily play it on a work/school day or replay it when a new episode is released. The price is right (people spend more money on skins in various games). Maybe they could add some more details to explore?\n\nIf you like 90's point and click games (Gabriel Knight, Blade Runner and Sanitarium) then maybe this is the game for you.

It seemed to be the best way to bring the point-and-click adventure genre to modern gaming. It allowed the developers to tell an emotional story that still gave the player a feeling of agency. It’s surprising how rarely that formula has been copied, with Life is Strange being the closest comparison.\n\nThe Descendant is now the closest thing to a straight copy-paste of the formula Telltale has mastered, but it’s boring characters, boring plot, boring… everything make it a chore to get through it’s first episode.\n\nThe premise is simple enough. Global Warming caused wars between the world’s superpowers, ending in nuclear war. Sanctuaries known as Arks were built to house some of the world’s elite in cryosleep until… well that’s unclear. These Arks are maintained by engineers known as Janitors, who are automatically awoken at key times to work on things like water heaters.\n\nThe Descendant’s first episode is split between three time periods, following two characters. In the past, Mia is the “new guy” on Ark-01, who works alongside one of the most poorly voice-acted characters I’ve ever come across. There’s a weird moment where it feels like the game is interested in building some level of distrust between the characters. “Who are you?” asks Mia’s partner, “You’re not the guy I expected.” Oddly, this tension between the characters is never suggested again.\n\nIn the future (“Centuries later...”), you’ll take control of Donnie, a one-time Janitor who is now partnered with a cranky, old Senator, tasked with investigating what happened at Ark-01. The Descendant jumps around periodically between Donnie and Mia, unravelling more of the mystery as the game goes on.\n\nThe basic premise of learning what occurred on Ark-01 is admittedly intriguing. Even though we’ve seen this idea done to death (waking up years after the Apocalypse), The Descendant’s idea of turning it into a mystery is something that I haven’t seen done a million times. It’s unfortunate that the game is so bad at communicating exactly what the mystery is. Upon Donnie’s arrival, we don’t know anything that’s happened at Ark-01, so immediately, tension drops. Donnie makes a suggestion that the senator should stay behind (and you’re given 4 options of reasons why he should stay behind) because presumably there’s danger afoot. It’s unclear why Donnie feels this way. Is the world inhabited by mutants now? Was there signs of distress? Couldn’t the Ark have simply had a mechanical failure and everyone died in cryosleep?\n\nThere’s no reason to feel tension other than the fact that the developers lay on the thriller movie music. Even in the moments that feel like they should be tense, they aren’t because the controls don’t allow you to move your characters quickly. With the exception of one scene, the characters crawl along at an alarmingly slow pace considering meltdown seems to be occurring. Then these moments feature puzzles that require you to find a thing to make another thing work, so that you can get another thing to work. There’s no urgency and thus no tension. Then the episode - which took me all of 40 minutes to complete - ends with what I can only assume was intended to be an intense cliffhanger, but because I’d been so bored until that point, I couldn’t find it in me to care at all.\n\nEverything about The Descendant’s first episode feels like a really boring SyFy original series, while Telltale’s games, while not perfect, tend to feel more like an AMC or HBO production in comparison. The Descendant’s low budget shows at every seam. The voice acting is bad to terrible, the writing is unsure of itself and never knows where to go, and the gamiest aspects are okay at best. The puzzles are simplistic, and the camera lingers in places that force your character to constantly walk into walls or get stuck in awkward positions.\n\nThe Descendant's first episode is a mess from beginning to end. It's near-interesting plot is brought down by bad execution (bad voice acting, bad pacing, bad animation). Thankfully it's only a briefly painful experience at 40 minutes.\n\n1.5/5","March 24","false","0.8"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

But if the story telling won´t work good it´s sadly just a cool 3D place...\n\nSorry for my awful English.","May 25","false","0.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","1"

I really wanted to love this game for so many reasons. Please read full review (ESPECIALLY the end).\n\nThe good:\n\n+ Cool artstyle. Super nice looking game.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- The game is 60 minutes long for 3 dollars. Horrible gameplay/price ratio!\n\n- The graphics is flickering (lagging). Looks like it is due to memory leakage. UNACCEPTABLE. I am usually not sensitive to minor lag, but my 2 000 $ computer was showing signs of graphics lags.\n\n- The choices do not matter at all in this episode. Outcome will be the EXACT same, even inside of the episode. The only thing which will be slightly different is how the character replies to the exact sentence you chose.\n\n- There are ~6 choices in this game (dialogue choices only, which does not change outcome at all), whereas Life is Strange had ~180 choices in the first episode. The choices are really boring as well.\n\n- The game is REALLY slow paced. The 60 minutes of gameplay gets you NO WHERE.\n\n- The "puzzles" in the game are a super poor version of Grim Fandango. I would recommend anyone interested in this game purchasing Grim Fandango instead, as it is more or less the same game in another universe, but with way more and better gameplay.\n\n- No gamepad support.\n\n\nHowever, the most important piece of fact is most likely this:\n\nThis game was funded by investors, who purchased stocks in Gaming Corps. I was one of these investors. We did not get to see this game until two days ago. Upon playing the game, most investors were horrified and sold the shares, resulting in -30% stock value. However, a bunch of investors still want this game to sell; therefore, many positive reviews will be the result of biased reviewers. Moreover, critical reviews will most likely get downvoted.\n\nSo be careful when buying this game. If you are into Grim Fandango and have the money to spend, maybe this is for you. But please read all positive reviews with critical eyes.","March 24","false","1.2"," 18 of 45 people (40%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","40","18","45","6","0"
