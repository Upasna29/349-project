This game looks really nice. And its an awesome Idea with a dark planet where you need the light to see something.\n\nMeanwhile it work online and does have a solid multiplayer. By the way all 4 factions do have different gameplay.\nIts the first RTS where you do have a real mobile base and Transformers.\nThe human faction can move buildings everywhere and the YX are Transformers, you buy as YX mobile units, you can combine them to make a battle unit or a building out of them. if you want something else just let them separate and combine to something else.\nThe new Faction Noxx do have really interesting game play with mobile base too.\nAnd each unit can be upgraded in stronger ones.\n\n\nThis game does have a really good AI, the human faction AI can be a challenge.\n\nIts just feels like a true RTS again, with have Base build , research and lot of different units with some unique ideas.","June 6, 2015","true","18.7"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","44","59","4","0"

For the price i think it's a good "little" RTS.\n\n(edited, will edit more after more playtime)\n\nI like the 3 factions, they are similar in units but still play slightly different.\n\n- XY build small useless cells that can combined together to form bigger structures and units, and once done, can uncombined to be cells again and adapt if needed. The structures are fixed on the ground, can't move.\n- Nova is movable and build its structures on movable plateforms. Each factories produce their own units.\n- Human build everything from the main center, other structures being only upgrades to build more stuff from the center.\n\nMaps are small and only 4 of them are currently available, in 1vs1.\nIA is not very solid, and gets easily punished because of limited amount of ressources on the map.\n\nOverall so far, i wouldn't say it's "great" but it's surely enjoyable. Also, the developpers seem to be very open on the forum.","April 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","0"

It's good to see indie developers create such a good quality rts game, which is hard to find these days. I couldn't believe that there are only two people that made this game, they have done an amazing job... They're incredibly supportive of their game,\nthey take the time to read feedback and the discussions in the community hub. Most importantly they actually listen to what players have to say and they respond! The developers are incredibly active with the community and with updates for the game, which is always good to see. The game has an amazing price tag for the content, and the developers have also stated they will be releasing more content even after release!\n\nI love the art style and theme of this game. They did such a great job on creating a sci-fi atmosphere, full of sound effects, incredible graphics (the lighting in this game is amazing), animations, and such a cool art style. The whole darkness aspect of the game is what really got me hooked, the way the units light up the darkness as you explore to find you're enemy or more resources. It looks so awsome seeing the lights from you're units, base, and animations\nlighting the dark areas of the map. The scouting abilities make it even more amazing. The scouts have really neat and unique abilities that are incredibly satisfying to use... I don't know how many times i've just  sat there watching the skill light up the darkness. There are three races\nin the game, each with their own unique scout. The Nova race is my favorite scout by far. It sends out these little probes that light up a circle around them, Creating three giant circles that move around and collide into each other.  It gives you a far superior vision over the map. It's fun to use, and so cool to watch. The other scouts also have really cool abilities, i don't want to give away too much, so some of it's still a surprise to people.\n\nThe combat is really fun, it can get intense looking around in the dark, suddenly colliding into the enemy... or fighting over resources trying to find some new ice to collect to build and upgrade. I love that you don't have to constantly be spamming keys and units, it's more about the\nstrategy and tactics.\n\nEach race is very unique and fun to play and to learn. The look and feel for the them is great, they feel very different from one another and have their own personality. There's a great amount of units that are unique, ranging from ground units, to air units, transports and repair. There is also a good amount of cool and unique abilities across the three races. The U.I fits in great with the art style of the game... It's nice to look at, sleek, and it's not confusing or obstructive. Overall im really glad that i bought this game, and i definitely recommend this game to people looking for a good new rts, or a\ngood game in general. I would even recommend it to people who are new to the rts genre, it's\na great place to start. This game has been a great experience, and will\nprovide great entertainment for a very long time.","August 7, 2015","true","22.9"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","33","46","0","0"

It's relatively intuitive despite some minor control interface things taht you can quickly get used to. There's no in-mission save either, which would really help with a lot of the problem's I've seen so far. There's no unit cap, so you can go back to the days of "SWARM ALL THE THINGS" of the hayday of RTS.\n\nHowever there is one SEVERLY CRIPPLING FLAW:\n\nEvery now and then, the UI just desides to go "HERP DERP DERP I'M A ♥♥♥♥♥" and completely rob you of your ability to interact with anything. For instance, you'll select a structure and then tell it to go and deploy at a certain location. Only it doesn't. And the deploy interface won't go away. SO you try and select another unit, and it lets you. But the deploy interface is still there, so you can't actually tell it to do anything. And it gets more and more convoluted, and then you lose because you can't deploy units, or build new ones, or place defensive structures, or select your "DON'T LET THESE DIE" units get obliterated.","August 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","33","52","6","4"

Unit selection can be tedious. The interface is generally inefficient and unpolished. Some units cannot shoot air units at all, which is just annoying really. There is only one resource in the game. The tech tree is extremely simplistic and pointless. Environment designs contain repetitive terrain and non-obvious impassible objects.

Simple mechanics, easy to use UI, simple resource gathering to allow for the main focus of building armies and wiping out your opponent. This game clearly pays homage to Command and Conquer and Starcraft with it's faster paced gameplay and overall RTS mechanics and that faithfulness to RTS's of yore pays off with a fun and addicting strategy game. With 3 different factions that all function in varying ways and have different strengths and weaknesses, there are plenty of strategies for victory.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riVHPRk41Yk\nThe most unique piece of the game other than the very 'alienesque' worlds and units is the pervasive darkness that blankets every game. It feels like you're playing on that planet from the movie Pitch Black and the only way you can see the map is to move units there. The game also features a very indepth story line that makes extraordinary use of camera angles to provide a low-budget, cinematic experience.

It's dark levels feel foreboding, strange, and unwelcoming. It's factions, all diverse, with unique unit designs. Each faction seems to have it's own special unit with it's own special ability, and they all play very differently. Nightside's Hard Campaign is just as intimidating as it's level design, everything is dark and lit up by units with flashlights. You can reveal terrain on the map, but although you can reveal enemy bases once the fog of war kicks back in you'll only have an idea of where your adversaries are.\n\nThe Campaign separates itself between several chapters, and each one of them very challenging. My favorite part is the Nova Campaign, where you're put under certain restraints that make the game just hard enough. The Nova campaign isn't forgiving, as they seem to have the lightest/weakest units but have powerful abilities and cheap units. I really like the soundtrack for the Nova's levels, they fit well and add to the game's overall atmosphere.\n\nNightside has one resource, but it's complexity comes from the dark level design, and each faction's way of grabbing technology and advanced units. Nightside has a lot of charm underneath it's dark aesthetic, the units and buildings themselves bright up the areas around them, an interesting way of creating 'fog of war'. The game itself looks very fun and I've played one MP game, and even though I lost I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nA solid RTS game, that has a challenging Campaign, very fun units, and diverse factions, all with a dark atmosphere, great soundtrack, and an intimidating shroud of darkness.","September 15, 2015","true","13.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

The smallest ground units are really fun for harassment of enemy extractors, and are almost invisible.\n\nThree air units, the smallest one only attacks air. The biggest unit for this race is a Flagship, which of course, flies.\n\nThere is a special drone which can disable weapons in the opponent's army and also attacks ground.\n\nThe big defense for the mothership is a drone release similar to SC2 carriers.\n\nThere is a special ability for the probes which releases three small "flashlight" drones, which move in sync with the probe. It has enough range that parking the probes near your enemy and using the drones is effective.\n\nYX:\nThis is a sort of "Transformer" race, with the most flexibility (everything is built out of the same building blocks "Cells", which are mobile). A not entirely bad option with this race is to build one probe and a ton of cells and then tailor your army once you know what you are facing.\n\nBuildings are not mobile, once built, but can be split back into cells.\n\nI think you have to build ground tech before air, but you have the option of scrapping the building, so it's not as big of a deal as with Nova if you want to go all air.\nThere is a special ability for one of the midsized units which bumps up how hard adjacent units hit.\n\nThe mothership defense is a shockwave with decent area.\n\nThe light option for the probes is a scanning ability, which basically gives a really big circle of vision around the probe.\n\nThe big unit for this race is a ground unit, so a little easier to counter than the Nova and Human flagships.\n\nThe upgrades for YX have more levels than for the other races, not sure if that means they can ultimately hit harder.\n\nHuman:\nAll of the human buildings are mobile, so you can have fun with moving your base around, and the "static" defenders are easier to get into position. The units are more limited for this race in terms of what they can attack (you have all the permutations of "air" or "ground" units that can only attack air or ground, it is sometimes hard to remember), so you need to be careful with what you attack with what. There is a special ability for the second largest air unit which creates a vortex which attracts enemy fire.\nThe mothership defense is a missile attack, and the probe special ability is the best one in my opinion, which are a series of torches that you can drop and leave. Torches can be destroyed by the enemy, however.\n\nThe flagship is a big air unit, which is probably the best unit in the game for killing the opponent's mothership because of the missile attack.\n\nOverall note: with all races, the mothership defense and the flagship special ability are one and the same. All of the races have a unit which repairs others, something which always bothered me about starcraft (they have advanced technology and it Never Breaks? Really?).\n\nMouse actions:\nIn general, left click selects units, middle click pans, right click places/initiates actions. To attack move, use left alt plus right click. To select all units of a given type, use Shift plus left click.","August 3, 2015","true","199.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I also want to mention I haven't even tried Story or Multiplayer modes yet, partly because I'm waiting for the whole Campaign to be in the game and partly because I usually just play RTS games to compete against the AI. However, I do look forward to taking advantage of all the modes the game has and will have (Co-Op vs AI has yet to be added).\n\nI'm happy I got this game for a few main reasons and lots of smaller reasons. The main reasons are:\n\n- The game is balanced.\n\n- The game looks great.\n\n- Combat and base building is fun and unique for each of the three races.\n\nThe other reasons I like this game are the following:\n\n- The theme behind the game is interesting.\n\n- Resource gathering doesn't feel like a chore, leaving more focus on combat and base building.\n\n- The music and sounds for the game help immerse you into it's theme.\n\n- The game isn't difficult to learn, and still has a good level of complexity.\n\n\nIf you want more information on the types of things you can do in the game before buying it, read below:\n\n- There are three races; Nova, YX, and Human.\n\n- Types of units/buildings for each race include ground units, air units, production buildings, one defensive building, a resource gathering building and research buildings.\n\n- Most units can only attack ground or air, few can attack both, however the defensive building for each race can attack/defend against air and ground.\n\n- There are what feels like three tiers of units/buildings you can build or produce, as well as one really strong unit with a special ability for each race.\n\n- The really strong unit for NOVA is an aircraft/air unit. It can only attack air until you active it's ability to "Launch attack drones" and it then acts similar to a Carrier from Starcraft. While the drones it launches can attack ground (not sure if they can attack air, haven't tested that yet although the aircraft itself can), they only last for a short duration (about 15 seconds or so) and the ability has a cool down that lasts equally as long.\n\n- The strongest unit for the Human race is also an aircraft/air unit. It too can only attack air and has an ability with a somewhat shorter cooldown that the one from the NOVA race, however it's ability is to "Launch missiles" which do severe damage to random(?) nearby targets, including ground units.\n\n- The strongest unit for the YX race is a large ground unit that can only attack ground. It has a shockwave ability which goes out from the unit and does heavy damage to anything in range of it, which is a rather large area. I'm not sure if the shockwave ability can damage air units however the YX race seems to have the most amount of units which can attack both ground and air.\n\n\nInformation reguarding the unique building style of each race:\n\n- Each race starts with it's main building. If it is destroyed you lose the match. Likewise, if you destroy the enemy's main building, you win the match. There is no way to build another.\n\n- The NOVA race has a hovering/mobile "Mothership" as it's main building. This is where the other buildings (and scouts) come from, inculding the resource collecting buildings. Once produced, your buildings are initially airborne/hovering and you select them, click on the "Land" button and then select where it will be placed and you will then be able to utilize that building.\n\n- The YX race has a hovering/mobile "Hive Mind" as it's main building. This building produces "cells", very small circular slow moving units, which individually are cheap and are how you build all your other units and buildings with this race. All units and buildings you can build require a certain number of cells.\n\n- The Human race has a hovering/mobile "Fortress" as it's main building. The Fortress can produce the resource gathering structures and platforms (as well as an air scout and it's strongest unit). The platform is what you construct all your buildings on in the form of "addons" including your unit producing building (there is only one for this race aside from the Fortress), all research buildings and your defensive building for this race.\n\n- The resource collecting structures for each race look different but all act the same. They all hover and can be told to move over any resource spot on the map to begin collecting resources from it.\n\n\n\nThis information is about the core of the game. Again, I have not played Multiplayer mode or Story mode but I'm 100% positive they are just as fun as the Versus AI mode. To conclude my review, I want to say if you like RTS games in general, you will be nothing but satisfied with this game. It's definitely on a smaller scale than others like Starcraft or Supreme Commander, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying it just as much if not more as I would any other RTS.\n\nFinally, if you are on the fence about trying this game like I once was, just get it. You will not regret it!\n\nGood luck and have fun!","June 18, 2015","true","18.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

I am rather disappointed in the way RTS's seem to be heading as of late with regards to large skirmish battles (or lack thereof)...back in my day we had some really great eight player skirmish battles in "Warcraft II".  Had this game been priced the same as "Grey Goo", I'd probably give it a "no-recommend".  Luckily, the Early Access price is only ten bucks, which isn't bad when you compare it and its features to the aforementioned game that goes for fifty.  I'm not sure how I feel about "the night" replacing your typical fog-of-war...I kind of miss the shroud and being able to see territories that I've already discovered.  As it stands, this game is fairly enjoyable though I wouldn't mind seeing some larger maps and more AI opponents on the field at once.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcgfxo9nlxg","April 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

It's a nice enough looking game, but it lacks a good feel to it. Most units are fairly similar, varying only in terms of health, and whether or not they can attack air/ground units. The economy needs to be modified, I think, so that there's at least some sort of throttle that might lead to a sense that the early game differs significantly from the late game. There's probably room for improvement along these lines, but I'm just not captivated enough to wait for it to change, or to come back if it does.","August 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I stumbled upon this game doing a mindless search through said garbage to hopefully find something of quality for a decent investment price. That was this game. The campaign can be challenging to unfamiliar players but that is the beauty of it. The AI and scripted events have a requirement that they demand of you in order to overcome them. It is a difficulty that reminds the player that they can't just get a win due to the enemy bending over for them. Games these days are  to watered down and this game is a breath of fresh air. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, because im still trying to beat the few beginning campaign missions. With no dialogue in cutscenes and nothing being explained, I find myself inescapably curious as to how the story plays out, I also feel that the developers shouldn't change the fact that nothing is explained. Why? Mainly because you get hints as to what is happening  by paying attention to your hero and the situation he finds himself in as you continue to progress forward. I definitely look forward to more content and I am happy to offer what little support I can in buying it.","June 8, 2015","true","8.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It doesn't catch the same spirit of other RTS's like StarCraft, Warcraft 3, Total War Series, Savage or the Age of Empire Series, but it's still a good stratedgy game.I have had my few expirences with the bugs and the control layout picked for this title, but after a little adaption to the hotkeys for attacking, building and so on; I was having a ball. They are now currently giving away the Noxx DLC for free, so I got no complaints with them on that!\n\nEach race has it's own strengths and weaknesses and each on of them react uniquely. Example, The Nova race, all of their buildings fly, land and take off with the exception of the command center. IIt sounds like Terrans from Star Craft, though I never seen the terrans move a stationary laser turret or a bunker to the front lines in the middle of a battle before.\n\nAnother Example is the XY's, The use of the small 'cell' minions to create buildings and units! If you no longer need a unit or a building, it can be broken back down to the cell minion uniots and be built into something else! It's my favorite race so far for the versatility this race has and the change of tactics on the fly!\n\nNext thing I love about this game is the use of darkness in all of the games played in NightSide. While it keeps the devs from having to create textures for their maps, it acts perfectly as a fog of war and can help determine the power of your army or settlement. Such as, when you have a bunch or units gathered together, you can see a little more of the map around you and the units area is more well lit vs. a single unit out in the darkness is only a speck of dirt when he's trudging out there.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of techno, but the music composed for this during games is beautiful. I may look into buying it at some point when I have the funds. If there's a NightSide 2 in development oir if the Dev's plan to Release something else for this RTS, consider me hooked and in line toi get it.","January 5","true","9.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

For some reason, I just really didn't want humans in the game, disappointed to learn they're the protagonists of the story...\nThis is a very interesting and fresh project, but it's squandered by being way too fast-paced, leaving almost no time to enjoy your accomplishments and discoveries - or build up significantly at all, effectively locking you out of even seeing certain late-game-only features. The tutorial allows for this, but it's only on one map and it more or less directs your every step, with an enemy that only attacks defensively. This feature should be renamed "Training" and handled as such.\nRight now, it really still seems like it's in beta. I've heard some say that it would feel at home in the 90s - this is very true, and while I don't mind that, it's a little too heavy with this in certain areas.\nEither way, give it some time - maybe it'll be approachable later.","August 17, 2015","false","2.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"
