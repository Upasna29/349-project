"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Negark/recommended/386750/","Negark","Negark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Negark/","320 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCashtronauts is incredibly fun. The goal is to collect money which unlocks risks which increase the amount of money you earn. The risks fundamentally change the game. For example, one adds civilian ships which drop upgrades for your ship. Others add different types of minerals to the game that sell for varying amounts based on in-game legality and rarity. I've played for a few hours and the game continues to be fun because the risks are constantly changing the gameplay.\n\nWhen you hit the later game the risks do start to slow down and it can take many games before you unlock another risk. Thankfully the developer has tweaked the game so that risks will continue to come in more frequently. Though I haven't unlocked them all yet, I do hope to see many more risks added to the game. I haven't unlocked the final two risks, but having some more ship variety would be amazing. Of course the game is in Early Access currently, so there's still plenty of time for improvements.\n\nOverall I would absolutely recommend playing Cashtronauts. It's super fun. If you want to see more gameplay of Cashtronauts, I have a series of videos for it here! https://youtu.be/XCliuFb6pdk?list=PLw7LcwDs7sjyG34x-7cpgOmGdUlUwvQlr","August 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

You can collect money by selling ores and Teeth dropped by Raptors, which are enemy ships who are on the hunt for you once you go outside your city barrier. You have limited fuel and ammunition, which can be refilled/restocked, so is your health, however it's not replenishable, so fight wisely! You can carry only so much items at a time, whether it to be teeth or ore, so you have to make many trips from outer space back to your settlement to be as efficient as possible ,you're going to need lucky and hopefully you won't bump into any cops or Raptors trying to kill you. Speaking of cops and murder, don't carry red ores! You will be murdered, it is illegal to carry around. This is a sandbox game, where the only objective is to get as much money as you can in a run, which unlocks more risks once certain money milestones are achieved to get even more money. Some risks give invisibility cloaks to unseen Raptors, other introduce new gameplay mechanics, such as civilian transport ships (murderable, carry lots of money, will get you into police trouble) and generally the more riks the more fun the game is.\n\nGameplay\nIt's a sandbox playing area which at early game is a bit difficult to navigate due to not having any minimap of any sort, but easy to pick up the general game. The speed rapidly builds up as you unlock the harder risks, such as sometimes while on low fuel you accidentally shoot a passerby insetad of an enemy. This builds up adrenalin and tense times that will be remembered. This technique leads to many addictions being made along with an actual relationship to the ship you're playing as. It's simple to understand. You get items to sell, you sell them, get rich, restock, repeat. Over, and over, and over. It's fun, knowing your ship can blow up at any time when your about to beat an all time high score.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nFun\nSimple\nAddictive\nCheap\nMore game coming\nClean graphical look\n\nCons:\nNot that much game once you get later into it\n\nFinale\nThe game is good right now, will only get better as time goes along. Gets an 8/10 from me.\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Love the soundtrack, game mechanics and the very special controls (Xbox controller). You scavenge around your spacebase for loot, minerals and pirate ships. Sell the things you collect in your 6 cargo places at certain buildings and earn loads of money. You also have to replenish your ammo and fuel which costs just a bit. Levelup works through moneymaking and automatically repairs your ship again. On higher levels it gets harder. There are missile ships entering your base and hunting for you. If you finally can raise your total earnings you will unlock new risks. Risks are like multiplier, but also add some more difficulties. One gives you an upgrade building. Shoot civil ships for speed upgrades and cops for weapon upgrades. With max speed and weapons you can easily set a new highscore. The cutiest detail in this game are the dinos inside the spaceships.

Another adds gold to some asteroids but also adds competition in the form of big mining ships.\nThe game eases you in gently, the 10 risks are unlocked as you play, letting you add more challenge as you get more confident.\n\nYou have a starting area which includes an ammo and fuel shop, a shop to sell minerals to, a place for upgrading your ship parts and a police station which rewards cash-monies for any teeth you bring them as proof of a baddy bashed.\nFrom here, you go out exploring space, blowing up asteroids to find juicy minerals to sell on for profit, searching for cash crates, ship upgrades to beef up your engines and weapons and bad lads who drop teeth and cash on death.\nBlasting benign civilian ships into space dust and collecting their cash and hopefully ship upgrade parts will set off a GTA style wanted state where police will chase you around the starting area until it wears off.\n\nThe game keeps you on your toes, every time I've gotten cocky or I've started to relax a bit, I've been chinned.\nThe starting screen shows your own personal high score and the highest score from around the world for that day which spurs you on to have "just one more shot".\nThis is early access but feels like a complete and polished game already. There are no reasons not to jump into this right now.\n60fps, plays great with both pad and keyboard and mouse.\nHighly recommended.\n\nThe music is also worth a special mention, can't stop bopping in my chair while playing this :D","August 16, 2015","true","31.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/386750/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCashtronauts is a twin-stick shooter where your only goal is to become as rich as possible. No matter how many innocents (or pirates) need to die along the way you must become the wealthiest spaceship pilot in the galaxy.\n\nWe've all played twin-sticker shooters before so we know that aspect of gameplay. It works well here, one stick to move and one to shoot it's pretty simple. What makes this game special then? It's the mechanics built around the shooter.\n\nYou are playing in space where you have to monitor your ammo, fuel, and cargo space. The ammo and fuel is purchasable from two floating space stations. You cargo can be ejected from your ship if you need to or you can sell it to the mining space station. You earn money by collecting floating cash in space, destroying asteroids to pick up contraband to sell to the miner, or kill all the pirates you want (or kill the police and stupid innocent people).\n\nCashtronauts introduces a Risk mechanic, where as you play and collect money you will unlock one of several different risks. Each risk increases the percentage of money you earn, whether that be collecting it from crates, shooting pirates or cops, or turning in mined drugs (red pill or blue pill, I'm not sure if they are drugs but they look like space drugs to me. In addition to increasing the money earned percentage, each risk also changes the game in someway. The first I unlocked made the Raptor enemies gain cloak, it also made them drop Raptor Teeth when they died, which I could turn in at the police station for a nice bounty. The second added Reddium, which was an illegal red mined ore (or drug) that I could sell to the miner, however, being illegal it would make me wanted by the police until I sold the cargo or dumped it. You can choose which, if any, of the risks you want to use in between each run.\n\nOverall I think Cashtronauts takes the twin-stick shooter in a challenging and fun direction and the risk mechanic adds for a nice depth too the gameplay. I'm looking forward to new risks and enemies as the game makes it's way through early access.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vG7U2MQCCac\n\nFor more reviews and the biweekly podcast - EarlyAccessMedia.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","August 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Those risks give you new ways to earn more money when enable, but it also comes with a hazard (ex: raptor ships will drop priceless materials when destroyed, but they'll now have a cloaking device).\n\nThe game has a single and a multiplayer mode (local only).

You will play and play simple to unlock more risks to continue playing to unlock more...\n\nNothing else matters or changes, really.

Basically it's about mining, looting, shooting and avoiding being shot. Your basic income is to collect minerals by shooting rocks to pieces, but as the game expands more riskful options become available and the game often puts you in situations where you'll want to chose between safely hauling your cargo back to base or risking it all for a much bigger reward. Overall the concept is basic, but it's well executed. The controls are fluid, though right stick aiming feels a bit inexact – but that could be my controller getting old. Cash accumulation over multiple plays to unlock the Risks that unlock gameplay features with new challenges and bonuses lends the game a rougelike-like-like-like generation/legacy element.\n\nAlso posive, for an early access release, is that the developer seems dedicated and has an active and friendly presence on the forums. The game is already technically solid and in a very enjoyable state, more or less a finished product, and with a few more planned features mentioned I think it's looking very good.\n\nWith a demo or other way to try the concept hands-on I would gladly have paid full price.","September 15, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think the content is a little light for 1 player but with more than one the game shines and is a good additional to a co-op focused collection.","May 29","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
