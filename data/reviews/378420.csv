It currently has an IndieGoGo campaign going, which has nine days left. Doesn't seem like it's gonna get there.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RhIfLolVQUk\n\nFirst thing I want to point out is that this is another mobile port of a game to hit the Steam Early Access landscape. Not that this is a bad thing, but Jurassic Island does exist on mobile platforms for 99c, which when compared to the $5.99 price tag on Steam can be a bit hard to justify the price increase. Also consider that I haven't played the mobile version, so where a game like Minimon is trying to separate itself from its mobile counterpart, I'm not quite sure what the differences, if any, are.\n\nIt also seems the developer has made other games using this format of top town sim with a pair of games, The Terminal and The Terminal 2. So in essence this may just be a reskinned version of those games. Currently 'The Terminal 2' sits at a paltry 24% positivity rating on Steam and was released August of 2014 and to not much surprise Jurassic Island seems to be heading in the same direction with a 33%.\n\nDuring my first look I went searching for a tutorial to get an idea of what we were dealing with and hidden in the settings menu I found "Game Tutorial" which promptly took me to a 2 minute video on YouTube. This isn't an effective way to learn how to play a game. So this didn't start off as a positive experience.\n\nMy overall experience can be boiled down into one word, broken. With no tutorial everything is a confusing mess. I was unsure of what to do or how to do it. I gave up on the first look when I hit a point and the game asked me to build an "Egg Mine" and it just wouldn't let me place it, anywhere. I tried to build some roads and the pathing system is impossible to direct because it was made for a touch screen, the same goes for the electric fences to keep your dinosaurs confined. Did I say dinosaurs with an 'S' as in plural, I meant dinosaur. I was only able to hatch one, because I couldn't figure out how to hatch another one, or how to get more eggs.\n\nOverall, Jurassic Island: A Dinosaur Zoo is a broken port of a mobile game, if it worked there may be something here. That's not the case and it seems its bound for extinction(rimshot).\n\nFor more Indie Movie, Game and Music EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","June 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","24","32","2","1"

It's the barest sketch of a simulator with none of the details properly filled in. True, you do have dinosaurs, buildings, roads and JEEPS!. Sadly, none of these objects interact in any meaningful way, in fact, just placing them down can be a nightmare. The UI and controls are broken, there is no description of any object in the game and the tutorial is a youtube video without audio. The game's page touts, "It takes only 2 minutes to build a Zoo", I spent an hour and couldn't even figure out how to open my park. I spent an hour trying to place an egg farm down...a broken game that barely promises a full Dinosaur Park experience.\n\nPROS\n-looks ok\n\nCONS\n-broken UI\n-confusing mechanics\n-very few things to build","June 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

A simple, pleasing 2d display and lovely lush foliage.\nIn it's current form, I cannot recommend this game to people not willing to navigate clunky controls and the occasional bug or glitch, but I do see a lot of potential in this game if it can sort out the weird method of bulding fences and paths, and have a decent tutorial. I have simply had to restart several times, trying out things at random to figure out the basics of gameplay, and I still find myself going broke pretty quickly.\nThat being said, I find the aethetics of the game charming and would like to see it developed further, and do not regret the small amount of money spent on it. I hope to see a fully-fledged version of the game someday with decent controls and maybe more dinosaur species, as well as additional building options.\nOn balance, I can't recommend this title as of yet, however I will be more than willing to change my tune as the game improves.","November 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
