(It wasn’t clear to me, anyway)  If these “hidden object” games are not your cup of tea, then you might want to pass this game by.\n\nAs far as “hidden object” games go, this one’s pretty decent, but with a VERY SHORT play time. It has nice “photorealistic” graphics, an interesting (although a bit melancholy) storyline, and a few mildly-amusing minigames. One twist in the gameplay/graphics was the “multi-plane” scrolling of each level; moving around shifts the perspective a little, possibly revealing a hidden object.\n\nAnother twist: hidden letters in the scene, often in the form of misspelled signs, often must be found.\n\nThe story is entirely linear (except the final level), so the “time-shifting” aspect is just part of the linear storyline; you can’t “time shift” on your own. This game has a psychological/meaning-of-life motif that seems to be in vogue these days, but I found the story intriguing enough to want to play the game to the end.\n\nThe game is very short, and can be beaten in about 2 or three hours.\n\nSo yeah, I liked it. It's a short but decent casual game. Consider the cost of the game versus the two/three-hour playtime, though.","March 6","true","3.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Even my mom got excited from this game!\nI hope that developers would continue work and soon we would see second part ;)","March 9","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
