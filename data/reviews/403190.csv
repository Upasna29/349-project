"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/recommended/403190/","atxferret","ATX Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/","156 products in account","I've been really struggling to decide how I want to rate this game because, although I have played it for around 50 hours, now that I see that there's no amount of practice or strategy that can get past a fatal flaw in the game design itself, I wish I hadn't.\n\nScroll down to the bottom for the summary, if you like, but I really suggest you read the entire review to get a grasp on my reasoning because, although the game is stable and not completely devoid of merit, it is basically broken, and unfortunately, without someone explaining it beforehand, you'll have to invest a lot of time before you see exactly how.\n\nIf you like games where you assign a task, such as building a building or using a machine, and then some guy goes and actually does said task, and the game is essentially this concept multiplied repeatedly, with all the logistics problems left for you to figure out, then you'll like this game, at least for a while. Probably for 5-10 hours or so.\n\nEverything hinges on how you plan your base. This, in essence, is the entirety of the game.\n\nIn a way, this is good, as it gives you the feeling that your design choices really matter. Where you place the mine, in association with where you place the ore processor, in association with where you place the semi-conductor making machine, in association with where you place the robot making machine, will define the success or failure of your colony.\n\nYou've played games like this before -- everything from the Anno series to Starcraft/Warcraft series of strategy games. Your placement plus automated workers of some kind using the things you place equals the game, more or less. In Planetbase, though, you're never preparing for war (there are "invaders", but they're a joke), and you're never trying to get to the next scenario or goal because there pretty much aren't any of either.\n\nEven this is alright, though, since, for one thing, it's only a $20 game. It is not, however, a "sandbox" game, as it is tagged, unless you consider a severe lack of any real goals to mean sandbox.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't recommend it, I do feel like most people will get more than $20 worth of gaming simply out of getting to the point to where they can hit all the milestones on the third and final planet. After that, though, there's really not much left to do, and you'll probably be bored of the repitition well before you get to that point (as I was).\n\nNo, my major complaint about this game is actually more of a combination of two elements.\n\nFirst, everything you build is connected to each other. It's either outdoor structures (power and oxygen generation) or indoor structures (domes where your people can do things) and you must build pathways to connect them. Due to terrain, you will often find that the only way to continue building your colony is to either separate your outdoor structures from your indoor structures entirely, meaning one meteorite strike on that connection can instantly spell the end of your colony because, although you can connect the entirety of your colony to all of its power and water generation with one single connection, and one of the first and cheapest structures in the game is the mine, you inexplicably cannot connect parts of your base through any amount of rock.\n\n(Edit: I have been advised in the comments that external connections, which are those built only to power and water generating structures, cannot really be destroyed, and therefore you could build all of those structures away from the base. Although true, this seems almost like an exploit or, at the very least, a very limiting strategy since you could never build any interior structures in that direction as the game won't let you "split your base", as it puts it. It might be a workaround for the above issue, but it's certainly not a solution to the problem. As per the devs (see link in comments), they don't allow that link to be destroyed via meteor strikes because it would make the game "ridiculously hard," indicating that they see segregating all exterior structures as the only viable strategy.)\n\nThe other option is to build these external structures alongside your internal structures. This strategy, however, will invariably lead to multiple instances of places where there is only one way to get from one end of the colony to the other because, apparently, the concept of building tunnels over or under hills was never invented in this particular alternate reality.\n\nOn its own, this conundrum could be seen as part of the game's strategy. After all, the main premise is that you're building a city out of domes an alien planet, right?\n\nWell, that could work fine if it wasn't for the fact that there is virtually no AI controlling the colonists, and the colonists are a bit like Sims in that they need to eat, sleep, and keep entertained, in addition to doing their jobs and carrying things around, the latter of which can often take up most of a colonist's life, at least until the colony is advanced enough to produce robots to do the carrying for you (which can take a while).\n\nNow mix the extremely limited pathways with the needs of the colonists, who lack the programming to anticipate their own needs in any way, and add the fact that every device that satisfies a need can only be used by one colonist at a time, and, if you're experienced with these types of games, you're already starting to see the big shiny, flashing, glaring flaw in the core design of the game.\n\nIf you're not seeing it yet, here's a direct quote from the developer in response to my asking if this was considered part of the intended difficulty of the game, or if the colonists are not supposed to be ignoring their basic needs when they're in the same room as the thing that can provide for those needs:\n\n"The main reason for the colonist not grabbing a meal will be that there are none available.\nThere might be a meal in the Meal Maker, but it might be already assigned to another colonist that is on their way to pick it up.\nColonists are polite this way until the triangle on their heads gets orange, at that point they will just grab whatever is available regardles of someone else wanting it.\nWe should probaby indicate this in the UI somehow to make it more obvious."\n\nThis means that your colonists are going to spend much of their time walking across the planet to get to a device to fill a need simply because the nearest device was being used right at the second they decided they were hungry, or thirsty, or sleepy. It doesn't matter that the device would be out of use in less than a second. That colonist is going to spend an entire in-game day walking to that other water fountain because he wasn't bright enough to stand in line behind the one guy at the first one. And the developer only sees this as a UI flaw.\n\nYou can read more on the forums regarding the complete lack of an actual AI in this game, and how horribly it mixes with the concept of domes and limited pathways but, what it all boils down to is, you end up designing the base around the stupidity of your colonists, which shouldn't be the point at all, but basically defines the game past the first 20-30 colonists.\n\nOnce you realize this, you quickly become annoyed with playing a game that doesn't involve much more than compensating for its own bad design.\n\nSo, here's the TL;DR\n\n+ Game is stable.\n+ Graphics are decent and create a nice atmosphere.\n- Audio is uninspired and sleep-inducing.\n- Very few real goals, but not nearly enough freedom to justify the "sandbox" label.\n-- Gameplay concepts clash terribly. Extremely limited pathways and extremely basic AIs do not mix well.\n(See comments for any of my replies to the developer responses.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/403190/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","Planetbase is a base builder on uncolonized planets. If you like building sims and space, you're likely to enjoy this game. Now for the nitty-gritty.\n\nThe GoodGORGEOUS GRAPHICS - Especially from far away with the domes up at night. Check my screenshots for some pics of my own base\nGREAT CONTROLS - Everything works pretty-much how you might expect\nTHE COLONIST AI ISN'T AN IDIOT - Colonists and robots actually seem to triage and do the things that need doing, rather than getting stuck in deadlocked loops. They perform most tasks to completion, rather than allowing their needs to interrupt current tasks. This seemingly-tiny feature is an enormous improvement over similar games like Banished or Maia. Because having stupid AI for colonists in a base building sim makes them extremely frustrating, often to the point of unplayability.\nUNLIMITED RESOURCES - One might think of this as a negative, because its not "realistic" but that would be wrong. A small base is going to take hundreds of years to mine out a mountain, or else have enormous stockpiles of metal. Planetbase takes the former route, and mines are inexhaustible. Why is this a plus? Because it prevents the landscape from looking like late-game Banished: Completely littered with exhausted mines and quarries. Planetbase, on the contrary, is more concerned with managing the rate of resource extraction, rather than constantly building new mines.\nNEAR-FUTURE PLAUSIBILITY - The first map especially seems like Mars, and none of the technology ingame (aside perhaps from the frequent trading ships) is that far future from what we might provide today. This gives the game a feel of realism and plausibility requiring no suspension of disbelief. The player can understand the role of each building and item from the start without having to look it up in tutorials or lore.\nGREAT UI - Simple, and direct to the point.\nGOOD SENSE OF PROGRESS - Always feels like you're achieving some grand vision. This sort-of gives it a Civ5 "one more turn" feel, except in PlanetBase its more like "one more dome".\nFLOW - Fun and addictive gameplay, flows nicely, easy to get lost in it\n\nThe BadTRADING SYSTEM - My biggest single annoyance is that, when you start trading, the button will only exchange one item at a time. That seems standard, right? But in a lot of games, by holding down shift and clicking you might send 10. Or Alt might send 100. This seems tiny, but when you're trying to buy something that costs $600 with money, you literally have to click 600 times. WTF.\nMETEOR PLANET - I do wonder if people would really try to colonize planets that are regularly bombarded with meteors. Doesn't seem wise. Or at least they should build their colonies underground.\nCAN'T BUILD MULTIPLE COLONIES - One of the things I wanted to do (badly) is build a temporary base in order to gain the resources required to build a larger more permanent base, then recycle the temp base and live in the better-thought-out permanent base. I wanted to do this because there are vast advantages to having large domed rooms and the largest power generators, but you can't really afford those in the early game. It would be better to do this 2-base build process, rather than build 1 and have to go back and recycle everything bit-by-bit to upgrade. A lot of times the new larger structures won't fit in the footprint of the old structure that they're replacing, causing bases often times to become messy and inefficient, or causing the player to have to tear down more of their base than really necessary to make improvements.\nTECHS ARE WEIRD - The technology system seem taped-on. You buy them from traders rather than researching them (what?), and a lot of them are arguably techs you don't want to have. Like the GM veggies, which cost like $400, say something like "Might kill you". Why would you buy these? And yet, to get the technological achievement, you need to get them even if you don't intend to use them.\n\nCONCLUSIONGreat game with some really tiny problems that marr an otherwise almost-perfect experience. I'd give it a 94% (very high marks).\n\nUPDATE (2015.11.20): Some of the negatives listed here have been addressed (the trading system), or plans have been announced to address them soon (the single base problem). Add to the positives section that developers are responsive to customer feedback and are continuing to support / improve the game!","November 1, 2015","true","14.2"," 453 of 500 people (91%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","91","453","500","24","26"

I feel bad becuase they actually gave me a beta key.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game by any means, but after much thought I don't think I can give it thumbs up.\n\nIt's a very nice looking game.\nThere's a lot of attention to detail.\nBalancing all the aspects is fun and interesting.\n\nBUT!\n\nHere's the kicker...\n\nOnce you get past the initial 30min or so of a senario, or basically once you've become stable, there's really nothing much more to it all. The REAL challenge in the game is that initial hump you have to overcome to become stable and self-sufficient. Once this is done though, quite frankly it's a bit dull.\n\nI've played all 3 planets to the max potential and I can tell ya that by the third I was completly bored.\nI guess maybe there needs to be more to it?\n\nI don't really have a suggestion or solution for this.

It certainly has many good points and a great attention to detail.

So I've replayed it to see how much it actually changed, and how much of what I mentioned has actually been adressed.\nTherefore, the following is an edited version from the original review, for the original review, please go to http://pastebin.com/xJqfjmhX or ask me directly for a copy. The review shown here is from 18 November, almost an exact two months after the first.\n\nPlanetbase is a great, if simple concept for a game. Yet flawed in its execution and sadly nowhere near fullfilling its potential.\n\nWhile it has come a bit since release, it is still full of frustrating moments and flaws, sadly this taints what is otherwise an interesting game that looks fairly good and runs great even on subpar hardware.\nOut of the flaws that were fixed, the most game-breaking were the first to go, with the nutrition system being slightly more forgiving through boosting how much basic meals your colonists can eat, and the AI being a bit more open to actually trying to do something that will lead to the colonists' survival, it still has issues.\nYou are still encouraged to not diversify your food supply, and colonists are still very robot-like in their methods. They have a habit of just standing around at random in your base, but at the least they seem to be willing to survive.\nSadly, They have any idea of prioritisation (And there are only VERY basic options to give them a priority, with only one button to prioritise a new construction over other constructions since my original review at release). Prioritising your workshops does just about nothing, as far as resources are concerned. You may have prioritised the spares factory so you can repair that solar panel that keeps the lights on, but your colonists prefer to put your materials into the bar construction that you have not prioritised, but also dont want to completely stop since there has already been a fair amount of resources hauled out there. Prioritisation remains an issue, as well as the limit as to your controls over what actually has the limited prioritisation you have access to - If there's a semiconductor foundry in the same room as your spares production, that will get the same priority as your spares if you prioritise the spares.\n\nThe second big flaw is in the interface and controls. You are very limited in how you can control the game, there are near no prioritisation buttons, you can not pause the game except by going to the menu, and there do not appear to be any graphics settings of note(Only 'ultra' 'high' 'medium' 'low', anti-aliasing and a resolution? Seriously?). There are no reliable ways to control or guide colonists, nor any way to prioritise for example your doctor making a medkit to treat the injured over hauling some vegetables to the trader. Nor can you tell when someone has just started work or when they're going to stop working. In general, there just is no structure to the base. Your crew just does what they feel like with no regard for the consequences while you have no way to tell them what to do.\n\nThe base itself is empty, and yet there is not enough room. Every single dome needs a long corridor that goes only from it to one other part of your base. There is no way to split from a corridor, and corridors need to have a minimum length, thus making sure you have long travel times no matter how you build. This of course means very little work gets done when you expand, with less and less getting done the more you build. Colonists do not interact with eachother either, and a majority of your base will be empty space where nothing fits or can be placed.\n\nThe nutrition system is still much the same, and works by loading a specific combination(One of multiple) into the meal maker machine to create nutritious meals. You give them 3 kinds of meat and 6 different kinds of vegetables? Doesn't matter. The game makes every kind of food ingredient into a generic 'basic meal' unless your unthinking colonists just happen to load the right combination of ingredients into the food making machine to make a nutritious meal. I've personally witnessed one food maker filled up with beef and only beef, and right next to it one filled up with only maize. Those two could have made burgers, nutritious delicious burgers, but instead I could do nothing but watch as the game turned them into generic 'basic meals'. A sad thing to see, for sure. But luckily no longer something that breaks your base as they can now hold out long enough for random chance to put together items well enough for a nutritious meal.\nThe problem remains though, with six slots in the meal maker, and most plants you grow growing in twos or threes you will not be able to make the meals consisting of three different ingredients unless you get very lucky.\n\nThis game needs a fair amount of work before I would consider it viable, and as much as I was looking foreward to it and was hoping to just relax, sit back and build myself a base, I found myself unable to do anything except fast foreward as my base stagnated and nothing got done. It's a good idea, and a good base for a game. But with the interface, options menu, and the AI as it is, I would not be able to recommend it.","October 18, 2015","false","23.3"," 458 of 596 people (77%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","77","458","596","29","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/403190/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?\nPlanetbase is not a simple space-based city builder, but an excellent little colony survival game.  Its closest comparison would be the game Banished where you are given a tiny few people and must grow your population while trying to survive the odds that a hostile planet will throw at your colonists.  It's quite a small game (hence its price) but I've leveraged some 90+ hours out of playing it, so I've definitely got plenty value for money already.\n\nYou are presented with 3 planets of increasing difficulty and a select few colonists.  Time is critical because your colonists' spacesuits will soon run out of oxygen, and then they will soon become hungry and tired after that.  Just like Banished, if your colonists' needs reach critical level, they stop working altogether and will most likely die (ie a critical need is already 'too late').  The simple maths is 1 colony multiplied by 0 colonists = 'Game Over'.\n\n\nDifficulty\nPlanetbase has a quite a challenging difficulty curve that balances between gentle and seeming-impossible difficulty spikes.  The first spike is at the very beginning: can you quickly make your colonists self-sufficient with the very limited resources available to you?  Expect a few restarts when you realise that you got it wrong, or some random planetary event such as a meteor shower ruins your plans.  Once you manage initial settlement, it all starts to feel gentle as the pieces fall into place: biologists produce food, energy and water production ticks along optimally, and workers busy themselves with manufacturing more resources and robots.  But it won't last.  Each time you meddle with the numbers, you are in danger of unbalancing all you've achieved and bringing on another tremendous difficulty spike!\n\n\nForum complaints and mixed reviews - misunderstandings only\nColony survival games occupy a tiny little niche that is very much misunderstood.  People tend to see the screenshots and assume (understandably) that the game is an empire/city building game of some kind.  The same mistaken assumptions were made about the equally-excellent Banished, where many players complained either that the game was simply too hard and needed to be easier, that the AI is somehow 'dumb' or that there is 'nothing left to do'.   All of these are wrong assumptions that point more to the player's misunderstanding of how this genre of game should be played.  People who would enjoy a space-based city builder might be more at home with the latest Anno game because Planetbase is altogether a different animal...\n\nFirstly, the game being 'too hard' IS the game.  It sits more comfortably as a survival/puzzle game than it does a city-building game, because you have limited space, limited resources AND a limitation on the number of structures you can build in order to meet the 8 achievements.   It takes almost nothing to run out of energy or water, but that is the point of the challenge - ie can you beat this planet AND overcome its hazards.  Secondly, if your colonists' needs reach the critical red, then it is already too late.  It's not dumb AI; it's exactly how that AI should play out.  Your only hope at this stage is that a less incapcitated colonist can take over the food or meds chain to help those who are already in the red zone.  If not, they will stop working and will eventually die (if they didn't, there would be no game to play), which brings me to the final complaint people make about 'nothing left to do': if you reach 300 colonists and everything is ticking over nicely, then there IS nothing left to do - you've conquered the planet so move on to the next.  But be warned, it's NOT easy to achieve it!\n\n\nIn summary...\nPlanetbase is an excellent colony/survival game that has more in common with survival than it does with city-building.  If you've played Banished on its hardest difficulty, then this is about the same level of difficulty as that.  You will be in for many retries, but the challenge is the reward.  I can't recommend this game strongly enough - it truly is a little marvel and I hope the developers might one day expand it a bit with some DLC add-on.\n\nHighly recommended - especially if you enjoyed Banished!","November 6, 2015","true","198.3"," 112 of 125 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","112","125","3","3"

I’ll be on the first colonist ship thanks!\n\nPlanetbase is a colony building strategy/simulation game from Madruga Works. In Planetbase you’re in charge of a handful of colonists and bots who have just landed on a different planet. It’s your job to get said colonists and bots working on building a self-sufficient colony that can sustain a reasonably sized population as well as support visitors, new arrivals and trade. While you may be alone on the planets you most certainly aren’t safe.\n\nPresentation\nPlanetbase may not have cutting edge graphics but it is a nice looking game. All of the textures are well done, particularly the buildings but also the colonists, bots and ships. The menu is simple and easy to use, not too much to say here. The UI is reasonably good and stays out of the way when you want it too. I would have liked the drop down menus on the UI to be a little bit bigger as I clicked the wrong thing a few times but this isn’t a major issue. You also get handy notifications for when major events happen such as a trader arriving or a colonist dying.\n\nGameplay\nAs you’d guess with a colony building strategy/simulation game Planetbase is all about building your colony and sustaining it. Choosing what to build when is really what it comes down to, resource management is incredibly important. With a couple of exceptions all of the resources in the game are key to your colony’s success so you need to manage what you start with carefully and use them to reach a point of self-sufficiency before you can really start expanding your colony.\n\nThere are quite a few different building pods in the game and most of them are used for producing resources, such as the lab (medical supplies and synthetic meat) and the Oxygen Generator room. As well as these you also have structures which are built outside your pods and are therefore not connected to your oxygen supply, these include wind turbines, solar panels and power storage units. How much power you can generate and how much you have stored can be a make or break condition so it’s important to build as many of these as you can whenever you can to maximise your power grid capacity and your backup power. Water is also key but not to the same extent as power. Like power excess water can be stored and it’s best to keep your supply in excess for when things turn south.\n\nOnce your pods are built you can begin filling them up with the equipment needed for the rooms, such as food makers in the canteen. Some pods are going to be more important than others and so the game lets you prioritise your rooms, meaning colonists will focus on the jobs that need doing there. Unfortunately you can’t prioritise specific machines within the pods so if you have a shortage of spare parts you’re going to end up with some semi-conductors and guns too unless you completely shut down those machines.\n\nThe structures/pods themselves come in different sizes, the larger the structure the more resources required. Generally each structure has two or three different sizes but some of them also have a further size requiring a blueprint sold by visiting traders. Again, resource management is important here. While it seems like a nice idea to build big structures early on to expand quickly this is a sure fire way to run out of resources and if you run out of a resource without the capability of making more your colony is as good as dead.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier there are threats to your colony other than simply running out of resources. There are natural threats such as meteor storms which can destroy structures (killing those inside), sandstorms which make movement speed outside of the colony significantly slower as well as degrading your structures and bots faster and lastly solar flares which cause radiation poisoning (and death) for any colonists unlucky enough to be exposed to them. There are also intruders who are rogue colonists that will try and kill your colonists though your guards are generally good at getting rid of them. In case of emergency, providing you have a command centre, you can trigger alarm levels which will force your colonists to stay indoors as well as make certain workers work extra shifts to treat anyone who may be wounded.\n\nOnce you’ve established your colony and things are running smoothly you can start to think about getting more foot traffic in your colony by building landing pads for ships. Landing pads will allow colonist, trader and visitor ships to start arriving at your colony (visitor ships are only supported by a large landing pad). Colonists become permanent residents of your colony and will take on a job around the colony based on their skills. Traders will offer you goods in return for money or resources. Visitors will stay at your colony for a couple of days and will consume food as well as take up beds but they do pay you for the trouble.\n\nAudio\nNot too much to say here other than all of the sound effects are very good. The sound track fits with the game and is pretty relaxing so it’s not too distracting.\n\nMiscellaneous As I eluded to, the game could use some more micro-management when dealing with what resource productions to prioritise.\nPlanetbase features three different planets for you to colonise, the second two are unlocked by completing a certain number of milestones.\nAirlocks only allow one person to pass through at a time and even if you build two right next to each other your colonists will choose one over the other. This significantly slows down the process of getting colonists indoors which becomes problematic when a solar flare hits and you have a large number of people outside.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nPlanetbase is a fantastic colony builder strategy/simulation game with good graphics and incredibly enjoyable gameplay. If you fancy something similar to Banished or you just want a sci-fi twist on the city-building genre then this game is for you.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 314 of 410 people (77%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","77","314","410","17","16"

Especially if you like city building games.  Think of the bare bones game of Banished (no MODs loaded) but with the science fiction twist of colonizing 4 very different types of planets.\n\nWhat can I say?  I love the concept and I love the graphics.  The devs have recently fixed some major AI flaws which means they are working on the game.  As long as they keep working on the game, I'm sure I will continue to play.  Although, I think the biggest thing that keeps me coming back to this game is the potential.  There are just so many items I believe should be added to this game, such as;\n\n1 - We already having the mining of ore.  How about mining for some kind of FUEL for the visiting ships?\n2 - Thus we would need the production of a raw FUEL product turned into a useable FUEL product.\n3 - Upon which, we would need a FUEL DEPOT near the landing pads/starport.\n4 - The addition of different food production lines prior to said products being placed in the food machines.  Perhaps sweets, breads and juices?  These production lines do NOT need to be as complicated as in the game Project Aura.\n5 - More and a wider variety of leisure time activity pods would also be nice i.e., cinema/multi-media pod, anti-gravity yoga pod, fight club/boxing/jujitso pod, heated swimming pool pod, etc.\n6 - Perhaps the production of some kind of luxury item that would add to base profits.\n7 - A central administration pod where workers, visitors and products can be registered and assigned positions.  Of course, we would then have to add administrators as an additional type of worker needed for a functioning base.\n8 - Instead of killing all intruders, how about a jail pod?  Oh!  and if you end up with a lot of guards it would be nice to have a barracks pod just for security.\n9 - For those of us who like to accept lots of visitors, how about a motel/hotel pod for the visitors?\n10 - I guess what I'm trying to say is more and a wider variety of everything would definitely keep this game ALIVE for me.\n\nSome modding has been allowed/added, yeah!  Playing this game with a Creative Mod loaded or a God Mod loaded is such a blast.  I hope the devs will keep tweaking this game.  I would highly recommend this game to all city building fans because you will get your money's worth of enjoyable playing time.","May 8","true","396.7"," 79 of 86 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","79","86","5","0"

You start getting your first colonist and start processing resouces while trying to not run out of food or power reserves. Overall a challenging but great early game.\n\nMID GAME\nThe mid game is  awesome by far the best part. You start expanding out and ramping up production, increasing your population and getting more technologies. You start getting visitors and you get invaded for the first time and you start getting transmissions from ships and building lazers its awesome there is so much to do in the mid game.\n\nLATE GAME\nThis is where the game falls apart for me. Once you get past the mid game and have built most of the buildings there is nothing new its just repeat the same set of buildings that you already have, its just about getting more population. Now if this was the only problem I would say its a good game just a weak late game but that's not the only late game problem\n\nDealing with late game storage is really annoying. Build too many plants and suddenly all of your storage is full  with starch and food with no good way of getting rid of it. I explain below why trading it all away screwed me over.\n\nThe AI was already not great but in the late game when your base is huge the AI becomes infuriating to deal with.\n\nExample one : I had too many resouces and decided to trade away 200 bioplastic at once to a trader. BAD IDEA. It took my colonists so long to get in and out of the base that 60+ colonists died due to starvation. WTF. Maybe my base design sucked but the AI should priorities their lives over their current action.\n\nExample two:  Too many colonists enter a room and the oxygen gets all used up you would think the AI would make them leave so they dont die but no they just stay and die :/\n\nDifferent planets dont really do much except increase the early game difficulty. Map size is also limited, its really large but its not like you can build across the whole planet.\n\nTrading and visitors are basically useless in the late game you so many resources and money from visitors that trading ships are only good for getting technologies and vistors have no value at all.\n\nAlso took over 3 hours to finally get a trading ship with the last technology I needed to finish the get all technologies milestone WTF I actually thought that the game was bugged at one point I spent hours just dismissing trading shipping and adding on starports to get more trading ships.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOverall it reminds me alot of banished, its fun to play through it once but after that there isn't much left to do thats new. Early and mid game are amazing I had a ton of fun playing these and if you are ok with this then go for it. Late game combined with a poor AI kinda ruined it for me but at 20 bucks I definitely got my moneys worth I just probably wouldn't recommend it to someone in its current state. That being said it has a ton of potential and I hope it continues to improve. Thanks :)\n\nEDIT\nAs some of the comments show I didn't explain well the overall value of the game.\nIs this game worth the price? YES it is, it has some fun moments and is worth the price\nIs this game worth putting a lot of hours into it? NO, this is why I don't recommend it.\nIf the updates keep coming as they have been and the game improves I will gladly update the reveiw when it is in a state that I feel is good.

What on the surface looks like a 'zen' city-builder is actually anything but - it is quite a difficult struggle meeting the goals the game puts before you. There are dangers of starvation, lack of oxygen, and sandstorms that can wipe out your colony. What seperates it slightly from Banished (apart from the mars-ish planet setting of course) is that there are concrete goals that lead to unlocking a total of three playable planets. The music and ambience are really good here. Graphics are nice and can run on really any machine.\n\nOne thing I want to say upfront, regarding several top negative reviews of this game: some say it becomes very easy after 30 minutes or more. I have definately not found that to be my case. After 8 hours our group is still struggling to even complete the 4th milestone event (out of 10) on the first planet. Maybe we are bad at it, but I don't think so.\n\nPros:\n+Has that really fun addicting quality of base-building without the combat that Banished really brought to the table\n+Great graphics and ambience that can look great on a gaming rig, yet still be totally playable on a work laptop\n+Puts goals before you, unlike Banished, which really helps drive the game forward.\n+Really good tutorial.\n+Price is definately worth it - I will certainly get 20 hours out of it easily without trying\n+Steam Controller works great with it - it was one of the first games I tried :D\n+Lots of options and fairly deep city-building strategy (I love city-building or dwarf management sims, so I tend to try them all)\n+I find lots of difficutly here.\n\nCons:\n-Really should be able to manually rotate buildings. At the moment the 'computer' makes the decision of which angle is 'best' for you. Apparently you can delete and re-plop, but why not just have a rotate key?\n-The ratio of human size to building size is way off. It becomes super apparent when you look through a video camera in one of your buildings - the humans look giant! It breaks the reality-fantasy barrier a bit (for lack of better words).\n-The camera angle options could really use some more flexibility - why can't I look up at the sky?! Such a beautiful atmosphere, and I want to experience more of it. I also want to get even closer on the groud to see people working!\n-You should be able to skip that initial landing animation.\n-Right click should also serve as the 'back' button in menus.\n\nOverall, this is totally a city-builder that should be in your library if you like that kind of game. Its worth full price, even.","October 17, 2015","true","21.7"," 145 of 189 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","145","189","5","11"

I have, on multiple occasions, started a new game and ended up spawning in a small space that leaves me unable to even being basic building procedures. Also, the difficulty doesn't really suit the first planet because I have tried countless times to make a good base but I can never do that, and I'm only on the first planet! I can even get to the other planets because it is so difficult!\n\nAll in all, this is a good game but needs some small places seriously fixed up. I'm sure I would not be the only one who would be glad if these sorts of problems are fixed up. Also, a sandbox like mode would also be nice, ya know, for when people like me just want to play this game calmly rather than raging over the fact that they've run out of Spares.","November 28, 2015","true","38.0"," 88 of 107 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","88","107","3","1"

I was very excited about this game.  I absolutely adore resource management games and civ simulations.  I've played for a few hours, starting over dozens of times, trying to find that perfect build that will get my colony seed going.  I love that it's difficult and your decisions matter.\n\nThen it happens.  Maybe an hour into a map, and the AI just gives up.  Out of my 7 starting colonists, 6 of them are hungry.  There's piles of unprocessed food in the storage building waiting to go into the processor, and no one will move it.  ONE lonely engineer will stop what he's doing, grab some veggies or meat and takes them to the machine for himself.  He eats, and then goes back to his tasks.\n\nThere is no way to schedule or rank work.  (The max build queue is kind of a joke.)  There is no way to manually assign tasks or override a colonists broken path.  A sandstorm hits, and I have a colonist that walks out side and just stands there in it for no reason.   My bots finally broke down.  One engineer walks right by, and the other is standing right next to it, but refuses to attempt repairs.  I have piles of spare parts and materials waiting to be used.\n\nIf a game doesn't have a strong AI to actually simulate well, it needs to allow for granular manual control.  This does not.  Once you've reached an equilibrium the game just stops working.  I love difficult and challenging games.  This isn't a challenge, this is an infinite loop of broken.  All in all it's a very simple game that had the promises of complexity, but failed to deliver.   I would say the AI is a joke, but there would actually have to be an AI to rate.\n\nDo yourself a favor, give this one a pass.","October 19, 2015","false","15.4"," 198 of 291 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","198","291","9","12"

I want to love it, but it's not quite there. The early game is chalenging, the mid game is interesting and satisfying... ...but the late game is tedious and frustrating.\n\nWhile the game does provide a great 'Max Build' option for production what is desperately needed is a 'Min Build'. Far too many times I've had bases colapse due to the AI not producing some key thing that is absolutely NEEDED for survival while workers/engineers/biologists blithely ignore performing whatever function is required of them. I've tried raising priority on the appropriate room, shutting down every other option for them and still they just refuse to do what is necessary. Then they all die.\n\nAnother thing that needs attention in a future upgrade is some way of determining just why some of the people are not happy. It is fine and well to see that some of them are unhappy, but if you don't know why it becomes very difficult to fix the problem. It is unsatisfying when you do everything available to make people happy and they just stay unhappy.\n\nOverall, the playing of the game is quite fun. Thankfully it's not too expensive and it is, theoretically, possible to win. While the AI could use some polishing and there are times when you feel like there seems to be just one secret formula for success I would recommend this game with one caeat: Don't expect too much from this little game or you will be frustrated.","November 1, 2015","true","137.5"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","39","46","2","0"

There is no sort of cross training, no ability to move individual colonists to specific tasks, and in turn, it results in a lot of bases dying off. A lot of times, the colonists get stuck or won't focus on a task that you need to make sure they don't all die.\nThe second issue ties in with this, in that the game starts off expecting you to build everything at once. You can very easily lose your first night on the planet if things do not get built in a certain time frame, and that leads to a mad scramble where if you're neurotic about base planning, winds up being a mess.\nI really think the develoeprs need to take another look at this game, and work on the pathing and priorities system for the AI, and to rethink the day 1 experience a little.\nI've been having a big mix of fun and utter frustration, and would say don't buy this unless it is on sale for very cheap.","October 17, 2015","false","35.3"," 72 of 103 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","72","103","0","0"

In lieu of an explanation, here comes a list:\n\nPros:\n1) Challenging and balanced survival/builder game. Enough elements for sufficient complexity, not overwhelming\n\n2) Beautiful  and surprisingly engrossing atmospheric game, both in concept and graphics. For a game with no storyline, you will feel attached to your colony.\n\n3) Has a sort of "one more building" hook, similar to "one more turn" games. Each time you get your colony self-sufficient, you will have to risk failure by expanding. There is a balancing act to everything you do: new buildings mean more power, air, water consumption, which in turn means needing new staff, which in turn means...\n\n4) If you've ever played "Banished," this is basically the space version. If you liked that, you will love this. Entails the best elements of strategy/city building games with a fun concept.\n\n5) (Was initially a con) AI has been greatly improved and there is a much more intuitive priority system now. This point serves as a double credit since the DEVs have to be credited for promplty responding to concerns.\n\nCons:\n1) Limited replay value: Once you have learned the nuances of the AI, the game feels a bit limited. You'll spend a lot of hours trying and failing; once you figure out how to succeed, there are not enough elements to keep you wanting more. (all other criticisms stem from this)\n\n2) There are only 3 planets to colonize and the Devs don't seem interested in adding more. So much potential...\n\n3) Some things that would seem essential to space colonization are missing. Things like "heaters," "bathrooms," "security checkpoints,' "radar," "vehicle construction," "marriage and children," "schools/retraining facilities" etc. could add more spice/challenge, yet not present.\n\n\nBottom line:\nIf you like the genre you will love this. If you're not specifically into the genre, you may still like it because it's fun.  Definitely expect around 10 hours of fresh fun. After that, it remains to be seen how much content is added.","October 19, 2015","true","56.1"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","49","65","0","1"

I have been following this game for a while, purchasing Planetbase as soon as it was available.\n\nThe problem is the AI, which seems to ignore common sense.\n\nThe crew will just stop doing their given/only tasks, resulting in either a mass suicide and require restart, or stop doing anything productive, and die slowly, also requiring a restart.\n\nBiologist would not tend to the hydoponics.\nWorkers would not manufacture steel or bioplastic despite ample raw resources.\nEngineers do not use steel or bioplastic to create advanced materials when bioplastic or steel was present.\nRobots allowing humans to do their task while pacing the coridoors or landscape without aim.\nBuildings the never get built despite resources and workers/robots idle, (but still eating and sleeping).\n\nThe recent beta patch only extended the average game by another 20 minutes before either demise would occur.\n\nThis game is both fun and visually stunning when it is running normally.\n\nI would definately recommend it IF you see a big patch addressing AI has been implemented.\n\nHowever as it is now (first week of Steam release), I can't recommend it, as there are too many good games that work on Steam.","October 18, 2015","false","13.0"," 68 of 101 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","68","101","2","0"

I am a huge fan of Banished, and there are many similarities here. At this point, I'd say I still prefer Banished, but I think with some tweaks Planetbase could match it. There is definitely room for improvement in some areas, and hopefully the dev will listen to customer feedback and continue to support the game.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Resource/staffing balancing is challenging, mostly\n- Graphics and sfx are reasonably good/appropriate\n- Music\n- Number of structure types, sizes\n- Randomized maps\n- Disasters keep things lively\n- No pathing issues that I've noticed\n- Help system strong, if sometimes limited\n- Space colony genre\n- Runs very well on ultra settings on my 3-yr-old laptop\n\nOpportunities for improvement:\n- Camera: odd controls for game type, no tilt, limited zoom\n- Not pausable realtime\n- *No urgency to expand (overpopulation, etc)\n- **Randomized maps\n- Planning is difficult (camera, no pause)\n- Base/resource/staff information is good in places, could be more complete\n- Better control of adding colonists by discipline (by % is clumsy)\n\n* I found that I'd get to a certain number of colonists and then just freeze there while I built up production and gathered resources. Then, I'd allow a few more colonists to arrive. Rinse, repeat. I'm actually split on this, because the balancing is tricky, and it allows you to expand when it's comfortable. Ultimately, I'd prefer the balanacing to be more forgiving, and have a stronger motivation to expand.\n\n** Yes, randomized maps are a plus and minus. They add tremendous replayability, but on my first map I had a relatively small area around my drop ship that was completely surrounded by mountains. This limited me to a much smaller colony than I would have liked.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game to fans of the genre. I think the price point is fair, and the launch discount makes it an even easier decision for those interested.","October 18, 2015","true","24.3"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","41","56","2","0"

The strategy is fun.  The overall presentation is great.\nI’ll start with the pro’s\n•	Fun!\n•	Great dynamic resource manufacturing\n•	Many different classes of people\n•	Can be self-sustaining (to a point)\n•	Many challenges in environment and space pirates\n\nCon’s\n•	The game offers very little in logistics\n•	You can’t make a bulldozer to move rocks or hills, what about a shovel?\n•	You can’t choose the colonists you want to come to the base, you have to use percentages\n•	No leveling of said workers, they can’t be any more efficient than when they start\n•	The buildings are TOO FAR APART, there is so much wasted space between buildings it’s ridiculous, if you increase the size of a building the size of the gap increases exponentially\n•	Buildings should be fluid and able to made a custom shape, not just bigger and bigger on the same inefficient floor plan, besides most buildings are made to be modular in space engineering not just round\n•	You cannot build in the center of most building, how hard is for a real person to put something in the middle of the room\n•	You cannot shut off individual items in a room to save energy, so you have to make individual rooms for individual equipment which is frustrating\n•	There is no vehicles, not even a dolly to carry things easily, or even a wagon\n•	The colonists work is highly inefficient, no learning for greater productivity, no efficiency increase with the passage of time\n•	The bots carrying capacity is the same as people, they can’t even pull a pallet\n•	If people get sick or hurt they stop working, not the case in real life, astronauts are trained to understand that you keep working no matter the situation unless its life threatening, colonists would go under the same scrutiny\n•	Can’t set which building you want made first, I try to plan ahead but it takes way too long to build because the resources are based on distance and not my priority, I thought I was supposed to be in charge\n•	IT TAKES TOO LONG TO MAKE/PRODUCE/MINE ANYTHING, I can’t get a priority on one thing it has to be the whole room, I thought I was supposed to be in charge\n•	WHY IS THERE A BUILDING CAP, seriously there is so much terrain, I have the resources and the game is capping me on my own level of productivity\n•	Why aren’t there colony babies?  Is everyone immortal and sterile?  You can never be completely self-sufficient in the game because you have to have a space port to get new people.  Which leads to pirates!\n•	Why is there no communication to let you know when pirates are coming?\n\n\nThe game play is great!  I wouldn’t recommend the game it until some major improvements are made.   The dynamics of game are great start, it’s just not diverse enough to make me recommend this game to anyone.  I want to so badly, and when I start the game I do want to recommend it.  When I get to the middle of expansion I go back to no, there just isn’t enough to make me want to continue when I know there isn’t anything else to do in the game.\n","October 29, 2015","false","51.1"," 64 of 96 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","64","96","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/403190/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","With this City builder Resource Management Sim you will feel like you’ve arrived on Mars. Planetbase allows you to concentrate on Engineering without micromanaging the AI. If you enjoy Survival Sims like Sid Meier’s Beyond Earth, but want something with more accessibility, you will love this game.\n\nMechanics:\nWith few quick-loading splash screens, and a smooth tutorial that drops you directly on a planet, you are immersed in the action almost immediately. This is one of those games that can become a “Just one more minute” time consumer. It takes a few components of the grand 4X Strategy Space genre and allows you to build a colony on a Mars-like planet where you are the Engineer.\n\nTo start you select the first unlocked planet, and you are able to spin the planet to choose a good spot for planet fall. I went to the West and took a spot surrounded by mountains for mining. Meeting various benchmarks will unlock up to two more planets. It quickly becomes a challenge to keep the power up with solar cells and wind turbines, with the dark of night and frequent storms.\n\nI love the way the AI functions independently, unlike in similar games I’ve played. There’s no need to tell them what to do. They are hard-working and will tend to the mining and farming jobs you’ve set up. When they are sleepy, they take turns using the number of beds you’ve built with no input from you. Of course, since you want them to work in shifts, never provide more than one set of bunks for every 6 workers, and provide a dorm instead of private cabins. You also manage their food, morale, and recreation by providing a variety of buildings on the base for those needs.\n\nControlling the work the AI performs is as simple as clicking on a building and setting it as high priority. At first it may seem like they are ignoring your priorities, but actually they don’t have the required materials for the item you planned, so they move on to the next in the queue until you divert materials.\n\nResource management can become problematic on another planet so uninhabitable. But, lucky for us, these NASA guys have created fully salvageable materials. You are able to click on anything and recycle it for usually most all of the cost components back in metal, plastics, and spares. This makes it possible to be thrifty and recycle your mine, for example, after stacking up some ore, so you can use the scrap metal for building a factory while the ores are being worked in the processing plant. By the time the materials are outputted in the finished factory, you will have enough metal to rebuild the mine. This also helps keep your workers focused on the job at hand.\n\nThe cost of building is further facilitated by the trading system. Once you’ve built a landing pad, trading and colony ships arrive fairly frequently. You can trade for materials needed. Some traders will overcharge, but others are more competitive. Because you can recycle, you are able to sell anything not bolted down just about, and if it’s bolted down you can tear it down and sell the materials anyways. This aspect is one of the realistic elements of the game and reminds me of the ability to sell anything on hand in the “Gray Market” in the XCOM franchise, for extra building income.\n\nBut, beware of accepting colonists before your colony is fully sufficient; then never accept more than you have meals on hand. You are able to manage this from within the landing pad. You are able to build a security control center for emergencies to order all AI inside the base during bad weather.\n\nThe management system allows you full screen information on your power grid, your techs, and your progress. The buildings have a really cool video option that lets you change into full-screen video mode of the interior of the rooms. The camera controls are easy to work with providing everything but a vertical axis camera, which is really a minor disappointment because you can’t see enough of the sky. I accommodate for this shortcoming by centering the camera above a mountain to see more of the sky dome.\n\nGraphics & Audio:\nThe graphics consist of a single map of the planet you are on, and you are unable to move more than a set distance from your base. But, the map changes with a variety of weather conditions: such as meteor showers, wind storms, and solar flares. Meteors fall and destroy parts of the base and you must react by repairing and diverting power sources. Audio consists of a variety of sound effects, as well as background music that is nice to listen to while building.\n\nPros:\n* Trading variety to facilitate bargaining to best the AI traders\n*Fully recyclable resource management that is flexible & forgiving of changes\n*You can build telescopes and lasers, and bots to do all the work\n*Some battle component exists with guards, guns, and interstellar bad neighbors\n*Perma-death/ failure is offset by flexible save-loading\n*Polished mechanics & No bugs\n\nCons:\n*No Narrative – Only the sign that has your city name, and the monoliths you may build\n*No exploration of the planet\n* There are no aliens, just mining, space-farming, & building turbines, generators, solar panels, etc.\n*No vertical axis camera controls/ Can’t really appreciate the sky, more than a 20 degree angle above the horizon\n\n\nPlanetbase is a great simulation of what it would be like to build a base on Mars, in an age of interstellar travel. It is the perma-death survival game I’ve been looking for since This War of Mine. And, it shares many similar elements with that game. But, unlike other space builders, such as Spacebase DF-9, it is more user-friendly. So, I would rate it an 8/10 among games in the same genre. And I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys space builders and architectural simulations.","March 8","true","23.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Truth is, that’s exactly what it is. It’s also a ruthless test to your ability to manage resources while expanding your base and receiving visitors - good or bad.\n\nYes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.\n\nAndy Weir, The Martian\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Planetbase.\n\nGameplayFor those that aren’t familiarized with city builders, just imagine real life, but with no corruption, global warming, or religions/cultures. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Fret not, as you still have to deal with hungry/dying/angry colonists.\n\nThe goal is pretty simple, to survive. And you do that by progressively expanding your base, while keeping an eye on your resources, as well as energy and water production. I’d dare say getting the energy system working properly, which includes having enough power stored for the night, is unquestionably the most important thing in the game. Without it, you won’t be able to produce oxygen, or food, or anything. Your colonists won’t even be able to enter/exit the base.\n\nThe base itself consists on singular pods, connected by bridges, with somewhat organic positioning. There’s a big variety of pods - from dorms, to med-bays, to bio-domes and even processing plants. All of which are important to keep the base up and running. There are also a few base components that aren’t pods, such as the solar panels, the water tanks, the mines, etc..\n\nThere are five types of colonists: workers, biologists, engineers, medics and guards. Each, as you can easily guess, has a specfic job, and some are more important than others, although that’s up to the player to decide how to run the base, and therefore choose the number of each type of colonist that the base should have.\n\nAs mentioned before, there are tourists, invaders and traders. They all come by ship, some bigger than others, depending on the landing zone. New colonists also come by ship, on a colonists ship, while tourists come on visitors ships, and traders on trading ships. Invaders, however, like to be special, meaning they’re sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that come on either the colonist or the visitor ship.\n\nOnce the basics are learned, and a good startup facility is built, the gameplay becomes entirely based on being able to sustain the prodcution cycle, while expanding the base and defeating invaders, serving tourists, helping crews in danger and trading some resources for new technology or even other resources.\n\nAfter mastering resource collection and the architectural side of the game, there are a few other things to take into consideration, like oxygen production and the disasters. Oyxgen production is quite important, obviously, and it’s important to make sure there’s also enough oxygen for the current number of colonists and a few more, as the visitors also count.\n\nThen, come the disasters. Disasters can be, literally, spotted from miles away, with the correct equipment. Although the word makes it sound bad, disasters can actually be a good thing, if the player wants it to be, as they can be a great source of energy, or even a great help when being attacked.\n\nOh, and there’s meteors! Did I forget to mention those?\n\nWhat to expectAnyone that likes city builders can expect some good hours of fun with Planetbase. Even after learning the basics and being able to easily set up a base, the random events can easily disrupt the plan, adding to the challenge. There’s a total of three planets to colonize, all of which have their own specific characteristics.\n\nIt’s also important to mention that the Madruga Works team was, and still is, very active on the forums, taking notes of suggestions, even implementing some of them, as well as quickly correcting bugs reported by the community.\n\nWhat not to expectDespite its extremely addictive and enjoyable gameplay, Planetbase won’t be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, which are, as you’ve probably guessed by now, a mere drop in the vast ocean of good things it has to offer. Micromanagement is also somewhat/completely neglected, as it’s impossible to control one single character, or prioritise a single piece of equipment/production.\n\nVerdictWorth Purchasing. From the get go I could feel Planetbase would be extremely enjoyable. I wasn’t wrong.\n\nNoteFor those that want some sort of comparison, imagine Banished in space, with the addition of “disasters”, tourists and invaders. Let’s not forget robots, too.\n\nReview copy provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","October 16, 2015","true","18.4"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","44","64","2","1"

I had a ton of fun initially. However the worker AI, unit aquisition system, and UI makes this game so frustrating to play past a certain point.\n\nI like the idea of working on base expansion while trying to survive against the elements of a foreign planet but with each natural disaster it only brings to light just how little control you have over your base.\n\nI'd like to see some sort of system in place where I could give explicit direction to each type of worker or even each individual worker. When you have a medic going to pick up ore while people are dying instead of making medical supplies, you know there is an issue. Also, when a unit is working on a task or replenishing a certain stat, they just randomly decide to stop for no reason and go do something else. No explanation, and often with no specific direction.\n\nAlso, it seems like unit aquisition is very arbitrary and random. I understand that the game requires you to adjust the percentages for an ideal balance, but with no idea when a future colony ship is coming nor what class it might contain, it's almost impossible to properly strategize when reacting to disasters. I had a meteor slip through my laser network and hit a sleeping quarters where most of my biologists were asleep in bunks. All dead. My 85 person colony starved in 2-3 game days. I couldn't give my remaining biolgists accurate instructions to maintain food production.\n\nNot to nitpick but the UI really needs some work and the camera system is a little wonky. I could get over some the camera issues but having to page through UI menus each time in order to set threat alerts or even find out how much of a resource I have just feels so unwieldy. A resource overlay seems like an easy fix as well as a hotkey system.\n\nI'd really love to give this a thumbs up. I really would. This could be such a great game with a great premise.\n\nThere's just so many things wrong with the AI/UI that it can't justify it. Once you get past the initial novelty, it's unplayable.\n\nLooking forward to a patch/update.....","October 17, 2015","false","17.1"," 48 of 72 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","48","72","0","0"

The excitement rises in the colony ship as you are on an orbital standby circling over and over this new planet to find the right spot to build your new outpost. Are you ready to land?\n\nPlanetbase is a Strategy/Builder City/Survival type of game in space, where you have to successfully build a new colony on a remote planet. At the start, you have to select where you want your colony ship to land. Then you will meet your team of colonists, which is composed of 7 people (3 workers, 2 biologists, an engineer and a doctor) and 2 bots. The colony ship will have in its cargo a limited amount of supplies, so you will need to build the most important structures first. Solar panel, water extractor and the main one will be the Oxygen Generator. Even a doctor can’t really help if you running out of oxygen! Then, you have to find the right balance between the food chain, parts and buildings supplies to make sure not only your colonist don’t die of starvation (I seem to be rather good at it) and can still build or repair structures. Within some structures you build, you will have to decide what to put in it. For example, when you build a Bio-dome, which is where you will be able to cultivate vegetables, you will have to choose what you want to grow in it, but you will be limited by space. A large building will have more floor space than a medium.\n\nDo not forget to build a landing pad so you can trade valuable resources but also get more people to your outpost when it is self-sufficient. By self-sufficient I mean this; for your current number of people, if you let too many new colonists in too soon, you might beat me in the death by starvation contest!\n\nApart from that, you will have to endure the harsh conditions of the planet and will face sand storms and meteor showers.\n\nThis is not an easy game, to say the least, and I would strongly recommend going through the tutorial which will give you a really good understanding of the game and its components.\n\nThe graphics are very good and the game runs properly.

And some people wish it had more replayability, more complexity, or more variety across worlds (a single strategy - with a few tweaks - will carry you through all four worlds). However. I still really love this game, even though I kind of agree with these complaints.\n\nYou see, Planetbase scratches my builder game itch in a way that other games don't. The balance between resource production and resources sinks (food > people's tummies, resources > spares > repair things, and so on) is wound really tight and you always feel a little like you're walking a tightrope where it's possible to ignore a feature of your base and have everything go disastrously wrong.\n\nNothing in Planetbase is pointless complexity, nothing feels wasted in the design of the systems, everything is interwoven neatly and multiple dependencies run across the resource systems. The end result is a game that responds to your decisions in decisive ways. You won't ever be wondering what thing you tweaked an hour ago that messed up your game up now, it all becomes clear as everything goes wrong!\n\nIs it a really deep simulation full of complex and arcane production chains? No. Does it take a while to master? Not particularly, although you will lose your first few games. Does it have a lot of replayability? No, not especially. But I've got 40 hours out of it so far and I've really enjoyed it. It's really worth a look. And if you want to see the difficulty of the final planet, check out my Storm Planet playlist below!\n\n_________\n\nI've been playing Planetbase for a few weeks due to getting into the beta and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. The game looks great with detailed buildings an environments, is extremely stable, and very compelling. The core concept should be obvious - build and manage a base on an alien world, however where this game excels is in how it makes you walk a very tight line balancing the resource consumption and production of your colonists.\n\nLet me explain - many builder games are hard for the first thirty minutes but once you've got everything up and running you can snowball to success without any problems - this is definitely NOT the case in Planetbase. You need to carefully balance the workforce in your colony and their outputs until quite late in the game in order to ensure you don't run out of vital materials required for repairs, or healing your team, or keeping your people safe. This makes for a tense, fun and challenging experience. I highly recommend this game to fans of the builder genre.\n\nAnyway, I've put up a video with some tips for new players that provides an ideal build order and gives lots of suggestions for making it through the early game intact! Enjoy!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV8u2BeaT74\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7iwQsYQsQ&list=PLCymfyavV-yNzZzGqahxdYLhFNAiHie8u","October 17, 2015","true","52.8"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocLazy/recommended/403190/","DocLazy","DocLazy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocLazy/","156 products in account","Unfortunately, Planetbase is another example in a long series of half-baked Unity releases that look good in screenshots but are lacking in the game play department. In short Planetbase is like Banished in space. Just with out any of the depth or the love that went into the making of Banished and with a buggy frustrating AI.\n\nWhile it starts off ok but after you've built the first 8 or so domes you've reached the end of the tech tree, after that it's just expansion. Which is where the cracks in the AI start to show and gets progressively worse as your base grows. In my case the AI literally started running around in circles between two points outside of my base. Aside form actual bugs the AI also struggles with resource distribution. Strange things will start happening as your base gets larger, like random occasional deaths from starvation as the AI fails to find food. Even though there is a very healthy food surplus and a nice even distribution of canteens that they should never be too far away from.\n\nThe other problem is the game poorly comunicates the colonists needs. It's a bit of a guessing game figuring out what they need and if what you have to supply those needs is adequate. For example I had an incident where colonists were dying from dehydration. Which made no sense as the water dispensers were hardly being used. It took me a while to figure out what was going on. It appears to be a problem with the AI again as there appeared to be plenty of water fountains going unused. However, adding in more water fountains fixed the problem... shrug.\n\n","October 17, 2015","false","11.2"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","37","54","0","0"

Good graphics.

People will starve to death carrying around a box of food even if standing next to an open dining table.  It seems that this problem gets worse as your base gets bigger, and you get more colonists.  The "alert" system and random disasters are coupled in a very poor way, oftentimes even with ample warning you won't be able to get your colonists to do what you need.\n\nUltimately, however, the fatal flaw is lack of depth.  No upgrades to equipment stations, and a production system that maxes out at two layers deep, and then only for making robots, everything else is one layer deep (bots are ore -> metal -> semiconductors -> bots, everything else is, for example ore -> metal -> spare parts).  Spare parts are a constant thorn in your side, because you can't ever stockpile them for some reason.   This game would be an amazing game if it only had more structures and a tech tree, and the colonists were not prone to random starvation or dehydration even with ample resources available.\n\nThe bottom line:  Keep an eye on this game, in three-four content patches it might be worth it.\n\nYou'd like this if you like:  Utopia, If you liked The Spacials but thought the combat got annoying.","October 20, 2015","false","6.0"," 53 of 83 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","53","83","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/403190/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Planetbase is a fantastic little 'city builder', with minor survival elements, set in space. Your aim is to control a small group of colonists and help them to build a habitable self-sustaining base on an uninhabited planet.\n\nYou start with a handful of colonists, a couple of robots and some supplies such as metal and food to get you started. Since your colonists only have spacesuits with limited oxygen, you better get building quick. The tutorial is smooth and in-depth and it walks you through what you need to know about surviving without giving away too much and ruining your ability to try new things your way.\nThere are three planets which range in difficulty of which two are locked. You can unlock the more difficult planets by completing 'milestones' or challenges on the first planet. These range from Surviving one day to having 300 colonists. Once you've picked your planet you can name you base and the game begins.\n\nPlanetbase seems quite hard at first, I killed off my first group of colonists in 4 minutes because I rushed to build larger buildings instead of the basics but after restarting I quickly learnt from my previous mistakes and was able to keep them alive for a whole day. Once you realise the needs of your colonists and how to manage your resources without overbuilding everything comes together nicely. Managing your power, oxygen and water levels is your main goal at first, then you'll want to start expanding your base and building mines for ore, bio-domes to generate food, labs for research and pseudo-meat production and much more. You can build a launch pad so other colonists can join you which they will as you start to build bigger and better things.\nWhilst building your base you can also manage the percentage of your colonists doing specific tasks (producing food, building, guards, ect) adding a nice little micromanagement element to it and allowing you to feel more in control of what is going on. You can also change production levels giving you full control over making sure your resources are never depleted fully\nThe graphics of the game are very beautiful with a lot of attention to detail, however the interface is very very basic looking. Everything is just a little green square with a symbol.\n\nPlanetbase is similar to Banished in the fact that starting out can be very difficult and once you make a big mistake it's often too late to fix it by the time you realise. I find this very enjoyable as I am careful with each of my resources and have to think about what is the most important room to build with what I have rather than just placing one of every room and leaving my colonists to do the rest.\n\nThere are some negatives to the game, though none of them are too bad. It would have been nice to have a pause button without having to press escape. I appreciate that the default speed is already quite slow but when I start a new game like this I want to browse all the building types at my own pace without the game progressing without me. I also found the random meteor showers a bit problematic at first. In my first two attempts at playing I lost 2 colonists in the first 10 minutes in one, and a newly built room in my second. I think it'd be better if random events like that didn't happen on your first day or so on the lower difficulty to give new players a chance. One last little grievance is dead end rooms (certain rooms can only be built off of one other room meaning it increases walking time when colonists are travelling through he base). I don't think there is any real point to this and it does end up slightly limiting your freedom in base building.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable but difficult game, so if you enjoyed Banished then you'll enjoy this as they have the same punishing but rewarding game style. Planetbase is one of the better base-building games out there and is a must buy when on sale if you enjoy this genre.","March 7","true","16.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

The key word here is "simple". The thing is, once you manage to build basic buildings to gather resources - you have won. From this moment your only need is to have enough energy and food. In other words, when the early-game ends and the mid game starts - thats it, you won.\nAnother thing I don't like about this game is lack of personality: noone is lazy/hardworking, noone needs socialisation, everyone likes to watch TV/hang on horizontal bar. People are basically clones, except for their job (worker, biologist, engineer, doctor, guard). Everyone can continue each others unfinished work. Noone is high/low-ranking. The only thing personal for humans in this game is a bed.\nIronically there are about 15 food variants and if you won't have variety in food your people would get sick.\n\nPros:\n-Nice concept\n-OK graphic\n-Easy to learn, entertaining to explore\n-Can be challenging on high difficulties, due to randomness\n\nCons:\n-Can be easy on high difficulties, due to randomness\n-Extremely dumb AI\n-Buildings limit (really?!

Have I mentioned this before?\n\nObvious buildings missing:\n-Toilets\n-Tunnels through mountains\n-Different social acitvities\n-Personal space (building with several rooms for one person each)\n\nA word about AI:\nI would not recommend this game to slow computers, since there are lots of problems with humans and bots constantly forgetting to go back to base and dying of oxygen lack, unless you have a good patience - this can be fixed with saving, quiting to main menu and loading your game. Such problem is regular. The similar bug with people forgetting to deliver items to trader can be fixed in the same manner.\n\nUpdated review 20.03.2016:\nThe problem with AI has been fixed.

I love the visual style and the games has a lot of potential. Here are the problems:\n\n1a.  Colonist AI needs A LOT of work. There gets to be a point where the colonists get depressed and only get out of bed long enough to hit up the canteen or the bar, then go back to bed. Which is fine until all your Biologists start doing it at the same time and your entire colony starves to death. (Maybe I shouldn't keep naming my colony Miranda!?)\n1b.  Producing to 99%. Colonists will work a project (i.e. refining ore, creating vitromeat, building spares, etc.) until it's nearly complete and move onto something else. And very potentially (read: commonly) never come back to it.\n1c. The sceenic route. The coloists will take the longest path possible every time, Airlocks abound and they take the one furthest from the module they need to get to or exterior worksite they are destined for.\n2. Random event generator needs a little work. It random, really random, annoyingly random. Which is fine for a simulator, but a city builder/strategy game should have a little bit more consistancy.\n3. Only one "stragey". There is only one successfuly build path out of the initial game, there after it's a game of ratios which is where the entertainment ends. Moreover if you play the tutorial you're given the stategy, so really you're just clicking through the motions.\n\nThings I recommend as quick fixes to outright issues:\n\n1. Automate refinery projects. Require a Biologist/Engineer to start them but remove the need for their continued oversight.\n2. Instantainous trade. Colonists occasionally starve to death while a trading ship full of food waits for their payment to be delivered by a bot/colonist taking the long way round the planet! Sometimes, it's even the colonist carrying the payment that dies. >.<\n\nGiven some more work this game could be amazing. Just not right now.

It has some unique play mechanics people don't seem to grasp quick enough and start blaming it on the AI or bad development, which is not the case.\n\nIt takes time to figure it out and I would strongly advice any new players to play the tutorial and watch some youtube videos, because it's really hard to do right if you don't get the AI.

Devs started patching right away, after players started complaining.\n\n-Cons: Not a lot of replayability value, once you have built a base on all three planets, that's basically all you can do - start over. There is no global part, that lets you connect your bases and actually colonize the whole planet.  Some parts of the game are unrealistic, when it comes to malnutrition and deaths based on lack of food variety and thing like that. That's where the AI could be improved, which the devs are doing constantly.\n\nBesides that I can absolutely recommend this game, if you like to try something new and are a big sci-fi fan, such as I am, go for it!

In Planetbase, you first start out with a handful of colonists and bots with respective profession and duties. Your primary job is to create a self-sufficient colony to sustain your population and gradually improve and expand your colony to support increasing colonists and visitors. In such a dire condition, your survivability depends on your management skills and strategic thinking.\n\nGameplay\nDespite being a colony building game, Planetbase did not fail to deliver stunning graphics with amazing clarity. The texture and shadow is exceptionally well-done. The game is designed down to the smallest detail, for example, the beautiful and starry night sky can be seen reflected on Solar Panel. The UI is great, the menu is easy to use and only allocates a small space. Besides that, there is a notification system which will alert you when there are surfacing issues such as the death of colonist, a sandstorm, etc.  Oh, by the way, you might want to watch out for meteors. As an impatient person, I enjoy the fast forward feature very much. The game will revert to its normal speed when an issue occurs which I found either annoying or helpful at times.\n\nThere are 4 planets to choose from with increasing difficulty and different conditions. Choose the location of your base wisely, the geometrical factor will affect the expansion of your colony. Besides that, Planetbase offers a respectable type of buildings ranging from solar panels to wind turbine to processing plants. Each and every building plays an important role in the development of the colony and the production chain. One thing that I absolutely love about the game is the ability to place various equipments in the buildings. For example, you may place a water dispenser in the Canteen (Should have probably used a cooler example...)\n\nAs mentioned, management skills is compulsory for a successful colony. During the later stage, you may construct Starports and Landing Pads to welcome colonists, traders and visitors. Hence, you would need to carefully manage the colonist immigration flow to ensure you have the people with the right skills. Terrorist would start to appear gradually as your prestige increases, those ****** would disguise as colonist or visitors, so be extremely cautious. This game encourages a strategic mindset, it makes you think twice before doing carrying out an action or building. You will most certainly ask yourself if placing a certain building at that location lengthen the time of processing a certain material.\n\nPros Stunning and Breathtaking-graphics\nEasy and Straight to Point UI\nVariety of Infrastructures and Raw Resources\nAchievements and Trading Cards\nCons AI Seems to be Stupid At Times - When linking multiple buildings into a triangle-shape link, the engineer would get trapped in the middle after it is done and is unable to get out. You can only choose to destroy one of the connections or let him die. I obviously chose the latter.\n\nInefficient trading system - You can only exchange one item at a time or 10 if holding down shift. It’s a pain when you wish to trade in a big batch or pay for expensive items. Besides that, we don’t have the ability to charge commissions like traders.\n\nUnrealistic Technology - You purchase technologies (at a high price) rather than researching them. Technologies like GM Veggies mentioned that “It will kill you” or something along those lines is kinda taunting. What is the point of purchasing something expensive that you will never and can’t use?(I still use it anyways)\n\nUnable to Build Multiple Colonies - I really did wish that I can build separate colonies all in one planet where colonist may visit each other instead of linking everything together.\nFinal Thoughts / Result\nAs a HUGE fan of colony-building games, I would say that Planetbase is one of the best out there. Many people said that it’s hard but you’ll manage after a few retries. Hopefully, the developers would add choices for guns and include aliens as well! But as for now, it’s time for me to continue my 9-hour Planetbase streak.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 10","true","25.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","3"

This is basically a Banished I can get behind. Banished in Space is the most simple way of describing it but honestly I feel like it's a more balanced, interesting experience. To start off, you have a few starting resources which you use to become sustainable, essentially you're not dead. By mining new resources, processing and growing crops, you build up enough resources to start expanding your base. Eventually you'll have a town (of sorts) where traders and new colonists will regularly visit. Personally, I find the survival portions of the game to be the most fun as the challenge is intense. You never know if a stray meteorite is going to ruin all your efforts or if you forget to close the airlocks of your base during a sandstorm, colonists can stray outside which can lead to their deaths. It's fun and requires heavy micromanagement. The concepts are simple but the right formula for survival will keep players on their toes.

It does have its share of flaws, and it's by no means perfect nor is it something that I think everyone would enjoy.  The AI is probably its most glaring weakness: your colonists are incompetent and their bots are about the same.  Colonists frequently starve themselves simply due to other colonists having actions queued from the other side of the base, or because they're waiting in line to deliver goods to a trade ship, or because they've ignored the fact that they're dying of thirst since they have a construction task at the opposite end of your base from the nearest water fountain.\n\nWhile the AI does leave an awful lot to be desired, games that take a relatively realistic approach to planetary colonisation and resource management are a very rare breed, and despite a couple missteps I still think it's a fun, challenging game with an awful lot on offer if you're a fan of base building.\n\nGo nuts with this one, it's pretty rad.","October 25, 2015","true","13.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I've heard complaints about people with the AI, but I've not experienced much of it. For the most part, its been pretty predictable or at the very least, semi-logical.\n\nOne legitimate complaint I have is that its moderately narrow in terms of the player's creativity (some would say "player agency").

(kinda like a Mass Effect tune to it)\n\nNice graphical aesthetic: The three planets give the lovely feel of being in separate environments. Each of the three stand out in looks and are not pallet swaps of the desert planet.  (The moon is still my favourite as it gives a nice view of the ring gas giant) The base buildings are a bit bland, but does have cool parts to it, like the meteor lasers for instance.

They will address their needs before completing their jobs, although sometimes they take this priority a little too high at times.\n\nDecent feedback: The game provides a sufficient amount of info when it comes to your base.  It is just enough to figure out what to do to maintain moral and survival.\n\nGame is tough, but fair: It get's hard at first when starting up, but with enough practice, you can have a thriving base of high moral and survivability.\n\nThe Bad parts:\n\nCreativity is pretty shallow in comparison to other $20 base building games (Banished): There is little, if any freedom to rotate, well ANYTHING. The only thing that rotates is the warpy view camera.  You can rotate buildings, sort of, when you click on a new building, look at it before you click to build, and then cancel it and load the same building again in hope it's in the right direction you wanted. (Good luck with wasting several hours at that with no pause time button.)\n\nComponents cannot be rotated, they are destined to be built in whatever slot the building has. If the meal maker, for example,  is placed in one area, then it has to face in one direction only and cannot be turned unless you move it to another slot in the building.   (Creativity takes another hit.)\n\nThere are not many buildings as there should be, and some buildings don't have much components in them to suit the name of said building. For instance, the bar, and what a shallow bar it is.  Tables, drink machines, tele's and....that's it, no pool tables, dart boards, card tables, or anything entertaining. That's a very boring bar for visitors, I guess people are not picky in the future.\n\nSome buildings can be pointless if you've building enough moral boosters.  Pro Tip guys: If you've build cabins, a bar, and have mixed meals, the people will never, if ever use the multipurpose room, unless you've build it in the path towards the bar, then maybe they will use it. But then again, if the bar works, why would you waste the space on the multipurpose room?\n\nCamera View is warped: Your base might look nice from one view, but once you move the camera or rotate it, the warped view makes it so you can't tell if your lines are straight or not.  If you're like myself, that wanted to build an effective base to look like a crescent, or the moon, well good luck with that because the camera will never show you whether or not your connections are straight or not.\n\nNo pause time button: That's right guys and gals, you can slow down time to 1x, but you cannot stop it.  My guess is because the lazor and meteor system glitches when it paused, so they had to minimize that effect.  So have fun starting your base and trying to place the buildings in the right places you want while everyone is running out of oxygen.  Take deep breaths colonists!\n\nAI priority system is currently flawed:  Like I said before, the production chains work eventually. Despite the fact that I had the right food to get the good recipes created, the AI will keep trying to make basic meals until their long-term pathing is finished, and then it will start bringing the right food to the meal makers.\n\nWhen it comes to transporting goods to the trade ship, currently, it is so important that it takes priority OVER everything else including survival.  Despite the constant times I had the priority icon activated over buildings, the colonists (ESCPECIALLY THE BRAINDEAD BIOLOGITSTS) drops all of their work to bring a lot of goods to the ship.  By the time it was done, people were now scrambling to get food to the meal makers, because nobody bothered to be on food duty.  This wouldn't be a problem if there was a building and workers that specialize in trading, like Banished for example.  That way, they will worry about the goods, while the rest of the base does their jobs.\n\nNot enough info for food:  It nice to know the game tells me how much vegetables and meat I have. I kind of wished I knew how much of each vegetable I had, that way I can refine my trading of vegetables, and not hope the AI accidently gives away all of the mushrooms instead of the excess wheat I had.  (Banished did this better.)\n\nFood production need refining:  If you're going to have a long list of recipes for food, then we need at least a button or two on the meal makers, that way the AI, buggy or not, will at least bring the right food to the makers to get the right meals out. I shouldn't have to wait for the AI to have a clue.\n\nMeteor Lasers are less effective than they should be: *Engineer looks at a rock going towards a mountain a mile away*"JESUS, IT'S COMING RIGHT AT US!!!!!" *fires laser* "Whew, crisis averted." *Meteor crashes on large bio dome, killing 8 biologists* M-M-M-MONSTER KILL-KILL-KILL-KILL....\n\nLasers at times hit the right rocks, but more often than not, they will aim for rocks that are miles away.  You have to build more lasers to compensate, but I kind of wish the aiming was fixed.\n\nBarely any HOT KEYS for building: As far as I know, there are only 2 keys: one for external, and one for Internal buildings.  So have fun mousing over button to get things built in a pinch as the time ticks down.  (Little to any hot keys for a base builder is very lousy in 2015, heck, it would've been unheard of back in the Warcraft 90's. Again, Banished did it better.)\n\nRandom meteors my butt, Rock God is out to get me:  I'm guessing since there are little disasters in this game, the developers had to make up for it with meteor deaths.  I would say they're random, but either I have the lousiest luck in the world, or the rocks were made to aim for the most populated areas possible. (Bio dome and bunks for example) Hope you like save scumming, because at times you will do it more than your X-Com play though.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still had fun with the game, but I've found the more I played, the more my creative fun was spoiled with these glaring issues.  If you still want to get it, wait a few months to see if they fix  the problems at the very least and hopefully when they let modders go at it, a number of these issues will be dealt with and the game will be more "finished" then they claimed it is.  (Oh the reason I mentioned Banished a lot is because it's a counter point to the lousy and weak "it's a $20 game blah blah blub blah" excuse.)\n","December 29, 2015","false","505.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

It is still being actively worked on by the devs (as of DEC 2015) and continues to improve with each new version they release. The movie/book The Martian comes to mind when, from the trailer the key character says, well in order to survive we are going to need to "Science the $#!T out of this!"; yes, that is a fitting quote =)\n\n* What happens at the start | setting?\n\nYou set down on the first world type (others may be unlocked via achievenments), a Type D, think Mars and your first colonists step down the ramp and to this new world. From there you have to move quickly to move supplies from your landing ship, in order to get power, water and air generated.  I had more than one colony die off, when first learning the ropes so I suggest you pay close attention to the tutorial. The game is fairly easy to pick up however but difficult to 'master', which is ideal IMHO.\n\n* Controls | UI\n\nAre easy to learn and laid out in a logical fashion. I really liked the fact that if you do not have access to certain functions, EG security controls, then the function key short cut simply will not pop up the menu. F2 through F8 will provide you with various easy access to the information/controls/settings that you need.  The UI itself is clean, no issues; though the sure number of buildings and items you can create may overwhelm just a bit at first.  Trust me you will adjust quickly and be asking for more stuffs! =)\n\nGraphics | Audio\n\nThe graphics are very good for this type of game and with consideration that this is an indie game from a small studio. Even when zoomed in people, structures and interiors all look quite good, if not a bit cartoonish (which I rather enjoy). As to the game sound effects, the secruity alerts can be a bit annoying. The sound effects in general however and the music are solid. The music has that perfect blend of sci-fi feel to it, without being over done.\n\n* Would you recommend this game?\n\nI absolutely do recommend this game. Even if you aren't a big sim builder person, this game has a lot to offer. If you are a fan of the genre then you need to get yourself a copy!\n\nTake care and good luck to you!\n\nIf you'd care to join me as I build Mal Base 1, you can simply head over here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJh_jnuYxujOwgpFYkJnaMYYQCgzKuHJM\n\n\n\n","December 14, 2015","true","33.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There are 3 to choose from at the moment, each with different difficulties. Some are more harsh with less sun and wind, so you can't produce as much energy with your solar panels and wind turbines, and some others might have frequent meteors.\n\nOnce your colonists land, you need to get to building. It's actually pretty intense because you need to get a lot of essential stuff going quite quickly. You need to build water extractors, a source of energy, oxygen generators, canteen, etc.\nYour different colonists have varying specialties. Biologists tend to plants, medics heal the wounded, workers can mine for minerals, and engineers can fix things up. Apart from those basic skills, each colonist can do a few more in depth things. For example, you can grow a medicinal plant, then take it to a lab and the medic will be able to create medical supplies from it.\n\nThe UI is very easy to use, and is also accompanied with some keyboard hotkeys which keeps the game from being frustrating. You can even speed up the game, which is great. There is currently no pause button, however, it's possible the devs did this deliberately to keep the game from being too easy.\n\nAs you play, you can gain milestones. They can be as simple as surviving one night, to building a large amount of things. As you achieve these, you can unlock more harsh planets to try and survive on. It keeps an overall feeling of progression, to keep you going.\n\nThere's a lot of detail managing which I won't go into, because then this review would be pages long. Some examples are supplying enough power to all your structures, attracting new colonists by keeping your colony running smoothly, building bots to work more efficiently, creating anti-meteor turrets and more.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game which I feel could easily suck you in if you typically enjoy this genre. There's a lot to do, and building up your colony is very satisfying.","October 17, 2015","true","7.8"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","22","36","0","0"

Problem is, the current AI is awful, and not letting the player direct control over the units makes it worse.\n\nIn the end, you have to learn how the AI is supposed to work and try to compesate its flaws by doing things in it's way, rather than having fun and creating the base as you wanted.

However it's incredibly shallow and consists of nothing more than a very repetetive balancing act, battling with the map you've been given to place increasingly large numbers of structures whilst hoping things pan out with your factories and such.\n\nIt's far too shallow and requires an inhuman amount of patience to deal with production misery for me to recommend this, but if you really want a game about colonising a planet, then this might do it for you.\n\nEDIT: Someone called me out on my profile for only having played just over an hour, so I'll explain why I didn't need any more time - Once you've completed the absolute bare essentials of a base which takes around 20 minutes of getting the balance right and building things in a pretty set order, the game becomes a repetetive slog of repeating the process of adding things to your base as you need them (which is sometimes difficult because the connections system is often interfered with by the terrain with no real way to understand why), there is almost no complexity to the game, I'd compare it to Banished with far less content.\n\nIn addition, simply checking your resources requires several clicks through menus, a lack of resource display on the main UI and decent hotkeys makes the game a pretty miserable experience unless you're really committed to it.\n\nEDIT 2: I guess I need to add another edit explaining why my low game time isn't a good enough reason to ignore this review. The game showed no form of complexity or advancement in the first 2 hours, if a game is incapable of getting you on the hook then that's entirely the game's fault. You can unlock the majority of the buildings you'll be using all the time within 15 minutes of starting the game, and you'll be using them so often that I got bored incredibly fast. The game doesn't go anywhere and the only thing you've got to worry about is randomly having your life made even harder by one of the "disasters" which amount of having to spend more time alt tabbed out waiting for things to be repaired.\n\nThe game is as shallow as a puddle, there's simply no reason to play this over one of the many other far more interesting citybuilding games which have far more freedom and a lot more content. Quite why people are attacking me and coming to this game's defense so quickly - smells very fishy to me.","October 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 133 of 247 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","133","247","10","4"

I mean they're the core of the game, so if they are performing poorly, then you're done for\n- The replayibility may be dull, no random generated planets or anything\n- The "challenges" may seem fun and difficult to play with (solar flares, different weather conditions per planet) but these get really old very quickly no matter how you approach them into achieving a grand colony\n- The UI looks like a UI from an alpha build from the early 2000's. It needs an overhaul\n- To get a good colony going, you have to set up a base almost the same way everytime\n\nThere are many more downsides which I will not mention because I wanted to address the most important aspects of the game\n\nSo to conclude, it has so much potential and so many hours of entertainment (yes I have only 9 but I can see how it is down the road). It is a great game, similar to Banished.\n\nWhat may sway my decision in the future (to recommend this game) is if the above aspects of the game are improved, fixed, etc.\n\nDon't forget about Steam's refund policy.

Double-check the policy.\n\nEDIT 11/18/15: As I've played last night and the devs commented on this today, the AI has been improved a lot, however I don't think that's enough to sway my decision to recommend this.

We have all seen the city builders before but not too many attempt to do it on an alien planet. It intrigues. Imagine all the different sorts of problems you will encounter trying to sustain a colony on a foriegn planet. But sadly this game falls short of the mark.\n\nYou have basic resources in the game for building, sustaining day to day life, and meeting more advanced needs of the colony. Your basic building blocks are metal and bioplastic. Metal is a refined product from mining as bioplastic is a refined product from vegetation which is grown in your biolab. Food is also grown and synthesized. You can grow a plant when refined makes a medical kit of sorts to heal your colonists. You can make a modular part in a more advanced factory which is used to generally repair everything.\n\nYour colonists themselves have basic needs they will seek to meet. Hunger, sleep, hydration, moral, and such. They seek these needs out through the various structures and subsystems inside the structures you build. There are different types of colonists and each one fulfills a specific role. Engineers, biologists, workers, medics, and guards. This all sounds good, right?\n\nThe problem comes in implementation. You have control over what is built. You can put in all the pieces for a sustainable colony. The problem is the colonists. They do not do their jobs. I sat and watched them for a couple hours experimenting with their behavior. I built a large solar array which I knew I did not have enough metal for. I was one metal short. I had all the pieces in place to make the metal. I had all the resources in abundance to make the metal. So naturally the AI would, as a consequence would make a piece of metal considering I had the material, facilities, and adaquate labor force in place. I watched for about 15 minutes. Sometimes they would go to the metal machine for a few moments then leave. Most times the AI when not eating and sleeping or carrying items, didn't do anything. They would mill about as if confused. I have seen colonists starve to death milling around when there was a lot of food. I tried building multiple food stations. I've used the "prioritize" button. In short, to put it in basic vernacular, the game sucks major ♥♥♥. In the future any game with this developers name on it should be viewed with suspician and contempt.\n\nIn short you can do everything right and sit there frustrated because the thing you cannot control simply doesn't work at all or works poorly (taking 40 minutes to make 1 piece of metal) The behavioral AI in this game is simply dog excrement. And there is no way anyone is stupid enough to release this and not know. So what you have is a dishonest game company looking to screw over Joe consumer selling them what they know is a poor product. It is a bad game with a good idea. The fact that they released it as is says this will be as good as it gets. Look for some empty vague promises and some hand waving if they even do that.\n\nI do not understand how people can give this game a positive review when it so clearly doesn't deserve it. I can only surmise they gave out free copies to people in exchange for a positive review. Either than or people like broken games.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You have been warned.","October 18, 2015","false","6.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

It's ruined by its catastrophic AI.\nThe game would be quite enjoyable if it weren't ruined by a stupid AI. Why does nobody construct the new solar panel I placed a long time ago, despite frequent power shortages? How can we fix the oxygen problem if nobody wants to build the oxygen plant that was planned for ages? Why does none of the starving colonists even care about producing food?\n\nIn theory you can place structures to fix problems, but actually you have to rely on a bunch of morons to construct them. And sometimes, despite all building materials being available, the morons just don't feel like doing their job because they prefer to chill out or to do insignificant tasks like carrying a box to the storage.\n\nThere isn't even a way to define a construction as priority or to send a minion explictely to a certain task. You just have to rely on the good will of your minions - in other words, on luck.\n\nAlso, the game lacks basic indicators like oxygen or power consumption or available building materials. And you can't even remap the keyboard - you know, there are actually people living outside the U.S. - which should be standard for a PC game.\n\nI'm desinstalling the game and classifying it as "loss of money".","October 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","2"

Its a slow methodical game that requires you to keep everything in balance if you want your colony to grow. The three planets each offer different variations on the same theme with different starting conditions. They each have their own environmental issues to deal with as well. For example the third planet which is a moon that has no atmosphere means you will be relying on solar power. The second planet has a dense atmosphere that light doesnt penetrate very well so its wind energy.\n\nThe game has a way of throwing you curve balls right when you don't want it to causing you to make sudden changes to what you are doing to adapt, if you fail to do so a colony that was thriving that you spent a couple of hours on can literally be rendered unsustainable within a few seconds if you don't have what you need when something bad happens such as a sudden solar flare or armed intruders enter your base and you have no armed guards to fight them and they proceed to gun down all of your workers or biologists.\n\n\nFun game, easy to get into and widdle the hours away tweaking things and watching your colonists do their thing under your iron fist.\n\n\nCouple of A.I. issues in the colonists that I have noticed, just minor annoyances in their priorities as they go about doing their thing. Other then that. Solid game.\n\nIf you are interested in this kind of game set in a sci-fi/futurists setting then pick it up. I have easily gotten my money's worth out of it.

To trade the players colonists have to travel with the resources they are willing to trade in a vehicle which at first is supplied by the players colonist ship but is inefficient and better vehicles can be crafted later in the game. The colonies can be either friendly or hostile. If hostile the starting crew of the player will include soldiers equipt with laser weapons. If war is declared the two colonies will fight untill one either submits to the other or is destroyed. If a planet has a peaceful colony the player can attack the colony and annex the base to their own along with a selection of resources and enhabitants (alien or human) that will submit to them. Their could be multiple colonies on one planet and they could all wage a war or be peaceful. I personally think this could increase the difficulty and strategies of the game rather than it being a build it game.\n\nI also feel a new planet with earth like atmosphere could be implimented with other power sources such as hydroelectric or geothermal.\n\nI think power should be more manageable along with more events in the games.","May 1","true","9.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You have to build the basics to stay alive: an O2 generator, power sources, food etc. And it builds from there - medical bay, dorm, processing plants, bar...\n\nIt's beautifully simple in its design and it's incredibly addictive. It's also brutal - a bit of bad luck and bad timing and you can cause a chain reaction that kills everyone. For example: run out of spares? No problem - there'll be a trade ship along soon. Except just then, your wind turbine breaks, meaning your power storage starts draining, meaning you won't have enough power to last you through the night. The power out, the O2 generator stops working. And everyone slowly starts to asphyxiate. Just hope that the morning's light won't be blocked by a dust storm and will power up the solar panels enough for everyone to not die.\n\nIt's stuff like that. I've also seen some flat out weird stuff - I'm not sure if it's a glitch or a delightfully morbid game design thing, but one day one of my medics just decided he'd had enough and wandered out into the wilderness and just kept going, off the screen and presumably to his death like "nope. I am so done."\n\nIt's not perfect, however - you can't directly control the settlers or give them orders. The AI is pretty good but not perfect, so I've seen Workers who are so hungry that they're nearly dead keep on loading supplies into a ship (even though there's food nearby) to the point that they die of starvation rather than just eating and loading the supplies later. Wat. Also I've played it for 34 hours and while I've only done the first planet it does feel like I've explored all the rooms the game has to offer.

But for any thing other than that I would say don't waste your money. At the time of writing this the latest patch "Improves the AI's 'self preservation'". Does it really?\n\nFirst my workers ignored the "high prioity" set metal prossers with 3 ore a piece in them to make the steel needed to make more spare parts. When they finaly made the parts to fix the power producers.\nI just watched as 3 wind turbines fail in the middle of the night 2 seconds before a sandstom (which could have changed the entire outcome if at least one had been fixed). The "AI*" right before that decided the solar pannals that where NOT EVEN BEING USED AT THE TIME where more of a prioity to repair.\nThis FAIL in proper "AI*" priorization caused all power to be lost and the O2 levels droped to zero killing every one.\n\nThe "AI*" in this game is a joke. The only way I could see this game is "What happens when the dumbest idiots try to populate a new planet".\n\nEdit: After further game time the above still stands but with an exception. There is no build queue for the colonists (at least at the moment) so you are forced to build one thing at a time. Or it can end up being the total death of your settlement. If you like to place a bunch of buildings all at once, then you must have the resources to build them all at once. The AI in this game will try to build every structure at once. Unlike in some other 'city builder' games, where the AI focuses on constructing the set buildings in the order they are placed.\n\nAt the current time of writing this, that function is not in play. Though if you (the reader) can use the 'work around' and/or don't mind that 'rule', the game might be for you.\nI, do however find it a bit annoying and can not in good conscience recommend this title until that feature is a part of the game.","March 17","false","94.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","9"

But its like its not completed yet. It has really few building (aka dome) types. I said buildings but actually there are no buildings in this game just domes. If we could upgrade our domes to buildings it would be much better.\n\nAnother topic is what we do on that planet. Our goal is buiding a colonial base site on the planet and survive. Thats cool. But we could do more. For example there is unlivible atmosphere on the planet so we could do something about that. Maybe not for the whole planet maybe just for a small part of it with much much more bigger dome or something. With that building thing can work. Because if we can do that we wont be need another dome to live.\n\nOkay lets move on. We have three different planets. I did not play the second and third planet. Because i dont wanna do the same things over and over again. Maybe it ll be harder than the first planet  but i ll do the same things in general. So why should i play those planets too? Because of the solar flares, or freezing cold different visual of the planet or something? No those are not good reasons. I need more differences. New dome types new bots new specialists maybe. A commander for example for the guards. Different plants with different effects (real effects). A dumpster a graveyard a school. Kids, families. More importantly A HOSPİTAL. Those people are living on those planets. Show that to us.\n\nThere are still a lot of things to say but the central topic is you still have a lot of work to do.\n\nFor this price IT SHOULD BE A BETTER GAME...","October 22, 2015","false","8.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Random events such as solar flares, meteors and invaders don't excite me much and only serve to be a nuisance/distraction. Sometime it even outright kills your important starting colonist and forces you to restart several times until you get a landing pad.

Most of the problems I've found are minor, and could certainly disappear with time and patching.\n\nEven now, though, Planetbase is eminently playable, and far more fun than I expected it to be. Perhaps its greatest design acheivement is that it never slips into that "mid-game dull spot" I remember from games like Sim City, where you've acheived enough in-game that the challenge is gone.\n\nWith Planetbase, you're always trying to keep your colonists alive, thriving, and expanding in hostile planetary environments, so you can never completely call your work finished.\n\nI find the game fun and truly compelling, and would recommend Planetbase to anyone who might be interested.\n\nBe sure to play the Tutorial (maybe even a couple of times). As above, the game is simple to learn, but developing solid survival strategies will come with time and play.\n\nOh, and get yourself a second Medic on base, as soon as you're able.

Slightly more intense than Banished, but only because when things go bad, they go catastrophically bad.  It does have some serious balance issues and a few gameplay issues, though.  Production and storage of raw goods cannot be limited and will quickly fill up Storage areas, leaving little room for vital nourishment and forcing you to trade away your metals and plastics or exponentially expand (massive storage -> O2 generator -> water pump -> solar panel -> 2x batteries).\n\nAfter the first 30 colonists or so, your base expansion is fairly linear, which becomes a little tedious, but random events, such as meteors and solar flares, still require you to pay attention.  Each of the three planets has slightly different conditions, and 10 milestones for colony survival.  Of the 24 achievements, only two should take any amount of planning; the rest will mostly likely unlock during the course of completing the game.\n\nAll in all, it's fun, but not life-changing.

The next thing I knew it was 430 in the morning and I had already logged fifteen hours of gameplay. If that isn't a ringing endorsement for how addictively fun this game is, I don't know what is.\n\nThat being said, like any game there are things that could use working on. I would like to see an option to assign tasks to colonists as they can sometimes get hung up on tasks that are not necessarily a priority. Or the entire group of them will work on the same task and half could be working on another. Prioritizing the domes is a nice function, but I think that it could be expanded on.\n\nAnother nice feature would be a list of individuals in the facility, which could make assigning tasks and finding certain colonists much easier. Maybe a way to crosstrain colonists to a lesser extent. Dan is an engineer, but I've taught him how to do some basic gardening in case of emergencies and the gardening from an unskilled worker is 30% as effective or something. That way if ALL of your biologists die, you aren't entirely screwed.\n\nI would also like to see a menu similar to asking for specific colonists for trading items. Maybe just as a send out to the ships what goods you're looking for so I don't have three medical ships and none with food or spares when I need them.\n\nLast little note: There is a typo on the power management milestone :P\n\nOtherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

I have to admit I'm not a friend of strategy games but I loved it and I played a lot of times. You have to be smart creating your base and put all things needed for the new colony and welcome new colonists in future.\n\nAbout graphics and music both are awesome and well polished, especially the graphics. That's a great PRO.\n\nGameplayHere you arrive in your ship and 7 people to a foreign planet. You have to be creative and use well the ground to have all resources. You have a great tutorial, you will have to read a lot but worth it, explains everything. Keep an eye of the energy grid. be smart creating it, is the most important thing in the game and if you overload the grid you will have a lot of problems even if you reached the third milestone.\n\nOnce you have a landing platform, you will be able to receive colonists and  commerce ships. You can trade but try not to trade everything you need for a bot. Bots are useful butt very expensive. Wait a little long to trade for something expensive.\n\nI couldn't reach the "gun factory part" but you'll have bad guests and could be attacked if you have an armory. Beware of that but I think that's gonna be amazing to test.\n\nYou can pick which part of the planet you can descend, at the first one (looks like Mars) you can pick in a place with clouds, I thought that means windy and I wasn't wrong. Great for an eolic turbine.\nSomething I didn't like is that you have to reach all milestones to go to a harder planet. I understand the idea of go through higher levels but I'd like to try the hard ones sometimes and I can't.\n\nPros+ Great graphics\n+ The milestones\n+ Good ambience music\n+ Realistic concept of surviving in space\n\nCons- I can't control de personnel\n- The AI could be improved, it controls everything\n- You cannot try the harder planets until you get all milestones\n- Sometimes the colonist are in "lazy" mode when they have things to do\n\nFinal ThoughtsAs I said before, this is a great game, I started to like strategy games and this is a great example of one of them. It has some things to improve maybe. This game is a must have, really, buy it.

BUT after playing this for 6 hours straight just... ugh, this game really tries to be good but the dreadful AI is just barely tolerable and really lets this game down. The learning curve isn’t that steep but with the barely fair amount resources you start out with as well as the clumsy, super inefficient AI this game is brutally hard, stack this on top of the nightmare that is balancing every single resource in this game and your left with one tedious and frustrating experience. At times this game feels pretty decent, but then suddenly you realize how much of a chore it is when you forgot to build one more power storage and boom! it's all over... everything goes to crap, again.\n\nThis game will be a major pain in your butt for your first few play throughs, I don't know how many times I restarted and reloaded a save after who knows how many failures just to learn enough to get a base -barely- going, and I did the tutorial, I learned everything I could, but nothing can prepare you for how insanely fickle the game balance is. Got no biologists left to get food cas they all died somehow? It’s over, everyone starves. No workers left or don't have any meds to heal them so they work again but need you need workers to make plastic to make the meds in the first place? well your screwed, the game will never make any progress and it will be boring a heck. Need to make one more wind turbine but can't get enough metal cas the power keep going off stopping the workers making metal? ugh, yay, you forgot to make extra power a second ago and everything comes crashing down because of it, fun. Everything in this game relies on each other for a base to work, -everything-, if you forget to make even meds it's all over, ''but that’s the whole point of the micro management and is what makes the game interesting and challenging though!'' you might be saying, yes it is, but in this game it just feels like a joke, this has happened to me in Banished before but it generally felt like my fault in that game, in this one, I just feel cheated. The fact there is no difficulty setting to be seen is very disappointing to, so if you plan on playing this game casually then lol just don't, this game is on brutal difficulty all the time, every time. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nLast thing I’m going to go over is the AI, like everyone else that has down voted the game on the AI I also have to admit it is as dreadful as they say, it is 'barely' functional and is just so frustratingly not good at what it's supposed to be doing. Even when prioritizing room for tasks you need done badly they will roam around and go on strolls or fill up their sleep meter every 5 seconds, they seem to do everything in their power to avoid doing work to keep the base running before doing a tiny bit of work then going to fill another need cas a need bar went down alittle again, are you kidding me?! There is no way to adjust when they go to fill their needs or where they go to fill them they just go and do it when they want, I even saw a worker abandon making metal just to get afew seconds of sleep then go and eat when he really didn't need to, meaning the end of that game cas I really needed the metal to make more power. I’ve even seen workers die of hunger as others eat the last of the food cas their hunger bar went down alittle and got to the canteen first, like what!?!? there is no way to stop them from doing that either, so enjoy watching your space base of morons have no idea what they are doing. In a game where the AI is essential to the whole thing running and being fun you think the dev would have done a better job right?… it’s a shame really.\n\nI also hope your not looking for anything graphically impressive or nice to look at either cas it’s pretty below average for me, the only anti-aliasing is FXAA im pretty sure cas it does a bad job and blurs the game pretty badly. It seems to be running on Unity 4 engine tho so you can’t expect much I guess, a real shame cas I sure wish it looked as pretty as the store pics.\n\nThis is just a 5/10 for me, pretty good effort but until a major AI overhaul is done this game is just a major tedious time waster. Sorry to the devs that worked hard on this but I suggest skipping this if you have something better to do with you 20 bucks.","October 19, 2015","false","20.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

You will need to control many aspects that ensure survival like oxygen, water and energy production. You will need to grow food, mine ore, process it into metal and plastic, build sfuff, etc... Many things to do... for an hour or two gameplay maybe. Then it gets dull. The colonists are dumb and even though there are plenty of food they starve themselves to  death. No tech-tree, no developments, not many goals to achieve. Once the colony grows you will only need to routinely add essential facilities. When your colony is attacked by intruders it gets more exciting but since you cannot control anything except issuing a red alert signal it still gets dumb.\nNo nuclear power - a rather dubious choice of techs - only solar and wind power are available. The surrounding landscape gets in the way and you cannot buldoze or dig anything that gets in the way. Not enough micromanagement and as I said - nothing worth playing any more than few hours. This game has zero replayability potential.\nStill, the idea is great and if the developers add more features to it it could become quite a promising sim. But till then I wouldn't recommend it.","October 21, 2015","false","39.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zespri/recommended/403190/","zespri","andrewsav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zespri/","521 products in account","I would not recommend the game in the current state. I do not know if developers are going to fix what I consider shortcomings, and if they are not, then I'm not recommending the game altogether.\n\nWhen you start a new game for the first time you are presented with 3 difficulty choices. Two of them are locked at this stage, so you only can choose the easiest. (Very minor gripe: why the heck to give a choice when there is no choice?)\n\nWhen you are playing the game there are 10 "milestones", certain conditions during the game that are used to measure your progress. They could be "reach 500 power" or "reach 100 colonists" or sopmething else. In my first and only game (that took 17 hours across three sessions) I got 9/10. The last one "reach 300 colonists" was not possible for me to achieve because I ran out of space for colony buildings, and here is my problem number 1.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you "choose" a pinpoint on the planet where you land. The interface for choosing it is abysmal	. You cannot rotate the planet with keyboard and you cannot zoom in or out. Mouse speed when rotating is about of a dying snail. I honestly cannot understand why they included this game element, it's awkward and pointless. In zoomed out state you do not see what landscape is like so you are just choosing at random. And here is where the real problem starts. I happened to land in a relatively small area surrounded by mountains from 3 sides, and the 4th side was the edge of the map (which is also bizarre, because I mean they just allowed me to rotate the freaking planet, I know that it's a sphere and I know that it does not have an edge). When I started the game I did not realize that there would not be enough space for me to fully develop, and that the game gives you a zilch ways of crossing the mountains. The "edge" is also not obvious. At a certain point you can no longer build in that direction, no line in the sand, perfectly level surface, it just does not let you place a building as if you are trying to place it on to  another building or on a mountain. Frustrated, you are trying again and again, until you realize that you are not supposed to build on the other side of an invisible wall. Anyway, after 17 hours of play it is a surprise that you cannot actually finish the level.\n\nThat was problem number 1. Note, that the game is probably meant to be open ended, so I'm not sure if it would properly "finish" even if I got 10/10. So how they say, the pleasure is the journey, not the destination. (Edit: the game does not have a win condition. You have a hard limit of 200 buildings and 500 colonists)\n\nHere is problem number 2. Some sim games give you an info panels about your minions (in this case colonists) and this one is no different. What is different from some of the games I played before, is that the info panel usually have a button to find the minion or to follow it. Not in this game. You click a colonist, you look at the panel and when you are done this colonist already wondered away and with a big base you cannot find her any longer, because she looks exactly like anyone else. By the way if the person departs (visitor) the info panel does not reflect this and displays the last known data. Now, you might be thinking, but do you actually *need* to look at the colonist information? I'll be honest with you I wondered the same. You see, I'd be happy if the game was built so that this information is of no use and can be totally hidden. I'd also be happy if it was there and easy to use. But currently if you'd like to investigate why your colonists are dying for no obvious reason you really can't. First of all, "a colonist has died" notification when clicked does NOT show you the colonists or her info pane. It just jumps somewhere on the map. Presumably, this is the place where the colonist died. There is no body or any indication of what happened though. So you reload a recent save if you were lucky to have one, and you are trying to find that person that is going to die. But since the game does not have a colonists list, or colonists search, you cannot really find this person, no way. If by some crazy accident you managed to find her and select her and look at her info panel... well I did not manage that.\n\nHere is problem number 3. As game flows you get event notifications in the bottom left corner. You left click to follow them, you right click to dismiss them. If you are not fast enough they are gone. If these where landing permissions and you missed it, well sucks to be you, you just lost these coins you otherwise could have earned, better luck next time. If there was two similar events about different objects the game group them up and excludes any specific information. So if two building were completed or two people died, you won't be informed what these building where or what theses people died from. Why is there no log, that one could browse at leisure? Btw, sometimes but not always, even if just *one* person dies the game does not tell you why. "Well he died. Whatever."\n\nSo the above sums up to the following. I wish I did not need the log, I wish I did not need to track individual colonists, but I do. And here is why. When my colony was developed with about 100 colonists and 30 bots, I had all my production lines up. I did not have absence of any particular resource. In particular, there was enough food. Still a colonists died "from starvation". Then another one, then another. Soon there was enough dead that there was not enough people to for the hydroponics, so the food supply plummeted and everyone died because now there was really no food. This happens, and the game gives you no way to find out what went wrong. You are simply left in the dark. This leads me on to...\n\nProblem number 4. This game does not support any corrective actions. If you ran out of an important resource (any important resource) there is no way to recover. (If you have plenty of other resources and lucky timing a trader flies by you might be able to salvage the situation, but from my about a dozen reloads it did not happen once). The only thing you can do is to reload your previous save and make sure that this resource does not run out. I'm not sure, maybe it's a genre staple? If it is I do not like it, I feel that there should be an in-game way to correct a mistake without the need to reload.\n\nProblem number 5. There seems to be a limited number of save slots and the saves are called save1, save2 and save3. I'm serious, that's what they are called and you cannot change these. (I understand that this is probably so that they can port to a mobile device easily, but it's just an explanation, not a good excuse)\n\nProblem number 6. So remember I told you that there is no way to find out what happened when something goes wrong? Well what the game wants you to do is to use built in resource graphs to figure out what dynamic led up to the current situation. The only problem is that there are bazillion of different resources and a single graphs screen. You have an icon per resource that you switch on an off to show the line on the graph or not. This is so bloody inconvenient. Because they did not have enough colours, half of the colours are the same so you cannot tell on the graph one line from another, and there is no legend. Also certain types of resources mean something to some people like me in combinations. So for example I want often to see raw ore and metal produced from it. And then I want to see starch and bioplastic produced from it, and also vegetables, because they same as start come out from the hydroponic pods. And in order to switch from one view from another I need to unclick all the old resources one by one and then click all the new ones one by one, what a nuisance!\n\nThis game could be good. Currently it is not. The worst thing, that most of the problems are only noticeable only when you are well in the game, and not immediately.","October 27, 2015","false","46.7"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","1"

You have to manage resources really well in order to keep you colony alive. For example you need metal and Bioplastic to build structures like solar panels and bio-domes,(Fancy name for a very large greenhouse.)\n\nThe game starts with you playing the very detailed tutorial, taking you through building and other game machanics. Once you know how to play the game, you can start your first base. You can name is whatever you like and then you can choose where to start on that planet. The world starts with a short cinamatic of a lander pod landing on the planet, (which can be annoying as it's unskippable,) then seven astronaughts and two rovers get out of the pod. You start by building an oxygen generator and an airlock. Then you need power so build solar panels and a power collector. If you don't connect them, then the game will remind you, which I find really useful as I'm still sorta new to the game. It will also remind you of what to do in sandstorm etc. You can build mines, refinaries, factories, landing pods, wind turbines. Do I have to say more? This game has loads.\n\nThe Upsides:\nThis game has a lot of gameplay value to it. You can play for hours on end, building and rebuilding bases. After a while you can unlock new planets, with totally different environments to switch up the gameplay a bit. This is awesome as you don't have to get bored looking at tons of sand 24/7. This game is also absolutley beautiful. You can have it on the highest possible setting and have a microwave run it. It is that smooth, (Disclaimer: Don't actualy put your PC in a microwave, I was exagurating okay?)\n\nThe Unfortunate Downsides:\nI have had so much trouble finding a down side to this game but it's far too difficult to come up with something resonablle. So I'm just going to nit pick if that's okay.\n\nThe planet has invisible boundaries which I really don't like. However you can still use a LARGE amount of the map. Also I have never built a base big enough to cover the map so I don't even know why I'm putting this here xD\n\n\nThe Wrap Up:\nOverall this is a really good game. It reminds me of Banished but has that Sci-fi feel to it and I absolutley love that. The soundtrack is just awesome and really fits the theme as well. But over all GET THIS GAME!

Some multiplayer would be nice, even if it was just on a simple LAN base multiplayer.\n\n2. Factions that can come and trade / give colonists. Factions would be awesome and you could even have new ship designs and markings.\n\n3. Okay this one is a MUST for all. Mod support. Think about it.

Although I only have 7 hours on record I'm pretty sure this will be a staple game I come back to over and over again. As I was continuing to play it today I kept getting nagging thoughts of what this game could achieve. I know it's a simple game but below are just some things that I personally would find appealing.\n\nThe only down side is that the resolution settings don't work and you can't choose between windowed/fullscreen.\n\nHere are my following thoughts for additions:\n\n1) Multi-tiered towers that allow for a certain amount of floors and cost more materials to create. i.e. Your tower can only have 2 - 3 tiers of levels. 1st floor medbay, 2nd floor canteen, 3rd floor bedroom pods etc.\n\n2) I'm not sure if the storyline of the game will allow for extraterrestrial species to visit the colony / trade with the colony but it would interesting.\n\n3) Have the ability to upgrade buildings instead of having to re-arrange them all, to make them bigger.\n\n4) Fighter robots. We have construction and carrier robots, but robots with lazers is always a cool thing to add.\n\n5) Some sort of tool or option to allow you to flatten down smaller pockets of terrain. It's very irritating when having to work around a tiny bump in the ground.\n\n6) Tourist specific areas like small parks or other entertainment and hotels.\n\n7) Reproduction - As with every colonisation I don't think it will be sustainable if there isn't any way to reproduce the population other than calling in drones from the home planet. I think adding specific bunkers for reproduction would be a fun element and add some realism to the whole thing. It would work well with the medbays.\n\n7 a) Adding on from reproduction a training facility for new people / children would be cool as well, allowing for a new profession for teaching. It would really complete the circle and add a lot more content and angles to the game.\n\n","May 9","true","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You run out of power, you run out of food or water, intruders cause havoc, your colonists die due to radiation... There is always something, that keeps you focussed. The only issue is the lack of content, but it's only down to the small development team I guess.

It's cool to play, even if I fail. However, it's not cool if your crew is a bunch of braindead electric ants. Let me explain.\n\nI had a night when there was absolutely no wind, and I didn't have enough electricity to make it through the night. How could I have? The game tells to build wind power. Why should I build it if I can't last the night even with it? Well, thanks to the power outage, people didn't sleep or eat or anything. What kind of a human being requires electricity to sleep anyway? If that wasn't enough, I already had a shortage of food and other materials. I could've really used people who did their fricking tasks. But instead they wanted to sleep. All at once. Because of that, nothing got built. Absolutely everything collapsed because of this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like a game with challenge, but this is bullsh*t. The difficulty comes mostly from RNG and bad AI. That's kinda weak. The crew needs like 10 minutes to make a single piece of metal. From mining the ore to hauling it to base to somebody bothering to process it. I kinda liked the game until I hit the wall of nothing getting done because everything went in a snail's pace. I had to tend to every need of the crew while waiting for more metal to be processed, but that just meant I had to build more stuff and get more crew. Unfortunately, this meant I had to build even more because they couldn't survive with what I had already built.\n\nIs every game of this a snowball rolling down to the depths of hell? Is this what this game is about? I get it, it's hard to make resources but it's a fricking meat grinder.\n\nIf possible, I'd like there to be a patch of some kind to make it easier to mine metal. Because frankly, it sucks right now. I hate it because it could be a really great game, especially with some kind of objectives instead of a sandbox. If you read this, creators, please make it so that I can play it without feeling like poop is running out of my hem.

You can even design the interior of most building too! Such as, in the Canteen (where colonists get served food), you can choose where to place each table, Meal Makers (Meal Makers turn raw vegetables and meats into meals that are edible)and even plants. There's natural disasters such as: Solar Flare, sandstorm and a group of "visitors" coming to your base, armed with guns who will shoot anyone on sight! This game is evil and may seem unfair at first, however it was fixed recently so now colonists will be able to make food even when hungry.\n\nGameplay\nPlanrtbase is very hard. The customization of buildings is excellent, you can change the size of buildings, change exactly what plants will grow in the Bio-Dome (inside farm) and even a Leisure room for fitness. Your colonists will take advantage of whatever they have, such as they will work out in the lesiure area if they're morale is low, and will sleep on their own bed or any available bunk bed if tired. You can change what rooms are needed to have work done in, such as you can make resource gathering rooms (such as Bio-domes) be filled with Biologists (people who take care of food gathering machines) instead of barely surviving plants. Speaking of plants, your Biologists will need to take care of your plants for them to make food AND also Vitromeat machines (creates processed meat). So you'll need to stock up on them. There's many buildings such as mines and factories. You can create robots or trade for their blueprint. Trading is manditory for win the game's first, second and third planets.\n\nDifficulty\nThe game gets a staggering 8/10 on this scale. Before the patch that made the game more fair, starting out was a nightmare. I've had 7 restarts within 40 hours, mostly of food shortage. One time O2 levels were too low in the base, and everyone died of asphyxiation (loss of oxygen). There's so many ways to die, it's crazy, hunger, solar flare radiation, meteor landing on you, asphyxiation, deprived of water, being shot to death, malnutrition, ect.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nVery high polycount on models (very detailed models)\nDifficult\nNo bugs after 40+ hours of gameplay\nTons to do\nRealistic gameplay\nTrading (player to AI)\nMany ways to lose\nVery, very polished game\nMany hours of gameplay\n\nCons:\nThe price is just a tiny bit high for now, but once there will be more content, then it will be okay with me.\n\nFinal Rating\nOne of the easier 8/10 I've ever done. I could put a 9/10 on this game once they add some more content.\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

And unfortunately the developer has made it clear that they do not want to introduce DLC or any updates for more unique gameplay sessions.\n\nNot only the underlying problem of the game really lacking in content, it also has a game breaking bug that I experienced with the AIm, which involved my entire colony voluntarily starving themselves to death. The dev is really slow with releasing fixes, and most are small and not particularly noteworthy. I don't think the particular bug I experienced has been fixed too.\n\nI would not recommend solely based on the fact that the game is so dull after a few hours, I just wish I realised before I passed the refund timestamp.

Highly recommended for turning a lot of conventions on their heads, namely, decentralization is key and resource management it a very finely-tuned thing in this game.

The theme is great, the graphics are decent, and mechanics are solid. However, there are a couple things that make this game very awkward to play and downright aggrivating at times.\n\nThe whole purpose of the game is to build a colony and try to have it survive as long as possible, which is easier said than done. At the time of writing, one of the biggest qualms I have with the game is that there's no way to set a building's construction as a priority. On top of this, there's no way to take direct control and issue orders to your colonists. During my first game, I got to the point where I needed to build an additional water extractor. I had plenty of supplies and placed one on the map and connected it. I then set to clock to 2x time and waited 10 minutes. During this time, all of the colonists continued wandering around with their thumbs up their asses. No water means no oxygen, which means everyone dies.\n\nWhich brings me to the AI. What AI?\n\nIn all seriousness, the AI is beyond broken. On multiple occasions, I've had a surplus of medics with lots of the necessary components to produce medical supplies and the workbench set to high priority, and I would sit there and watch the medics do literally everything BESIDES make medical supplies. A similar situation happened with the engineer and spares production. I'd have the spares set to high priority with lots of metal and a surplus of engineers, and they did literally nothing until the spares ran out and everything broke down.\n\nThere are also some other issues such as an awkward UI and lack of building hotkeys or rebindable keys in general. But, this is all minor streamlining stuff that can be overlooked. Incompetent AI and lack of agency are what really kills the game. I may buy the game again if they change these, and may even recommend the game later on. But I cannot recommend the game in its current state.","October 22, 2015","false","2.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game, while passable, is NOT it.\n\n- The COLONISTS are not an improvement from older games.  They stand around doing nothing or pick the jobs that are just not needed right now.\n-  You CANNOT assign beds, to make it easier to get to work.\n-  There is no fast travel to reach the farther areas of the base.  So if you plop down a cabin, which is a room that assigns colonists ther own PERSONAL bed, and then they have to work in the other side of the map.  Well then thats quite a problem. If I could asign the bed to a someone who works nearby, tha would be awesome.\n- You can hire five different colonist types. Who cares what there names will be, because your going to have hundreds of them.  They do NOT improve in skill nor can you improve their equipment.  The only ones that get an upgrade are guards, you can give them a generic gun.\n\nThe INDUSTRY/ECONOMICS.   You can make robots to help run the base. Miner/Constructor/Carry bot.  Make generic "guns" to either give to your security force or sell to traders.\n- You can sell any other surplus items you over produced in the base.  Its very easy to have a surplus of food.\n- You CAN prioritize rooms, but not specific jobs in that room, like making specific materials you need. This forces you to specialize rooms, for example I have a small factory room at the corner of my base that can produce 4 weapons at a time.  I turn this on every time I hire guards.\n-  You can also trade with passing ships but you CANNOT prioritize transporting goods to the landed trader.  So if your base is just too busy the ship cancels trading and leaves.\n-  You can limit the amount of items your base can produce which will stop your colonists from expending all your resources.\n-  So the fun really is in managing a 300+ person station with a bad interface and Bad AI.\n\nTech\nNo research.  You buy every new tech from the traders.  There are 8 improvements.  You will not use all 8.\n\nCombat/conflict\nAutomatic lasers that shoot down meteors that get to close.  Guards man security consoles to look for intruders.  The guards can then track down these intruders and use the gun you gave them.  You can also hit the red alert button to allow colonists to go to the guard locker and grab a gun.  Which I never needed to do yet as the guards have easily destroyed every intruder.  Sadly no other items like armor or medkits.   No other enemy aside from the generic "intruder" 15 hours in.\n\nBiggest caveat ---> There is very little control over the people, aside from "prioritize this room".  And we all know AI tend to be dumb in games like this, which is why I like the option to help it once in a while.\n\nWhile pretty to look at and I got to kill 16 hours playing it, I realize, it has LITTLE OR NO REPLAYABILITY.  Once you figure out the right build order and how to stabilize there is very little challenge in the game.  The only challenge remaning is figuring out how to grow larger, population 300.  And for someone like me, I was hoping for more gameplay.  The completionist in me might just reach for the 300 just to say that I did.  But really after 15 hours, other games are more interesting/challenging/fun.\n\nDon't get me wrong its an OK game, which can be played with one hand.  So if you have to be bedridden for a few days this game is a good fit.  But not worth the asking price.   Wait for a sale less than $10.","October 21, 2015","false","18.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

On my main computer (R9 280X, 1080P) I ran it at max settings and got 60 FPS (V-sync) all the time. I tried it on my laptop (1080P, GTX 620m, which usually means you can't run 3D games), at max settings I got around 20 FPS (which is what I get at minimum settings in other games), and turning off AA and lowering the graphics effects one step gave a still good looking game and fully playable around 30-35 FPS.\n\nMain review:I usually only write reviews for games I've played trough beginning to end, but since I had the privilege of getting an early key, I'll share my opinion on the game in conjunction with the release.\n\nIn Planetbase, you set up a colony on one of three distant planets, with the goal to become self sufficient and making your base grow while making sure you'll never get to any resource shortage. Among other things, you'll manage production of electricity, mining minerals needed to make building materials, grow plants and synthesize meat to keep your colonists fed, and also protect your base from threats like sandstorms, meteors and armed intruders. When you have a stable production line set up you will be able to manufacture robots to make your base even more effective, and help you grow further.\n\nI was quickly drawn in to the game, my first session lasting several hours, making me lose track of time, which is usually a really good measurement of how well made a strategy game is.\n\nI would say Planetbase is a challenging game. At first it felt like I was playing Extraterrestrial Failure Simulator 2015, as it's very easy that things start going south as soon as the base is lacking in some kind of resource. As an example, one of my first bases had too little variety in food. When I noticed that one of the colonists got ill due to this, I changed what plants were grown in my Bio-dome, and also started building a lab to produce vitro-meat. The problem was that before any of this was done, more colonists had gotten ill, and ill colonists refuse to work. The only way of getting better is being treated by a medic, but the only medic was the first one to get ill, so the colony stopped all production before the problem could be fixed. This happens a lot with different shortages (one more example: too few spares will lead to power shortages when the power plants decay, and without power, new spares can't be made - you're doomed again), and teaches you that you have to be on top of things all the time. Check the charts - is anything decreasing? Build to make sure you have so you get by. Expand slowly, as fast expansion will put you at risk.\n\nWhen I started to get a hang of it, the hours flew by again, and I had lots of fun during the expansion. The joy faded a bit at the end though: as your base grows, and you have acquired all technologies and built all kinds of buildings, the only goal is to increase the base size even more, which can feel unrewarding, as you're really not unlocking anything more, so it's the same check resources -> slowly expand -> repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's fun getting there, but if the game had more content, and more incentive to keep on playing in the late game, I would have given it a higher score than 7/10.\n\nI must say that I wish that there was a way to directly address certain problems in your base. You can prioritize the manufacturing output of certain buildings, but this doesn't always have any noticable effect. Sometimes, certain buildings can be in dire need of repairs, but there is nothing you directly can do about it, other than hope that some engineer will get to that sooner rather than later. As I mentioned earlier, you are often better off reverting to old save files to save your base.\n\nBased on what I played through so far, I would say you get at least a good 30 hours from this game. I would love to see some kind of expansion further along. Perhaps also with the option to more directly control the actions of your colonists.\n\nOne last note: This game doesn't support Steam Cloud saving, which is unfortunate, since the game runs well on a laptop. It would have been great to be able to play on both the main computer and the laptop with the save files synced.","October 16, 2015","true","18.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","1"

I must admit I am a bit of a sucker when it comes to this types of game (Strategy/Simulation/Build/Management). Even though I thought the other game was just OK with good potential... PlanetBase seemed even more intriguing.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, yes, for a game like this one doesn't need much better graphics really. The soundtrack at the begining really gets you into the grove that you are about to go into space and colonise on a far away planet... I was really into everything and letting myself immerse in the experience.\n\nThe first 3 games, sadly for me I must admit, I pretty much killed all of my colonists quite fast!\nThere just seemed no way to be able to keep a balance on the things one needs to build for survival of the small colony you start the game with.\nParticularly food! Food was always an issue. It didn't seem like I was ever able to keep enough food being produced (bio-domes took too long to produce enough materials to fill the meal making machines in the canteen).\nAlso, there seemed no way of really prioritising any of the jobs your 'sims' (I'll call my colonists sims for the sake of ease) have. So a lot of the time they just stand around being 'idle'. Being the masochist I am clearly, I tried to persevere and figure out what I was doing wrong.\n\nEventually, I was able to develop a colony, enough to have just over 30 sims in it.\nBut even then, somehow the bit of the map I was in had hardly enough space to build as there is no way to get machines or bots to break through the hills/mountains/whatever you want to call that are all over the place. I understand the purpose that they're needed for the sake of building mines and producing ore but... and a big but... there should be an alternative to this issue!\n\nAnyhow... eventually after much fiddling around with the map, starting a game, seeing what the map is like before starting to build, quit to menu and restart the process all over again,,, I managed to figure out my way to a semi decent sized map with enough space to build a 'decent base'.\n\nStill I really like the graphics.\nThe music became a tad annoying so pretty much just opted to have it off most of the time and leave the sound effects on. The meteors, the spacecrafts, the lasers, the solar panels moving, etc are pretty cool sound effects that helpt the game immersive potential.\nHowever... There is as much great about this game as there are possibilities to improve it (and needed improvements). It would be great to have a bit more control over what priorities one can/should give to its sims... better control over the different food types, what goes into each meal making machine (for example we should be able to select how much of veggies and meats a particular machine should hold; this would give the option to have properly balanced meals on some machines/canteens and simply fast meals like salad or whatever on others for quick hunger quenching). Also, maybe I am missing out on how it works in the game, but we should be able to assign a work machine or at least a specific dome/area to a specific sim and hopefully this would avoid the fact that since they spend most of their time trabelling around the base the machine works are produced considerably slow for the needs one has sometimes. SO trying to balance those out can get annoyingly challenging (fiddling with colonist percentages, etc) since they'r not quite maazing. They work well I guess if you just really focus on developing one group of sims at a time for whatever one single need one wishes to develop... but that means you're lacking on other areas...\nI think it would also make this game a lot more interesting if you had demolition bots or tools to craft the terrain in order to expand your building map.\nI could go on and touch on more in depth thoughts and ideas... but I wouldn't want to bore anyone that bothers to read this review any more than I already have by possibly making it this long.\n\nWell... I think it's a good game with potential to be great, with improvements needed for sure. Still quite enjoyable until you sort of get the hang of how to control the small controls available to expand your colony/base.\n\n6/10 for potential that's for sure. Wonder if there are any developments to come that will make the game more enthralling!\n\nSo I will recommend the game since there isn't a level of marking this game other than Yay or Nay! As I enjoyed it and wish for more (once the game improves)... I will leave it for others to decide if they Yay or Nay the game after all!","February 9","true","58.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With real life Mars One mission to colonize Mars launching in near future, this game shows you just how many difficulties the colonists will have to overcome.\n\nYou pick a spot on a planet to land at, you land, and you start building up all the necessities of life. From food, water, and oxygen, to medical care, safety, and entertainment. One miscalculation, and your collonists are diying left, right, and center.\n\nAlong with a multitude of buildings you have to construct in a sane pattern, you get an option to construct equipment available in those buildings, resulting in hundreds of variations of things you can build.\n\nYour landing party are just the pioneers. You construct a landing pad to keep up the inflow of collonists, traders, and visitors to your fledging colony.\n\nI initially resisted buying the game due to multiple negative reviews using a vague term "no depth" to describe the game. I'm still unsure what they mean, but my guess would be the lack of plotted story. It's true, there is no story plot to follow, no villain to subdue, no arc to complete. But in my opinion, the entire game is the "plot." You start off with barely anything and your story is to survive. The scarcity of resources is your villain you wish to defeat. Is there a need for more?\n\nI didn't feel the game had to start with some cinematic about the future of humanity or some other ideal I had to pursue. It's implied.\n\nMoreover, the devs responded to a little buglet in the tutorial that I reported within mere minutes.\n\nI'm definitely giving a solid thumbs up to this game and it's certainly worth the measly $20 it sells for.","March 22","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fundamentally, this is a limited and flawed game, but it manages to be fun, and I enjoyed playing it. It feels more like a sandbox than a true strategy game. It lacks a meaningful end-game. Once you have learned to build a base successfully, that's it for the game. You can do the same again on planets 2,3,4 but the objectives are identical. There are no new buildings that are unlocked, or new strategies you have to adopt on these planets.\n\nThe game also suffers from a number of display, menu gaps. There is no view where you can tell where you can build legtimately or not, or place a mine. There is no 'grid' or 'tile' view where you can tell you if you have enough space to build your buildings. This is a crippling flaw, since the structure and economy of the game encourage you to scrap and rebuild your base easily. However, you could remove your medium building and then be unable to place your large building in its place, and there is no way to tell that without your workers doing several minutes of work. You can't name your save games, or really organise your saves, or load from within the game. You will be frustrated by how little direction you can give your workers on activities or where to work. You can be crippled by a hidden system of priorities that prevent one aspect of your base from working, bringing down your whole base.\nThe game succeeds with some of its simplicity, but needs a little more to reach its full potential. I'd say this has the makings of a great game, but this isn't yet a great game.","March 19","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However after abit more extended play through I realize that this game is kinda lacking on few aspects I find important\n\n1. The UI isent terrible, but it could certainly be improved with simple changes and more accurate information, being able to look at all your important base functions and such on the fly instead of rifling through menus would certainly make this a much more enjoyable game. The alarms... after the first couple of times its cool, after that... irritating.\n\n2. The AI is garbage. I hate watching how this all unfolds as your base expands. sometimes you get high level colonists building or hauling materials somewhere when its not their job and have a more important task thats more their specialty then what they are doing. The path finding needs work, not a whole lot but definitly some fine tuning and a few more features would fix this.\n\n3. Game content feels high but quickly piddles off after 200 colonists. It feels like there alot of AI interaction is missing, most times it dosent feel like your playing a a base building game... but more watching. Sure you build the building and make the connections but theres no individual conduction of each colonist. you cant take control of colonists on a whim to correct a serious error instead of clicking a button and waiting until people have time to get things done. A maintenance managemnet screen would also be nice, indivdual control of colonists, especially guards... i feel like thats a big one... you wouldnt have to monitor your whole base if all you could do was place guards at the entrances and tell security stations which zones you want surveyed and not randomly. With base building games i always feel there should be a tech tree, but in this your purchase your techs... alright then. Overall i always feel a lack of total control over whats going on in my base. Another interesting thing is lets say your 270+ colonists in and as your expanding you need to refurbish old wings of your base, the game makes it impeccably time consuming, even reorganizing modules or having things built can be tetious, especially when your getting into the larger bases.\n\nOverall its a good experience and though i only seemed to mention bad things about the game there is lots going for it and alot of the game mechanics are agreeable and most of what goes on is okay, but I can just picture such a better game with a few tweeks and a few features added that could turn m 6.8/10 into something more...","December 27, 2015","true","30.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The alarms... after the first couple of times its cool, after that... irritating.\n\n2. The AI is garbage. I hate watching how this all unfolds as your base expands. sometimes you get high level colonists building or hauling materials somewhere when its not their job and have a more important task thats more their specialty then what they are doing. The path finding needs work, not a whole lot but definitly some fine tuning and a few more features would fix this.\n\n3. Game content feels high but quickly piddles off after 200 colonists. It feels like there alot of AI interaction is missing, most times it dosent feel like your playing a a base building game... but more watching. Sure you build the building and make the connections but theres no individual conduction of each colonist. you cant take control of colonists on a whim to correct a serious error instead of clicking a button and waiting until people have time to get things done. A maintenance managemnet screen would also be nice, indivdual control of colonists, especially guards... i feel like thats a big one... you wouldnt have to monitor your whole base if all you could do was place guards at the entrances and tell security stations which zones you want surveyed and not randomly. With base building games i always feel there should be a tech tree, but in this your purchase your techs... alright then. Overall i always feel a lack of total control over whats going on in my base. Another interesting thing is lets say your 270+ colonists in and as your expanding you need to refurbish old wings of your base, the game makes it impeccably time consuming, even reorganizing modules or having things built can be tetious, especially when your getting into the larger bases.\n\nOverall its a good experience and though i only seemed to mention bad things about the game there is lots going for it and alot of the game mechanics are agreeable and most of what goes on is okay, but I can just picture such a better game with a few tweeks and a few features added that could turn m 6.8/10 into something more...","December 27, 2015","true","30.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From first catching it's trailer I thought it was reminiscent of my first game on PC, Sierra's 'Outpost' ... it was, suface wise anyway.\n\nThe tutorial is concise and well worth finishing before you move on to settle on to your first planet, a Mars type; because when your colonist's lander sets down, you're really on the clock with fairly limited resources. You get the majority of your build options at the beginning of the game and have to learn fast to reign in your construction enthusiam. When you've belched heartily after gorging through that last seemingly insignicant bioplastic crate, you'll really miss it!\n\nAfter you've learned (within the constraints of your playing style and resources), what to build, where to build, when to build and how big to build it, there's an awful lot of freedom in the game. Once the initial adrenaline wears off you'll find yourself planning the perfect 6sigma colony arrangement and then palm slap as you realise that it's going to take seemingly forever. It doesn't but the game certainly makes you work for it.\n\nBy the the quarter point you're into the rhythm of the games day/night/disaster cycle. The web of needs you've created has an annoying ability to spiral into system collapse if you're not paying attention to the many management tools at your disposal. But then you realise that bots are your friends, as are those really expensive patents!\n\nAt the mid point only reckless sabotage of your colony can cause any difficulty. The game starts to counter the apathy with occasional raiding parties, some of which can be quite devasting but by this point it can be a bit of a drag. In a stretched out colony the AI becomes irritatingly inefficient. In fact the only reason I can see to get to 300 colonists is to unlock the moon sim and the 'achievement'. The other two sims once get progressively more difficult at the offset but again, become tired at the midpoint. Worth doing though just for the first half.\n\nStill, minor end game gripes aside, this is well worth the £10.50 I paid and I will be keeping an eye on Madruga's output.","January 5","true","163.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My first 6 bases? All failed horribly, but I learned each time and now building up a working base is simple on the first planet.\n\nThere is only one drawback, and that is that sometimes you can get saddled with a nearly unusable starting area due to simple siz restrictions. Not that you can't build a survivable base, it just won't be big and will hold you back from Milestones.\n\nMy recommendation to new players: just because you can build a landing pad, don't let colonists land willy nilly.

This game is great if you like base building games, but it's limited in what you can do. Not to say there isn't lots to build because there really is, but once you've got a stable base it will get old unless you're like me and will spend hours being all finicky about the perfect spot to put your potted plant.\n\nThat's the long and short of it.\n\nBut on a further note this game can be bloody hard at times especially when you first start. First two times I played, my guys prioritised building a landing pad instead of the airlock so they could breathe. Turns out you can't survive without oxygen. Apparently they didn't get the memo. The next time I played they decided that it was a better investment of their time in the long run to build a flat screen tv in the dining quarters instead of building the water fountain I'd put in when the room was first built. Then needless to say they all turned into raisins and I was left with two robots and 7 spacesuits which I now have to list on ebay as "Slightly Used."\n\nBut, I can honestly say that in an economy saturated with copy/paste shooters and only one or two decent triple A games entering the market every year, a return to the simple base building format is a really nice change of pace.\n\nBut yeah, basically, if you can handle looking after an army of man-children with about as much sense as a plate of plums, and if you can deal with your favourite robot getting hit in the face with a meteorite and letting the rest of your base die of space aids whilst you stare intently as the engineers try to save his little life, this game is for you.\nHowever, if man-babies ain't your jam, or if your heart can't handle the tragic death of the brave little toaster, then go back on the store and try your luck at something a little more friendly.

First off, do the tutorial, it will save some time and frustration. You can pick you base location on the first planet (haven't tried others), do this and find a location that has A LOT of open space, not pockets of it, but a huge area. It took me about 10 attempts but once I did man was I thankful.\n\nEven after tutorial, I failed about 3 times playing this game. Why? Because I got over zealous in 3 different things. Expanding base too quickly with too few colonists. Led to unhappiness/starvation etc. Expanding colonist population too quickly, again, starvation etc etc. Third, combination of not taking my time to make sure I had medical supplies/spares produced and plenty in stock while also having more basic power structures etc.\n\nAfter these events I learned that I need to take my time, some pick it up fast, some find this game very hard. I'm usually average with strategy games. If it's extremely complicated or indepth I have a hard time with it. I find Planetbase in the middle, challenging, but not so hard I can overcome challenges and advance far.\n\nCurrently, I have a population of 220 (you start with 7?) and about 50 bots constructed, unlocked all tech upgrades via the trader ships that land and have a continuous balanced production system, never run out of anything. So overall done with planet 1 if I like. But I have not built many of the new tech buildings. In order to do that I have to recycle large areas of my base and rebuild, which again can be problematic, take away the wrong building with too much population, could spell disaster. Some things I found frustrating at first before advancing in the game and understanding it better were meteor strikes and armed intruders. Meteor strikes will be frequent, but very spread out, so small base, 1/100 will hit maybe? Large base covering a huge area you will see multiple strikes now and then. Anyone caught inside a building that is hit = dead. Got to keep an eye on this and make sure you have the right amount of colonists ie engineers, biologists, workers. No biologists = no plant/food growth etc. When you unlock landing pad/starports there is a small chance a colonist ship landing might actually be armed intruders, naturally they will attack and kill your peeps. So you need armed guards. These 2 things I found frustrating at first, but you can build a telescope in conjunction with laser to shoot almost all meteor on a collision course with your base.\n\nDeveloper seems very into keeping the game updated and listening to the community. Many will question $20 price and wonder if it's worth it. I'm on the fence with it, I picked this up on sale for $15 and was skeptical then, but definitely don't regret it now. I'd say try get it on sale if you can, nothing wrong with that, but worth at least a $10 price tag. Nothing wrong with supporting a good game with a developer that actually cares. Can't wait to see where this game goes in the future with additional updates, possibly expansions/dlc? or maybe a planet base 2.\n\nWill continue playing and supporting this game, glad I got it.","April 7","true","95.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As EVERYONE is saying the AI is...potato at best. Let me explain.\n\n1. People will stand idle for days at a time.  Need your biologists to maintain plants? nah they're gonna hang in this tunnel and O2 generator for awhile.  Need your Medic to use a "medical supply" on a injured colonist? nah they're gonna sleep, eat, cross the entire map to take ore to the metal processor INSTEAD OF HEALING THE WORKER WHO FRANKLY IS WAAAAY MORE IMPORTANT.\n2. Everything is suicidal - Oh sandstorms here that hurts our health and incapacitates robots? well our omnipresent lord and master hasnt built a control center to put a yellow alert up so LETS GO OUSIDE! *dies/KOs*\n3.  Food disappears super suddenly because you cant really tell how much food is needed to feed people - For example 10ish people with a small biodome making food and you have a surplus of 40+ vegetables.  11 people? HAHA everyone gets to starve now! Prioritizing doesnt help either as that doesnt effect production time just keeping the growing plants healthy.\n4. Power dissapears all to quickly at night unless you've somehow managed to mass produce STUPID amounts of Backup batteries.  Solar power doesnt work at night (duh) and I can accept that, but wind is SOOOO underpowered.  Right before nighttime the wind never fails to stop...completely and then the batteries drain at uberspeed, especially when you have just gotten a start in expanding.  5 buidings OK at night 6? Yeah...well good luck with that.  Again you could just place more solar and generators during the day but it takes DAYS for the AI to get around to building Metal from ore.\n5.  Prioritizing anything is luck at best.  Need starch (for plastic) well unless you happen to have extra resourses laying around for a med or large biodone then you have to sacrifice food.  Need Medical plants? yup same deal you sacrifice food and starch (for plastic).\n\nNow the AI...it just doesnt seem to want to work with you.  you can have recources available and people will just loiter forever.  The only thing I see to fix it is to unprioritize everything, stop building, and wait for every loose item to be gathered and taken to its home.  Then AND ONLY THEN will a medic heal a person or a engineer/robot go build a building.  Heck the builder robot routinly does the carry robots job while the carry robot just idles around.  It seems like the AIs prioritizing is alittle off deeming gathering over healing or expansion.\n\nSo why do I also recommend it? Now maybe this is just because of the finicy AI but mistakes are punished.  Your building an outpost ona distant planet you cant just be given everyhting super easy, though a few extra resources in the colony craft woudnt be harmful.  The models are pretty nice if a little lacking in variety.  The game doesnt slog along, once you start you (logicaly) only have a short while to get oxygen, water and food going. Though itd be nice if either you had more food or people didnt have black holes for necessities.  The core mecanics are there and the game has good foundations, its just a wait to see how they do with newer content.\n\nImprovement wise there needs to be some more movement of parts.  Sure the solar panels turn and wind turbines turn but oxygen? nah static movement, water? nope? food? nope, just spits out veggies and such occasionally.  Rooms are just that, rooms theres nothing amazing about them to make you zoom in and marvel at whats happening.  I just watch the resources and when theres enough I build a building.  Which is bad as im not LOOKING at the game, just teh charts and resource monitors, the game could have been a top down or ASCII game for the amount of time ive looked at things.  Rooms should be specialized when you build them imo, biodome? select food, startch, or medical plants and then upgrade it over 4 levels 1/4 full, 2/4 full etc and have it fill with various things.  Have some airducks that have little streamers blowing to show air is present, have the med bay bed perform diagnostics on a injured person.  have water spriklers in the biodome.  This would need some more balancing to make it not game wrecking but showers and toilets as apparently hygene isnt important in space. maybe mine more then ore like precious metals to trade.  Theres so much room for improvement but I think that the resources need a major overhaul first as anything gets added to this game and it might make everything break.  Especially since everything is based on 2 singular things, metal and bioplastic, the amount needed just to get stuff rolling is crazy even if its just 1 or 2 of each.\n\nStill, idk, I like this game but I know that its only...20% if that.  The base game is there but is in need of balancing and additional things to do as honestly the game relies alittle to much on luck atm.  Also once the AI gets tweaked im sure this will get much better.  Heres to hoping the gtame isnt just dropped by the producers.\n\nId give this a 5.5-6/10.  Playable and just fun enough to not drive you insane.","October 18, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you love city building strategy games and survival ones like Banished, you should definitely check out this game, as this is essentially a space variation. You will -- presumably -- have to restart each planet and each challenge multiple times to perfect your strategy, but that's exactly where the fun starts, at least for me. In fact, after a hard start it can feel really cozy and quite satisfying to see your base safely secured by lightning rods amidst a thunderstorm. Especially as the graphics are beautiful. The mechanisms are logical even though they're sometimes not what you would expect -- e.g. if you can build a spaceship why are you not able to dig a tunnel through a mountain or build a floating component on a sea? -- and as probably everyone else I would wish for more planets, more resources, more buildings.

This game will make you watch each of your habitants slowly starve/suffocate/burn to death because of a mistake YOU made 12-24 hours ago.\n\nDidn't build enough Solar or Wind generators the day before? - You didn't really LIKE Jimmy, right?\nNot enough Biologists to cultivate your crops? - I hope the 10% you eventually lose are in non-vital roles.\n\nFor those complaining about Planetbase being too "simple" or "not complicated enough for $20", I'm of the opinion that the is right in the sweet spot of Base/Survival Management - Simple enough to learn the basics quickly, but also not so complex that its entirely your fault when you fail.\n\nI have 20+ hours in the game, and my current (7th) colony has about 120 Habitants and 25 Robots...after 120+ Days. (THE PREVIOUS COLONIES ALL DIED) - (HOW IS THERE AN ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS GAME TO REACH 250 HABITANTS IN 60 DAYS).\n\nThis game is not for those who want to be rewarded constantly for their efforts and told how great a player they are. It's for players who want a hardcore survival simulator, have the game slap them in the face for their mistakes, and ask for another.\n\nAll that being said, here's a few tips for new players:\n\n1. Get used to your colonists dying. It's going to happen. A LOT. I once had a meteor land right on the landing ship as soon as I started, killing 3 of them. It's not an issue with AI, it's an issue with YOU thinking you can save all of them. Hostile groups infiltrating your base are almost guaranteed to kill at least 1 colonist per intruder.\n\n2. Get your resource generation going ASAP. The key is becoming self-sufficient as soon as possible, and never taking your eye off the amount you produce/consume in each category. The game is a constant balancing act. If you build too many structures, you won't have enough colonists to maintain/work each item, and will produce less overall, if anything.\n\n3. TURN OFF THE COLONIST LANDING PERMISSION FROM TIME TO TIME. I cannot stress this enough. The game will keep adding colonists to your colony before you are truly ready for them. It's not a bug, it's a feature. YOU are in charge of the base, and the game will CONSTANTLY challenge you on this.\n\n4. Never get comfortable. The day you lower your guard is the night the wind doesn't blow hard enough, your colony runs out of power before morning, and people are starving to death in the hallways.\n\n5. Build a good number of airlocks throughout your base. Airlocks only allow one person/robot to pass through at a time, and colonists will line up as they need to go outside (This happens a lot when trade ships land, as your colonists will HAND DELIVER cargo to the ship from your storage). You need additional airlocks near the landing/trade pads to accomodate this traffic, and airlocks in general throughout the base to efficiently reach repair sites, mines, etc. I suspect complaints about pathing are due to this.\n\n6. BASE LAYOUT IS CRITICAL. External structures cannot efficiently intermesh with Internal structures, because of oxygen. Furthermore, learn which structures interact frequently with the others. For example, placing your Storage/Canteen/Biodome close to each other will assist in your colonists harvesting crops and staying fed. Likewise, keeping your Mines/Airlocks/Reprocessing/Factories in close proximity will assist in processing raw materials into spares, metals, and other usable materials. Failing to maintain an efficient base layout will ultimately cripple you in late game, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I'm thoroughly enjoying the difficulty of the game, and I'm glad there's no way around it. You either become knowledgable and overcome, or you lose. 20+ hours and I'm not even done with the first planet of three.\n\nLastly, allow me to make the following comparison, for those who have played the early SimCity games - When you play Planetbase, you are effectively playing a game with the complexity of the original SimCity. If Planetbase were as complex as say, SimCity 2000, no colonist would survive.\n\nNow that you know what you're getting yourselves into.

This game is about starting to colonize a planet and build and and develope a base. It looks amazing and there is a lot of thought that has been put into it. BUT everygame has its flaws and this game has overlooked some critical things or just havent implemented them into the game yet. There are some very anoying things like workers not doing what I want them to do and the fork disease. I wish you could assign certain engineers or workers to a certain task or machine, I know you can indirectly do this but it takes too much time I want to tell the worker to do it now. The hidden fork disease is the most anoying thing sometimes, it is labled as malnutrition and the description is the lack of veriety of foods. First of all we are space pioneers tough it out man it is fine, and second of all you are getting enough foods to live so y u die?? I agree maybe if you sont have a good variety of foods the person should not be able to work as efficiently but even that is pretty stupid.\nThere is also a lack of stuff to do in the game after you have completed all the achievments, I know they are still working on it but i am going to make some suggestions. There should be some crazy space wonders on the planets that you can explore and maybe find some alien tech or some ore. You could make another class of colonists that are called explorers that will do this for you. You load them up with supplied and send them off, maybe you could make a rover and their speed and carrying capacity is increased. There could be ore deposits on the surface and natural resources like that. Landscaping would be nice too, but with moderation being able to terraform a whole mountain is op bit flatten part of the base of a mountain is what I am thinking of. I think there should be more building and more everything just to give more depth to the game, mabye controling you own planet and take over the galaxy... lol idk. And if there is a way to overwite saves, please let me know because I lost my biggest base because of not beinbg able to do that. Overall I love this game and it is worth every penny, i am not telling you how to make your game but I am just making some suggestions.","October 17, 2015","true","24.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, there are a few, rather annoying issues.\n\nIssue #1. The resource "tracking" mechanism (AI in general) needs improvment. In my experience, the colonists seem to ignore resources that are needed.\nEx. I sat for three in game days needing one metal for another Solar panel. My mine had four boxes of ore in front of it but instead of grabbing those, they would go and attempt to mine more, at which time they would then put the box of ore by the front door and go take a nap.\nThis leads into the next issue, the priority system.\n\nIssue #2. Priorities don't seem to effect the colonists. The entire time I had the above mentioned issue at hand, the processing plant required to make the resources needed was the only priority building. But they continued to mine and use what they did eventually make into metal, into spares that were not required. And yes, I did turn the spare count way down.\nAnother example of this issue is with repairing robots and sturctures.\nIn a seperate base, I had a robot, broken down in front of the airlock. I had several spares on hand however nobody bothered to repair him. Later on, part of my power grid failed due to the lack of upkeep on my windmills, thus resulting in loss of power and a catastrophic shutdown of the entire base. After a desperate attempt to get power restored, everything just kind of fell apart and everyone died. All of this resulting from the colonists not repairing the robots or...anything for that matter.\n\nIssue #3. The colonists are insanely needy. It seems like almost half the time they are off in some random room, wasting time when something really needs to get done before they all die. I mean, I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be sleeping 10 hours a day, taking my time eating, and working out to de-stress if my life was in danger and something that was going to keep me alive needed to be built time-now. It doesn't matter if you are angry because it's either angry and alive, or, hap...oh.. wait, now your dead.\n\nNow, I'de like to turn and point out that this game is worth buying, if you haven't already. Personally, I think this game is awesome. It is pretty fun to play and well worth the money spent. If you are looking for a fun time killer and are into this style of game. I recommend it. The random occurrences, although they happen way too often in my opinion, are pretty cool. A few times I've been sitting there with no windmill, biting my nails waiting for the sandstorm to pass as I watch my power bar plumit. Or, been yelling four letter profanities after the connection to one of my buildings get nailed by a meteor. It adds that exitement that games like this usually lack.\n\nAll in all, I'de give it a solid, maybe generous, 7 out of 10.","October 17, 2015","true","36.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, the AI just does not work.\n\nIn this game, you have to set up and manage a variety of supplie chains. so far so good. But your employees/colonists are just not up for the task and stand around or walk in circles, move boxes from here to there and back and forth and do anything exept following their priorities. That sucks and is a pain in the rear to watch.\n\nBut still, I like the scope of the game, the settings and its presentation.

As I said, there's much to love about concept and presentation. But there are too many ways the AI does not work (does the term “artificial intelligence” rally apply here?). And that kills alot of fun.\n\nOnce I was lucky and I managed to grow my colony past 100 inhabitants, that's when my colonists started to take extended outdoor hikes to nowhere for no particular reason, only to suffocate one after another. After I lost too many engineers this way, my colony ran out of spares. And that's when the infrastructure started to crumble. I ran out of energy, then oxygen, and my station was rendered into an outrageously expensive space graveyard.\n\nThe colonist’s jobs are rather simple, actually. There's only a few basic specializations: worker, biologist, engineer, medic and security. But people are just not doing their jobs and the prioritization button has no function. You desperately need spares? Here's iron and a machine. But where's the engineer? He stands happily, walks, stands again, walks back, takes a nap, passes by the spares machine, looks, walks away, and so forth. Same with all the other roles, these things happen All. The. Frinking.

Replayability lies in the different planets given and the varying terrain that is procedurally produced at each planet creation. The further along you get, the easier it is to survive, so most of the challenging (and most fun) gameplay is done in the beginning stages of establishing your colony. Beware, however those of you who think themselves in a stable place as over expansion can be easily done leaving your colony of 50+ People who had happy stable space-lives plummeting into disaster, and worse, death.\n\nIn the first week I owned the game, I played 36 hours.

Planetbase gives that and more. Unlike other games that toss immense data and spreadsheets at player, Planetbase forces player to observe and be aware what is going on. Player must be aware of risks and issues that can struck his colony and to figure it - where is and what is the problem. Even when player achieve "stable colony" that still doesn't mean player is free to go wild.\n\nPlayer do not have direct control over colonists as in most games. This feel strange at first but once you get used to it, it is better that way - controlling 300 colonist individually would be really too much. Player must understand the needs of colonists, face the issues, solve problems and prosper above all.\n\nThis is one of rare challenging games when some simple thing (i.e. selling too much unneeded resource) can kill your entire colony. Also this game has overwhelming feel "Just to make this one thing..." and you keep saying that for the last 20 made things. I really like that game loads quickly.\n\nThere is not all so nice and well. The bad things about Planetbase are:\n\n- AI is strange (especially in crucial moments like engineer builds connector to the Solar Panel but then he ignores Solar Panel even though all needed materials are there)\n- many features should be extended:\n\n* visitors can be more gamy mechanic not just intruders or tourists\n* helping ships in distress also offers huge potential\n* new home made tech research could be a thing and to be specialized per planet\n* possibility to have some colony speciality that can affect gameplay\n* ABOVE ALL WE NEED NEW PLANETS WITH THEIR SPECIFIC CHALLENGES (lava planet? liquid methane planet? planet without solar power possibilities but almost constant wind and slowed movement outside?- can only enhance specialization idea)\n\n- better control over prioritization\n- better control over saving games\n- better airlock model (new airlock that can let in or out more people)\n- windowed mode\n\nI hope game will evolve and offer new content.

I didn't want to give it a negative review because horrible AI aside the game is excellent. Patch 1.0.6 fixed it, and I can now call it a released game.\n\n"Long" review: The game is more or less Banished on other planets. It has the same good and bad things Banished has: at first it is difficult and knocks you over before you learn how the mechanics work and what you should and shouldn't do. RNG is part of the sub-genre, so you have to accept the fact that some colonies are doomed to die because of RNG gods said so. Excellent game, and I recommend it to players who enjoy RNG, survival-based management games, plausible near-future space exploration and citybuilders.\n\nShort review: Buy it.\n\nTo the developers: Consider using Early Access the next time you're developing a game (and I hope you are, because the interaction between the customers and the devs have been quite good). It is very important that the released game is in a good state, and unfortunately Planetbase wasn't.

It plays and feels like a $5 smartphone game. There are a few moments of complexity peeking through but the devs never follow up on them.\n\nThe food system for instance, allows you to grow multiple types of plants in two categories.  One category is purely food as plant or synthetic meats while the other sacrifices some food potential for building materials.  With all these varieties of food you can make different meals to add variation to the diet of your residents to avoid malnutrition.  However there is little reason to bother growing anything other than a two plant combo that gives you a complex food to meet that malnutrition need.  The other plants and the meats available are unnecessary to the game and just clutter the UI or your inventory.\n\nWith almost every other part of the game, it seems like they wanted to make a complex system of unique desires by your residents but stopped it way short to rush the release.  I suppose my feeling about the game could be summarized by the devs running low on funds and needing to capitalize on the game by an early release. For $10 on Good Old Games you can get Space Colony which is much more complex and rich game that was released over a decade ago.\n","October 20, 2015","false","30.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

You have a reasonable disposable income.\n\nI fall into these four categories, so I'm enjoying it.\n\nThe reason for the above qualification is that the game does become a little stale, so if you are not bothered about completing all achievements, you will probably get bored around the 10 hour mark.\n\nGame play, graphics, UI and overall feel are on point.  If there was more to do (as in more scenarios or more buildings etc.) I would be looking at an all time fav.  The AI is a bit off sometimes, but I've not got too p1ssed off with the colonists too often.\n\nI would summarise the game in the following way:\n\n1. Early Game (Less than 20 people = For me this is the first 1hr of each planet).\nReally enjoyable. Its a little challenge and often a rush to get it down right. I tend to resrat a few times to get it right.\n\n2. Mid Game (20-100 people = For me this about 5 more hrs).\nThis is the best bit for me. Once you are relatively safe from fear of base collapse due to something you've missed, you can start planning the base.\n\n3. End/Late Game (100-300 people = This can be anything depending on how much you  care how the base looks).\nThis is where I tend to get bored. I feel the number of buildings needs to be expanded.

I bought it. I do not regret it one bit. I love this game. It's my new craze right now. Obviously not the greatest game ever, but great nonetheless. In future I hope to see; more construction options, such as a vehicle factory for little rovers or something. Bigger and wider terrain so there is more reason to build vehicles and more places to build. A feature that lets you manually move resources, it can be frustraiting to not be able to move something you need moved. More types of humans that can come to your colony. The ability to make a seperate colony (which I see a lot). More planets, like an forest planet, a planet that is covered in water, things like that. The ability to name your planet (Because why not). Button customisation would be nice. Be able to be visited by aliens, friendly or not, aliens are kind of a must to me. And finally, somewhere down the line, mods and multiplayer, these would make the game immensely popular and it would live for a long while.\n\nGreat game, and I will be playing so much more of it!","December 1, 2015","true","48.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start off with a limited amount of colonists and supplies, and have to make a self-sustaining colony. Having a nice colony attracts other colonists to land and join you, hence increasing your production capability, but also strains your resources (oxygen, food, water, beds, etc). Sucess comes at a price too... as a well functioning colony attracts criminals who invade and try to take over.\n\nIt should be mentioned that not all play-throughs are winnable. A meteorite could hit the canteen and kill your only medic, or the power could go out and your people suffocate from lack of oxygen, or a disaster (sandstorm, solar flares) could wipe out a few people left outside.\n\nUnlike Banished [where you can walk away for 10min and the game plays itself] Planetbase requires constant attention, monitoring of all resources, and planning for your next expansion... or the inevitable disaster.","November 30, 2015","true","139.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You love city builder / strategy games;\nb.  You are the sort of person who tries to get all achievements;\nc.  You have OCD; and/or\nd.  You have a reasonable disposable income.\n\nI fall into these four categories, so I'm enjoying it.\n\nThe reason for the above qualification is that the game does become a little stale, so if you are not bothered about completing all achievements, you will probably get bored around the 10 hour mark.\n\nGame play, graphics, UI and overall feel are on point.  If there was more to do (as in more scenarios or more buildings etc.) I would be looking at an all time fav.  The AI is a bit off sometimes, but I've not got too p1ssed off with the colonists too often.\n\nI would summarise the game in the following way:\n\n1. Early Game (Less than 20 people = For me this is the first 1hr of each planet).\nReally enjoyable. Its a little challenge and often a rush to get it down right. I tend to resrat a few times to get it right.\n\n2. Mid Game (20-100 people = For me this about 5 more hrs).\nThis is the best bit for me. Once you are relatively safe from fear of base collapse due to something you've missed, you can start planning the base.\n\n3. End/Late Game (100-300 people = This can be anything depending on how much you  care how the base looks).\nThis is where I tend to get bored. I feel the number of buildings needs to be expanded. From here it just gets a bit repetitive placing the same few buildings over and over to get the last objective.\n\nOverall I would give it a 6/10, rising to 8/10 if you are big fan of this type of game.\n","March 14","true","78.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This isn't your Sim City, where you're just slathering buildings on the board. This requires a lot of planning and tact. Managing Oxygen, Power from Wind and Solar, Food, Medical supplies, Building supplies, and plenty more. It's challenging, and will take a few trys to get a solid base going.\n\nThe downside is the AI leaves a lot to be desired. It suffers from the same SpaceBase-DF9 plague of not being able to control them and having them not do the tasks they need to do. Often times I've had Botnists walk out the airlock and loiter outside only to turn around and clog the airlock up again trying to get back in. You have to place one building at a time and wait for it to be built or else they'll get confused and place all the resources and then walk back inside without constructing anything. Often times I've needed spare parts to repair buildings, and while I have the resources to make them, none of the engineers want to use the machine to craft them.\n\nOther than that, the game is perfect for what it is.

You land a few people and robots on a hostile planet and get to work building your base. Oxygen generators, Biodomes, Dorms and everything else you might need to survive this harsh environment. Besides the lack of food, water, oxygen and building materials you will be bothered by meteoroids, sand storms, solar flares and later assaults. It’s up to you to create a second home for your people.\n\nPlanetbase is a very calming game. I usually don’t use the speed controls in games like these so what could have been a 30 min session turns into a few hours. But I find watching your people move around the base like little ants very enjoyable. There is a good amount of challenge, especially in the beginning trying to keep up with food and lack of energy but as you get the hang of things the game becomes easier and lets make more mistakes or build in less than optimal way.\n\nBeing very calm game Planetside is also not very deep. Once you’re over the initial hurdle of establishing a colony there’s little you can to do screw up. There’s also not much point in expanding the base. Neither from the story perspective, of which there is none, nor from objectives. There is a few technologies to acquire by trading and a few milestones to achieve but it all feels a bit weak.\n\nDad rating: Excellent\nYou can both pause and save at any time.\nThe only violence is during assaults and even that is barely noticeable.\nAll in all Planetbase is a nice game that fills in that need for a calm game of watching something grow.

It's a fun premise and overall it's really well executed.\nThe review by Etheras is really excellent and I think captures my thoughts exactly so I won't reiterate everything they said but check out that review! They itemize the good and the bad really clearly.\nThe only thing I would love to see, and this is totally unfair since the game doesn't claim to offer this at all, would be the ability to terraform the planet.

You land a few people and robots on a hostile planet and get to work building your base. Oxygen generators, Biodomes, Dorms and everything else you might need to survive this harsh environment. Besides the lack of food, water, oxygen and building materials you will be bothered by meteoroids, sand storms, solar flares and later assaults. It’s up to you to create a second home for your people.\n\nPlanetbase is a very calming game. I usually don’t use the speed controls in games like these so what could have been a 30 min session turns into a few hours. But I find watching your people move around the base like little ants very enjoyable. There is a good amount of challenge, especially in the beginning trying to keep up with food and lack of energy but as you get the hang of things the game becomes easier and lets make more mistakes or build in less than optimal way.\n\nBeing very calm game Planetside is also not very deep. Once you’re over the initial hurdle of establishing a colony there’s little you can to do screw up. There’s also not much point in expanding the base. Neither from the story perspective, of which there is none, nor from objectives. There is a few technologies to acquire by trading and a few milestones to achieve but it all feels a bit weak.\n\nDad rating: Excellent\nYou can both pause and save at any time.\nThe only violence is during assaults and even that is barely noticeable.\nAll in all Planetbase is a nice game that fills in that need for a calm game of watching something grow. It fuels my imagination of what if would be like living on a different planet.\n","February 15","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game leaves you wanting more complexity and more to do, it's very fun, and maybe I'm getting old but I prefer a game with a modest feature set but executes them extraordinarily well to one that purports to deliver the moon but is full of bugs and when you take a closer look at those features, they're mostly half-♥♥♥♥♥ (I'm absolutely thinking of Fallout 4 here).\n\nI'm not sure what sub-genre this game is, but if you like games where you build stuff, and scores of minions go running around getting the details worked out (think Evil Genius), this game is one of the best out there.\n\nI played 25 hours playing only the default game mode (probably 5-10 hours I had the game on pause, bad habit). There are other game modes, but it seemed the added challenge was just that the planet had a harsher environment; randomly occurring bad events happen more. I find challenges based on "increasing the random rates at which bat things happen" to be pretty empty. But that said, the 25 hours of game play were solid. I spent a few more hours (5-8) than I really needed to, to experience everything this game has to offer, to see if the game had more to offer.\n\nOh, and to top it off, the team is still updating the game and implementing new features.

It's fun and engaging and makes for rewarding--and also punishing--gameplay. The main task is keeping your colonists alive, which can be a serious pain sometimes. The start of the level is critical, and you need to carefully distribute your resources to different buildings right away, otherwise you will find your colonists dying from dehydration, hunger, sleep deprivation or asphyxiation within the first 10 minutes. After several tries and fails, I got the hang of it and managed to expand my base across almost the entire seeded map on one playthrough, with a population somewhere in the many hundreds.\n\nMy Suggestions For Making This Game Even Better\nI think the trading system needs a complete overhaul. You should be able to broadcast purchase orders and have them delivered to your base, rather than the "[random] trading ship has docked" system that they have now. I think more food and leisure, and building options would be nice to implement in a future expansion, as well. And I would like to be able to assign sleeping quarters to particular staff, because currently they will sleep wherever the closest bed is when their sleep need reaches critical, which can be far away from where you want them working if you aren't careful in your layout.\n\nSpeaking of layouts--there needs to be a more effective way of changing locations of your buildings. Currently the game only allows you to deconstruct one building, and reconstruct another in a different location. This is a VERY long process since first the building needs to be removed, then all the worker's needs need to be met (which in itself takes awhile) until they can begin construction on the new building. And in-between that time they may need to exit the base to retrieve the dropped resources one-by-one to put them in storage and use them in the construction of the new building.\n\nThat brings to to one last request: changes to the random map seed.\n\n--I think the maps are really cool, actually. They have the atmosphere and design to them that makes you really feel like you're on another planet. But the multitude of rocks/hills makes constructing a base in the layout that you want extremely difficult. There should be a slider option to adjust the amount of "open terrain" on the map, promoting more growth and development. The terrain shouldn't be flat and devoid of scenery, but it should be slightly customizable. I find myself starting games over and over and over again just to recycle the seed until I find an open-ish map that I can work with. <--This is a nitpicky suggestion but one that would go a long way towards replayability, I think.\n\nAlternatively there could be some kind of terraforming option (possibly even mining protruding rock for metals), thereby flattening an area of terrain.\n\n\nDespite these suggestions for improvement, don't misunderstand. This is a well polished game which I have enjoyed very much and which I have gotten my money's worth out of so far already, and I see even more replayability in the future. Hopefully updates will continue to come on a regular basis, providing more content and extending that replayability even further.","February 16","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The objective is to build and survive, which is not easily done,  It takes some strategic thinking and planning, with a decent learning curve, at least at first.\n\nIt is a fun game and I would recommend it to any city builder or banished fan. But it falls short for a few reasons;\n\nOnce you survive, build your base up and make it sustainable, the only thing left is to expand. While this can be fun for a while, theres no real threat to your existance, outside of bad planning or expanding too fast. It doesnt seem like you can run out of resources, nor have any outbreaks or virus's etc that might take a toll on your colony. The threats that do exist are manageable.\n\nBuildings are almost all unlocked within the first 10mins of the game, theres no real research to be done and so there's nothing really to strive for. Sure you have to combine resources to build new things, and things you need - but thats a just a waiting game - which brings me to the last point;\n\nIts a waiting game a lot of the time. AI can be a bit stupid and doesnt always do the right task in the right order. ie if your low on food, and theres plenty of things to make up a meal, then go and harvest the food and make them! .. they dont always. So because of this, and the amount of time it takes to make some of the ingredients to build an object, you can be sitting watching your colony work away for long periods of time, and not be building a whole lot. Or having stacks of buildings under construction and waiting for construction materials to be made (but the AI is too busy doing something else).\n\nOverall though - its a fun game. I only paid $20 for it, and it kept me entertained for a decent amount of time. I'd replay it casually here and there, but once its mastered, its not a game I'd play religiously. And an experienced builder will master this one in a few hours.","February 16","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't your Sim City, where you're just slathering buildings on the board. This requires a lot of planning and tact. Managing Oxygen, Power from Wind and Solar, Food, Medical supplies, Building supplies, and plenty more. It's challenging, and will take a few trys to get a solid base going.\n\nThe downside is the AI leaves a lot to be desired. It suffers from the same SpaceBase-DF9 plague of not being able to control them and having them not do the tasks they need to do. Often times I've had Botnists walk out the airlock and loiter outside only to turn around and clog the airlock up again trying to get back in. You have to place one building at a time and wait for it to be built or else they'll get confused and place all the resources and then walk back inside without constructing anything. Often times I've needed spare parts to repair buildings, and while I have the resources to make them, none of the engineers want to use the machine to craft them.\n\nOther than that, the game is perfect for what it is. It will challenge you and maybe even force you to do some pre-planning before building a huge space city.","January 16","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is challenging to get the colony going. I had to restart multiple times due to faillures of one sort or another. The A.I. isn't as bad as some people are making it out to be, once you figure out why things happen the way they do. Basically, you want to add redundant colonists as soon as possible and grow only as quickly as you need to--too  quickly and you won't have enough manpower to run the place. If you only have one engineer for example, and something unfortunate happens to him you're in for trouble.\n\n$20 is maybe a bit steep for the amount of content there is. It kept me occupied for a few evenings but that might be the last for me.  Some of the buildings could use more variety of furniture. The dorm only has one fixture to add--the bunkbed--it would be nice if I could add plants or entertainment systems. The cabin is almost the same but it's a different kind of bed--a single--supposedly more comfy.  Its really only a 2D game because you can't build on anything other than the plains. Hills are just obstacles that you have to build around.\n\nI'm recommending it because it fills a genre hole that I haven't really seen before (a city-builder type of game in hostile environments) and I do think its more fun than Project Aura, but it seems to me like its almost an early access game, because I feel they still need to add more features to it to make it worth $20.\n\nThe intruders are a bit lame. Random visitors just start shooting up the place and hopefully you have armed guards to fight back. I'm also not sure about these boulders constantly falling from the sky. Micrometeorites would probably be easier to understand. A better variety of random events could improve the game, too.\n\nI find there are a lot of city builder games where you get to the point where you have pretty much everything the game has to offer in your sim and then you start to wonder, what can I do next? In this game it might happen a bit sooner than the others.","December 8, 2015","true","45.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your first few times out your entire colony WILL die eventually - you just need to figure out why.  I've read negative reviews about this game, but I think thats because people expect every game to have endless content. This was worth the 14 bucks I spent.   Granted, this game is a little limited - think Banished without mods, but its very enjoyable.   I played Sierra's Outpost a LOT back in the day, and this is like that in a way but with less micro-management.\n\nAlso - I dont believe there is a "bug" as many reference.  I think the bug is in their design because  Ive reached high populations more than once (200+), and while I have had catastrophic die off, its always for a valid reason (lack of meal makers for the population, food to far from canteen and taking too long to produce.)  Ive adopted an almost modular method where each area of the base as all of the essentials close to avoid wanderlust with my people.\n\nIf I could improve this, I would do add the following:\n\nA screen showing the breakdown of which types of bots are in service.  Transitioning from a human mining force to a robotic tends to get messy because IVe either overproduces bots or my drillers have died off and I didnt notice.\n\nAllow for some sort of upgrade to the dorms so they can be upgraded to cabins.\n\nMy # of hours is deceiving, I have left it sitting overnight on pause just because I forgot about it, but I easily have 60+ hours into this as Ive tried to complete all of the goals on each hardness level.","February 6","true","147.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From WoW to Sim City, through Command and Conquer to Banished (each being totally different). This game had me playing for 2 days, finding new features and unlocking new ways to advance your colony.\n\n* What about after that?\nOnce you unlock each (limited) "tech tree" item, passed the first planet. Your not really left with much to aim for. You will move onto a couple more planets, but your left with the same tech to unlock, the same patten of "build-reduce-increase-build more". Your only aim now is to just expand that particular colony until you question your time. You repeat the same housing, food, O2, water and energy arrangement over and over again. Creativity then become monotonous.\n\n* Well, what you you suggest?\nAgain I like these types of games, but something is missing these days with this and Banished for instance. Its lacking anything fresh, its watered down.  I get the feeling its half finished, one day the dev team gave the game a whirl and thought "thats alrite" "I'ld buy it" rather than "how about ground water levels" or "research into better robots etc". Maybe something more to manufacture.\n\n* Verdict!\nIt is a well balanced game, everything is weighed out nicely. The initial challenge is good and rewarding. But I just wished it had a little more to do, I would have liked a more adventurous dev team. I would love a game with the depth of games from times of past, but feel like they stopped half way out of boredom. Its worth the £15 and you will have fun, but like Banished (for me) you get to a point, click quit and wont be bothered with it for some time.","May 27","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Selling excess goods are a bit of an issue when you reach around population 60, always have so much starch or food. Perhaps an office to make contracts for selling supplies to a corporation?

There are few surprises once you learn the mechanics of the game, and the game allows you to fail due to dumb decisions or just dumb luck.\n\nFrom a challenge perspective, once you achieve a foundation you're most likely going to succeed unless dumb luck happens - ie days worth of no wind and storms, so your power accumulators all dry out. However, I see that as a bit of realism, we cannot always just use math and rules to predict success. I like the randomness and just having to abandon a base where you just messed up.\n\nI would like to see the game evolve even further. More complex dependencies, a bigger world, capability to teraform parts of the planet (in particular the hard levels you may find yourself surrounded by mountains making you unable to build out).  It would also be interesting to see procreation so a base could grow without having to receive immigrants. Having skill levels for the personnel would be interesting too. Anyway - you get the drift.  It's a nice game to just kills some hours with now and then.","May 29","true","187.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a lot of fun.\nIt is sort of lightweight, but you can still fiddle with certain aspects for quite some time. It does keep you busy for the time you are playing.\nThe first few hours on a planet can be harsh and sometimes growing might not be as easy as expected but the game is still beatable without having played similar games a lot before.\nI liked the setting too. It feels somewaht authentic without being overcomplicated after you got over the buildup phase.\nThe tutorial also does a quite good job telling you what you can do and what you should do. You don't need too much additional meta knowledge\nThe controls are really easy to learn. (I moved the map with wasd but you can just go to the screens borders with your mouse)\n\nThe devs are still upgrading/patching the game. not so much noticable bugfixes (i never had any sort of gamebreaking bug) but new content and tons of improvement. better displays of information, ai (esp pathfinding) improvements and many more. Don't get me wrong here. It is already a fully functional game and it looks already pretty polished and complete.

The game looks really good and the building and landscapes designs really make you feel like youre on a different planet. The game makes life that little bit harder with the addition of meteor strikes, sandstorms and solar flairs all of which add a litte bit of panic and excitment to the game, a meteor landed smack bang in the middle of a full dorm of sleeping colonists which then led to the plants not being tended to quick enough and a food shortage soon after.\n\nPlanetbase does have similarities to the game Banished, however it is certainly different enough to stand on its own. My biggest issue, which funnily enough is the same as I have with Banished, is that the game is fairly simple once you have a stable set of production buildings, not that i dont enjoy watching my litte colonists scurry around but the game needs a bit more challenge that isnt based around scarcity of resources. I would also like to be able to independly place some structures so that I can set up new colonies without haveing to link buildings across the whole map.\n\nOn the whole well worth buying, would reccomend to fans of this genre and newcomers alike\n\n8/10","November 18, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For example, resources, the way that it is generated is too unstable, and the fact that once your equipment starts deteriorating, everything begins to go downhill because the people (with a huge amount of resources to build spare parts) choose instead, to carry food to the storage room. Medics, cannot be bothered with people with injuries. Workers/ construction bots, do not carry out construction tasks when the resources needed to build the item has been met.\n\nAll in all the game is fun, the concept is not revolutionary or new, but it is interesting, perhaps it might be because of the space setting. For now, as much as I enjoy playing this game. I would not recommend this to gamers who are interested in it until the AI or perhaps a task allocation system has been added.","October 18, 2015","false","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This type of game has a shelf life, because once you figure it out it's over.\n\nIf you want to build a big base and not worry about fiddling around with it to make it work this might not be for you. Tossing buildings down with little thought is recipe for disaster. It's far less forgiving than SimCity. The game ends if you make a bad decision.\n\nIt takes patience to design a base that doesn't implode when it gets to big. Once a base starts a death spiral it can be quite hard to recover.

I doubt I'll play it again, but it passed the dollar per-hour threshold for entertainment value. I may come back to it some day, but the other reviews are pretty spot on, especially LordLeeSLR's review. In fact his review is so accurate, I'm not going to bother repeating everything he said. The game is great and challenging in the beginning, fun in the mid game, and falls apart in the endgame. However I'm giving it a thumb up because it's juuuust barely worth the price tag. If the game were $10 it would be an easy recommend. Maybe wait for a sale, don't go in with expectations too high, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.","October 29, 2015","true","22.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After all, I've played this game more than enough to actually know what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is, above all, a game of challenges. From the very moment your intrepid crew disembark, time and circumstance are against you. Life on this new world will be harsh, brutal and extremely unforgiving, and your chances of survival (especially as a newcomer) could realistically be rated somewhere between minimal and non-existent. You are completely and utterly at the mercy of the elements, of a hostile environment, of your own noobness and ineptitude, and indeed, of a bunch of often-times lazy and downright selfish colonists whom seem to delight in thwarting your efforts by placing their own immediate needs above those of the greater good... Or, to put it another way, a bunch of perfectly ordinary human beings.\n\nErgo: this is not a game for those whom get easily frustrated by not having absolute control of every little self-serving munchkin whose lives are still, ultimately, in your hands. You are not God, nor do you possess mind-control powers. You are merely the architect, the supervisor, the manager. And as managers the world over know only too well, dealing with and handling idiots and self-servers is just a fact of life... Live with it - or take your God complex to a game designed to accommodate and pander to you, as there are enough of them out there.\n\nThis is not to excuse deficiencies in the AI which can, even I admit, sometimes cause additional problems and can be extremely frustrating. These are, however, gradually being addressed by the developers (and no game, after all, is perfect). Put yourself in the above frame of mind, however, and you'll give yourself every chance of enjoying a truly captivating and rewarding sandbox game; one where you can constantly strive to learn and improve with each and every new base, set your own goals, and take great delight in overcoming all the many obstacles to finally achieve those ambitions.\n\nIt ain't perfect - no game is - but it can be one helluva lotta challenging fun for such a bargain price! Highly recommended if you enjoy resource management / development simulations and, above all, a genuine challenge. Not recommended if you get easily frustrated and are prone to rage-quit!","December 21, 2015","true","394.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The pathfinding for the various workers and others you control is almost non-existant.  After putting hours into a game I found:\n\n1. The engineers would suddenly stop making spare parts (they never really made spare parts at all, I had to purchase them from traders, but the process to load the traders ship takes 20 minutes of real time!) and then my power generators would break and all my buildings would lose power and then all my people die.\n\n2.  The biologists suddenly stop caring for your food plants and then all your crops die and then all of your people die of starvation.\n\n3.  Diversifying your power generation between solar and wind doesn't hedge your advantage to continuously generate power.  I couldn't make spare parts to fix either type of generator, the wind wouldn't blow for 30-45 minutes of real time, night time is obviously no good for solar power.  I had four large storage bays for power and went through them in approx 1.5 minutes.\n\nNot being able to control any people coupled with nonexistant pathfinding is very frustrating.\n\nGood concept, bad programming.","April 2","false","45.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While both games involve planet exploration, and creating a base, and surviving and thriving, eventually making a profit, that's where the similarity ends.  Both games play alot alike in those aspects.  And both are quite fun with the "base" demands of the game.  As they both play like Space City sims.  If you like games like Banished, or maybe even Cities:Skylines (A bit of a stretch) you would probably enjoy both games.\n\nNow for the huge differences.  Planetbase plays alot like a simulator.  The base game is a bit more difficult, as you need more juggling to keep your base alive, as more colonists arrive, you need to balance alot of aspects such as food production, Oxygen production, Electricity production, water ect.  Even though the new colonists are a welcome sign to your base, they are also a detriment.  Your colonists themselves handle as you would expect them to.  They work to the best of their abilities, but need the basics including some relaxation to keep from losing morale.  The lower their morale, or the more injuries they have, the slower they will work.  But they are astronauts, and know what their job is.  They also aren't afraid to share beds, or other equipment. You also have to grow food for your astronauts, or create bio meat for your team to survive\n\nSpace Colony on the other hand is more like Planetbase if it was on the Jerry Springer show.  The astronauts all have their own set of skills, and likes and dislikes.  The base game seems easier, but you have to deal with clashing personalities, and each astronaut has a very flamboyant personality.  And part of the job in the game is to get your astronauts to go talk to each other on couches, to help them gain friendships.  Some you get to fall in love with each other, and they all need separate assigned beds or they won't sleep.  You also have to deal with what seems like constant spawning of aliens, which will destroy your equipment in your rooms.  As far as food production, in this game, you build a mower, and you need to find plants growing on the planet and the mower turns the plants into green space juice.\n\nPersonally I find Planetbase to be the much more enjoyable game of the 2.\n\nSpace Colony 5/10\nPlanetbase 9/10","May 24","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a few structures to build, and a few componants to build in some structures. You manage only a handful of critical resources and a few sort of bonus ones, like coins or guns that make things easier but can be done without. So on the face of things, it's very simple to play, and as simple games are, easy to get bored with... but there is a catch, it really doesn't get boring at all. For all it's simplicity, as you expand your base and move from survival to thriving, the dynamics start to shift slightly. It becomes a game of balancing critical resources with less vital type resources that you can't grow or maintain a huge colony without having. Can you survive without a massive stockpile of spare parts? Of course you can... But survival is a handful of colonists in a handful of structures, not 300 colonists, countless visitors, robots, and a sprawling city's worth of buildings and support structures. The real fun begins when you get to that point. When you have to start asking yourself questions like, "How do I FEED this many people?" or "How do I expand my power grid without getting in the way of future buildings?" Then there are the colonists themselves. " How many Engineers do I need? Or Guards?"

The buildings and some of the interactionned brought back fond memories.\n\nOverall I like the game and it's mechanics, There are a few things I would change/add (detailed below), but overall the game in interesting.\n\nThere have been a few comments already about content and the initial hurdles followed by what some have referred to as boredom. This could easily be tweaked and in fact a game difficulty level could be added. That being said, I feel too many games go overboard on the constant break and fix. There is such a thing as building and stocking, not everything has to go bad every instant.\n\nOn the suggestion front;\n\nMore control should be available at all levels. In fact, a colonist "scheduler" could be an interesting adjustment to the challenge of the game.\n\nEach internal structure should be controllable individually. Giving priority should not be done just for a whole surface, but to individual machines.\n\nColonists and bots should have more self preservation reflexes.\n\nAdding a queue to the work performed by colonists and bots would also be a great enhancement, in fact this mirco managment might present a fun challenge to the game.\n\nTerrain work would also be a nice addition, so removing obstacles, fetching surface resourrces, etc..\n\nAbother possibiolity would be mountain and subterrain construction.\n\nOne thing I found to limited was actual research and developpment, instead of just being bought, reaserch could be a fun challenge as well.\n\nAdding space based systems and multiple colonies per planet is another venu that could be explored, as is multi-planet colonies and interrelated economies..\n\nDLCs or addons could also be a nice way to take this game further.\n\nA customisable quick access bar would be very nice.\n\nSo, overall positive.

While I agree that the AI needs a bit of work, the game is still playable and fun in my opinion.  Having put almost forty hours into it, I think thats a fair conclusion to make, but the game is not without its flaws which I will list in addition to the positives as well:\n\n+ Good graphics design which runs pretty smoothly.\n+ Intuitive controls and a nice tutorial for everything that isn't.\n+ Seems to be a good balance of difficulty and fun (at least for me).\n+ Plenty to micromanage but without being overwhelmed\n+ A small bit of progression as it takes milestones to unlock the other two planets which adds a sense of achievement and a reason to do well.\n\n- AI needs some work, because if just one of their needs isn't met, they refuse to work which is annoying.\n- Prioritization needs to be improved/implemented, as many of my workers will distribute materials in an order that I wish I could control and rearrange when needed.\n- Power always seems to be an issue and I wish power storage units would drain just a bit slower\n- The morale system just flat out needs to be removed in my opinion, as they start getting depressed for stupid reasons such as overpopulation despite an abundance of resources and living space.\n- Lastly, the guards should be better at fighting intruders.  My base gets raided regularly and it annoys me that for every intruder that enters the base, just as many guards are going to die and will have to be replaced.  Not to mention that people get depressed when the guards die so everyone always has some stupid reason to be sad, which again is why that whole morale system needs to be done away with.\n\nOverall the game is good in my honest opinion despite the work it needs.  I wouldn't have put so many hours into so far if I thought otherwise, but if you haven't purchased this yet and are still skeptical then wait for a sale.  If the issues that I listed get addressed and fixed, then this will get two thumbs up from me.\n\n","October 23, 2015","true","57.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately it should still be in Beta as the AI is terrible when you get to around 100 population.  Im not sure if they are going to patch this or let this awesome unfinished game go now that it's been released.\n\nTips for players on getting around the bad AI (if they dont patch it)\n- Do not create a "Loop" base where it stretches all the way around a large mountain\n- Try to keep all airlock/external structures on 1 side of your internal structure chains, do NOT build on both sides no matter how much land you are working with\n\nIf Devs are reading this review, this is one of the games problem :\n- The AI are set to go to the closest airlock to get to an External location - so when you build an airlock on 1 side of your chained internal structures and you've built something on the other side, they will go through the closest airlock and sit there and die even if there is an airlock 5 meters away which has perfect access on the other side.\n- The other problem is getting resources to your starport/airfield.  I haven't worked out the cause of this bug yet, but when you get to a large sized base, the colonists liturally go for a random walk out into the middle of no where and pace back and forth until they die...  and when they die, they drop their packages, and then more colonists go out and get stuck trying to pick up the packages.\n\nReally hope you guys can get the issues sorted as i really do love the game","October 22, 2015","true","38.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I really enjoy the challenge of starting the colony and growing it ever larger.\n\nThe biggest downfall is the faulty AI - it is a game breaker. Colonists will avoid doing any work, preferring rather to stand (idle) in connecting tubes and alternating between sleeping and eating/relaxing. External structures will go unbuilt even when they are required to be built. Food will not be managed, even though stavation is rampant ... the list goes on. At one stage I saw a group of colonists waiting to exit the Airlock, hopefully to construct a dome, but rather they immediately turned around and went back into the habitat, having performed nothing at all of the jobs outside - like carry supplies to the Storage Dome - everyone can carry things!\n\n\nAfter having played for over 2 hours, there are glaring issues with the game. I suggest the following improvement, beyond just fixing colonist AI:\n\n- Use three levels of priority (Medium/High/Critical) for ALL managment AND construction tasks (even those constructions within a dome, e.g. the Water Fountain).\n\n* Critical: only one task of each category Engineer/Medical/Biologist, at a time can/should be allowed to have Critical priority, ensuring the AI takes *immediate* notice, even if the colonist assigned to the task is starving/sleepy, etc. However, priority of the assigned colonist goes to free/idle colonists first. Those colonists that are already assigned a task are not to be considered for a priority task, unless all colonists of the same category are busy. Maybe decreasing the resulting Condition rating of the object being managed/constructed, based on the colonist's status (Normal (100% Condition)/Yellow (85%)/Orange (50%)/Red (25%)).\n\n* High: based on the required task, a specialist colonists will be promptly assigned, before he/she takes on more menial &/or personal tasks. Again, the resulting Condition rating could be affected by the working colonist's status, as above.\n\n* Medium: colonists will get to the task when there is nothing better to do, or have a higher priority task waiting for which they are specialised.\n\n\nAt the moment priority cannot be set to a higher level for the construction of buildings and this is essential within a multitasked and multi-skilled environment. While it is possible to set a specific dome to have increased priority, certain tasks within that dome also need to have their own priority rating, even if they have their status icons showing. For instance, taking care of high-maintenance plants.","October 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Previous review below.]\n\nThis is not the game it appears to be.\n\nIt looks like a Banished/Cities-type simulation, but the NPC's astonishingly narrow AI makes it more of a puzzle-solver of a game.  For example, nobody but Medics can use medical kits; if your workers are injured and you have no Medics or a landing area, you might as well just restart.  Too much functionality is limited to a specific class, and losing any of them is a gamebreaker.  They are every bit as single-minded and single-functioned as the robots they work alongside.  They aren't people; they're logical constructs to solve the equation that is the base.\n\nIt's imperative that you use your starting resources very carefully, because your base will have to be in perfect sync to start creating your own supplies (and you'll need to do that fast, before you run out of spares).  Odds are you'll need to recycle a ton of things when circumstances (low power, low water, lack of resources) back you into a corner, and that's if you can get out of it at all.\n\nI took a chance on this after reading Kotaku's enthusiastic write-up, and I regret that.  It has great potential, but the narrow-minded AI breaks not only immersion but a sense of enjoyment.  I don't know that a patch will solve what makes this game so unlike expectations -- and typically disappointing.  I have a very faint spark of hope, but until then, don't come into this expecting Banished-levels of flexibility and depth.

Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Stonehearth, and others are probably games you've tried and enjoyed. Me too, but it was the nastolgia for Sierra Entertainment's Outpost, released in 1994, that initially sparked my interest. Planetbase promised to scratch that itch for survival on a remote hostile planet, where a breakdown in logistics wasn't just a nuisance, but a death sentence for your colony as vital systems shut down one after another, your colonists choking on the cold vacuum of space.\n\nPlanetbase delivered on that promise.\n\nThe Good    An extremely active developer who listens to feedback, fixes bugs quickly, and actively addresses concerns by the community.\nA tightly interwoven crafting chain of mutually dependent resources requiring careful growth and husbanding of resources.\nA musical score that is enjoyable to focus on, but blends into the background perfectly. Changes to the music or additional sound effects from base alerts and planetary events blend in exceptionally well with the music, alerting you to changes without being disruptive.\nAn interesting and high potential building mechanic with size-variable structures limited in placement by terrain and connective tubes to existing domes.\nAn extremely intense, interesting, and exciting early-mid game.\nNeeds Progress    I feel there's a missed opportunity for story, which also impacts my next item. Why are these colonists there? Is this just a routine expansion? Overpopulation on Earth? Resource shortages? Military venture? Ground work for a terraforming project? I feel like players should be able to choose some kind of story which would in turn help with....\nLate game content is lacking. As with many in-development city-building survival titles, once you know what you're doing it's easy to get to the point where you run out of challenges beyond the (at this point) relatively simple yet time consuming task of further population growth. If the game had some background story information, it might help alleviate this.\nAI still needs work. I kind of feel guilty for adding this because, as of 1.0.6, the developer has put a TON of work into AI and its lightyears ahead of where it was when I first started playing. Still, while I'd argue the AI is "good enough" for a release at this stage, and better than the AI in many city-building survival games I've played, I'd still like to see some more optimizations.\nOverall Review\nA fantastic addition to the library of any city-building survival enthusiast who enjoys some roguelike elements. Planetbase isn't just your typical survival builder in space, with gnomes or dwarves replaced by spacesuit wearing colonists. Instead, Madruga Works has created a space colony theme that looks, feels, and plays like you're trying to get a fledgeling colony off the ground on an atmospherically hostile planet.","November 8, 2015","true","34.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They give you the ability to manage it though, what with exercise rooms and bars.\nPros: You can save whenever you want. Before you try something risky, save. It also has quick saves and auto saves. When I screwed up, it was very easy to restore and try something different.\nCons: I wish you could pause the game while laying out your base. But that's very minor, as the construction UI is very smooth.

There's a lot more depth to particular aspects of it than I first expected (the sheer number of different meals that can be produced, for example).\n\nThere is one thing that is really getting to me, however. There isn't a way to change priorities once construction blueprints are laid down. Resources will be allocated to new construction before spare parts for repairs, even if the room to create the repair parts is at a heightened priority. For someone like me who will place down multiple rooms at once and then lose because the workers mindlessly build while the energy infrastructure falls apart elsewhere, this is killing me. I was hoping for something more like Dwarf Fortress, where you could set individual workers priorities and have a dedicated repair engineer, dedicated machinist, dedicated builder, instead I have to recycle structures halfway through resource gathering because there's no other way to stop for more pressing work.\n\nAlso, the fact that specialists will carry materials (a worker's main job) but won't do anything else outside their field is something that makes losing painfully slow. My first few attempts I didn't realize this, and sat there for a good 20 minutes at 4x speed as my base slowly fell into disrepair as biologists kept everyone fed, but no engineers meant no repairs, and no medics meant no healing. I sat through it hoping adjusting priorities would get the work done, but instead they mindlessly went about their normal tasks until they asphyxiated. After I figured it out of course I was able to recognize the point of no return and restart, but it's just another lack of AI that is making me consider reinstalling Dwarf Fortress...\n\nDespite this I'm continuing to play hoping future updates make up for it.","October 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But meanwhile, after just a couple of hours, AI is getting absolutely frustrating. Permanently, those little bots and workers, which automatically run around and choose what to build, do NOT build buildings, i need to have, to be able to grow and/or survive. AI simply refuses to go to places and build there, without any obvious reason. Unfortunately, you also have no chance to manually direct your staff or order them to go to some needed places. It´s all driven by AI automatically, not happening, so you permanently need to triy-and-error from the beginning... This really need to be corrected. It´s a total game breaker for me...  :-(( If this ever gets corrected ,this game has a very big potential to be a nice one... but till now, you´d better stayaway from it...

It's a lightweight colony simulator. It's very easy to get into it. In fact the game is so easy that I feel that tutorial could be cut in half and it would be just cool. Beside that game is easy, it's also very enjoyable. Gameplay  servs small problems to the player that he has to resolve. Problems arise organically. (Need more food -> build farms -> need more water -> build water extractor -> need more energy -> build generator -> etc). It's really easy to hook up to 'I will just construct the next dome' routine. Basically, game is a quite common city/colony builder. So anyone that played simcity or anno games will quickly understand the game.\n\nGame is really pleasing and so, but it has one major problem. It's really easy. Mechanics are very simple. Even most complicated supply chain is involving 5 resources types and 3 stages (manufacturing a robot), so it's not very demanding. There are couple of basic resources (metal, bioplastic, raw food). Nearly anything in the game can be created from such resources. And since there is so few basic resources types, the only sane tactic is to make mass production of them from the very begining. After than you are ploping next structures with balance of resources in mind. This is not ideal. Mostly cause at certain poin resources will be produced faster than you can spend them on next buildings.\n\nGame has basic needs system. Basic. All colonists have the same needs for whole game. After first 30 minutes of play colonists needs don't do much. Mostly cause at that point you are just ploping next structures. Even when some kind of accident happens (meteor strikes power gen and there is no power and O2 is not produced), needs are droping so slowly that there is plenty time to react. I would be nice if needs of colonists would evolve as colony grows. For exmple, when colony has access to semiconductors colonists might want personal computers. That would greatly imporove mid-late game.\n\nAnother thing is that you can have only one base. I get that the game is called planelbase and it's about base building. But it could be interesting to have ability to create more than one base and have some specialization on them (one is a mining one and the other one grows stuff). That could be a great excuse to add vehicles. That's another issue. It's really odd that bunch of colonists would be sent to a remote planet/moon with a task of building a colony out there and they would not need to go anywher. Just stay indoors and make stuff. Some sort of exploration would be really nice. Even taking geological samples or performing experiments or something like that.\n\nThe whole game was built on good ideas. But it seems unpolished. Even the achievements feeld unpolished. withing 10h I managed to get most of them. And only 2 of remaing ones pose any kind of challenge ("Express Outpost" and "Express Colony").\n\nThere couple of events during the game tha can  occur. There can be a solar flare, sand storm, raiders and random quest. When most of them have real impact on the gameplay (solar flare will radiate colonists and it's safer to keep them indoors, sandstorm will slow them down and damage outside structures), raiders don't make much sense. It feels like this one wasn't thought out properly. They  occur really late game and when they occur you have 15+ armed guards vs 5 raiders. They will kill like 10 colonists in one part of the base but rest of the base will function just swell. It seems like a good idea to implement, but when encountered it's just not so interesting. Most annoying part is the sound of the lasors. And that would be it.\n\nThings that could be improved right now:\n\nUI has couple of things that could be improved:\n- resource/population widget could be merged into one and this way all infromation coult stay on the screen all the time rather than switching between them.\n- It's really unclear how colonization ship permits work.\n- When trading ships land it would be nice to have a list of them awaiting deals (colony with 6 starport would use that)\n\nOverall the game is really good. I most likely I will put another 10h into it. But the game could be so much better with more content in it. I would really like to see more supply-chain options, more events, more  base building options, more elaborated needs system, and much more.\n\nIf you like city/colony builders games with buy it. Don't expect level of anno. Be happy.\n\nIf not a hard fan of such games and want to spend an evening with nice game, buy it when on sale. Still nice experience.\n\nIf you are die hard call of duty player, don't buy it. Go play call of duty.","October 17, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It was promising early on -- the graphics and the challenge had me captivated.  As it turned out, the balancing act turned out far too tedious to be enjoyable.

You know it all too well.  You think you're doing well and one minor resource shortage snowballs into a dramatic collapse of civilization.\n\nSimulation games should never trap the player into positive feedback loops.\n\nPlanetbase's problems include:\n\nDynamic models for power and water production.  Planetbase has only two types of power production: solar and wind.  Solar does not produce at night while wind produces erratically depending on wind speed, which randomly fluctuates between a dead standstill and an Oklahoma F5.  Resource storage buildings are provided with the idea that you should have enough installed capacity to tide you over.  Capacity planning is not at all straightforward and I find the swings in energy production far too dramatic to be enjoyable.\n\nBad unit AI.  Workers in Planetbase are automated agents that move resources around and construct buildings.  Once all of the necessary resources have been delivered to the site of a new structure, construction commences.  However, when constructing several buildings at once, workers will often divide up your resources between them and nothing gets accomplished.  There is an option to prioritize work, but it will not cause resources already delivered to another site to be reallocated.  The Settlers series of games also suffers from this issue.  Allocation of workers and resources is not at all intuitive and leaves you longing for the ability to allocate workers with a click-and-drag of the mouse.  Selecting a worker will inform you where the worker is headed, but only with respect to the next junction.  The next time you're leaving the house and someone asks you where you are going, tell them you are going to the next bend in the hallway.\n\nI loved the ability to manage the processes carried out within structures.  Biodomes, laboratories, and factories were well done.  However, since workers are segmented into specific classes, these processes were often left without anyone to implement them.  I found it difficult to understand what my biologists were doing.  My crops were dying, and the games does nothing to help you to understand where you're going wrong.  I found myself wishing the game's mechanics were a bit more transparent.\n\nI'll play a few more games and see if my opinions change.","December 23, 2015","false","14.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There is an option to prioritize work, but it will not cause resources already delivered to another site to be reallocated.  The Settlers series of games also suffers from this issue.  Allocation of workers and resources is not at all intuitive and leaves you longing for the ability to allocate workers with a click-and-drag of the mouse.  Selecting a worker will inform you where the worker is headed, but only with respect to the next junction.  The next time you're leaving the house and someone asks you where you are going, tell them you are going to the next bend in the hallway.\n\nI loved the ability to manage the processes carried out within structures.  Biodomes, laboratories, and factories were well done.  However, since workers are segmented into specific classes, these processes were often left without anyone to implement them.  I found it difficult to understand what my biologists were doing.  My crops were dying, and the games does nothing to help you to understand where you're going wrong.  I found myself wishing the game's mechanics were a bit more transparent.\n\nI'll play a few more games and see if my opinions change.","December 23, 2015","false","14.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Excellent, excellent, job by an unknown (to this reviewer) publisher, Madruga Works.\n\n------------------\n\nLonger Review:\n\nGraphics -\nPros: It is a very good looking, clean game with good usage of flares, reflections, shadows, light and dark during night and day.\nCons: After a while all of the bubble-domes start getting repetitive, although, I have not yet build the Farm Dome so we'll see.\n\nSound -\nPros: For a build-up-a-colony game, the most you hope for is background sounds and a repetitive soundtrack that doesn't distract, but provides ambiance to the setting of the game.  Madruga Works did just that.\nCons: None.\n\nBuild Types:\nPros: Despite the all-bubble dome look, there is a good selection of build types, build-additions, etc. to make your colony unique.  Additionally, there are several types of colonist (humans & robots) which you can attract and perform various jobs.\n\nBuild Action:\nPros: The actual building up of domes and structures is pretty good.  You assign a task and the various members of society add that to their to-do list.  Materials are assembled, and the assigned task is built once things are in place.  Buildings are linked to one another for power/water/etc. and you assemble a mesh network of domes for the society.  It's a generally good system, and I would like to see it get even better.\n\nChanges I hope get made:\n1.  Actual placement of buildings is still a bit clunky in that there is a larger-than-should-be required distance between domes.  I would like to see this get reduced to 0 in some cases, such that you could adjoin two domes edge to edge.  This change would greatly enhance the game IMO.  Yes, sometimes you want a corridor, other times though, you dont.\n\n2.  There is still a builder-gets-stuck-inside-what-it's-building error.  IE - If I build 4 buildings and connect them into a square, there is a chance the builder will get stuck inside and I'll have to demo/rebuild.\n\n3.  I would like to see a large indoor water feature, eg Aquaculturing fish and clams.\n\nThat's all, overall it's a very good game that could make a leap to best in class if they can do a bit more differentiation and add more fluid design.\n\nMy colony right now:\nhttp://imgur.com/Qn2AfwL\n\nGood job, Madruga Works, good job.","October 31, 2015","true","77.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Well it has been fun so far trying to find redemption for the ill named base. Deimos E is basically self suficient.. for now.\n\nDeimos E? Whatever happened to Deimos A through D you ask? Well lets say that our colonists were behaving kinda strange... You know... small stuff like killing themselves in solar flares, wandering to long out in raging sandstorms or just ignoring mission critical tasks that would ultimately doom them to dying way younger than supposed to...\n\nOf course Its not like the base is cursed or anything, that asteroid that destroyed the first airlock on Deimos A preventing everyone inside the fledgling settlement from getting out to unload our supply filled spacecraft was just an unfortunate accident!\n\nGranted Deimos B through D also had a few minor setbacks, like when everyone suddenly decided not to build that energy collector I suggested them to build before nightfall. Sadly they ALL suffocated that night when the wind turbines could not keep up with energy demand because the wind never showed up... Of course our investigation cleared our company of any liability! Turns out the colonists were just spending way too much time outside the base wandering aimlessly picking up and dropping supplies randomly and depleted their Oxigen supplies too much... clear operator error!\n\nAnyway, I am very pleased to announce that Deimos E has suffered none of the setbacks previously mentioned. Feel free to visit us, at the moment have several open staff positions so what are you waiting for! We even discovered an ancient relic of unknown origin and will be bringing it in shortly for study!

The game has real potential but it has a TON of balancing and bug fixes that need working out first.\n\nPower generation never seems to work right. The game needs more options honestly. The wind power is not reliable at all and solar generation really isn't enough. Why not look into adding geothermal, or other options. Or maybe make the wind on your "inhospitable" planet stronger or last longer. I found myself with fields of capacitors and it still wasnt enough to hold the night if the wind died out for long enough.\n\nO2 bug? I found on huge settlements that if I lost power for some reason or another to the point where the 02 would drop, it would never come back. The plants would indicate they were working and they were more then enough before the outage? Even building new plants would not work. Air would never return and everyone would die.\n\n100 to 0... Another issue about losing power is the slow food process. If I lost power on veyr large colonies for ANY amount of time the food production would never recover. In fact the whole of the colonists would rush from one food dispenser to another in a mad rush to try to get the only food tray! Rather than you know, grow the damn food. Further more it would be the biologists, who for some reason are the only folk who can grow food. They would run back and forth trying to grab one tray of food rather than work on growing more. Perhaps setting the table so only one colonist is assigned to each tray of food when ready so not every single person is rushing for it halting ALL production if they happened to be hungry.\n\nHonestly all this issues could be fixed by taking some notes out of Banished's book. Give players the ability to assign colonists to jobs, and beds. etc. Give us the ability to disable tasks. For example: Biologist A has meat production disabled but not veggies and herbs, whereas Biologist B only has meat enabled. This way I can regulate who is making what and not have it be so random. Especially in a game where things collapse so easily.\n\nI really like this game, but I would wait for the devs to iron it out a bit more or wait for it to go on sale. 10 bucks is a bit pricey for a buggy and not very deep game.","December 19, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

So this means no more improvements to the base game which is sad. My original review below stated that this game is basically in the Alpha stage due to the lacking content and mid-end game scenarios or achievements, that is still my opinion to date. This seems like a cash grab by the devs to get more money out of people and a very poorly considered strategy if that was their intent. So my recommendation is not to buy this game until either their "expansion" is released to undertand the cost/play ratio or until they provide more valued content.\n\n*** UPDATE 2015-11-18 ***\nI made a new game and played till my base had a pop of 200. No real "issues" that are game breakers but there are a few bugs or issues that are frustrating.\n\n• The AI is still pretty weak in that it seems job queue has no consolidation routine. Example: A construction bot will carry the last resource needed to construct something but will not stay and construct the something in most cases, it goes on its way and the construction of something occurs later in the queue,which requires a subsequent trip.\n• Resources that are dropped on the ground after recycling an object will typically remain on the ground until decay if you have a significant job queue or have anything toggled for priority.\n• The meal makers don't have enough slots to really create anything more than Basic meals if you have a large variety of food being produced. Typically you need to minimize your food to a meat and either wheat or maize to maximize meal "making". Basically the more variety you have in your base food products means the greater chance your people will suffer from malnutrition, which is counter to logic.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the game has nothing to keep you interested or mid-game to end-game scenarios which makes it boring pretty quick. If the devs could add "missions" for credits or supplies or an end goal constructable like a terrraforming machine or "genesis" machine, something to keep you interested in playing, otherwise no point in playing for long.\n\n*** UPDATE AFTER AI "FIX" 2015-11-03***\nThis is still such a mess it is crazy. It isn't even just the pathing AI, it is everything with the AI. Work prioritization is bad but welfare prioritization is abismal to non-existant. Same review applies, game is no bueno.\n\n*** ORIGINAL ***\nIMO, this is not a full game, it is an Alpha or a graphically suped up mobile or facebook game with no multiplayer.\n\n• The AI for npcs is atrocious.\nPathing sucks, job/task management is near non existent and what exists is broken. There is no way to micromanage anything, and this game begs to be micromanaged.\n\n• There are no minigames, mid-game goals or end-game goals or game changing scenarios or achievements.\nSo you just trudge along building your base as big as you can with as many colonists as you can until disaster strikes.\n\n• Content is minimal.\nYou have a few selections of structures and fewer selections of internal items for those structures. As you progress it looks like more unlock, but frankly why bother trying to get there, they are just more of the same, just bigger.\n\nSomeone described this as Banished in space, as far as the game concept goes it is very similar, and Banished also doesn't have any real goals or end game achievement but the AI in Banished works well, this one does not. Oh and the mods for banished, yeah there is that.\n\nBasically this game is just tedious and frustrating until at minimum the AI is fixed and some end game goals or scenarios are included.","October 21, 2015","false","68.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

I deleted the node he was trying to work on, and he started working again.\n\nThat is it. I have built a base with everything in it, 150 population and 80 robots. That is the only AI error I have encountered.\n\nI think people are missing a core mechanic of the game and confusing it with AI not working. Let me explain.\n\nWhen your colonists needs become severe (orange  - red), they stop working. The only thing they will do is try to fulfill that need.  Guess what, if you cant fulfill that need, they wont work again. If you have no colonists that are free to work, well you lost the game. Time to rethink your build and start over.\n\nIn one negative review (the most popular one), the reviewer explains that even though his colonist was carrying food, he was starving to death and  this means the AI is garbage.\n\nWhat it really means is the reviewer does not understand the mechanics of the game let me explain. So you can only be carrying raw food which is grown in your bio sphere or in your lab. This is not ready to eat. For it to be ready to eat it needs to be delivered to your meal maker which in turn uses it to produce a meal ready for your colonists consumption. There is the possibility he may have been carrying a meal which you have imported yes. however it still needs to be carried to the meal maker for it to be consumed by a colonist.\n\nNow remember colonists wont do any work if their needs are severe, so no matter how many meals you have or raw food, if there is no meals ready in the meal maker/s, and all your colonists are starving, well its gg.\n\nOnce you understand the mechanics you make sure you are always one step ahead. Power supply, food production, meeting needs of colonists, the golden rule is dont over expand if you havent considered the impact it will have on your economy and havent sufficently upgraded your infratructure to incorporate it.\n\nBlaming poor AI in my opinion is because players do not understand the mechanics of the game. As stated in 22 hours I have had to restart maybe 6-8 times, however every time I learnt something which my made my next base much better. The reviewer also talks about The more colonists you get the more of a problem this is, however in my opinion this is the complete opposite. The more colonists you have the  easier it is to maintain colonist needs as if some stop working due to `their needs being sever others take over the work and you can in time fulfill the needs of all.\n\nYou may find it unrealistic that a colonist starves whilst there is raw food available, that is fair enough. But that is not poor AI, This is a core and valuable game mechanic, which is part of the games challenge.\n\nI hope that clears this issue up for some people.\n\n2) The game lacks depth\n\nI agree. Right now I believe there is 40-60 hours of game play here. This will involve you building all the buildings available and creating a successful base on each of the planets available right now.\n\nThere could be so much more to what is a fantastic core game. More buildings, more resources, more needs and more events. Rival planet bases inhabiting the same planet of you. And my main suggestion once all the things I have mentioned and more have been added, a campaign.\n\nI think this games is perfectly set up for a campaign each with diferent objectives etc. For example you get a base with a robot facility and X amount of semi conductors, however you can not recruit workers on this planet etc. (some tweaks to job roles maybe required but you get the idea).\n\nThe ideas mentioned could turn this game from a great little city builder with 40-60 hours of gameplay to a all time classic with 100s of hours.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite the poor reviews this is actually a highly polished and extremely cohesive and fully functioning economy/city builder simulation, which will provide you with 40-60 hours of absorbing, challenging and fun gameplay.\n\nIf you like this genre and enjoy games which are a challenge and require you to use your brain in order to progress then this really is a must buy.","October 22, 2015","true","22.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Check!\n\nThis game is a solid example of the city-builder genre. After a few patches, I feel comfortable in recommending this game to folks who enjoy the genre. The logistics of building a colony on a new planet, and keeping your citizens breathing, fed, hydrated, entertained, and happy while building your colony towards new milestones present a fun and interesting challenge.\n\nBase building reminds me somewhat of Evil Genius, in that it is an optimization problem. You'll spend most of your time laying out different modules essential to the survival and productivity of your colony. The maps will vary based on which part of the planet you land; the planet map is consistent, but each set of latitude/longitude will provide you with a different experience.\n\nAs the game advances, the logistics of maintaining a base require more efficiency and increasing threats; you will have to face down invaders who mean to kill your colonists, and have to keep ahead of the food/meal/O2 curve.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game. It's not overly complicated, but it still has some depth.","October 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I think this game has slightly less attention than it deserves, and some of the other reviews are perhaps a bit harsh.\n\nIt is indeed very difficult, but seems to become a bit easier if you play with patience and avoid expanding too  quickly. It is a fine balance to maintain. Often with city-builders you reach a point where you can expand uninhibited, but this is not the case for Planetbase. Everything needs to be in a fine balance, that I enjoy trying to maintain.\n\nA couple more tips would be nice though. The largest one I've struggled with is making food according to recipes. Feeding your colonists only basic meals will cause them to become sick. A wheat + meat strategy has worked pretty well for me, and then just some patience with expanding.\n\n8.5/10","October 19, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It has issues like most games when first released, but the developer does seem to be working through and fixing them at a fast rate. Initial problems with general AI are improving, and a lot of the bugs that were there at launch are disappearing. Although I do keep coming across the food bug where upon my colonists just stop loading the meal makers after a long play session, which in turn causes everyone to starve to death even though I have huge stockpiles of meat and veggies. A quick save and reload resolves that one though.\n\nWhy do I recommend it?  Because I've done everything the game currently has to offer, and yet I still want to play it more.  It's challenging mainly at two main points while playing; in the initial base build to get core rooms done before you run out of resources, and when you are trying to build as fast as possible to grow quickly, stretching your resources to breaking point without getting everyone killed, and there are a lot of ways to kill your colonists.\n\nTo be honest about the only thing that's really negative about the game there just isn't quite enough content, or replay value. Only 3 starting planets are available when they could probably have 100’s more. There aren’t any aliens or hostile creatures you have to cope with, or events/disasters that take place outside of the occasional human intruder, solar flare, and blizzard/sandstorm. Also as the French would say it lacks a certain "je ne sais quoi" which if you play it you'll see what I mean, it's like the game is missing some of the charm or humour you'd get from other games like "The Settlers" and at times the game just feels outright brutal when a meteor hits your massive bio dome full of biologists because your workers decided to take a 2 minute tea break from the laser defence system.  But that’s possibly a balancing issue that the developers will address. They could improve it a lot buy adding more interesting buildings for you to expand your colony with so that your colonists can do something other than just try to survive. If they opened the game up for modding I’m sure that’s one of the top things that modders would add along with new locations.\n\nUltimately you'll get your money's worth if you purchase the game and try to complete the steam achievements, but not much else, which for a game of this type is a little disappointing. It's like the developers have built a core game, and released it with the thought to make some money while they make the real version as a sequel which has all the bells and whistles, which in today's games market is understandable if not entirely wanted. Still it’s a decent game that’ll be keeping an eye on to see if it becomes a great game.\n","October 29, 2015","true","99.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In comparisim of the difficulty between build sim games (I played), Banished, Anno 2070 and Planetbase.\n\nPlanetbase is  probably on par with Banished for me.\nAI in Banished seems a little better for me. But in Planetbase, the AI system really hates me and frustrates me the most, where a Engineer/Bot constructs one building but not the other next to it. For example they choose to build the building but not the connector afterwards. Especially on startups and in a crisis where you need that particular building to be built. Workers tend to be a little inefficient due to the many things they do (mostly anything that involves hard labor). Piority tab is just something for you to click on but its up to the AI to do your bidding while you are watching them in agony. They also tend to build the things that are closest to the spacepot at start up and from the base after you got it built up.\n\nI was also hoping that there would be some sort of a slidebar that controls the efficency of the AI Humans (by category) and Robots to do their jobs better.\n\nWhat I do hope in the future for a patch or expansion (which may or may not happen)\n- AI System taskbar to control the efficiency of the Humans AI and Robots.\n- A piority queue system? Something lets your workers know what to build next and what not.\n- Another panel for the Alert system for easy access once you build of the Control Centre.\n- Tweaking of the Human AI with Negative Status, they should be working on half efficiency instead of completely dropping their task and Idelling around the base.\n- Machines that uses materials should go first instead of Buildings.\n- Some sort of Emergency Back up Generator to last through the day? (Or half a day depending on how much power has been stored in it.)\n(There is probably more to add but this is the best I could come up after unlocking the second planet.)\n\nIn the end, Planetbase is a management game with a huge hope of luck that 'stuff does not happen' when you are just starting up your game. For example, Worker getting an injury when you got no Medbay to cure him, Random Meteor hitting onto your SolarPanel/Wind Turbine/Power Storage and situation where you really want natural wind to blow across the globe but does not do that. *Especially on the 2nd Planet which I am currently on.*\n\nBut once your base has been built up for all self-producing machines or up to Medicine/Spare Parts for your Wind Turbines and Solar Panels. You are pretty much set and have to be cautious of keeping your power management up and expand cautiously. Only time I had trouble was multiple intruders attacking my base while I was in the middle of setting some furnitures down for my Dorms. I had to back track everything to the start of the menu and towards the Security section to put on High Alert for my guards.\n\nIn other words, if you like Management games that are really hard, about the same levels of FTL and Banished. Go for this game. It takes a couple of times of trial and errors to know which to build first and hope for the best of nothing happens. If you are uncertain of it, ask a friend who has it to let you try a game or two. Though be warned that a good game can take a couple of hours to get it right to your playstyle.\n\nCheers to all playing as well and fingers cross on random encounters in the game.","October 19, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Of course like most games of this genre, once you get the basics down, the challenges become limited.  However this game does have difficulty levels and some of the achievements are certainly difficult.  In that respect it is better than banished.  There are only 8 research techs to buy in the game, I wish there was a few more.  I wish there was a few more buildings as well.  But as a whole it's a great base building game, I love the graphical style and gameplay.  I'm hoping to finish all the achievements.  It's certainly  way better than Space Base DF-9.\n\nManaging your spare parts and food are key and getting expensive robots up and going is a real challenge.  The robots can supplement your workforce a great deal but take time and considerable resources to acquire enough to really make your base run flawlessly.  Overall I love the little challenges that you can make for yourself.  Getting a base going after you learned the basics is easy enough and once you get going it's hard to screw up, just like Banished.  The most fun part of the game is actually optimizing everything once you get going.  You learn slightly new things from every base you build and your next base is almost always better.  All in all I'd give it an 8/10.  If they ever add more researches and buildings, I'll easily give in a 9 or 10.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews, I haven't experienced nearly the amount of trouble other people have had.  It may be due to a pathfinding update they did recently before I had even played.  If you were frustrated with the game before, you should probably try again.

After noticing that I've logged 149 hours on this game already, I feel compelled to write a review.\n\nPlanetbase is a surprisingly difficult and addictive colony building game where you must master resource management and build order so your 5-8 starting colonists won't die after their first day on their new planet. You start with a stockpile of different resources from your landing pod and your colonists serve as labor to assign those resources to buildings and actually construct the buildings. It takes a lot of work and a little bit of luck, however, before you have the infastructore to start producing your own resources, so proper management of your starting resources is absolutely vital.\n\nThe game takes place on one of 3 planets that you can unlock as you progress and hit certain milestones on preceding planets. Each planet has its own special weather systems which create unique atmospheric difficulties for your colony (i.e. the ice world is heavily clouded so solar panels don't work as well). This increases replay value since each subsequent planet is more difficult to start on (on later planets, you start with less colonists and resources). Overall, this game was a delight and well worth the 10 bucks I paid for it, but it does seem incomplete. Specifics below:\n\nPros\n1. Excellent balance of resource and time management creates an extremely challenging early game.\n2. Graphics and the (simple) soundtrack create a fun mood for building\n3. This game is insanely addicting.\n\nCons\n1. Once you become self-sufficient, there's no real challenge to hinder your base expansion in the mid-late game\n2. individual structures could have more detail and/or variety (i.e. no restrooms anywhere in the colony?!)","November 17, 2015","true","157.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The game is difficult and if you don't work fast you easily fail very early on in the game. The fact that you have limited suplies makes it even more difficulte and forced you to use your resources wisely. These are two things I really enjoy about the game. It's not just a click-and-drop and forces you to actually play strategically.\n\nAnother thing I love about it is the ability to build items inside various domes. This is certainly a novel concept I hadn't seen in games like this before. The falling meteors and their ability to damage your buildings is also a nice touch as well.\n\nNegatives: There is so little time to get even the most baisic starting structures in place (Airlock, O2 Generator, Solar Panel, Water (forgot the word), and Power Storage). I enjoy that it is difficult, but at least a tiiiiny bit more time in the beginning would be nice.\n\nWhen you get further into the game it's also difficult to get anyone to do anything. For instance, I needed Bioplastic, had all the people, resources, buildings, and items necessary to do it, but no one would? This gets very frustrating when you are running out of one resource or another and need to build something fast.\n\nThe buildings that you can build are also limited. The game is still technically being developed I believe, so this might change later (logging in today I did notice that the space suits on the people had changed, so I hold out hope, at least). Still, the limitation does such just a tad bit. I wash there was a little more to in terms of building items.\n\nYou do also have the ability to rotate planets and choose the LL of where you start out. I've noticed little difference in doing so, though. Another thing I wish is that this actually affected gameplay on the planet. If it does, so far I haven't noticed it. Also having the ability to scan the LL location to see the Topography would be nice. Since you cannot demolish, level, or otherwise build on the mountainous areas it is very easy to back yourself into a corner when building- especially if you are unlucky enough to have it generate a super small area that's buildable (like I have on occasion). Given this, taking even a short amount of time to look around your area to plan a strategy takes too much valuable time when starting out, so being able to scan for sufficient areas on the plant would be a nice perk to counteract that.\n\nIt's difficult and challenging for certain, but in some ways it's too challenging. Still. All in all, I am very excited to see where this game goes.","November 27, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't use the word "Sim" because If you are digging into the pros and cons of this game then I think you will find the biggest negative is depth, you can do just a fraction of what you could do in something like SimCity or Cities etc.\n\nOn the flip side, that is only a con if that is what you are expecting and looking for in this game IMO, Planetbase is only $20 and it should provide you with twice that in hours of fun, what it lacks in depth it makes up for in catchy graphics, base building, trading, helping travelers etc with enough freedom of how you build things to keep you on your toes from start until self efficiency (another reason why I say arcade over Sim, it feels a bit more action orientated to me).\n\nUntil you play a bit you might find starting out a little challenging, one suggestion that stood out for me with this game was "take it slow", it's to easy in this game to try and build (and/or process) too many things at the same time dividing up resources and taking everything longer to build/process and a LOT of times (especially at the start), time is key if you are losing power or water or waiting for spares. Try to focus on what you need "now" and just think of the next thing once you have all/most of the the resources for whatever you are currently doing.\n\nAlso, make sure you create the means to make metal before you use all the metal you start with or, well, game ova!","November 11, 2015","true","185.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I picked it up a few days ago and have quite enjoyed my time with it so far.\n\nThere are a few issues but none that I have encountered that hurt my experience too badly.\n\nThe colonist AI could be tweaked a bit more but it seems like the Devs are working diligently on this.\n- In 1.0.5 I had 10 or so colonists starve to death because they would not stop taking items to a trading ship long enough to eat (I had back to back ships where I attempted to offload tons of items). It was kind of funny since the path they had to take was only a few modules and they had to walk through a canteen  filled to the brim with food.\n\nI have only loaded a few maps on planet 1, but I seem to end up surrounded by hills and mountains most of the time which severely limits the area that can be built on.\n- Luckily I found a few tricks that help mitigate this. You can use pads, mines, and connections to flatten terrain and cut paths through some hills to get to other flat areas. Placing a mine on the other side of a hill and connecting it to an exterior module will place a 'path' that flattens out the hill in that spot. Repeating this can lead to extensive landscape adjustment.\n\nIn one of my first games my colony ended up dieing out. My only starting engineer was unlucky enough to be crushed by a meteor and my construction bot broke down before I could build a Landing Pad so I was left with no ability to build new structures and was not yet at a self sufficient stage.\n\nThere is a lot of room for expansion in this game as new modules and hazards can probably be added relatively easily.\n\ntl;dr  A fun base building space game to pass the time.

Of course like most games of this genre, once you get the basics down, the challenges become limited.  However this game does have difficulty levels and some of the achievements are certainly difficult.  In that respect it is better than banished.  There are only 8 research techs to buy in the game, I wish there was a few more.  I wish there was a few more buildings as well.  But as a whole it's a great base building game, I love the graphical style and gameplay.  I'm hoping to finish all the achievements.  It's certainly  way better than Space Base DF-9.\n\nManaging your spare parts and food are key and getting expensive robots up and going is a real challenge.  The robots can supplement your workforce a great deal but take time and considerable resources to acquire enough to really make your base run flawlessly.  Overall I love the little challenges that you can make for yourself.  Getting a base going after you learned the basics is easy enough and once you get going it's hard to screw up, just like Banished.  The most fun part of the game is actually optimizing everything once you get going.  You learn slightly new things from every base you build and your next base is almost always better.  All in all I'd give it an 8/10.  If they ever add more researches and buildings, I'll easily give in a 9 or 10.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews, I haven't experienced nearly the amount of trouble other people have had.  It may be due to a pathfinding update they did recently before I had even played.  If you were frustrated with the game before, you should probably try again.  Overall the pathfinding seems pretty good to me.","November 16, 2015","true","28.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

After noticing that I've logged 149 hours on this game already, I feel compelled to write a review.\n\nPlanetbase is a surprisingly difficult and addictive colony building game where you must master resource management and build order so your 5-8 starting colonists won't die after their first day on their new planet. You start with a stockpile of different resources from your landing pod and your colonists serve as labor to assign those resources to buildings and actually construct the buildings. It takes a lot of work and a little bit of luck, however, before you have the infastructore to start producing your own resources, so proper management of your starting resources is absolutely vital.\n\nThe game takes place on one of 3 planets that you can unlock as you progress and hit certain milestones on preceding planets. Each planet has its own special weather systems which create unique atmospheric difficulties for your colony (i.e. the ice world is heavily clouded so solar panels don't work as well). This increases replay value since each subsequent planet is more difficult to start on (on later planets, you start with less colonists and resources). Overall, this game was a delight and well worth the 10 bucks I paid for it, but it does seem incomplete. Specifics below:\n\nPros\n1. Excellent balance of resource and time management creates an extremely challenging early game.\n2. Graphics and the (simple) soundtrack create a fun mood for building\n3. This game is insanely addicting.\n\nCons\n1. Once you become self-sufficient, there's no real challenge to hinder your base expansion in the mid-late game\n2. individual structures could have more detail and/or variety (i.e. no restrooms anywhere in the colony?!)","November 17, 2015","true","157.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

(Disregard my grammar skills Im a tard)\n1. Prioritizing tasks with colonists/robots\nThe colonists basically have no free will or any sort of thought processes at all so when you start to build something their will be a random selection that will go and do the task which is usually fine but if one has really low hunger and they go out theres really no way of preventing them from doing the task without recycling the building.\n2. Malnu♥♥♥♥INGtrition\nThis was a big problem for me I dont know why maybe im just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid but I didnt know it was a thing until the one person who could fix it got it. This person was the medic. After he got malnutrition he just said ♥♥♥♥ it ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥ this and just decided to not do his job at all. I couldnt get different foods out fast enough for him to get better so everyone else got it too. In turn everyone else started dicking around neglecting their jobs which eventually led to death.(BTW the medic should be able to administer his own health packs without being at a bed or anything)\n3. Starting resource number\nOk listen... Im ♥♥♥♥ at video games. I dont really know how to handle the amount of resources they give you off the bat, now im not saying make it bigger but at least make it a number that we can change from the beginning. Also I don't know if im doing this wrong or what but the colonists never seem to store the extra food they make. It just piles up around the biodome waiting for use which really isnt a problem until you make too much food, but it looks bad at times.\n\nWell for now this is all I can really think of if you are decent at citybuilder type games like this than you shouldnt have too many problems but if you're a pleb like me then you might have some trouble. The game really is fun if you get it right and get past self-sustaining and keep thriving but if you mess up even 1 thing you can ruin everything fairly quickly.\nI do reccomend buying this game while it's on sale and for how the game plays all around it is pretty fun.

It is a fine balance to maintain. Often with city-builders you reach a point where you can expand uninhibited, but this is not the case for Planetbase. Everything needs to be in a fine balance, that I enjoy trying to maintain.\n\nA couple more tips would be nice though. The largest one I've struggled with is making food according to recipes.

It's incredibly similar to Banished, if more in depth. That comes with the problems and plusses alike.\n\nIf you liked Banished, this game is for you. If you like games that mix city building with puzzles, this game is for you. If you can make your own goals for basic games, this game is perfect for you. Really, this game is a great mesh of city and puzzle, requiring some thought for long term growth and layout.\n\nHowever, this game is not for everyone. It will get boring to some people after two hours, and it does have some objective flaws. The UI is minimalistic, but shouldn't be, the hills look silly, you don't get a ton of information about how each job is going. Banished avoided all of these problems, but it's not in space and has slightly less depth.\n\nFor $16, I'd buy this game if I enjoyed classic city builders. For $20, I would buy it if I liked Banished and space.","October 18, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Planetbase is considerably more streamlined in several ways:\n\n* Everybody comes with a job pre-assigned.  Biologists grow food, Engineers build things, Medics heal people, Guards fight intruders, and so on.  You cannot reassign them to other jobs, so if you have a shortage of a given profession then you can just hope more come to visit.\n* The natural resources consist of ore, water, sunlight, and wind.  They are pretty much the same wherever you go, so the importance of geography is greatly mitigated, in the end it just determines where you can or cannot expand your base.\n* There are no seasons.  You're on a inhospitable planet that is constantly being hit by meteors, sometimes has sand storms, sometimes has solar flares, that's pretty much it.\n* Stockpiles are not manually managed, stuff pretty much goes wherever the nearest available cargo bay is.\n* Food is pretty much either meat or vegetables, there's different types but the difference seems to be mostly cosmetic.\n\nOne thing Planetbase does very well is cut a very tight balancing act between the three resources:\n\n1. Power.  The means of generation is unreliable, so you strike a balance between solar and wind and hope for the best.  When this fails, you'll desperately build more power generators and/or batteries.\n2. Life Support.  When you allow too many colonists to come before you have food supply to catch up, people will start starving, so you'll desperately need to build more means of producing and serving food.  Oxygen and water are also a concern, but easier to resolve due to reliable means of production.\n3. Expansion.  There's only two things to expand with, metal and plastic, but the tricky bit here is that a lot of it will be spent on maintenence (such as "spares" to keep your power generators running).  Consequently, you'll find yourself desperate to expand sometimes, but unable to do so because all your resources are being eaten by maintenence.\n\nYou'll seesaw back and forth for hours and hours just trying to get the balancing act between the three resources running right.  The whole game is just that and resolving good placement as your base expands.\n\nAside from its general simplicity, the only things that bothered me about it was how there's no way to heal your only medic if he becomes injured and also that the colonists seem to path to the nearest airlock even if it's on the other side of a long base.  The AI of the colonists generally does a good job of occupying itself at all times, thanks in part to resources constantly sprouting somewhere in need of moving, although sometimes I do find myself frustrated they won't produce a vital resource even if it's marked "high priority" just because something else is eating up the resources needed to make it.\n\nIn the end, I give Planetbase a thumbs up for being a technically smoothly-executed base builder that runs just fine for what it set out to do.   Base builders like Bansihed or Towns are more interesting in that they give you finer control over the construction of your colony and more resources to juggle, but they are also buggier than Planetbase, which was rock solid for me.  I also appreciate that Planetbase is Sci-Fi, as I'm sort of bored of medieval fantasy fare.  I'd probably rate Planetbase closer to 75% if Steam gave me a choice, but for less than $20 it's hard to complain.","October 17, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As such it has the same appeal, as well as the same problems and limitations. Once you figure it out, it isn't that hard, and once you reach a certain point, there isn't much more to do. The main difference is that space (heh...) is the main problem here. The maps feel fairly small, especially compared to the huge maps you could never hope to fill out in Banished.\n\nI don't imagine I will be pouring 100+ hours into this, but for what it is, and for what it does, it does it damned well. I've been hoping for a good space city builder for a while, and although I would have wished for something more expansive, this does the job well enough.

The logistics of building a colony on a new planet, and keeping your citizens breathing, fed, hydrated, entertained, and happy while building your colony towards new milestones present a fun and interesting challenge.\n\nBase building reminds me somewhat of Evil Genius, in that it is an optimization problem. You'll spend most of your time laying out different modules essential to the survival and productivity of your colony. The maps will vary based on which part of the planet you land; the planet map is consistent, but each set of latitude/longitude will provide you with a different experience.\n\nAs the game advances, the logistics of maintaining a base require more efficiency and increasing threats; you will have to face down invaders who mean to kill your colonists, and have to keep ahead of the food/meal/O2 curve.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game. It's not overly complicated, but it still has some depth.","October 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TosheSenshi/recommended/403190/","TosheSenshi","Sir PaperSamurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TosheSenshi/","258 products in account","Great game for starters.\n\nIt is a game with players going through many heart wrenching(not emotionally), mind breaking, hair tearing, eye poking, intense sweating and swearing on many situations. In comparisim of the difficulty between build sim games (I played), Banished, Anno 2070 and Planetbase.\n\nPlanetbase is  probably on par with Banished for me.\nAI in Banished seems a little better for me. But in Planetbase, the AI system really hates me and frustrates me the most, where a Engineer/Bot constructs one building but not the other next to it. For example they choose to build the building but not the connector afterwards. Especially on startups and in a crisis where you need that particular building to be built. Workers tend to be a little inefficient due to the many things they do (mostly anything that involves hard labor). Piority tab is just something for you to click on but its up to the AI to do your bidding while you are watching them in agony. They also tend to build the things that are closest to the spacepot at start up and from the base after you got it built up.\n\nI was also hoping that there would be some sort of a slidebar that controls the efficency of the AI Humans (by category) and Robots to do their jobs better.\n\nWhat I do hope in the future for a patch or expansion (which may or may not happen)\n- AI System taskbar to control the efficiency of the Humans AI and Robots.\n- A piority queue system? Something lets your workers know what to build next and what not.\n- Another panel for the Alert system for easy access once you build of the Control Centre.\n- Tweaking of the Human AI with Negative Status, they should be working on half efficiency instead of completely dropping their task and Idelling around the base.\n- Machines that uses materials should go first instead of Buildings.\n- Some sort of Emergency Back up Generator to last through the day? (Or half a day depending on how much power has been stored in it.)\n(There is probably more to add but this is the best I could come up after unlocking the second planet.)\n\nIn the end, Planetbase is a management game with a huge hope of luck that 'stuff does not happen' when you are just starting up your game. For example, Worker getting an injury when you got no Medbay to cure him, Random Meteor hitting onto your SolarPanel/Wind Turbine/Power Storage and situation where you really want natural wind to blow across the globe but does not do that. *Especially on the 2nd Planet which I am currently on.*\n\nBut once your base has been built up for all self-producing machines or up to Medicine/Spare Parts for your Wind Turbines and Solar Panels. You are pretty much set and have to be cautious of keeping your power management up and expand cautiously. Only time I had trouble was multiple intruders attacking my base while I was in the middle of setting some furnitures down for my Dorms. I had to back track everything to the start of the menu and towards the Security section to put on High Alert for my guards.\n\nIn other words, if you like Management games that are really hard, about the same levels of FTL and Banished. Go for this game. It takes a couple of times of trial and errors to know which to build first and hope for the best of nothing happens. If you are uncertain of it, ask a friend who has it to let you try a game or two. Though be warned that a good game can take a couple of hours to get it right to your playstyle.\n\nCheers to all playing as well and fingers cross on random encounters in the game.","October 19, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has issues like most games when first released, but the developer does seem to be working through and fixing them at a fast rate. Initial problems with general AI are improving, and a lot of the bugs that were there at launch are disappearing. Although I do keep coming across the food bug where upon my colonists just stop loading the meal makers after a long play session, which in turn causes everyone to starve to death even though I have huge stockpiles of meat and veggies. A quick save and reload resolves that one though.\n\nWhy do I recommend it?  Because I've done everything the game currently has to offer, and yet I still want to play it more.  It's challenging mainly at two main points while playing; in the initial base build to get core rooms done before you run out of resources, and when you are trying to build as fast as possible to grow quickly, stretching your resources to breaking point without getting everyone killed, and there are a lot of ways to kill your colonists.\n\nTo be honest about the only thing that's really negative about the game there just isn't quite enough content, or replay value. Only 3 starting planets are available when they could probably have 100’s more. There aren’t any aliens or hostile creatures you have to cope with, or events/disasters that take place outside of the occasional human intruder, solar flare, and blizzard/sandstorm. Also as the French would say it lacks a certain "je ne sais quoi" which if you play it you'll see what I mean, it's like the game is missing some of the charm or humour you'd get from other games like "The Settlers" and at times the game just feels outright brutal when a meteor hits your massive bio dome full of biologists because your workers decided to take a 2 minute tea break from the laser defence system.  But that’s possibly a balancing issue that the developers will address. They could improve it a lot buy adding more interesting buildings for you to expand your colony with so that your colonists can do something other than just try to survive. If they opened the game up for modding I’m sure that’s one of the top things that modders would add along with new locations.\n\nUltimately you'll get your money's worth if you purchase the game and try to complete the steam achievements, but not much else, which for a game of this type is a little disappointing. It's like the developers have built a core game, and released it with the thought to make some money while they make the real version as a sequel which has all the bells and whistles, which in today's games market is understandable if not entirely wanted. Still it’s a decent game that’ll be keeping an eye on to see if it becomes a great game.\n","October 29, 2015","true","99.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't use the word "Sim" because If you are digging into the pros and cons of this game then I think you will find the biggest negative is depth, you can do just a fraction of what you could do in something like SimCity or Cities etc.\n\nOn the flip side, that is only a con if that is what you are expecting and looking for in this game IMO, Planetbase is only $20 and it should provide you with twice that in hours of fun, what it lacks in depth it makes up for in catchy graphics, base building, trading, helping travelers etc with enough freedom of how you build things to keep you on your toes from start until self efficiency (another reason why I say arcade over Sim, it feels a bit more action orientated to me).\n\nUntil you play a bit you might find starting out a little challenging, one suggestion that stood out for me with this game was "take it slow", it's to easy in this game to try and build (and/or process) too many things at the same time dividing up resources and taking everything longer to build/process and a LOT of times (especially at the start), time is key if you are losing power or water or waiting for spares. Try to focus on what you need "now" and just think of the next thing once you have all/most of the the resources for whatever you are currently doing.\n\nAlso, make sure you create the means to make metal before you use all the metal you start with or, well, game ova!","November 11, 2015","true","185.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even to start out though, it is very challenging. It's very much akin to any city builder game but here you manage things in such that you end up learning that you can't just plop anything and everything down all at once. You have to be strategic (for real) to get anywhere with this. I wouldn't recommend this game to any kid that's desperate to win a game. There is no winning here. It's just building, maintaining and watching things work together and grow. The graphics are superp and the game never crashes which is a nice thing. No freezing or anything. It's all random. Of course the AI is somewhat predictable but not entirely. Where even if you try to control where they go or what they do, other things can happen completely changing your course forward from that moment on. What will happen exactly? I'll never tell.","November 1, 2015","true","191.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I picked it up a few days ago and have quite enjoyed my time with it so far.\n\nThere are a few issues but none that I have encountered that hurt my experience too badly.\n\nThe colonist AI could be tweaked a bit more but it seems like the Devs are working diligently on this.\n- In 1.0.5 I had 10 or so colonists starve to death because they would not stop taking items to a trading ship long enough to eat (I had back to back ships where I attempted to offload tons of items). It was kind of funny since the path they had to take was only a few modules and they had to walk through a canteen  filled to the brim with food.\n\nI have only loaded a few maps on planet 1, but I seem to end up surrounded by hills and mountains most of the time which severely limits the area that can be built on.\n- Luckily I found a few tricks that help mitigate this. You can use pads, mines, and connections to flatten terrain and cut paths through some hills to get to other flat areas. Placing a mine on the other side of a hill and connecting it to an exterior module will place a 'path' that flattens out the hill in that spot. Repeating this can lead to extensive landscape adjustment.\n\nIn one of my first games my colony ended up dieing out. My only starting engineer was unlucky enough to be crushed by a meteor and my construction bot broke down before I could build a Landing Pad so I was left with no ability to build new structures and was not yet at a self sufficient stage.\n\nThere is a lot of room for expansion in this game as new modules and hazards can probably be added relatively easily.\n\ntl;dr  A fun base building space game to pass the time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitIsGoingdown/recommended/403190/","ShitIsGoingdown","Mia Ishata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitIsGoingdown/","186 products in account","So Planetbase, first time i have heard about this game is after i found a video on Youtube of someone introducing it. As i saw the gameplay i was totally convinced this is my sort of thing, even tho he only showed the start of it.\n\nSo now i bought it and sunk multiple hours in it and i must say, for a non-early access im abit dissapointed.\n\nI wont write a big wall of text so i make it short.\n\nThe major problem is the AI of each colonist in the game. Sometimes they take the longest possible Paths or ignore priority of certain functions they have to fulfill. I wouldnt say i didnt find any more problems then this and give it a good rating but the AI is so bad it will kill your entire gameplay experience.\n\nNow for the long part!\n\nHow to fix this? Well only the dev can do it, but you and me can find solutions for it and suggest changes. And so i will.\n\n1. "Uh.. What am i doing? Where do i work? Ah i will just idle in the corridor here."\nProbably my biggest issue here. While i see its the appeal of the game just to set everything up for your little AI minions to do their own thing with, it does certainly not help the game out. The only priority control you get is for some workplaces and yet-to-be-built domes, even with that its not sufficient of how you can plan on getting enough susitance for your colonists. Building things is always prioritized even tho the same materials are required to build important components like Spare Parts. So Dev, please, Give us a function where we can assign staff to certain room/functions to have them stop wandering all over the place!\n\n2. "I just ate.. well i guess i can go eat some more anyway."\nProblem here is that alot of times Colonists would go and consume any resource of time to use a bed or something like that to replenish their lil Bars, even tho these are still in the green. Not only does it waste the food you accumulated. It also prevents them from working efficient, espicially when they have longer walkpaths. To fix this is easy, let them go for what they need only if the status reaches the red or orange area. If those reach 0 they shouldnt just die like that, how about a healthbar or them refusing to work until they got what they want?\n\n3. "Sheesh dude, when i go to work to maintain all those vegies, i must always walk some sort of marathon!"\nNoteable issue here is that you cannot easily replace buildings or upgrade their size to create more efficient room, most importantly Biodomes for food. You will end up building like 3 over a large scale of your base which has a siginificant issue with the AI of your botanists. Sometimes one of them does not get required maintenance and sometimes they even ignore the domes they are close to just to work on one far away. Unless you have already a plan on how best to build with said efficienty a fix would be the one i mentioned in issue 1.\n\n4. "Outage again? Damn this electricity system is wonky nowdays.."\nWhile i cant say this is a major issue but its something that needs to be adressed. Often times you will notice outages during the night because (obviously) your solar panels cant give you any energy on it. So you end up building Windmills right? Well, yeah, if you are lucky enough to have wind happening during the night. I fixed this problem by building alot.. a unneccesary lot of Energy storages to make sure i make it through the night, but those ended up taking so many building materials that my gameplay experience was slowed down a bunch. I ended up using windmills only to reduce the loss of power during the night if i didnt have enough resources to keep up with the power-storages. So.. A fix? Well one idea would be is to give the storages more carrying capacity. Or have electricity you created be more efficient (Use less over time.) Of course another source of electricity would help too.\n\nThis is more of a review of the games issues, so i will not rate the game, but i definitly recommend to follow it if it still recieves its share of development. I did notice it still recieves updates and i hope my opinion gets recognized, not just for me but for those with the same issues like i have.","February 8","true","30.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I didn't really get a good feel for the game then and some of the footage lead me to believe the game really wasn't all that great.  I ended up grabbing the game after weeks of inner debate and to my surprise it was quite addicting and really good.\n\nThis game mixes together a few different styles and did so nicely.  At times I get a little SimCity feeling and other moments I feel like I'm playing Command and Conquer.\n\nSadly it doesn't seem like there will be any new additions to the game in the future, according to a dev post on the forum.  For the price this game is listed for I'd still recommend getting it anyway if you like RTS and base-building.\n\nLastly, I'd like to note that after the many hours I've played this game I have yet to experience a single bug or performance isssue.  The game runs smooth and loads quite fast.  One of the biggest complains people have of this game is the AI is dumber than a box of rocks, and sadly that part is somewhat true.  90% of the time the AI seemed to work fine for me but there were moments where the AI just seemed to go nuts and forget how to make food, eat, drink water, and sleep.

Your colony will still fail eventually due to random events.\nI tried to give this game a serious go, but even once I learned the highly illogical way the lemming like colonist suicided themselves by walking out the furthest airlock from their objectives, I continued to run across numerous bugs like trade ships leaving before they finished trading, dumping hundreds of items on the launch pad or colonists wondering off away from the base in droves because they could not figure out pathing to their objectives despite me having built multiple paths within my base leading to numerous airlocks. Carrier bots idle when there is stuff stacking up in farms despite me having ample storage facilities close by, Workers going off to work in a mine or processing plant despite me having the security building set to a priority, so radar dishes go unmanned and meteors continue to slam into my base every 5 or 10 minutes.\nColonists have to be told not to go outside in a sandstorm or during a solar flare. This isn't something people want to do naturally? Not die?\nInvaders come more often than trade ships, despite my prestige only being 300/1000.\nFrequent bugs where colonists will suddenly stop bringing resources to a build site despite having over 100 in both metal and bioplastics. I have a lab and an airlock that have not been built in over 3 hours of waiting. I have over 300 colonists and have built several other building in that time, but these structures are ignored after they bring one or two items to them.\nI have had 4 ships in a row land with invaders which ends up killing all my guards through attrition and colonists do not arrive fast enough to replace them. And why the hell do invaders come anyway?They have zero chance of taking over the base and they all die every time. It's like a colombine situation where they just want to kill as many people as they can before they die. If they really want to take over the base all they have to do is wait. All bases fail at some point due to random events. So invaders are just wasting their lives trying to take them by force.\nThe EXTREME difficulty of this game is trollish at best.\nThe creator left no way to adjust the diffculty off the stupidly difficult default.\nColonist die instantly if they run out of food even if there are vegetables staked 3 high in the farm or storage, solar flares cause radiation poisoning that wipe out half your colonist, sand storms are almost daily and cause so much damage to equipemtnt that you WILL run out of power at some point because solar panels and wind turbines with 10-15 year lifespans on Earth will become usless in a week on this starter planet unless you have an endless supply of spare parts. (Not even close to an exaggeration. 5 days and they start breaking down.)\nColonists whom are starving will not eat food that is ready to get right off the plants or stacks of it in storage. If you do not have the exact ratio of colonist/structures/materials. You end up with a failed colony after the first accident, which there are far too many.\nThere is no margin for error and this game, which had huge potential for people who like building games, fails on every level because it boils down to a game for people who like punishment. Because the game will punish you over and over and over for the slightest mistake.\nAnd don't dare try to apply any sort of logic to any part of your strategy. The game does not make any kind of sense in that regard. The colonists have no will to live. In fact they are constantly trying to die and you have to micromanage them to keep them alive, but you don't even have most of the tools you need to properly micromanage them. No way to tell a specific colonist to do a specific task and nothing else. They do as they please. Even if it means they and the whole colony will die.\nAll in all this game is a collosal disappointment and would have been a lot of fun if the creators were not hell bent on making it an insanely hard challenge just to keep your power generators from falling apart in a week.\nIf they patch in a way to turn off all the insane events and drop the stupid maintenance schedule, this game could be fun to play. But even if you get your base going, eventually there is nothing to do because the game is more focused on destroying your colony than actually building one. Most structures don't even have advanced forms and you could really use giant sozed power collectors and water extractors, bigger O2 generators, dorms and airlocks capable of allowing more than a single person at a time trough it. (Even though the ones they have look big enough for 5 people to git inside.)\nRight now it's just frustrating. nothing makes sense. Trees that use up oxygen at night even though the farm they are in still uses full power so the lights are still on, so the tree should produce oxygen 24/7. the tomatoes right next to the tree continue to grow, but somehow the tree has entered a phase of darkness in full lighting. Farms also produce no oxygen. you need about 1 water fountain for every 10 colonists. My highschool had about 1 water fountain for every 500 students.\nAnd these are just the crazy things that make no sense. The random events are worse.\nThere are events you can do NOTHING to stop. And those events just end the game destroying your colony. You can't do anything to prevent them.\nSolar flare pops up and fries all your medics. Had 5 of them, but they all got radiation poisoning and can not heal one another when sick.\nMeteors crash into critical structures or kill critical colonist all the time and you can not build a defense against them until your base is almost completely built. And even when you do build the meteor defense, getting the engineers or workers to man the stations is not possible even if you set the security building to the only priority in your base. So meteors still get through and sure as ♥♥♥♥ they will hit critical structures at the worse possible times.\nA game is not suppose to be playable only until a random event makes it unplayable. I have had games where I have only just gotten started and a meteor crashes into a structure killing the only engineer I have and even when I have a landing pad, no more colonist will come because who wants to go to a colony where nothing is being built?\nI timed the meteors on a "low" chance game and they hit every few minutes. They hit structures, bots or colonist about one in ten meteors, so you are going to get loses and it's just random with no way to defend against it.\nthere is no way to prevent invaders. Even if you turn off all the landing permissions, they still show up. A nd they have no goal ecept to kill as many of your colonists as they can before you kill all of them. You should at least have an option to capture them, torture them to death in horrifying ways and broadcast the horror back to where they came from to make them think twice about coming.\nThis is not a game, this is a gamble. That's all. It requires you to be lucky. Skill is meaningless because random chance will lose you the game 9 times out of ten.\nThe designers should have placed a way to turn off the random events in the settings or had the human decency to have difficulty levels like every other single player game known to man.\nBut they didn't. They made a game for hard core gamers who like to lose due to making no mistakes at all. Just random chance.\nAnd I paid money for this garbage.","October 16, 2015","false","81.5"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","23","46","5","1"

Time and base management are required to survive on the multiple planets available to play on. I always take into account the value of the game and I see it here. Well priced for the entertainment. Maybe some cools mods or some tweaks in the future to add a twist in challenge for those who have mastered the ways of the base :) Here is my finished milestone completion series for those who want to take a look. Looking forward to the updates on the way including new planets and game features https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17sCIqIhd1g&index=3&list=PL2NZzDrzXcUsbty3d7STqu9j0ColxB5C3","October 16, 2015","true","33.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GmCity/recommended/403190/","GmCity","GmCity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GmCity/","240 products in account","This can be a very addicting game in the short term but a lot of waiting can be involved, however it's not a perfect game and does have a few issues that are not bug related which I will get into in a few.\n\nFirst the summary.\n\nPros:Stable - This is one of the most stable (at this level) games I have seen in a while.  It's fast loading and so far it hasn't crashed for me even once.  Which hasn't happened in years.\nGraphically pleasing - Occasionally the trailer isn't a lie, and that boads true in this case, it's very graphically pleasing from start to finish with very little issues like clipping which would throw you off.\nRonseal - It delivers exactly what it says on the tin, you build a base on an inhospitable space rock and try to stay alive all the while the rage of every asteroid in the Milky Way rains down upon you.\nMiddle Ground:Slow - Shortly after you complete the tutorial and get the game going you will find most of your time on x4 speed waiting for the next thing to happen or your new project to complete.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it will bore you if you don't have something else to do while you wait.\nAI - It's been getting better with a few patches but there are a couple of glaring holes in the AI that will trip you up the first time you notice it, however you can overcome the issues by playing to the AI's strengths instead of the base.  This does little to damage the game but destroys the realism aspect in some cases.\nCons:Little Replayability - Once you've built all the buildings once, and expanded a little, there is really nothing else to do, there is no incentive (outside of achievements) to expand further or challenge you in any way.  There are some random events but they don't really challenge you for reasons I'll explain in the next.\nFew Challenges - Although there are random events and supply problems that can arise there is little challenge once you figure out x plants feeds y people and so on.\nLack of Features - There are some features that just make no sense in their absence, for example:  There is security and intruders which will be "detected" when they "enter a secure zone" with no way to designate or even control which zone is secure, your security cameras will scour the whole base when they only need to guard a single airlock or corridor.  Same with the security guards who will wander all over the base and spend ages running across the base when intruders arrive.  The same problem persists throughout several key gameplay mechanics.\nIn overall I've quite enjoyed the game, however I ended up going for 100% achievement completion to try and challenge myself as mentioned the game doesn't do that for you.  Once you figure out how the AI reacts to situations and as mentioned before how many of X plants feed Y colonists it's pretty much just "place structure and sit on x4 speed only slowing down to turn on and off the alarms for every solar flare or Sandstorm."\n\nDon't expect this game to keep you entertained for weeks as without going for something like 100% achievements this game loses replayability very fast.  However if you enjoy completing the same task again and again for absolutely no reward or change in outcome then you will find this game most enjoyable.","January 21","true","77.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

For my dislike, someone else might like it. There were no bugs in my 30 minutes of play, tutorials were solid and helpful. Graphics were good for this type of game. No major issues, just a play style one which is opinion.\n\nMy gripe was one of not wanting to just keep expanding the same buildings over and over in order to have a stable colony. I wanted a little more depth in certain areas, not the tedium of a city builder game like Sim City that is just set in space. But like I said, it is my opinion, if you like city builder games this one won't be bad for you.","March 29","false","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I didn't really get a good feel for the game then and some of the footage lead me to believe the game really wasn't all that great.  I ended up grabbing the game after weeks of inner debate and to my surprise it was quite addicting and really good.\n\nThis game mixes together a few different styles and did so nicely.  At times I get a little SimCity feeling and other moments I feel like I'm playing Command and Conquer.\n\nSadly it doesn't seem like there will be any new additions to the game in the future, according to a dev post on the forum.  For the price this game is listed for I'd still recommend getting it anyway if you like RTS and base-building.\n\nLastly, I'd like to note that after the many hours I've played this game I have yet to experience a single bug or performance isssue.  The game runs smooth and loads quite fast.  One of the biggest complains people have of this game is the AI is dumber than a box of rocks, and sadly that part is somewhat true.  90% of the time the AI seemed to work fine for me but there were moments where the AI just seemed to go nuts and forget how to make food, eat, drink water, and sleep.  It can get frustrating when it happens.  Aside from that it is a great game.","March 21","true","41.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I've read the other reviews and while I agree with some points, I think that there has been a lot of negative emphasis placed on the inability to control the crew of your base. However, I think I understand the intent of the developers; the challenge of the game is that you are the boss, but like a real life boss, you can't really control what your people do, you can only provide the means, the motivation and the encouragement.\n\nIn twelve hours I've had no crashes and nothing weird happen; the game runs just fine. It also looks very nice as well. The interface is well designed and is easy to pick up quickly. There is a lot of visual feedback in the game, making it much better than staring at a bunch of spreadsheets.\n\nThe only gripe I've had so far is that I've found that the buildable area is limited by invisible means; I was building towards an open plan when I discovered that I could no longer add items. If I "backed" the camera towards this artificial edge I could tell where it came to a stop, but when looked at the other way (facing "out" from the interior of the buildable area) there was no indication that there was a limit. It's not a big deal, once I understood it was there I was able to allow for it, but it would have been nice for the developers to add a function that would highlight the actual buildable area.\n\nSo, it's a Highly Recommended rating from me.","April 3","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a very fun game, that I believe and hope will be continued to be developed. It seems like there is a large of amount of pathways that can be taken to further expand the game, which I hope will happen.\n\nOverall a very cool game, which I think is one of the best of it's kind. It's not overly complex, there is a little bit of thinking, such as what to build first, and the sub-sequential build order, as well as the positioning of structures, and what colonist ratio is needed, which makes a nice challenge.\n\nOne thing I will pick up on though, is the level difficulty of the planets. There are four planets with different environments;\n- Class D (Desert Planet) > ACCESSIBLE < Meteor's + Sandstorm's + ~50% Flat Surface\n- Class F (Frozen Planet) > CHALLENGING < Blizzard's + ~45% Flat Surface\n- Class M (Gas Giant Moon) > OVERWHELMING < Meteor's + Solar Flare's + No Atmosphere + ~55% Flat Surface\n- Class S (Storm Planet) > SUICIDE < Thunderstorm's + ~30% Flat Surface + ~10% Water Covered Surface\n\nNow I believe the level of difficulty to be in the wrong order, not something that ruins the game, but still annoying.\n\nThe Desert Planet > is easy. The unique Sandstorm's really aren't that big of a deal, they do mild wear to certain power structures, and mild damage to colonists overtime, but they also provide a large amount of Wind power. Meteor's are rare but can still be a pain early in the game. Space is a mild concern.\n\nThe Frozen Planet > is very similar to the Desert Planet, but easier. Sandstorm's are replaced by Blizzard's, which also deal mild damage to colonists and certain structures overtime as well as increasing the Wind strength. You may have slightly less space, but the fact there are no Meteor's at all, makes this planet easier.\n\nThe Gas Giant Moon > is by far the hardest. There is no atmosphere so you don't have the option of Wind power to sustain you through the night, so you must solely rely on Solar power. You are constantly bombarded with Meteor's, and additionally there is now Solar Flare's which are a real annoyance. If it's early in the game and your colonist is outside when it hits, you can pretty much say GAME OVER!\n\nThe Storm Planet > isn't the hardest. You may have slightly less room to operate in due to lakes and large mountains, but there is still adequate space. Instead of Sandstorm's or Blizzard's, Thunderstorm's take place. This is by far nicer, as they are much more regular then the other two. You may wonder why I say "nicer", and I do because they provide energy more frequently, and with the simple addition of one building (which you can easily build from the start without drawing to much from your resources) protect your buildings and hence your colonists, and pretty much take the only danger of this planet out of the game, leaving it as not a 'Con' but a 'Pro'.\n\nSo in my opinion, the planet difficulty should be more like this;\n- Class F (Frozen Planet) > ACCESSIBLE < Blizzard's + ~45% Flat Surface\n- Class D (Desert Planet) > CHALLENGING < Meteor's + Sandstorm's + ~50% Flat Surface\n- Class S (Storm Planet) > CHALLENGING < Thunderstorm's + ~30% Flat Surface + ~10% Water Covered Surface\n- Class M (Gas Giant Moon) >  OVERWHELMING/SUICIDE < Meteor's + Solar Flare's + No Atmosphere + ~55% Flat Surface\n\nIf I could change one more thing, it would be that something happens after you have built your base. Although a challenge, in reality one would not simply stop at building a base on a planet, you would then proceed to terraform, but as I mentioned earlier "there is a large of amount of pathways that can be taken to further expand the game"!\n\nOverall?\nIn my opinion it's worth a try.","April 27","true","50.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sounds simple right? In theory it is, you supply your colonists with Oxygen, Water, Food, and Entertainment. Your Colonists have different roles, such as Worker, Engineer, Biologist, etc and each plays their part in the colony in their own way.\n\nWhere the game gets interesting is that as your colony grows, it needs more everything. More Energy, Materials, Colonists, etc. It suddenly goes from simple idea, to managing multiple spinning plates on sticks. Think you have it all under control? Not so fast! Add in natural disasters and invaders, and you have found yourself precariously low on materials, which cause other problems, and now your spinning plates can come crashing down.\n\nHowever, the game never feels like you are out of control of the situation. Many problems are caused by your own doing. Grow too fast and your people starve. Forget to defend against a disaster, and suddenly you are salavaging parts of your base to recover. Even when I lost all my colonists to lack of water, I was not frustrated because it was my own fault.\n\nThe tutorial is very well done, and covers the important basics very well. They leave some advanced buildings to mystery, but the tooltips and help menus cover as much or as little as you want to read.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is that there is not only logical progression, but how things interact is logical. Additionally, you can customize the interior of your colony to specialize as much are as little as you'd like. Need more Engineers? You can adjust the percentage of Engineers you let come to your colony! You don't need any more Medics? Don't allow any to arrive on the next ship!\n\nAdd in there's techs for bigger buildings (which provide more space, power, etc), and that some tasks can be done by robots, and you've got a deep enough game to satisfy the micromanager in you.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of this type of game, you'd be doing yourself a favor by getting this game. For me, it is hands down one of the best colony builder games I have played.","October 16, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Nice job on the artwork and asset details too.\n- Music is great, atmosphere and feel of the game is really well done.\n- GUI is simple, easy to understand and not in your face too much. Everything is organized where it makes sense - intuitive interface goes a long way in keeping you feeling organized and not like you're missing something and going to fail.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game if you like colony / city type builders.

Every single aspect of the game must be a top priority. Managing your resources is crucial, as using them all doing one thing might result in your entire base failing. I highly recommned this game for those who find colonizing planets interesting. It does have one slight issue that lets me down however, and it is the fact that once you have constructed a fully functional and stable base (Which may i add is quite difficult), the game becomes rather repetitive and you begin to run out of things to build and do. If the devs implement a bit more content for later on in the game such as more difficulties to encounter (various different disasters such as mal-nutrition from eating constantly veggies or vitromeat, having crops being infected by a certain disease thats mutated and spread to others crops which needs to be stopped by bioligists otherwise all crops will die and stop producing, machines inside factories, robotics facility etc causing injuries for colonists). Adding some new feautures to the game such as more various types of ores, which can be smelted down and used only by certain structures, rather then everything constanlty using bioplastic and metal. Adding some more structures such as a nuclear generator (where uranium has a very rare chance of being mined in mines but can be used by a nuclear generator to produce a constant power, however it could affect nearby colonists with radiation if used too frequently, but could potentially save a base if solar panels and wind turbines are not functional) and posibbly a communications room, where colonists can utilise it to communicate with home planets to increase their morale, and also having care packages sent to assist in stabalising the colony. But besides that one issue, i absolutely love this game and look forward to see its future develop shape it into an even better game! :)","October 17, 2015","true","17.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If I'd had spare parts left, or a trader with something useful.  Next time, Planetbase...  next time...\n\n[edit:  HAH!  40 days!   I probably coulda lasted longer but the Traders only seem to bring me what I'm producing and have plenty of (food) when all I really need are some spares and metal.]\n\n12/10 - more like this!\n\nPros: nice graphics, and an insanely small download!\n\nThe only real con is that the Artificial Intelligence is clearly artificial and barely intelligent.  Or maybe that was me.  I didn't realize  that the carry-bot was acting brain dead, not because of radiation damage, but because I' turned off power to the airlock during an earlier sandstorm and neglected to turn it back on.  Can't build if you can't get outside.\n\n[edit]  ok, enough is enough already.  The AI would really rather go for a nice walk around outside and die of starvation, than to stay in the cafeteria and eat (ya know, cuz he's hungry and he could die).  This is consistent problem with the "AI".  The colonists just prefer to do anything except a) their jobs and b) eat when appropriate. Some 'days' the colonists will eat like birds, and the nexxt they'll drain your food supplies in one sitting.  I've had starting colonies die of starvation in as few as 4 'days' - cmon, the even Donner party lasted longer than that and THEY didn't have plenty of FOOD!.\n\nThe 'traders' - feh - as if.  Trader implies they're gonna bring anything you want/need.  Nope.  They only bring me what I'm making plenty of.  Um, yeah thanks for that.  Need food?  Nope, ain't gonnna get it.\n\nThe game is fun but pointless and aggravating. I get what they are trying to do, but to say the colonists have any kind of AI is a joke.\n\nEdit.  AI has certainly improved a bit.  I've kept a colony of 105-ish alive for over 100 days.

Every time I go  to expand though, the happiness of my colonists drops. On top of that, the food requirements are very inconsistent it seems. It seems impossible to feed a starting population of 7 with one greenhouse worth of plants especially after the starting food runs out. It makes it feel very unbalanced, and I want to throw my laptop across the room from the noise it makes when food is running low.\n\nI wish that the food problem was my only complaint, but for some reason I often find myself watching all of my facilities falling into disrepair. Not due to a lack of spares, nor the available colonists to repair them, but rather ALL of my colonists are idly wandering around the interior and couldn't be bothered to do much of anything, whether it's maintaining the plants or maintaining the solar panels. The fact that I can't click on individual colonists and set them to a specific task is INFURIATING!!! Instead, I have to sit and watch the base I've built, to be as efficient as possible, get run into the ground by autonomous (sort of) meatbags who have no concept of self preservation.\n\nOn the subject of self preservation... If there's a sandstorm outside, or a solar flare, maybe if a group of psychotic people are running at the door with guns screaming at me; I'm pretty sure I would know not to go outside and take a stroll. Not these colonists! They'll practically throw themselves at the opportunity to die just for the hell of it. Unless of course you have a control room which is what you need in order to inform the colonists (manually) to stay inside and safe from death...\n\nHaving just played the game, these are the problems still fresh in my mind which in my opinion make the game nearly unplayable. I've played it for a few hours but I just can't get past the learning curve that is usually simply to figure out in other games of this genre.

You've basically got to ensure that you have huge surpluses of food and water at all times, because if your colonists ever actually get hungry or thirsty, they're too stupid to recover from it and will simply wander around until they die, even if you have enough food and water for them.

It suffers in all the ways that Prison Architect and Banished did.\n\nThe author has responded to complaints of the game being too easy to ensure that it's too hard. This of course means that as a player, your strategy is to overengineer your colony, and thus again - it's too easy. While a light touch on engineering your infrastructure can lead to disaster, all you have to do is over-engineer your basics and ensure that your colony survives, and then the game is on easy mode.\n\nThe game treads the line between micro-management and macro-management, just like Banished and Prison Architect, ensuring that you actually don't care about any of your individual colonists - yet quickly, a small mistake can send your colony into the rubbish bin of history.\n\nUltimately, the game has insufficient depth to last beyond the playthroughs necessary to earn all the achievements.\n\nThat being said, it's a lovely game, well-thought out and with a wonderful graphics set. If you're into a management game that you can burn through fairly quickly, go ahead and pick this game up. If you're looking for something more enduring and engaging, look at Cities: Skylines.

It's hard to upgrade your base, Like said by other people, the AI does not prioritize very well at all. For example, you wish to increase the size of a building, first you make plans for the buildings removal, then you remove the building and that leaves the resources behind, the AI will not come and move the resources, which will stop you putting down the new improved building. You have to wait for the resources to  deteriorate or have lots of storage space, which can be frustrating because it can take an hour of human time or you have built the base size to maximum. I also found that once you get 100-200 colonists, that all you do is watch the landing pads for ships landing, which after 3 hours can be boring.  P.S I feel that the AI makes problems for you, as in base management, spares, medi pack replenishment and robotic replenishment  or some other necessary resource, after 20 hours of game time it's just the same old problems,","October 24, 2015","false","52.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The devs seems to want you to build the base THEIR way, not like other great indie city builders like Banished.\n\nIf you deviate from their starting formula you are ♥♥♥♥ed.  In the 2nd planet if the wind doesn't blow, you're screwed as well.\n\nI find myself often sitting at 4x speed most of the time waiting for minerals to collect.\n\nI give it a thumbs up though, b/c extremely promising style of game, esp since it is a city builder sci-fi, needs more stuff, like trying to send your soliders at other cities.  Patting down intrudters or zapping them.\n\nAI is a little bugged, will build the building then run all the way back around, then another guy will come buidl up the bridge.\n\nAfter you build a solid base, get past 30 guys, you pretty much enter the game on easy mode as well, difficulty curve is getting to 30, most of the buildings, and a few soliders to fight off intruders.\n\nAlso you have to micromanage a TON in this game, shutting of power nodes (b/c wind doesn't blow lol), boosting/forcing buildings b/c AI is pretty stupid to build stuff you want built.  Things don't get built in order, you cannot direct people to build something.  You can't build if there is 1 resource block covering the area you want to build, lol, so in the beginning very annoying b/c you have to recycle your ship (again challanging too).\n\nLots of tips I could share, but, get a good 10-15 hours of the game imo if you like city builders and sci fi, and are inbetween games.

I wouldn't say they are perfect but for an RTS game they are pretty good.\n-There is stuff to do. What I mean by that is that you have a goal and you have plenty of space and options to achieve it.\n\n\nCons:\n-lack of much settings\n-poor save/load system\n-sometimes placing the buildings feels a bit choppy and just off, not a major issue but it woul'd be better if it was more smooth.\n-Can't rotate buildings\n\nSuggestions:\nDEVS PLEASE DELIVER UPDATES! If you leave the game the way it is its gonna get boring and forgotten in time. You've set a great base- expanding it = more fun for us + more money for you.\n\n","October 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Acidophilus","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037418590/","16 products in account","Overall, I think this game is very cool and has a lot of potential. It also has some annoying habits (I hesitate to use the word "bug" because for all I know, my frustration may be the result of the product "functioning as designed"). I am going to give this game a "Recommend" based largely on my hopes.\n\nAs a teenager, I spent a lot of time playing Sierra Online's "Outpost", a game which this reminds me of for two reasons: 1.) It is very cool; and 2.) when it shipped, it was a bit half-baked.\n\nMy hope -- and again, the basis for the "Recommend" -- is that Madruga Works will address the problems and get this game to its full potential. My experience with Indie Game developers is that they honestly do try. I would feel better about this if the game appeared to be mod-able -- gamers are often a lot better at making games "work" than the developers are. As far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a lot of potential for modding, at least not yet.\n\nYou probably know the premise -- you land 7 people and 2 robots on a strange new world, hoping to survive and thrive. And this can be engrossing. I spent a good part of today playing this game. I have literally not eaten anything in the past 27 hours -- it's either been playing this game, or sleeping.\n\n(It's a good thing my dog knows to nuzzle and bug me when I am gaming -- because otherwise he'd starve and probably have leaked all over the floor by now).\n\nSo anyway, this game is very addictive.\n\nThe moon (or Mars, or whatever the desert planet is) -- is a harsh mistress. Power grids fail. Water runs out. Solar flares irradiate. And an annoyingly-large number of meteors smash into your stuff. Basically, it's like Detroit.\n\nAll of these tragedies make the game compelling for me.\n\nBUT WHAT NEARLY RUINS THE EXCITEMENT FOR ME is the fact that your astronauts seem to have the werewithal of 10 year olds, and some of them seem to have a special penchant for eating boogers. The pathfinding in the game is pretty weak -- perhaps this is designed, but if your 'nauts start to get the least bit irradiated or malnourished, they'll start wandering around aimlessly. My last game basically ended with a whimper after a biologist and the medic both got malnourished (apparently, eating rice, tomatoes and onions for months on end will drive you insane). The medic laid down in the sick bay and never got up.  Sounds like the kind of crummy doctor I have on my health insurance's network....\n\nAs a child, I looked up to astronauts as heroes -- guys (and gals) who could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. I am really pumped to see "The Martian" because of this. But the astronauts in this game -- wow -- they are like the polar opposite.\n\n\nIt'd also be nice, I think, if the game wasn't so dependent upon biologists --- my last two games basically ended either because the biologists died (and therefore, everyone starved) or because the biologists turned into bumbling idiots. Can  ordinary people not grow a tomato plant?\n\n(Mea culpa -- my last two attempts at windowsill gardening resulted in spectacular failures -- but I'm not an astronaut).\n\nSO -- BOTTOM LINE -- I really hope that Madruga Works fixes the AI, and perhaps make the astronauts a wee bit less fragile. For $16.99, I feel like I got a decent value from this game. If these kinks get worked out, this really could be an (off)world-beater!","October 18, 2015","true","39.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But not the kind of challenge you can win thus far, it's the kind of challange that tests your mind and willingness to stay calm whilst watching every attempt you make at holding down a stable ecosystem fail and ultimately lead to seeing every single one of your collonists die off.\n\nI have many things to point out about this game which I will list to you potential buyers;\n\n1.) At the start you have to sit through at least 20 seconds of watching your ship land and crew get out. No way of skipping this and it happens every time you start a new world (which is a lot.) Get's rather annoying.\n\n2.) You start off with enough resources to build the innitial 4-5 building you need as the bare minimum to have your AI survive, after this you must recycle the craft your people arrived in which allows you to then build the other 3-4 buildings you then need to keep the food/ resource supply stable for the 7 people you start with. Why I am mentioning this is because it doesn't allow you to build the base how you want. There is a line set that you have to follow and if you don't, your AI will either die or run out of resources to do anything which gets rather dull.\n\n3.) Now, you have come from Earth and yet you only get 2 sources of power, Solar or Wind. Now, Mars has never known for it's lovely breezes and at night there is no sun. This gets rather frustrating if there is no wind at night, the sun is down and your base drains the power storage to 0. All your buildings lose power, and your AI all die because the oxygen gen has no power. So right there you have to start again, this time you put more time and resources into more power supply for the night. But that means you have less for food, or other important supplies so you fail again and your AI die because you din't feed them well enough or something stupid.\n\n4.) Bunks. I just played a game where all my engineers decided to go to bed at the same time... Then an astroid hit the bunk room and killed them all. This means nothing else can be built or repaired. I watched as my other AI stood around and eventually died from lack of sleep as no one had the skills to repair the bunk room. So I had to start a new world, again. Also, people will sleep whenever. If they get tired half way into the day because they carried some leaves from the bio dome to the vending machine, they will go sleep and their job that they are supposed to do doesn't get done.\n\n5.) Your base is made from Potatoes. No really! Starch from potatoes. Plastic from starch. Base from plastic. What the F**L!?\n\n6.) Colonists arrive in ships from Earth (I'm guessing)... Yet they bring no supplies to help your base. Bit selfish if you ask me.\n\n7.) Trade ships offer you ♥♥♥♥ in return for diamonds. You think trade will save you? You better be willing to part with everything you have in payment.\n\n8.) AI arrive at refinery machine... 5 minutes later decide they earned some sleep. Metal/ Plastic doesn't get made until next day.\n\n9.) Everyone seems to break their bones all the time, and medicine repairs the broken bones. Medicine devized from leaves you grow in your biodome... on mars! Why are not funding this?\n\n10.) If you don't have a control center, people will wander out into huge sandstorms. Because they cannot think for themselves that it is a bad idea. They require a yellow alarm to show them outside is wrong, inside is right. Storm very bad.\n\n11.) Guns seem to be a factor. Though god only knows what for, since I can't even get the factory working properly before all my AI die of something or other. But I still want to know why violence is part of a seemingly peaceful mars base game?\n\n12.) Some spawn locations on new worlds have just enough space to build 1 thing then no space to build anything else. I have had this a few times. So it's over before it begins.\n\nOverall it seems like an Alpha game testing phase. Not a full release. Definately needs a huge AI/ UI overhaul before it is actually fun to play.","October 23, 2015","false","19.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I want developers to read this :).\n\nMy negative feedback is because, despite upgrades, this game has very short depth, but if they expand its playability it can become a super game. I love the concept and I believe that for 20$ it is still worth buying it.\n\nSome suggestions for developers:\n\n1. As many people said: please make it more challenging, not only with weather/environment casualties, but introduce a major component of battle.\n\n2. Introduce scientific achievements for advanced buildings (for example, may give the possibility to assemble rockets and different types of satellites to launch in space. Satellites may  play an important role for the workability of many buildings on the ground. They should need maintenance too, so you may think about shuttles and training buildings for astronauts that will be launched in space. Spares may be used to fix the satellites. Of course, if you build a separate environment in space would be super cool (what about a space station to customize for the survivability of the astronauts?).\n\n3. Why only menaces from the sky? Hostile aliens may be on the planet before our arrival.\n4. Why not contagious epidemics? Also consider the possibility to lock the corridors to restrict some areas and limit diseases.\n5. I wonder if these astronauts ever ♥♥♥♥. :) Their organic production could be packed and used as fertilizer to increase bio-productivity. It would be an optional ingredient for the plants.\n\n6. Defensive objectives: your security may alert you about aliens' landing on specific areas of the planet. Also you can think about evacuation ships in case of massive invasion whenever you need to protect your workforce, or specific shelters.\n\n7. Rovers to explore the planet and to bring workers elsewhere or to save them from casualties. You may also think about other raw materials or resources which could be used to make advanced buildings or vehicles: i.e. copper.\n\n8. Fun: why only gyms and bars? Space casinos, clubs  or game room.\n9. Religion: your colonists are scientists but not necessarily atheists. they may need God sometimes.\n\n10. Why not giving the opportunity to people to gain specializations in something else: i.e. workers that become biologists or engineers.\n\n11. Temperature could be another survivability variable to manage. Livestock or food may need cooler temperatures. Why not envisaging a dedicated warehouse?\n\nJust some ideas.. hope that they may help for further progress!\nThanks\n\nVincenzo\n\n\n\n\n","April 9","false","40.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Once I figured out what to do however I realized not all the dieing is my fault, Once the base got extremely large faults in the AI became really apparent, they will take the longest possible routes around the outside of the base and actually suffocate before reaching the airlock to go back inside, the pathing they take is rediculous sometimes and your colonists will also occasionally die of thirst when water is availiable and starve to death while you are sitting on plenty of food. Guards will sit down at a console instead of engaging the armed intruders presently SHOOTING THEM, just to get shot in the back a few times while they sit at their computer until they die. The AI with your colonists are by far the worst aspect of the game. Base building is fun, power/water management is challenging, making sure there are spare parts to keep your base running, making sure your processors have ore, basically turning your base into a well oiled production machine is a very satisfying feeling. Your small base barely surviving on a inhospitable world eventually becomes a hub of production and trade and it feels like an accomplishment. I would recommend the game, but until the game is patched and colonists take routes where they stay inside the base for as much of it as possible, you will deal with losing colonists due to their own stupidity once your base gets big enough.","October 25, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You start out with a small group of colonists on one of 3 planets (two are unlocked by achieving milestones) and have to build up quickly to survive.\n\nIf you are familiar with Banished, this game will be an easy transition, however, colonists have fixed professions and cannot be changed. The game does feature a day/night cycle which will test your ability to store and generate power during the night and you will need to generate Oxygen, Food, Metal, and Plastics necessary to survive.\n\nThe game's difficulty can be a bit challenging early on, as meteor strikes can hit parts of your base and do tremendous damage.  Also, expanding your base can provide a challenge as you'll need to balance resource and material generation. As you unlock the two other planets, the conditions change and act as a barrier against progresss). This game does NOT have a pause time feature (but you can speed it up), so making decisions requires some planning ahead.\n\nSome limitations in the game that I'm not too fond of is the restricted freedom you have to place building nodes. By default, you can only place nodes where you have an existing connection to a base. You cannot create separate outposts. All buildings must be connected. This can be troublesome in a map where you are confined or want to "redistrict" buildings.\n\nOverall, it's a decent challenge and a good burner of boredom.","October 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately the keywords are both fun and promising. This doesn’t feel like a finished game, It feels like a very polished beta. The content is about the amount a small indie crew could muster and add enough variety to keep you hooked. But small things regarding placement, lack of snapping functions when placing stuff along the wall but very strict in the middle of the floor and a very starved UI in regards to information and micro-management gives the game a feel of being unfinished. The big problem is the AI, It works great when it works, but it has a really hard time dealing with big spread out bases, and the destruction of airlocks. Sometimes it totally bugs out and sends a worker or droid all over the map looking for a resource cube 10 meters away from the base.\n\nDo I recommend it, absolutely! I have no regrets buying it, when it functions it is extremely fun. But be aware of what you are buying, think of it as a “beta” (right now at least a few days after release) and pray all the issues will be modded or fixed in the core game.\n","October 21, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Worth the price. Next step for the devs: Enable mod support, and you will have a thriving mod community just like Banished has.\n\nPlanetbase is a great game. I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, and I don't understand why, so I decided to write a review of my own. I love simulation games like SimCity, Banished, etc., and this is a fine example of the genre. Simple in that you don't have an overabundance of resources and stats to manage, yet elegant in its easy controls and interface. Beautiful graphics that don't tax your system processor, which is amazing as there are plenty of uglier games out there that burn up your CPU and GPU. I have had this game about a week and have sunk almost 100 hours into it so far just on the first two of the three available planets.\nStill a little buggy, I will occasionally come back to one part of my base to discover that a room is locked down, and as far as I can see there is no way unlock it. I know the devs are aware of this particular bug and are addressing it. It's nice to see a game go through pre-release and release with an active team of developers, which Plantbase has.

The devs also said that that they have a lot of further ideas for games like this and i really hope, that there is coming more. I hope that other developers are also making something like this.\n\nI was one of the Beta testers and the devs are really caring about feedback and they fixed the bugs really fast. There were a lot of updates and now there is also the 4th upgrade out, so i would say, that they're care about the game and what the people think about it.

The graphics of the game are quite good. I like them very much. You can also watch your colonists in your buildings, with a camera.\n3. Special events like a sandstorm or a solar flare.\n\nCons:\n1. After you've managed it to build a colony with something like more then 100 colonists the game is not really challenging anymore. There are also 2 other planets, where it's a bit harder to survive but i whish that the game would also be more challening in the late game.\n\nIf you like this kind of genre, you will most probably also like this game. Most of the negative reviews are also saying, that the game is not bad and that they're liking the idea. For the first game of this company, i think it's quite good and much better then other EA games i've played.","October 23, 2015","true","30.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Right out of the gate I felt like I knew what I was doing. I felt intelligent and up to date with how to work this system, but what I didn't know was just how fragile the game really is. My first desert colony crashed and burned when I began to stress the ai (100+ people). I wanted to blame the ai, and how the game is formatted and designed. But after the rage had subsided I began to take a different look at it.\n\nThe ai needs work, the developers know that, but this game isn't broken. Just very fragile. The amount of micromanagement required to survive is absolutely stress inducing. As I feel it should. Your every move has a consequence on your end game and I never realized that, right down to the type of colony lay out, structure type, size, and where you put components. Every little action has a profound impact on your journey, and a lot of people don't realize that. They try to bruteforce the game, break it and then blame the ai. But this game requires a lot of finesse and patience, and I adore that it was developed that way. I bruteforced my desert colony, placing stuff willy nilly everywhere and not paying attention to my micromanagement and I asphyxiated 175 people. But after watching youtubers like Negark handle game mechanics, I sailed through both F and M all 10 milestones in one shot.\n\nLooking back, my view of this game has changed a lot. I thought of it as a more layed back style game where you wouldn't have to worry about what kind of food you were growing to assure no one would starve, or worry about how you should distribute workers to gather metal ore during a power crisis while juggling processors and factory components. But indeed every move you make should be well thought out and calculated, like a game of chess.\n\nWould I recommend this? yes and no. I think this game appeals to more methodical people, the kind of people who like to sit and plan out what they're going to do while under stress. For those who just want to bruteforce everything, this game isn't for you. I've loved playing this and I really hope the developers add more mechanics, more planets, and continue to enhance the ai.

I'm having a ball with Planetbase, and I hope the devs know they've done a wonderful job. The AI improvements seem to be bearing fruit, and I'm not seeing much in the way of poor behaviour. It would be nice if my engineers stayed on duty at the telescope stations longer... RIP residents of cabin #5.\n\nStill, that's what fresh colonists are for, right? :D\n\nThe game keeps you on your toes, but not too much. Once you reach certain milestones, you can just sit back for a while and allow your supplies to build up, and take a breather. But before you start expanding again, you'd better make sure you've got enough of the basics! Having the power shut off in the middle of the night because you forgot to build enough energy storage and generators a few days earlier can really raise your stress level.\n\nLooking towards the future, I'd love to see more dome types popping up. Perhaps some end-game mega projects that can practically be a base all of their own, within a giant structure? Definitely something to work towards!\n\nAs for the game how it is now, build slow, think about what you're doing, and you should be alright.

Once I figured out what to do however I realized not all the dieing is my fault, Once the base got extremely large faults in the AI became really apparent, they will take the longest possible routes around the outside of the base and actually suffocate before reaching the airlock to go back inside, the pathing they take is rediculous sometimes and your colonists will also occasionally die of thirst when water is availiable and starve to death while you are sitting on plenty of food. Guards will sit down at a console instead of engaging the armed intruders presently SHOOTING THEM, just to get shot in the back a few times while they sit at their computer until they die. The AI with your colonists are by far the worst aspect of the game. Base building is fun, power/water management is challenging, making sure there are spare parts to keep your base running, making sure your processors have ore, basically turning your base into a well oiled production machine is a very satisfying feeling. Your small base barely surviving on a inhospitable world eventually becomes a hub of production and trade and it feels like an accomplishment. I would recommend the game, but until the game is patched and colonists take routes where they stay inside the base for as much of it as possible, you will deal with losing colonists due to their own stupidity once your base gets big enough.","October 25, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is challenging but fair in my opinion.\nThe colonist AI does have some issues, but the devs are aware of it and are releasing patches.\nSound wise it's good. Sound effects are perhaps a little lackluster but nothing major and they fit well enough. Music is nice and fits in well with what's happening.\n\nI know, I'm terrible at reviews, but the overall gist is:\nGood game.

So I jumped in with very little clue what I was doing, the tutorial covered the very basics of sustaining a base, but nothing else. I thought this would be a problem, but I found with the tool tips and descriptions as well as the liner unlocking of buildings helped.\n\nMy first 4 times playing were straight up failures one failure took me 4 hours of gameplay before everything just went wrong, I probably could have saved it. but I was so frustated I just turned off the air, until there was silence. after a couple tries I don't see how the gameplay would get old quickly, so many things can change the entire pace and direction of the game. the decisions you have to make are meaningful in the present future and very long term.\n\nsome of the things I love,\nthe graphics,\nthe random terrian\nthe minimalist UI\nand the AI works under most conditions.\n\nsome of the things I don't like/think should be improved\nThe UI, I apprecaite that there are not tons of menues and screens always on and in my face, but putting everything in one corner. some things I think should be outside of the submenues, like the security setting, when you need to change to yellow or red alert, going to the menu clocking managment options and then clicking secerity and then going to the pop up in the middle of the screen and selection which alert you want to set, feels way slow.\n\nOn the topic of UI I would like to see better statistical information, and predictive information like how much food you need for a civilian a day, and compare that with your storage, and beyond anything that is a convince like that I would really like to see more information about your storage, and people.\n\nI don't feel like im in charge, but instead I am doing things and they are reacting, and sometimes in a way that I don't like or in certain cases in a way that they kill themselves...\n\nThere is no way to force a person to do a thing, if your colony is failing, it is extreemly hard to fix, as without being able to force one or two of your people to do one thing before anything else, they will make small problems worse, during food shortages ive noticed not so hungry people eating while someone is starving and never can walk to the food in time to get any(in that case though they did make it).\n\nthe priorty system is meant to fix the above problem, but it does not work all the time, in my expirence it works if everything is running smooth, but if all your people are tierd, hungry, thirsty, sick I have never seen them do what I marked as priority but instead do the least important things, like carry supplies to storage, when I could really use the medic to be making medical supplies in the machine that has all the reqired materials in it and is 70% done.\n\nI still would say the AI is good, Ive never seen pathing issues or anyone getting stuck, if they are not doing anything there is a reson why, even if its stupid like they are tierd or where hit by an metor.\n\nThe game is fun, every decision matters and I cant count the amount of times where one night the wind did not blow and power went out, keeping the situation under control with your hands behind your back(becuase lack of control) is really fufilling when you succsed.\n\n","November 6, 2015","true","79.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are too many resources to manage, and the smallest mistake means failure. Sooner or later, your colonists will be dead, the only thing which can change is the cause. Lack of oxygen, lack of water, lack of food, lack of medical supplies, lack of spare parts to repair power generators which produce oxygen... I'd appreciate some varying difficulty, the game seems to only have one difficulty level - impossible mode.

Yeah, the AI has some quirks, but they're quite consistent and you'll eventually get used to it. There's still a lot of potential for adding depth and more direct control to the mechanics, but watching my extraterrestial base develop and my colonists going around their business felt satisfying enough to recommend. Will require some trial and error and unfair treatment by the RandomMeteorGenerator, but that's life.\n\nPros: Nice atmosphere (well, once you place the O2-generator), clear buildup in complexity of your base as you progress, mouse controls feel really intuitive (love the scrolling to resize modules) and the classic city/base-building feeling of achievement seeing your base grow is definitely there.\n\nMehs: The graphical interface isn't all that self-explanatory, and even the mouseovers are a little too summarized. Camera is kind of wonky as well (EDIT: Apparently this is a design choice. Shows what I know about art, I guess). The fact that there is no pause-button is a legitimate choice on itself, but it feels a bit weird not to have one while there not only is a fast-forward button, its use is even recommended multiple times in the tutorial. Combine this with random disasters (although largely preventable with mid-game technology), and you might warp into a slaughter at 4x speed, without any way to assess the situation.\n\nSuggestions: It would really help to see what colonist will take care of what project. You can click on them to see their direct queued action ('Picking up metal', 'Taking metal to airlock', etc), but highlighting their end goal when selected (and vice versa highlighting colonists involved when selecting a resource or something under construction) would give some more insight in their sometimes-not-so-obvious-priorities. Some kind of research-tree as an alternative to buying techs would be an obvious route to increase depth by adding another layer of prioritizing.","January 21","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would be nice if there was a forklift type thing that would carry multiple boxes at once even if it is kinda amusing watching  Meteors direct hit the closest colonist to the trading vessel.\n\n\n\nOverall rating: 20/20 I recommend this to everyone if they are sadistic and would love to watch intruders suffocate whilst being bombarded by meteors.\n","November 25, 2015","true","71.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not talking about guards... those guys spreads out on the whole base, except the area around the air locks... when a bigger group of invaders (6-8) enters the base, you can bet how it ends up... (Yes, they are armed, and yes there are planty guard posts, with safety monitors).\n\nShould be good if one could be able to pin the location for the workforce. There is a priority button, but still, that doesnt solve the problem.\n\nThe idea to buy the tech upgrades is great, but there should be way more option, more tech, I think... There was a game back then, K240... HUGE amount of tech available for purchase. Some of them were crucial, others were more part of the personal game style.\nThere could be more tech connected to the buildings. The amount of buildings are quite limited. There should be way more possibility by buying tech: energy shield, automatic mining station, fusion power plant, additional recreational facilities, riot shielded guards, defense robots, etc, etc.\n\nThe resource system is too simple. There are only 2 raw material, everything is based on them.\n\nThen the goals... There are milestones in each difficulty to reach. THE SAME MILESTONES IN EVERY DIFFICULTY!? Mehh...\n\nThere is no other goal than one: to complete the 10 milestones.\nThen you get to the next difficulty level. Which is, as I mentioned, basically the same... one mission, on three different levels.\nWithin a couple of hours, you can beat the game.\nThe 3 level only differs in the conditions (more-less wind or sunlight, more-less radiation, etc).\nIf you manage to create a sustainable little colony, with patience you can increase the size pretty fast. Not exactly challanging.\nSo if you finished all the milestones once, you finished the game.\n\nThe graphics are good, nice atmosphere.\nThe music is a bit annoying, too short loops (I played many-many hours of Settlers, never realized the same problem there).\n\nOverall, the game is quite ok, however there are a lot of possibilities within...","January 31","false","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

One miscalculation and all of your hard work will be for nothing.  However, if you can get past this early point before you acheive self-sufficiency (which there is actually two levels of this; the first being basic where you can survive in the meantime and the second where you ensure your base will be truly self-sufficient).  It is important to monitor everything closely because things can go crazy real quick and this can lead to catastrohic failure for your colony.  Overall, this is an absolutely amazing game which I have already spent dozens of hours playing.  It is especially neat to see your small colony of only 7 people eventually turn into a burgeoning colony of hundreds of people plus robots and visitors.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game, then just go ahead and buy it.  I am not saying it is perfect (as my below comments make clear), but it is still great fun and you will get tens of hours out of it, easy.\n\n*FOR THE DEVELOPERS*: If you read this review, there are a couple of things I would like to say and I realize that you are of the belief that this game is finished.\n\nFirst off, I really think you should reconsider being finished.  I would like to see some additional buildings to help with ensuring variety of gameplay which is important for replay.\n\nI would also be interested in seeing the ability to build tunnels through rock formations.  That is defnitely something which can be annoying especially if you spawn in a bad place.\n\nI would also reccomend that you improve the AI system.  As it stands, the AI seems very basic.  It tends to lack basic logic which is part of what makes the game so ridculously hard.  It would also be good if the people could actually interact with one another.  All of this would help enhance the realism of the game.\n\nFinally, I would love to see greater variety of available planets.  And, I do not necessarily mean that the planets should be more difficult just different to mix up the scenery.  Maybe even have different gameplay options based off the selected planet.  An ocean world, perhaps?\n\nFInally, I would like the ability to name my saves, the current save system is VERY tedious.\n\nI know what I am asking is a fairly good amount but I think it would make the game that much better and so I hope that you opt to strive to make the game the best it can be and not settle for just good enough.\n\nHowever, with all this being said, let me take the time to say what an amazing job you all did.  This is perhaps the best game of its kind I have ever played!  A very great effort indeed!","February 21","true","33.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a fun little base builder sim.  The biggest thing I've noticed with being sucessful with the game is managing not only the supply level of your base but it's accessability as well.  If your colonots have to go all the way across the base to get supplies, eat food, or get sleep then you're losing out on their productivity.  It does get repetative though once you've unlocked everything.  The occasional intruded raid or metoer strike are the only real threats.  More diverse accidents and some new buildings would go a long way for replay value.  Also steam workshop support would be amazing.","November 8, 2015","true","39.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really satisfies an itch I've head ever since Outpost (yes... I've been waiting since 1994 for another good space colony sim). The graphics are beautiful, and the colonist AI is actually really great. If you don't build like an idiot, the colony will self-maintain really well.\n\nGreat challenge to get up and running right in the beginning, which I love.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE IT GREAT:\nThe production chain and number of buildings is a bit too limited, and there aren't enough scenarios (planet types) to keep the challenge up. An underground construction layer could be added as a late-game option. Adding colonist breeding seems like a natural upgrade path. Colonist-owned sleeping quarters already exist, which would make an easy step toward a family housing unit.","November 7, 2015","true","98.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyway this is my review:\n\n\n\nPros: Great AI, No Guards? Set it to Red alert and watch your colonists Zerg rush the intruders or just set it to Red wait for your colonists to get in the base, Turn off all your Airlocks, and drink a ton of soda whilst watching the intruders die of Asphyxiation, Scream like a COD kid when a meteor hits your only solar panel.\n\n\nCons: The colonists rely on you to spoon feed them since they don't seem to know what meteors, Solar flares and sandstorms are, Watch a hundred of them carry trading items a long distance whilst under meteor bombardment,solar flare day, and sandstorm heaven. It would be nice if there was a forklift type thing that would carry multiple boxes at once even if it is kinda amusing watching  Meteors direct hit the closest colonist to the trading vessel.\n\n\n\nOverall rating: 20/20 I recommend this to everyone if they are sadistic and would love to watch intruders suffocate whilst being bombarded by meteors.\n","November 25, 2015","true","71.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Headed to lab, headed to connection, headed to lab, headed to connection, going to eat. REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT.  The engineers stand around in the hallways doing nothing, while every room on the planet has material in it with a yellow, orange or red wrench over it.\n\nShouldn't these idiots be performing repairs?  I have plenty of resources.  They do NOTHING unless I build a new item... they WILL do that.  Oh they occasionally put out a "spare" or two, but this is HORRIBLE.  I had an excess of 40+ meals/food.  Then every plant on the planet needs an engineers attention to the point they no longer produce.

It dilutes the experience of the city builder into a package that is glossy and zen paced, but played within margins that will make some fans of basebuilders sit up. It's sort of a hack job, in some ways, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. This is a game that is doing a whole lot of things from a whole lot of perspectives, and ending up with a title that feels like it could be more.\n\nBut really. Put on some tunes, relax, and Planetbase. There is something sinister in it's design, whether that be the missed opportuinites during development bewildering you or the ever ready reminder that life is fragile when lived in bubbles. I honestly almost gave this game a negative review, as I thought it was shallow. Then I played a few bases and - all in all feel it's a fine addition to a genre that I would love to see abused in gaming. RimWorld does it better, but this is again a slower paced death simulator. Mostly recommended if you are already pretty interested and won't rage too hard when your entire base goes ♥♥♥♥ up because everyone suffocated.","October 18, 2015","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There a sense of "oh ♥♥♥♥" when you hear a meteor crash around you.\n2) Gameplay seems balanced once you get used to it, after you use up your beginning supplies focus on metal and bioplastic production or you just won't make it.\nCons:\n1) The AI is is to simple to handle some of the things that I want them to do. A build Queue would be great. Something I can manipulate so that my colonists know what i want built first. Where I want the resources to go first so we can continue to survive. Right now they just kind of build whatever they want in whatever order they feel is best. Which 80% of the time i disagree with. This goes for production as well.\n\nPersonal Note: I really want to like this game a lot, it has the potential to be a game you could sink hours into perfecting your martian colony or settling on pluto who knows, the possibilities are endless. I feel like there needs to be some AI work, I feel like there isn't enough depth into how the player controls their colonists to do what's right for them. You can tell them to prioritize working on certain rooms and that's about it. You know you really need spare parts but all you can do is spend outrageous prices on trade ships or wait for your engineers to feel like making spare parts in prioritized rooms, which in my experience was not that often. I had two wind turbines down, a solar panel and a crippled power storage center down before they even thought about making any spare parts for them. It was a incredibly frustrating experience.\n\nI would recommend this game if you enjoy a sci-fi city builder. There are a lot of good things about this game, don't get me wrong. I feel like there's just a few things missing and it could be a much greater experience if you didn't suffer from the frustration of a lack of build order or production order or control over how things are built. I feel like a minimum would be incredibly handy, you can lmit a maximum number of any good but you can't make a minimum number to keep on hand.","October 22, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I know the developers are working on adding new features and fixing bugs - it is a small team so I expect this to be a work in progress BUT don't let that put you off! It is a great and very addictive game for those who like resource management/survival sort of games. Played over 9 hours in one section and just wanted to keep playing.\n\nThis games reminds me of theme hospital in a way - just in space! Also if you have played Banished you will get the same sort of feel from it. I have lots of suggestions for features but I am sure the developers have enough to get on with for the moment :)\n\nI know the price is a little high for a game that you will only get about 15 hours max out off until you might get a little bored of the same old BUT I think this is one of those games that with a little support will become a really good game. Just hope they don't stop working on it like the developer of Banished did (that is also a game worth checking out).\n\nI can't wait for the future updates!

I thank the creators of this Space Simulation game. If it were my choice I would give it a award (but obviously it is not). PlanetBase has to be my favorite of all time... It reminds me of the games I used to see all the time around my area ; and wish I could have them all :)  (But I couldn't) . Even though I am limited to watching streams after I bought this game (Due to a issue in my computer Graphics Card) , I still love to watch others enjoy it. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who like Space or Simulation (And also Space Simulation Games :P ) games. This game still has flaws as it was released only about a Month ago or so (Earlier for some Streamers) . The updates in this game are coming fast fixing flaws (Of course after a while more flaws will come and go) .  PlanetBase is a Addicting , Fun , Adventure( In a way) , With Twisty turns . It has mile stones which gives you something to work toward (Besides being the best Colony around) , Its has Hotkeys that are very reasonably placed (Others might argue). Sometimes you can find out one of your most treasured workers might actually be a Terrorist (Intruder) or that on your rich visitor ships might actually be full of Terrorists (Intruders) . Certain streamers (which I will not name) have brought me to a liking of this game!

This game is moderatly difficult. The game play is smoot for the most part. Though some things are pretty annoying. It's addictive to play.\n\nThe Bad: The AI is a little stupid. I saw 1 Colonist die due to lack of oxygen, because it didn't want to come in side the base. Lack of building varity.\n\nMy 3 biggest problems are more me nitpicking then anything. The UI is lacking to me. The Camera controls are very different from most Sim Style Games and there is no Windowed Mode.\n\nReally in a few patches I think this game could be really great.

Carrybots will walk past resources lying around outside your mine so they can get to the canteen so they can have a good stand around idle for ten mintues whilst another carry bot half a planet away will start it's journey to pick up the resources the other bot left lying around.

I feel it could have been better, or cheaper.\n\nThe game AI becomes frustrating as the game progresses. Ok, let me rephrase, the AI is an issue from the get go, but it becomes more apparent as your base gets bigger.  Here is an example. I have a base with 27 medics and 35 first aid supplies there is one colonist in sickbay with combat wounds who dies after 10 minutes of being left alone. Why don't I have the ability to make a sick bay a priority as I can with factories or biodomes.\n\nColonists have no sense of self preservation. They will walk into low O2 zones and walk by armed intruders like they are not there\n\nSo this is a future where space travel exisits and we can go to other planets and set up colonies, but we only have solar and wind power?\n\nCamera controls could be better.

One miscalculation and all of your hard work will be for nothing.  However, if you can get past this early point before you acheive self-sufficiency (which there is actually two levels of this; the first being basic where you can survive in the meantime and the second where you ensure your base will be truly self-sufficient).  It is important to monitor everything closely because things can go crazy real quick and this can lead to catastrohic failure for your colony.  Overall, this is an absolutely amazing game which I have already spent dozens of hours playing.  It is especially neat to see your small colony of only 7 people eventually turn into a burgeoning colony of hundreds of people plus robots and visitors.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game, then just go ahead and buy it.  I am not saying it is perfect (as my below comments make clear), but it is still great fun and you will get tens of hours out of it, easy.\n\n*FOR THE DEVELOPERS*: If you read this review, there are a couple of things I would like to say and I realize that you are of the belief that this game is finished.\n\nFirst off, I really think you should reconsider being finished.  I would like to see some additional buildings to help with ensuring variety of gameplay which is important for replay.\n\nI would also be interested in seeing the ability to build tunnels through rock formations.  That is defnitely something which can be annoying especially if you spawn in a bad place.\n\nI would also reccomend that you improve the AI system.  As it stands, the AI seems very basic.  It tends to lack basic logic which is part of what makes the game so ridculously hard.  It would also be good if the people could actually interact with one another.  All of this would help enhance the realism of the game.\n\nFinally, I would love to see greater variety of available planets.  And, I do not necessarily mean that the planets should be more difficult just different to mix up the scenery.  Maybe even have different gameplay options based off the selected planet.  An ocean world, perhaps?\n\nFInally, I would like the ability to name my saves, the current save system is VERY tedious.\n\nI know what I am asking is a fairly good amount but I think it would make the game that much better and so I hope that you opt to strive to make the game the best it can be and not settle for just good enough.\n\nHowever, with all this being said, let me take the time to say what an amazing job you all did.

I'm glad I got the early access to the game. I have enjoyed it a lot. It's definitelly not as polished yet, but the core idea and story is there. There needs to be much more work on GUI, the buttons are not as obvious and should let the player know a bit more about the status of the colony. The main idea about this, futuristic colony is that the technology would be so advanced that you should have artificial intelligence in a way that you can control and set. Right now you're in charge of everything and it can be overwhelming sometimes.\n\nGraphics are very nice, the resouces graphics are bit "cartoony" wish it was more realistic. The economy is good, but there are a lot of questions about why do colonies need "alcohol" or "guns." You only find out when crisis happens, which is weird.\n\nReality is a bit stretched here too. Mars doesnt have frequent sand storms, they would barely move a human walking, the atmosphere is so thin, those winds are gust gentle pushes. From this, the win-turbines might not produce enough power, so solar energy or other alternative ways should be looked at. Water is stretched too. There's no recycling of water? Just pumping from ground? That's not how advanced colony would work on another world.\n\nI would give this game 7/10 right now.

My first two or three colonies died fairly fast until I got the idea of what to build, and in what order. My only real complaint so far is that I will have enough materials to make most things but keep getting messages saying I am out of these things. For example, I will have plenty of the right things to make spare parts but keep getting messages saying I'm out of spare parts. Equipment is breaking down and I can not repair things because there are no parts. The macine is setting idle. It would be so nice to click on the necessary colonist and order them to go make some spare parts.

There are several things you need to know or put aside to like this game. First, it only allows for two of the most unreliable energy sources ever conceived (wind and solar). Don't know if they wanted to make a political statement, but from every playthrough I've seen, it's made the players curse the energy levels. No way humans would put their lives in the hand of such unreliable technology. Also, they have sandstorms. These would decimate wind turbines and solar panels alike. At least the amount of constant upkeep is in alignment with reality.\n\nSecond, the game can be buggy though it works well most of the time. I think the biggest annoyance is the AI will not prioritize things correctly. For example, it seems that no one will build spares (the things needed to upkeep the wind turbines and solar panels) if metal is needed anywhere else. Then, even if the material is available, it is almost impossible to get someone to build them.\n\nAnd third, once you've built up every pod, the game is pretty much over. So there can be low replayability.\n\nThis game is for those that like building settlements and seeing how fast or how well you can lay out everything. And for that reason, I recommend this game for those that are into that. If you're not one of these people, you may find this game a big disappointment.\n\nThere are two other planets to unlock with different difficulties, mostly due to power generation again. So there is SOME replay value.\n","November 1, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's too easy to click in the wrong spot by accident, and it sucks having to re-select the same building.\n\nPlease make the components for Labs, Cabins and Dorms snap to optimal placement locations. This would be save-game compatible, since components can still be anywhere in the building in the save file, but would be directed to optimal locations during placement. Sickbays, Control Centers have components of different sizes, so this might not work for them.\n\nI'll edit this with additional suggestions later.\n\nedits:\n\nPlease make the number keys 1-4 set speeds pause, 1, 2, and 4.\n\nPlease make cutscenes skippable. If i want a cinematic experience I'll go watch a movie.\n\nPlease ask for confirmation before deleting an under-construction building with resources on it. It's easy to do this accidentally, and it's a pain to wait for the resources to get moved to rebuild the structure.\n\nPlease consider allowing placing a building on top of resource blocks. Changing this would need more changes to the source code and is lower priority. Would need to add "move resource blocks out of the way" task.\n\nI'lll change this to recommend if 4 or more out of these 6 changes are made.","April 5","false","56.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not talking about guards... those guys spreads out on the whole base, except the area around the air locks... when a bigger group of invaders (6-8) enters the base, you can bet how it ends up... (Yes, they are armed, and yes there are planty guard posts, with safety monitors).\n\nShould be good if one could be able to pin the location for the workforce. There is a priority button, but still, that doesnt solve the problem.\n\nThe idea to buy the tech upgrades is great, but there should be way more option, more tech, I think... There was a game back then, K240... HUGE amount of tech available for purchase. Some of them were crucial, others were more part of the personal game style.\nThere could be more tech connected to the buildings. The amount of buildings are quite limited. There should be way more possibility by buying tech: energy shield, automatic mining station, fusion power plant, additional recreational facilities, riot shielded guards, defense robots, etc, etc.\n\nThe resource system is too simple. There are only 2 raw material, everything is based on them.\n\nThen the goals... There are milestones in each difficulty to reach. THE SAME MILESTONES IN EVERY DIFFICULTY!? Mehh...\n\nThere is no other goal than one: to complete the 10 milestones.\nThen you get to the next difficulty level. Which is, as I mentioned, basically the same... one mission, on three different levels.\nWithin a couple of hours, you can beat the game.\nThe 3 level only differs in the conditions (more-less wind or sunlight, more-less radiation, etc).\nIf you manage to create a sustainable little colony, with patience you can increase the size pretty fast. Not exactly challanging.\nSo if you finished all the milestones once, you finished the game.\n\nThe graphics are good, nice atmosphere.\nThe music is a bit annoying, too short loops (I played many-many hours of Settlers, never realized the same problem there).\n\nOverall, the game is quite ok, however there are a lot of possibilities within...","January 31","false","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

As you expand you need to meet needs as they arise. The game has many achivements to work towards and unlock. This is a fun, strategic game that I recommend, although for its price it may be a bit too much.","March 12","true","27.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels like this has been released and should really be early access, it needs a lot more content and would really benifit from Steam Workshop content to open the game up more.\n\nIn short, great fun game but would i recommend this?

I made my colony into a trade empire, so it depends what you want to specialize in... "manage".\n\nBuy it, don't be cheap, if you're a little tike, go ask your mom to buy it, if you're like "the comic book guy", you know what to do, tighten that ponytail, clean those cheeto fingers and do the deed.\n\n","June 4","true","40.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your quest is a manage a group of space settlers and build a colony on the new planet. For all that you should getting and crafting resources, and after that building. But not all so easy how sounds. You should also thinking what building are preferable at start and how big they should be, because at the start you have very limited resource and if you don't want kill all your people at start you should thinking strategic. In a game you have a lot different buildings what you need to build big colony. Game have 3 planets where you can play, all planets have another specifications. In your colony you should keep a balance in demography between workers, engineers, biologist, medics and guards. Also you can own 3 type of robots: caring, constructing and driller. You always should manage good your resources , you should have enough energy,water,oxygen and etc. A lot of thing depend of another. For example if you don't have a water, shortly your oxygen generator cant processing oxygen. And this not all, you also should survive a lot of impact for example meteors or intruders attack.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+have good gameplay what can be enjoyable for you and you don't see how fast time is go when you play\n+good crafting system\n+good trading system\n+enough good graphic\n+can bring enough challenge to you\n+a lot of thing depend from another\n\n-not a best camera mode\n-i think they should put a more data what you can check about your base what more detaile\n-AI sometimes bugy\n-cant control peples invidualy\n\nSo i think this game is very good and if you like a building strategy games you shouldn't be disappointed if you buy it.Yes for now this game have some problem with AI sometimes, but this i think shortly developers resolve this, and if they also improve invidualy control and more statistic this game will be perfect! For the end i have a little advice for you, you really should do a tutorial at the start if you don't want fail in a few days in the start.\n\n9/10","October 16, 2015","true","9.2"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","26","54","0","0"

As soon as you have all building types you can watch your citizens do everything just fine.\nI was close to deinstalling the game again but decided to play on. And suddenly, everything changed.\n\nAs soon as you build a landing platform, where trader, visitor and new colonists can land you can screw everything within seconds.\nIf you expand to fast, you will ran out of food. If you have to many visitors, you will ran out of food. If you buy other things with too much food, you ran out of food.\nWhen I played this, as soon as someone is very hungry he stops working.
