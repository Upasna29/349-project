I can't say more about the gameplay, because there isn't anything else. I don't mind, if there isn't a tutorial in a game, but in Moonlight Minions there aren't even tooltips, so to find out the function of the tower you want to buy, you always have to open the help menu, and that's really annoying.\n\nIn my opinion it is not worth its money, because it's only brainless tower building.","October 23, 2014","false","7.6"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","2"

Instead the interface lists the equivalent of $s as gems.\n\nThen moving on to actually placing a tower I discovered that there are no tool-tips.  As far as I can tell from the interface there is no way to tell what any given tower does, why you would use one tower over another tower, and what effects upgrading a tower would have.\n\nI would love to play this game further one these basic issues are resolved but these issues are so basic I don't feel like continuing to play this game at this point.","October 23, 2014","false","0.3"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

Just like any other tower defense.... You must stop enemy from reaching exit.\n\nVery simple concept.. very simple excuted... on Par graphics with nothing speical... On Par Music/sounds with nothing special.. Not really any story involved.. You don't get lesson to learn each different tower... (poison tower AOE slow and it stacks if u have mutiple together.) You won't run into any bugs...\n\nIt's price for a dollar for a bundle folder and it did it's job well...\n\nAll the achievements are all quite easy to do even if u play hard difficulty from start.. any Tower defense vetern should be able to finish each level in no more then 3 tries..  I am sure i can get all achievements in under 3 hours.. and i will do just that...16 levels only with an endless mode.\n\n5/10.. nothing special.. nothing wrong.. another game that i am on fense for recommend or not recommend.. Since it's getting a lot negative review.. i will help to do the opposite.. think positive guys.","December 18, 2015","true","9.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","3"

It's a basic, no nonsense, simple tower defense game in the purest classic sense of the term. If that's not what you want, there is something in the order of 100+ variations on this concept on Steam right now (check out Sanctum 2 if you want the best, in my opinion). I play something like this game on my iPhone called Fantasy Defense, and I looked through all the games on Steam to find something like that and Moonlight Minions is the closest one.\n\nThere are problems here. There's no tool tips. The sound is very low budget sounding. The animation quality is sub par. But, it works. It's only a dollar, the developer priced it fairly for it's shortcomings. For what it's trying to do and what it claims to be, it's right on the money.","July 7, 2015","true","0.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

However I do like the visual style . Instead of Towers you have cave sctructures like mushrooms,spores and crystals .\n\nHonestly the only big issue for me here is the lack of tower stats . For the most part you can guess what power level towers have if you played games in this genre but it would be nice to know exact statistics . Either way its not a big deal because gameplay depth isn't that complicated .\n\nAlso you can use one of 3 AOE spells like Lightning,Earthquake and Meteor shower which are unlocked by beating the game . You can play short 90 minutes campaign with text taunts or endless rounds for high rankings .\n\nFor $1 I have no problem recommending it but if you tired of this genre and looking for something new definetly pass .","November 9, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Graphics sucks, but it's a tower defense game, you really need graphics? The only one thing i expected is that when I put cursor over a tower, to see description of what that does.\nPerfect "office-game" for some time waste.\nPretty sad to see so many negs.\n\n+ minimalistic design.\n+ simple\n+ supports "windowed" as also fullscreen\n+ fun\n+ last, but not least: achievements\n\n- short\n- graphics\n- info on towers\n\n8/10 for the 0.67 € i payed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/recommended/311170/","kumorig","kumori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/","926 products in account","The good stuff:This is a solid and quite interesting tower defense. It's short, Id say 10 hours for 100% achievment completion for anyone competent. 6 towers, 3x16 levels (easy/normal/hard). It's quite satisfying to complete. The price is very fair.\n\nI'd say it stumbles over the "recommend line" by a few meters. It's easy to understand the opinions of those who disagree.\n\nThe bad stuff:* Obvious mobile port.\n* Non existant keyboard controls. Bah.\n* Silly "tap-mechanics" that has no place in a pc game.\n* No info at all of towers and monsters. It might not be much but you have to figure it out yourself.\n* Unfair RNG. Waves, monster spawnpoints and money drops are (sometimes? always?) randomized. It becomes painfully obvious on the last level on hard. I'm certain that some setups are impossible. But hey, quit, leave the map and try again for a different wave setup. Play a few times to get decently lucky with drops and it should be easy.\n* Once you figure out the towers and the basic strategy, most levels play the same.\n* I never used the 2nd tower once. Whatever that means you can figure out yourself!","January 26","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
