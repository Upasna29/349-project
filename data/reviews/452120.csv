I've choosen the second option, and I don't regret it at all. The game has a very intriguing story that takes you deep into the culture of an Sweden fairytale.\nIt may be a bit short (between 20-40 minutes) but the originality and the love with which was created the game compensates this. The dark artwork and the haunting music will keep you playing till the very end in just one sitting.\nAnd who says you can't try the different endings that the game has to offer?\nThe work which only one man can do amazes me and it should make us realize just how much we can really do if we start working hard.\nYou've done a great work, Talecore Studios, and you've won my heart! I can't wait to see the next future projects of yours.\n\nPros- Support for achievements and trading cards.\n- A soundtrack that will make you fall in love!\n- Intriguing story that makes you stick to the monitor till the end.\n- Different choices with different outcomes.\n- Different endings.\n- This game is the result of only one man work of 6 months.\n- The voice acting touches your heart.\n- A game inspired by nordic mythology.\n\nCons- It's a bit short.\n- No Steam Cloud support.\n- Why do we still don't know the release date for the second part yet?\n\nConclusionThis game it's a short and cosy experience, leaving you longing for more. For a very small price, you will get access to an fairytale feeling that some people used to have growing up as a child, I'm really recommending checking it out.\nI can't say anything more than... Support developers like this, we need them in our life!\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Temper your expectations otherwise though, Midvinter is very short, although it seems to have a few different endings. Point n click mechanics are very straightforward, the story is fairly basic and voice acting isn't great. I'd say it's worth a shot for a short, relaxing game session, and it's a good achievment for a sole developer.","May 6","true","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Will have to play it a few more times to get the rest of the endings. So worth the small amount of money!","May 5","true","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972163902/recommended/452120/","76561197972163902","DarkDisguise","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972163902/","68 products in account","Product received for free\n\nFor being the first game of Talecore studios, it's a very nice and warm experience, still fantastic to think that it has been made by one person alone in such a short time. It seems like there are very few games today inspired by nordic mythology, especially the very small and mundane, that was very common in countries like Sweden, when people were still very superstitious and afraid of the dark. Images like Näcken, the fierce but beautiful portrayal of a man, said to drown those who come close enough to hear his tunes on his violin, and the Skogsrå, lone protector of the forest, are just two common creatures of nordic mythology that appears in the game. Midvinter brings back that fairytale feeling I used to grow up with as a child. It makes you want to sit in front of a warm hearth, and just admire the snow outside your window, while in reality as I sit playing the game, it's just the start of a hot summer.\n\nIt's a short and cosy experience, leaving me longing for more. I could go back to play Skyrim, but the nordic feeling doesn't carry the same kind of mood, with it's combat-oriented gameplay. In truth, I'd love to see more titles striving for this kind of depiction of old folklore. Quiet, somber, cozy, and chilly, just like the arts of John Bauer.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to any kind of similar follow-up, revolving around the same setting.\n\n","May 6","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Different choices gives different outcomes. I hope more will support this indi game so we will get a follow-up.
