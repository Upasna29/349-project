There's nothing inherently wrong with clones. I've played and enjoyed quite a few of them myself. In all honesty, I don't like the original arcade classic. However, I do enjoy the many sequels Taito has put out over the years such as: Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders Extreme. I look at it like this, if Space Invaders '78 is the duck, and its sequels are the phoenix, then that makes Cosmic Rocket Defender the diseased ♥♥♥♥ um... I mean rooster?\n\nOoh. That's just a little low isn't it? Maybe I should lay off the crass. Okay then try this on for size: Cosmic Rocket Defender isn't a game. The thing about games, video or otherwise, is that they have stakes. You can win, but you can also lose. Seeing as how CRC is a clone of Space Invaders, it stands to reason that it would share its arcade-design philosophy. Outside of Metal Black, you're probably not playing an arcade game for its intricate plot. You want your skills to be tested, and to obtain that coveted spot on the high-score table. Furthermore, games like Space Invaders don't actually end, at least until you run out of lives, or do something absurd like cause the score to roll over.\n\nThe long and short of it is that CRC doesn't have stakes. Death is a mild inconvenience at worst, and aside from restarting the current stage, you aren't penalized for it. Your score isn't even negatively affected when you lose. It seems like such a simple issue, but how can we have something released in 2015 that doesn't grasp the decades-old fundamentals? How is the player supposed to care when the "game" they're playing doesn't? The worst part is that this omission isn't the worst aspect of CRC. There's still the entire rest of the software that's a mess.\n\nCosmic Rocket Defender is overly difficult. Enemy-ships fire at too fast a speed to react to, and their patterns are too random to predict. In cases where bullets move at excessive speeds, then there should be sufficient warnings, such as the ships flashing before they fire. Instead, you'll find yourself constantly taking damage and not having any idea of when or where it happened. Enemy-ships can also sometimes fire while diving towards the bottom of the screen. Due to the angle and proximity, there's really not anything you can do to get around this.\n\nIn keeping with the tradition of modern-era clones, CRC has power-ups and a shop between stages. Unfortunately, these aspects are also broken. The most common power-up in this product is a star, and it's value is 10 points. 10 POINTS!? The average enemy-ship is worth at least 10 times this waste of space. There are some good power-ups, such as armor and mega-bombs. By the way, both of these power-ups can be purchased in the shop, which is just baffling. Now what you really want to look out for - speaking hypothetically because you shouldn't play this game at all - are the multi-missile and shield power-ups. The multi-missile fires missiles in several directions, so you can stay out of an enemy-ship's line of sight.\n\nThe shield gets its own paragraph because it well and truly breaks whatever game-like qualities Cosmic Rocket Defender pretends to have. This power-up makes you completely invincible for several seconds. When this drops, you're guaranteed to win the stage. The later stages have multiple waves of enemies, but that's all rendered moot if you manage to get multiple shield drops in a row. Yes, it can and will happen. I'll never turn down a free shield, but at this point, I might as well play a rogue-like... or a slot-machine. In the later stages, either I'm blessed with a shield power-up, or I'm subjected to a mountain of BS. In short: My progress is at the mercy of RNG.\n\nIn the end, there's no incentive in attempting to take this product seriously, when it can't even be bothered to get the basics right. Cosmic Rocket Defender wants to be an arcade game, but it's not finished. You're left with something that feels like a prototype, but the developer expects money for it, and that in my eyes is far worse than any clone.\n\nBefore I forget: YIKES!","April 16","false","0.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

A small, short, simple invaders-inspired game.\n\n- The game is heavily based on luck, I didn't like that much. You retried a level until you beat it, mostly because you got the right power-up drops. You can't really consciously dodge incoming enemy fire.\n\n- Armor upgrades are not permanent, it's a waste of money. After dying (you have endless retries), you always start out with 2 armor. It's effectively a very expensive consumable, instead of starting out with 3, 4, or 5 armor instead.\n\n- Shields, contrary to the game's description, you can't upgrade shields. It's an extremely powerful power-up that can drop from destroyed enemies, and grants you invulnerability for a short amount of time. Picking up a second drop does nothing, neither refreshing, nor extending the shield duration; it seems to be on a cooldown so it will run out and stay out for a short amount of time. I felt very disappointed.\n\n- In level 11 and up, you face perfectly cloaked enemies, who briefly uncloak when they fire. I did not like it.\n\n- Score always goes up. You try a level, you die, score always stays. On the other hand, destroying enemies, the little UFOs in the top, bombs, and picking up stuff gives you score. So you can neither say that the lower your score the better, nor the higher the better. The score system is contradictory and therefore pointless.\n\nHere's a montage of my full playthrough:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyLavIVB5Tc","April 28","false","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I liked having the options to upgrade my base ship, although if I had one very minor complaint, it was that the effects of some of the powerupgrades aren't spelled out a bit clearer.   After several plays I am still not sure what the powerup for "Rockets" does.  I think it makes my main weapon stronger, i.e.  takes less hits to destrpy an Alien ship...but...not sure.\n\nEither way, the game is very fun.   Can be played in 7-12 minutes so far, although I am hoping with more experience to make a game last a bit longer as I get into higher levels.\n\nGood game.
