Then out of nowhere some changes started to be made.  These changes essentially removed some of the fun from playing with the physics, and limited creativity (I had planned on making a bouncy path to my house filled with tricky platforming...that's not possible anymore).  They also still listed on their website that the game has planetary gravity, even though that was removed months ago, so they falsely advertised features to get sales.\n\nThese alone are bad enough, but I want to go back to focusing on the devs themselves.\n\nThese are people that pretty much always had to be reminded to post patch notes whenever an update came out.  If people didn't do that, they wouldn't even bother.  They always talked about being able to create your own universe in early videos (they also mentioned water, which never made it into the game), but the truth is you can't make anything unless it's attached to something else first.  And then when you break a huge planet off after making it, guess what?  It will fall right back down, likely pushing you through the floor if you get hit.  Some universe...\n\nConsidering all the problems the game had that were definitely in need of being fixed that got ignored (terrible camera, lack of information on making formations like bombs, multiple bugs with collision), I'd either say this was a scam from the start, or the dev team really is just that bad, either way, I'm not inclined to buy or recommend anything they make ever again.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play multiplayer just one last time before they shut down the servers...","October 9, 2014","false","81.3"," 54 of 55 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","54","55","0","19"

It's a huge disappointment to me, and I thought it could blossom into a wonderful gem that would unearth from Steam's massive collection of games and see the light of day. This game has been neglected for at least a year by now (you're probably surprised that I decided to write a review in April of 2015). Patterns was a physics sandbox type of game. It's very different to Minecraft. Patterns used to be a very promising game with different materials and a world that you could sculp and build. You could cut down trees and watch them fall (and turn brown, for some reason). However, that feature was a problem, as everything you build could fall if it's not connected to another block. Some buildings could become bombs, even. Use the right material and build a bomb in the correct shape, and it will explode! This was probably one feature Linden Lab wanted to amplify and add to, but as I can tell, nothing much evolved from it. Planetary gravity was an exciting idea, but for some reason, Linden Lab moved it to some small blank slate maps only. I mean, seriously? I played when it was in very very early alpha. You could discover new shapes when you find some sort of crafting table inside a massive pyramid. You go to it and then you make shapes by adding triangular parts to a block, folding them, etc. I think that might have been removed as well, as I can't find it anywhere. Some blocks have special properties. Some hurt, and some are bouncy when you jump on them. When I first played after some map updates, I explored and had lots of fun just by doing that. I'd build fancy bridges and connect the floating islands so that I could explore them and revisit when I wanted to. Now, I feel that there's a little less to see. I can't recreate that fun because the only floating island map there is is not at all very hidden. No pyramids, no mountains big and complicated enough to climb and have fun. I've heard water was supposed to be added, but it apparently never made it. I grew bored and came back when Patterns was dying and soon thrown aside. I never got to see multiplayer for myself, which was an exciting aspect I was eager to try out. Now, Patterns is just a sad and lonely game groaning for attention. It's probably going to be removed from Steam, and cast into the abyss of the forgotten. I get feels just flying around when I try to play, knowing that all the potential I saw was not possible with the developers behind the game.","April 5, 2015","false","14.3"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

I have tried short tiny spurts over several months since I purchased it and realized there is just no point to this. Build what? Ok so you you can do some puzzles and jumping and share your stuff with others or even play other peoples things but what exactly is there to do besides that and doing the side collecting of blocks so you can make more things? This is the most boring game in history. I do not recommend this game. I am sorry but it is horrible. Little confusing platforms with no real idea as to what is going on. If they would of perhaps expanded this over the last 2 yrs it wouldn't be as terrible but besides some fixes and a new ui, there is really nothing here.\n\nThe universe to create isn't really there because the maps are so TINY. There is no space like in minecraft or other sandbox creative games where you can build things and have a lot of room to do so. You can gather up blocks but then if they fall or break you have nothing. They simply just vanish. It is nice having a game with this concept that not everything is SQUARE blocks around you but this needs a whole lot more in order to feel like a true sandbox. Skip it for now and watch its progress if interested but there really isnt very much here going on with this game however from what I understand, they are no longer working on this game so there may not be any more work to it.\n\nApparently this is just like the game "windborne" where the game looks good and gets people excited for more possiblities but then the devs go silent and vanish doing few fixes or offering few features or they get busy with their other games instead.\n\nI also don't care for physics in a sandbox game because  it limits and ruins the creativity for me of what I want to build, adding more limitations to what I want to make.

I quite enjoy Linden Lab's Second Life program, and them taking a different spin to content creation was quite a nice change. The whole thing turned very sour very quick however.\n\nFirstly, take into account that LINDEN LAB NO LONGER SUPPORT OR DEVELOP THIS GAME.\n\nAdditionally, take every review and every feature list with a pinch of salt, a rather large one. Over half of the items from the features list up above do not exist, even a little bit, and never will due to the lack of development. They promised multiplayer, but I never saw it come. They promised AI animals or creatures, but it never happened. You spawn into the world in a very very lonely place, where not even people who want to join you can.\n\nIf you do buy the game, take into account that Linden Lab do not know much about optimisation. Second Life proves this, only giving an average of 15 FPS in populated places. Patterns is similar, except worse due to the poor implementation of the physics engine. If you break something off and watch it collapse, prepare yourself for a spreadsheet demonstration of this collapse. Also, they don't believe in not drawing the object behind objects in front of you. If you create a house, walk outside and look at the front door which is closed, the entire interior, and backfacing walls are also drawn. This is very noticable when looking directly at the middle of the map, or the floor for example, because every layer is drawn.\n\nHeed the advice of the masses, do not buy this game. Do not support the developers who have already given up.","June 3, 2015","false","13.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Just like everyone says, it's very similar to Minecraft in terms of how it feels. The major differences are obvious, most shapes aren't cubes, but other polygons, such as pyramids. There are stress physics, so if you were to put too much stress on a polygon, it would break. There are dynamic physics, so things can fall and react with other objects. Somehow, breaking the base of a tree and watching it fall over is oddly satisfying. I hope that one day the developers include an infinite world generation feature. I'd also love to see more mobs and better crafting. If the developers took what they currently have and added a few Minecraft-esque features, they could possibly be the next big game. As of right now (January 25, 2014) this game feels a little lacking in terms of content. I am also never able to find an online game. But even with that said, I still recommend this game. It's very fun and future updates are sure to make it even better.","January 25, 2014","true","4.3"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

You can let your creativity flow. You can build whatever you want, whether is be a giant castle or just something simple like a small house. You can also build things such as working rockets, as seen in the trailer. I also recommend to play this game with friends if your friend has this game too. If you don't feel like building, you can still mess around with friends by building rockets, some bombs, etc. Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10.

If you're going to make a game and make promises you can't keep, then at least make your game free, Otherwise you'll just end up with a ton of money and no friends. Pretty sad.

Unlike Minecraft, the game offers a variety of geometric shapes for each building "block." Constructs also have to be built well enough and with the right materials to endure the pull of gravity and can also be amusing to undermine for destruction. As I write this review, however, this much younger game has nothing akin to a survival mode as in Minecraft.
