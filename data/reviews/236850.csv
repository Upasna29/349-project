"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adurnas/recommended/236850/","Adurnas","Adurnas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adurnas/","163 products in account","A rather complex grand strategy game, you pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821. There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination), as most are a real challenge to earn.\n\nEach country is divided into provinces, allowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based. Battles aren't controlled by you, as in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing army, and the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rolls, and in part by factors you can influence, such as generals, terrain, morale of troops. The same can be said for naval battles, where different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting in, if they are in the open ocean, or in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean).\n\nDiplomacy is fairly well fleshed out, countries can have a number of different governments, such as feudal monarchies or merchant republics, all that give different bonuses and maluses, and some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you want, so as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points. You can offer alliances, royal marriages, support rebels, create false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a "casus belli" (a reason to go to war) among other things, the list is really really huge.\n\nMonarch points are a "limiting factor" in the game, you have 3 different types of monarch points (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military), each that serve different purposes. For example, military points can be spent to buy a new general, or to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there. (As of the Art of War update, rebel mechanics have changes slightly. Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentage, now each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifiers, such as nationalism, culture or religion. Once the counter reaches 100%, multiple stacks of rebels spawn). Other points can be used to change your capital, annex vassals, gain provinces in peace deals, create buildings and much more. The gain of monarch points depend on your ruler, that can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month. By spending some of your income, you can also hire advisors, that can add to your monthly monarch points income, and grant you some nationwide bonuses.\n\nTrade is also a large factor in the game, you have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodes, and you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malus, or to send the money that you collect upstream, to a different node where you can collect from. Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade income, while being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controls.\n\nAs of the "Common Sense" update eu4 has a revamped fortress mechanic, given out for free. Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money), and they exert a "zone of control". Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in war, while provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control. Forts now block enemy units from advancing, allowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defences, while the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops. Unoccupied forts also have a "zone of control": If you conquer a province next to a fort, but leave the fort to itself, the fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war. I love these changes, especially if you play a large nation, as it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provinces.\n\nParadox has created a lot of DLC for this game, but with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as well, so it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLC, so as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much. If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCs, even without owining the DLCs yourself, the game activates them, so its possible to try them out before you buy. It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind), as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offer.\n\nIt's a very time-consuming, and occasionaly frustrating game, but I found that the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantage, and the game is becoming more satisfying due to that.","October 5, 2014","true","142.7"," 833 of 852 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","833","852","20","3"

But thanks to the fine people at Paradox Interactive, I can unleash the inner beast that resides within all white European christians and do my part for humanity. Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople (not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxy Pope #1 forever get rekt bearded priests) I can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages (not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida). Soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors, or all thats actually worth ruling (not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos).\n\nThis game is best played with a warm cup of Folger's coffee in your hands, so you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time. The period when white people discovered the world, and decided they didnt like it.","March 15, 2014","true","654.9"," 3,521 of 3,800 people (93%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","93","521","3","92","112"

Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilization, but a new game, where everything is new, is fresh and exciting.\nSo let’s shall begin with topics I want to "review".\n\nMusic\nMost of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background, but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country, which is trying to boost the morale of the player, which usually works. The weird part about the peaceful songs are, that they are somewhat forgettable, but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later.\n\nDLC’s\nThere are many... Way too many DLC's that did come out for this game.\nLuckily they are usually units getting a better design, for 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much. The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on. For example the "new" DLC "Conquest of Paradise" enhances the colonization mechanics which were, at the beginning of the game, a bit lackluster, but more on that later.\n\nCountries\nThe country’s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821, the interesting part about them is, that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start, that means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new world.\n\nAI\nThe AI has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference, there are militaristic, diplomatic, passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time. That is, until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course. The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI's, if you conquer they will hate you, if you don't have any alliances they are going to attack you, that's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AI, which can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think. Just never trust them too much...\n\nIdeas\nThe idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing, there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country’s, 18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas. That sounds like a lot, and it certainly was a pain for the creators, but it was well worth it. It gives most of the countries just their own specialty. But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuff.\n\nColonization\nThe new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one. Get exploration ideas, Colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created. The colonial vassal is just like another country, but he has to pay taxes and can't attack you. You can control these taxes on your own, but never set these taxations too high, because you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time. Independence wars definitely can get a strain on you, if you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a war.\n\n\nThere are certainly way more things I could try talking about, but I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested, especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points, but I don't want to tell you everything. There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some people, so that they are going to try this game for themselves, and not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game.\nFor most of the people the Price is going to be the main issue with this game, 40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop, but that's why special sales exist. If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend it.\nThe game managed to keep my interest for other 265 Hours now, and hasn't even bored me a bit so far.\nIt's probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it, or try it and hate it.\nI hope I managed to get some peoples interest, and if you are still reading this, thanks for reading my first proper review. It means quite a lot to me.\nMfG Artjom\n","March 8, 2014","true","730.3"," 521 of 532 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","521","532","0","6"

The spells you cast draw on three mana pools: Paper Mana, Bird Mana, and Sword Mana.  Bird mana is used to make peace deals, genocide cultures, and stop your people from whining about war weariness.  Paper mana, in combination with a gold sacrifice, can be used to cast construction spells, in addition to making a province you gained two years ago a core part of your nation somehow.  Sword mana is used for enchanting rebel factions to keep them in line.  You generate mana for these pools by sucking the life essence from your monarch and his cabinet of advisors.  Be careful, though, as the ones that generate the most mana tend to die rather quickly.  You'll frequently see your 6/4/5 monarch die by age 30.\n\nYou'll notice that most of the spells are involved with either war or keeping your people from whining about war.  Don't worry, that's by design.  There's nothing to do if you aren't at war.\n\n10/10 it's okay","November 5, 2014","true","517.8"," 879 of 986 people (89%) found this review helpful 647 people found this review funny","89","879","986","647","7"

I've been playing it for... I don't know how long, a few weeks. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, eating between wars, literally dreaming about my kingdom and after about 200 hours playing I haven't got tired of it yet.\n\nBut perhaps you'd like to hear a story. Maybe a tale of woe, of blood and vengeance...\n\nAustria, 1653. IronMan mode.\n\nMy King was yet another re*ard in a long line of mentally challenged Habsburgs. Administration was difficult, for he didn't know how to count from 0 to 10 by the age of 46. Pen and paper were alien artifacts for this man, who considered burping after a meal with international envoys a diplomatic act. I was proud once, when I learned he loved guns. And forever ashamed when I found out he couldn't fathom how to work a trigger. He became a General as soon as he turned 15 and then, for the first time, he was good at something... no, I'm  kidding, he was terrible. I'm sure his kind mother put that one star over his head. She didn't fool anyone. Well... no one but the king himself, of course... silly kid...\n\nSo, as a good christian overlord, I was patient-- and spent 30 years trying to kill him, spearheading the "special" monarch into the most challenging battles. Soon I started to fear he had been blessed with immortality to compensate for his almighty uselessness. The damned French on my western border had a 6/4/6 sadist on their throne. My neighbor's lawn was greener than mine. I was desperate.\n\nHence came the time when I, the Holy Roman Emperor, accidentally enacted a cursed reform that wouldn't allow me to wage war against the Empire's members anymore, bringing my struggle towards unifying the HRE almost to a halt. But I had hope in my heart, for if no tragedy happened and I managed to keep peace, the 170 years left to play should be enough for me to gather 150 Imperial Autorithy points to fulfill my objective. I had 3 provinces left under foreign rule waiting for the taking and that should guarantee my success-- so I demanded what was rightfully mine.\n\nI went to war against my oldest friend and ally, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Again. They were so scared that even with their half-russian-size territory they didn't put up a fight-- literally not one, while I went on rampaging through their territory. I needed one more point for them to accept my peace offer and return the Empire's provinces when it happened...\n\nThey sent forth a 62 regiments army against me, a 3 star general leading it. They didn't stand a chance against my 130 invading regiments, of course, which was about half my army at that time. But they were brave, and chose to forfeit their lives for the sake of their homeland. So a massive battle began-- and it unraveled quickly. The fight went on for less than a month when... my f****** s** of a b**** piece of s*** excuse for a King died in it. Yeah, sure, I was euphoric for a moment. But no, it turns out those weren't good news because...\n\nWith his demise I lost the elections to be the next Emperor-- for the first time, mind you-- so I didn't get the 10 Imperial Authority bonus. A few days (or seconds) later, after the previously mentioned battle was won and so was the war, the Empire's territories were proudly returned by me. And then I learned you can only gain Authority if you are the current Emperor. The new guy at the office, the Holy chairman of the ancient Roman Empire, the 15 year old King of a useless single-province kingdom, laughed at me. I felt it, I swear. I'll remember that moment until the day I die... possibly even longer than that...\n\nSo after about 10 minutes screaming at my computer and one more hour cursing inside my head, I recovered my sanity once again, kept it cool, and decided to wipe the Holy Roman Empire from the face of the Earth. I'm halfway there, but the more than a million rebel soldiers spawning everywhere across my kingdom are delaying my war efforts. Still, I shall have my vengeance.\n\nSorry, I had to put that out there. A 15 year old Saxe-Lauenburgian kid as the Holy Emperor... what a joke. I'll give him his first shave with a flying cannonball.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith inhuman effort and, of course, the help of God himself (thank you, Pope) I reverted my situation and finally managed to unify the HRE. Now, in 1753, from the edges of a long-gone Hungary to the borders of Spain, Europe is under my rule.\n\nBut you wonder: "Why does that matter?" And I tell you: because it means if I had been born in 1444 there would have been no World War I, this review would be written in Deutsche (or maybe I would have brought latin back, who knows?), and my grandson¹³² would rule Earth. Knowing that, I can finally sleep in peace. I feel my entire life had a meaning, and now a whole new purpose... to play Castile next. (After becoming a junior partner in a Personal Union under Spain, winning my independence alone against them and England, vassalizing the Ottomans and succumbing to a Civil War caused by the sudden, premature death of my first independent king made me give up on returning my westernized Byzantium to it's former glory-- by the 17th century again, obviously the worst hundred of years in human history)","March 22, 2015","true","331.4"," 370 of 397 people (93%) found this review helpful 326 people found this review funny","93","370","397","326","16"

History becomes your plaything as you choose among any country that existed in the year 1444 and until 1821, not just in Europe in spite of what the name suggests, but also in Asia, Africa and the Americas. You can play as one of the big boys or you can opt to play as a smaller country and try to carve out an empire as you tangle with the big fish.\n\nBe advised that the game has a steep learning curve. Even I, in spite of my several hundreds of hours of playing this game, still do not fully understand certain aspects. The game just keeps throwing new things into your face, and considering how often Paradox releases expansion packs and update patches, the game will continue to have enough stuff to interest you for a long time to come. Whether you're an achievement hunter, a master strategist or just a casual with an interest in history, this game has something to offer you if you're willing to invest the time to learn it.\n\nThe choices you can make in this game are nearly limitless; create the world's largest land-based empire or rule the seas (or both). Control the flow of trade, or ignore it and focus on the production of goods in your lands (or both). Colonize the Americas, or play as a Native American tribe and crush the colonialists. Conquer India as a European power, or conquer Europe as an Indian power. Wage holy war against the heathens and heretics of the world, or leave them be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you feel really daring you can do some truly ludicrous stuff. Play as an islamic Papal State, or create a Catholic Arabian empire. Or relocate your country to another part of the world entirely (Portugal in India, Norway in Canada, Ireland in New York, Georgia in Georgia, if you can imagine it, it is probably possible).\n\nIn Europa Universalis IV you are a painter and the entire world is your canvas.

What it really excels in is war, the other two 'focuses' of the game have been improved over time, but the game still revolves around war.  This wouldn't be a problem if with every patch they wouldn't make conquest more tedious.  From the 1.7 to the 1.8 patch (Art of War, released in November 2014), conquest was made much, much easier, and completing World Conquests (A particular feat, being the only independent nation left in the world) was made much easier.  From there, Paradox has been adding roadblock after roadblock to conquest.  This is okay, though.  If conquest was as easy as point and click, and no thought has to be put into it, then this game wouldn't be such an engaging, addicting, and fun experience.\n\nThis game's learning curve is interesting.  I can't remember much of my early experience but you're given a complex yet simple interface, tooltips that don't mean much (which has been helped with some semi-recent patches), tutorials that also don't help much, and, of course, the shock of "What am I supposed to do?  Is there a goal?"  The answer to those questions is both simple and intimidating, and it slaps you in the face rather abruptly.  It depends.  You do whatever it is you like, there is a score system but it doesn't really mean much.  That means that short of being in 1st place at the end of the game (which is rather easy for most nations), there is no goal.  You take control of your nation, you embody it.  That nation is you.  It took me about 4-6 hours to understand how to play the game, and another ~100 to 'git good'.  I stopped improving as a player (much) at about 1500 hours.\n\nIn short, this game is about entering the renaissance, takes a huge time investment, is super fun, and hard to learn.\n\n10/10 -IGN.","December 27, 2015","true","869.6"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","97","103","10","3"

It is an exquisitely detailed and complex simulator. Certainly you apply strategy to it to be successful within the simulation, but the point of the game is not to win. It is to explore possibilities, only a limited number of which are actually owned or even impacted by you. The smaller your nation or sphere of influence, the smaller impact you have on the world simulation.\n\nAs a result, you can find yourself often just letting the history of the game take its course for a while without making any meaningful decision. It’s a game where you often drop a stone in the water and watch for the ripples. Yes, the game has an unbelievable number of systems, but you need to approach it from a context almost like playing with sliders to see what happens as opposed to making winning or losing moves. When you see that, you’re able to begin to unlock what the system is trying to show you.\n\nThe easiest way to feel like you’ve failed at a game like EUIV is to play it like a traditional strategy game. The more you force your own ideas about external goals onto the game, the more challenging and resistant the game becomes, which, to be fair, is a fairly accurate representation of history as well. There’s a reason guys like Napoleon, Hitler or Alexander never win in the long run, and it’s because the more you impart your own will of domination on the world, the harder it becomes to maintain, control and stabilize.\n\nThis game never lies to you, but it allows you to lie to yourself all the time. You can fool yourself, as so many tyrannical leaders have before, that you have amassed supreme power and that your ascension is a destiny and foregone conclusion, only to find yourself torn down low almost at once. It’s an illusion fostered by so many strategy games that came before. The difference is, in other games, the bigger you are, the bigger your base of power from which to exert domination. In EUIV, being bigger makes you strong, but potentially fragile, unstable and absolutely a target.\n\n","February 22","true","455.0"," 82 of 86 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","82","86","6","4"

However the devs are more worried about what an elite few do versus new players and the many who simply play for fun.\n\nThis has led to a fundamental disconnect between the developers and customers.\n\nFor instance, Johan, the lead designer, had to take a poll to learn that locking away claim fabrication, and thus being able to fight wars in the early game, was an unpopular idea. He had to poll on twitter to figure this out ...\n\nThe steam store page talks about two key promises:\n\n1) unparalleled player freedom\n2) building a global empire\n\nFor some time now the devs have been nerfing the game patch after patch after patch reducing player freedom. The biggest problem with this approach is they make the game take longer sitting on speed 5 doing nothing but waiting in order to do the exact same things that players did previously.\n\nA slower game doing nothing isn't a better game. But the devs are unable to grasp this.\n\nAs to building a global empire patch after patch, taking longer to build the same empire isn't really the thing one would expect.\n\nThe odd thing is that they keep adding achievements to take lots of land while at the same time making taking land more time consuming without being more interesting.\n\nThe current version is simply boring imo and future versions will probably continue the trend.\n\nThe AI developer Chaingun referred to an in house "anti blobbing crusade" recently. They seem to not understand this is turning into an anti customer Crusade.\n\nThey ruined CK2. EU4 appears to be next.\n\nI hope they will change so I can go back to a positive opinion.","May 4","false","653.7"," 218 of 278 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","218","278","19","32"

A perfect example of that is territory developement, if you don't have the dlc you cannot develop buildings in a country, which is a function of the base game that you could use before the dlc, and therefore i already bought with the basic game.

PET here and I'm here to recommend you  Europa Universalis IV.\n\nEUIV is a Grand Strategy Game. That means it's pretty hard to pick up. It's something pretty unique. You start as early as 1444 and you can play with any country in the world. Yes, you head that right. ANY country in the world! The game also does not give you a purpose which makes the game a bit difficult. Some people find it hard to play a game when you don't know exactly what to do.\n\nSo this is the thing. You pick any country in the world and you do whatever you want. You can pick Portugal and try to colonize South America. Hell, you might go directly for North America. Or hell, you can even start a war with Catalunia (later Spain).

And while this is good, expanding on weak points and increasing players' options.  It also detracts from the game by forcing players to upgrade every so many months.  It is like a game you purchased for full price coming with a subscription that if you don't keep up with your game will start getting screwy.\n\nThis screwiness comes from the half-availability of aspects of each DLC, making it so that there are things you cannot do without the requisite DLC, but the game fully expects you to be doing.\n\nAside from that ever expanding problem is the tutorial, which does not keep up with the DLC.  A new player is royally porked by the tutorial as it is largely wrong and often broken.\n\nI have enjoyed it, a lot.  The game is not bad by any stretch.  But the way the DLC has gone I have become increasingly displeased with Paradox as a company and more and more I am content to just not buy anymore of these monday to friday DLC for this monkey financing games.  I will not be getting Hearts of Iron 4 until it is complete in its development cycle because of the way DLC has been handled by CK2 and EU4.\n\nDeep, rich strategy combined with deep gouging DLC...  I would skip it until you are getting the Complete pack with everything included.  Unless you are a 100% gung-ho grand strategy fan it is just not worth keeping up with the Cardassians.","March 8","false","114.0"," 204 of 273 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","204","273","12","29"

It starts in 1444 and goes all the way to 1821, following the proto-country you pick through an almost 400 year history.  There are over 100 Nations to choose from, among other formable ones once the proper conditions are met; such as Prussia, Egypt, and the Netherlands to name but a few.\n\nThe game is in real time, not turn-based, but you are able to pause the game to issue orders and deal with your affairs, or slow the game speed down to settings 1 or 2 (of 5, 5 basically being as fast as your computer can handle).  You build your armies and determine its makeup (out of Soliders, Cavalry, and Artillery) and this affects how battles will go.  A lot of Nations have special bonuses to certain things (like Poland gets a bonus to its Cavalry), which also affects the outcomes of battles; which are based on dice rolls (sort of like Risk) which are greatly affected by the general you have leading the army.\n\nIt is a complicated game with a great deal to learn (it makes Civilization seem arcadey), but if strategy, simulation, and history are your thing, it's easily worth the time investment and should provide countless hours of fun and content (it's on Steam Workshop and there are a ton of mods for it, not to mention Paradox often releases expansions and extra DLC artwork for it as well).  The game can also feel very fresh based on what part of the world you're playing in and as what Nation, as strategies will vary wildly depending on that.\n\nIt's very easy to recommend this game to fans of the genre.","October 30, 2014","true","864.2"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","52","53","0","1"

It's essentially the Renaissance. As the title suggests it's mainly focused on Europe but you can play nations such as Japan, the Ottomans, the Aztecs, the Chinese Dynasties, etc. You can be a western nation like England or France embroiled in the Hundreds year war, or you can be Austria, the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. You can be Sweden and break free from your Danish oppressors and create an empire to shock all of the lesser nations. You can even play as Byzantium and overthrow the Ottoman Empire to restore the Roman Empire to it's former glory.\n\nPros: Historically Accurate\nAlways something new to do\nGameplay is always different\nVery fun in multiple aspects\nYou can make history your way\nHelps you learn a few historical things here and there\nAlways throws a challenge or two at you\nCons: Not so newcomer friendly\nCan get frustrating at times\nI've had a hell of a blast so far while playing this game. It's not too easy if it's your first Paradox Interactive game and it's certainly not easy to anyone when they first start playing. You will mess up a lot, but once you get the hang of it it's extremely fun.\n\nI seriously recommend getting the DLCs like Art of War, Wealth of Nations, and Res Republica.\n\nHere's some screenshots from games I've played previously, whether singleplayer or multiplayer:\n\nThis siege made me cry internally\n\nYou can remove kebab if you want\n\nMy friend building the Scandinavian Armada\n\nFighting the Napoleonic wars endgame, and yes, I am amazingly somehow winning that battle.\n\n\nI would recommend this and other Paradox Interactive games to you guys.\n\nConclusion: BUY IT.","January 2, 2015","true","386.9"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","54","58","13","1"

The goal now, is to simply monetize every single aspect of this game, and make it unplayable unless you buy all the DLCs... This is unnaceptable Paradox.\n\nFor example, they patched the core 'vanilla' version of EU IV, to add a 'region development level' feature to the game. However, you cannot actually raise the development level of a region, unless you buy another dlc called "Common Sense"... Really!?! Why are you forcing this feature onto the vanilla version, if you need a dlc to fully play it? Pardon the pun, but it makes no sense.\n\nParadox is essentially going back, and making a game you bought in the past, unplayable. It's sad how how patches meant to fix bugs, and add positive features to a game, is now purposefully breaking it so you have to pay more money to fix it.\n\nTo quote Game of Thrones, SHAME!","July 18, 2015","false","576.4"," 141 of 193 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","141","193","9","8"

When one DLC causes a bug, the only way you can fix it is by buying another one. The biggest example of this is the development system. Paradox has given the AI an advantage that the player will never get regardless of their country or difficulty, and the only way that you can get on even footing is by buyig their DLC.

So with this DLC coming out you have 2 new options in regards to the building system. You can be limited to having 1-6 buildings (varies depending on province) per province, with no way of leveling up the provinces to put more buildings in. This means, that at a certain point in the game, when more that 6 buildings become available, you will not be able to do ANYTHING unless you pay $15 (USA) to unlock the development feature. This honestly pisses me off because it should be in the core game to begin with, but instead they make you pay for an essential feature. Apparently it slipped by the devs minds that this game is getting very "pay to win" because without the DLC the game is trash, honestly. The DLC is bug fixes and ♥♥♥♥ that should have been in the core game, but locked behind a paywall. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS GAME, PLAN TO BUY ALL THE DLC WITH IT!!!\n\n7/10 get your act together, Paradox","June 18, 2015","false","523.9"," 442 of 669 people (66%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","66","442","669","23","33"

A great improvement from EU3. But CK2 is still my favourite!Amazing game that really makes Civilization 5 look kind of boring in comparison.\nI'm a big fan of strategy games but have always found it hard to find that special sense of satisfaction towards the end game. Many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process. The Europa Universalis-series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at Paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in. That said, this isn't a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like Civilization. But for me, who don't mind some learning, planning and strategic thinking, it's as close to a PC-game blessing as is possible.

We began the game at 1444 and each player picked a nation. I chose tunis a small north african nation with a plan to unite africa and take southern europe by storm. Nikoli and tim decided to pair up as crimea and the golden horde with ambitions to take over muscovy before they formed russia. Patrick picked denmark, and daniel went for orissa a city state on the eastern coast of india. 3 months later the year is 1586 and the world is a very different place. As tunis i have taken control of all of northern and central africa. I also have several colonies in brazil and have succeded in subjugating the tip of italy. However my economy is in bad shape due to spain portugual and great britains repeated invasion attempts. To my east is the ottomans a massive all powerfull sunni nation who have succeded in taking a large chunk of eastern europe. Relations are tense and the only thing preventing war is my alliance with the timurids a technolgically backward horde that controls vast swathes of asia minor and india. Nikoli and tim made the mistake early on of attacking russia in the winter :D. The war lasted 15 years and nearly bankrupted both crimea and the golden horde. However they scraped a win and over the next hundred years fought off the ottomans and the united commonwealth of poland and lithuania on multiple occasions. Despite succesfully reforming his goverment and westernising nikoli's crimea was eventually overrun and he switched to play as the shogunate of japan. Tim's golden horde succesfully managed to take over the remnants of muscovy and he remains a major power in the region. Patrick managed to unite scandinavia into an empire, but grew bored and switched to playing as the papal state in italy. He is not very happy that my tunis now controls half of the peninsula and persistently declares holy wars against me :/. Daniel isolated from the rest of us has become one of the dominant powers in india and is currently colonising the spice islands. We have become very invested in this game and my dream of taking over southern europe still burns strong. Buy this game, convince all your freinds to buy this game and embark on an epic simulation of over 400 years of the worlds history.","March 27, 2015","true","240.7"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","43","52","14","1"

The game is played in real time but with the ability to pause at any time and the need to pause often it often has the feel of a turn based game.\n\nThere is no first person view like in Total War games and this is not an entry level strategy game like CIV5. So if your looking for eye candy, cool action scenes or a game that you can easily get into and learn you will not find it here. That being said EU4 has an easier learning curve than most of their games and that's due to it's top notch informative and slick UI. Information is easy to find and the Wiki is kept updated by it's devoted fanbase.\n\nThe difficulty levels can be changed in the settings but difficulty if mostly based on what starting country you choose. Also, the AI is well done and will give you headaches so expect a harsh learning curve. Patience and learning from your mistakes will be needed but once you get going you will fall in love for months if not years.\n\nThis is not a world conquest type game. Sure it can be done but that's for the elitists and die hards and is not what the game is built for. EU4 is a sandbox historical simulator of sorts. Historical events and themes influence playthroughs enriching the gaming experience for history buffs. This is a game where you set your own goals and make your own path. Don't expect the game to tell you where or what to do because it won't.\n\nParadox is a good Swedish company that is always putting out free updates and patches but on the flip side their major updates and expansions can be rough around the edges filled with bugs which can drive players mad. That being said they are very good at patching and improving their games. It just requires some patience from us beta testers err I mean gamers occasionally.\n\nIf you're a board game enthusiast, history buff and/or just wanting to step up to a more challenging but rewarding grand strategy game than I highly recommend EU4. Check out the free demo to get a taste.","July 11, 2014","true","991.4"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","4"

Seriously.\n\nIts a good strategy game and all, but it really has improved my life in other ways.\n\nFor example, I now have superhuman knowledge of trivial points in world history that will never come in handy ever. Every time i blink i see a map of continental Europe burnt into my retinas. I'm pretty sure that I have become racist towards various cultures and religions. Especially the French.\n\nSeriously, ♥♥♥♥ them.\n\nAlso stupid ♥♥♥♥ happens all the time. You've been looking at central Europe for a few hours. You pan the map to the west and notice that Haiti now owns half of America. You declare a war to claim ONE PROVINCE and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent.You feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels.\n\nThe game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on. It makes it seem that all you're doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values, but deep down inside you know whats really going on.\n\nWhen you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk, you don't realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives.\n\nI mean, i didn't even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery. The only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down...\n\nDon't even think about trying to be a tolerant, peace loving society. Either all the countries next to you will kill you, or the boredom will kill you, because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to ♥♥♥♥ the common man in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are.\n\nOverall 10/10 best opression simulator.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyranus1331/recommended/236850/","Tyranus1331","African American","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyranus1331/","75 products in account","Europa Universalis 4 is an extremely entertaining real time strategy game, similar to all the others released by Paradox Interactive. In the game, one is able to create armies and navies, invade and conquer your neighbors, and colonize the world. It has no real end goal, however world domination is nice. With a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800, there are centuries of history to play through, as historical countries, even though keeping to their set history is up to you. Europa Universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible, to conquer Europe as China, to maintain colonies accross the world, to destroy the largest empires, to invade Russia in the winter.\n\nHowever, Europa Universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge. It is not easy, and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed. There are also other nations like France, Austria, Portugal, and Castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop.\n\nMicromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay, and it can pose to be difficult, but also rewarding, to fully manage an economy, organize military forces, mitigate crises, and handle diplomacy. However this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game, and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such.\n\nEuropa Universalis IV is a great game for strategy gamers, who have no doubt at least heard of other Paradox titles, but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game.","October 11, 2014","true","283.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

I'll try to give a fairly comprehensive look at why you should or shouldn't buy this game.)\n\nI've played this game for almost 1000 hours at the time I'm rewriting this review, so i think i can be a pretty good judge. I originally didn't reccomend this game (and still don't) to the broad gaming audience, and that's for a multitude of reasons.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThis game is nearly impossible to get into by yourself. It's really difficult to learn how to play this game, let alone play it well. If you're not already coming from a strategy game background, you most likely will never put the time into learning this game. The only way that i originally got into it, was from being harrassed by a close friend of mine to play it with him because he wanted someone else to play it with. I've since done the same thing to many of my friends, and that's the only way I know of people personally learning to play it.\n\nSecondly, a lot of the game's essential features and improvements are marketed as DLC. I don't have a problem with supporting Paradox in developing new features for a game I really love, but they don't see how hard it is to come into the game with what I'm fairly certain is 100's of dollars of DLC at this point. Granted a lot of these are harmless texture packs for certain countries units, or new music. However, some of the patches with new DLC made vanilla Europa basically unplayable, such as the common sense DLC (ironically). When i started playing this game, there was only one major DLC released, so it was a lot easier to pay the extra 15 bucks or so on the back of my friend's promise that is was worth it.\n\nMy third major gripe with the game is that Paradox doesn't seem very willing to take the community's suggestions on game features and or balance. There are a lot of things in the game that the EU4 community doesn't like currently in the game. A quick example is the coalition mechanic. There's a general consensus that this mechanic needs to be either reworked or completely removed until they can think of a sensible way of implementing it. Another is a very disproportianate amount, and the quality of most rebellions. There's no reason that there should be 27 thousand seperatist rebels spawned from a small nation i just took over that had a standing army of 8 thousand. How did some rebel leader manage to persuede more people into joining their force than their actual nation had when they existed? Let alone the fact they can afford 6 artillery regiments. There's many examples of things like this and I've looked on every forum I could find and couldn't even find a response from any Paradox employee. Really frustrating and honestly kind of stupid considering they're essentially alienating a large portion of their small niche audience for no apparent reason?\n\n\nPros:\n\n\nGetting past all of the cons, this game is helplessly addicting and entertaining. I'd never become bored of forming a large empire out of a small county. The expansion and total control of your country is really amazing and something I haven't seen from another game before. It's given me nearly one thousand hours of enjoyment and it really doesn't feel like that will stop anytime soon.\n\n\n\nTldr: I can't reccommend this game to everyone. But if you can somehow manage to get past the steep learning curve, frustrating developer methods, and expensive pricetag, this game could provide you with a lot of fun.","April 17, 2015","false","109.3"," 79 of 118 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","79","118","3","10"

The last good DLC released was easily El Dorado, and afterwards they completely revamped the game, which was not needed once so ever.\n\nI will admit, the seige system in Common Sense is great, since thats the only part you dont have to pay 20 bucks to get. For me, to be forced to buy a 20 dollar dlc, to "develop" provinces, when the AI can already do that by themselves? Thats not difficulty, thats called being greedy.\n\nAside from that, the real reason I dont recommend this game, in it's current state, is because of the absoulute garbage performance it has. I've owned this game for about two years, and with those previous two years, the game has been amazing. It ran extremely well, and I absoulutely loved it. Today, I was just goofing around on it, and as I was playing it, I can actually say, I felt dirty playing it. It looked that bad, to be honest. It litterally looked like, my screen went from "smoother then a baby's ♥♥♥" to "nice trailer park bro.".\n\nSure, you can blame it on my garbage PC, but regardless, it looks nasty.\n\nIf you want a Grand Strategy game, get Crusader Kings 2, now thats a gem, not plagued by the 8 headless DLC horsemen. Well, it is, but atleast then I can safely say that I dont feel like a slavic pig dog while playing it.","April 24","false","384.7"," 50 of 69 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","50","69","2","3"

Addictive is another adjective to describe EU4.\n\nFirst of all: this game has not a learning curve, but rather a learning walls. Once you fell down climbing the first one, there are more walls to climb to entirely understand this game in its complexicity. So if you know that you will give up after a couple of tries, because you get easily frustrated DO NOT BUY this game. If you think you can deal with frustration, love complex strategy games and then buy this game.\n\nTo describe it briefly: You control in this game a nation, which you either lead to its glory or doom. Or you just survive. This is your job. How do you do this? You conquer provinces, construct buildings, draft armies, build ships, send them into battle. You will fight wars against neighbours and rivals and crush them or get crushed. The game has multiple ways of playing, you can play peaceful nations or be a warmonger.\nIf you are able to pass the 20 hours of beginner's frustration, read a couple of guides and the wiki, try to understand the game - you are in for hours of great fun and enjoyment.

The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Nation designer! Also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously The Cossack’s cost is 50% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks, not anything "expansive". It’s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free. I love the concept of a game developing after its release, but don’t make me pay for every slight tweak. Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For “The Cossacks”, that's roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly $13 dollar left to pay, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial "deal" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next "grand" expansion for EU4 because oh well, right?\n\n\nUPDATE 4/10/16:\nWith the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanision then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.\n\n\nP.S. 5/28/16:\nEuropa Universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable. It stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience. Paradox is becoming a disappointment, if they aren't already.","January 28","false","99.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","1"

It doesn't need fancy graphics and extreme 3D battles, it's all up to your imagination. All you need to be a true conqueror of the world is your brain. It all comes down to tactics and knowledge. Once you got into it EUIV will drag you into parallel existence for a very long time where you can write your own history...maybe you will dominate the world...or maybe you will get crushed because you became to greedy.\n\n\nPro:\nYou can easily waste hundreds of hours playing this game without getting bored (duration of one game if you play it from the earliest date until the end: 15-30 hours)\nHigh replayability: Every nation is different and has it's pros and cons. No game will be the same.\nStrategy with depth: You have to take care of loads of stuff in your realm, plan ahead, adjust everything to suddenly changed situations and watch your friends, enemies, rivals and coalitions closely to prevent the development of bad situations and to turn it into an advantage over your enemies.\nWorld design looks great\nChange the true history and write your own\nChallenging AI (mostly)...so you don't need other players to have fun\nMultiplayer via Steamworks: I haven't played it with strangers yet but it's so much fun to play with some friends. Make plans together to dominate the world or plot against each other or just backstab your mate in the darkest hour to make profit. Everything is possible. Your friends don't need all the DLC. Every player has access to the DLC of the host. Nice feature!\nIronman mode: No mods, vanilla game settings, no manual save option, only 1 autosave slot -> this mode is the mode if you're looking for the real fun. You have to think twice before you decide important decisions because you always have to live with the outcome. This prevents you from doing stuff too careless and forces you to use your brain more. Every success will be so much sweeter.\nLoads of challenging achievements (only achievable in Ironman mode)\nSteam Workshop support: There are some pretty good mods available.\n\nNeutral:\nSteep learning curve: You will forget where your head is in your first 5-10 hours if you haven't played a title from 'Paradox' before because there is so much to take care of, but once you have learned the core mechanics you will have a blast! You will even learn new stuff after 100 hours of gameplay. This keeps the game interesting. It is absolutely worth the effort but if you are a impatient person...this game won't be your cup of tea.\nDLC politic: It's a bit controversial in the community. The main DLC from Paradox are always worth the money but there are several cosmetical packs with new unit skins or music for a few bucks. Some people are arguing that the cosmetical stuff is cut out of the main DLC to milk more money, but Paradox is saying that they're cut out to lower the price of the main DLC because not everyone needs or wants them. Those who want them, can purchase them separately while other people don't have to pay for a feature they don't need. I like it the way it is. I buy the cosmetical stuff when I like it and while it's on sale. Some extra support for the devs. You won't miss something big if you don't have them.\n\nContra:\nGerman translation: It's a mess. All games from Paradox have a messed up german translation. Missing lines, completely wrong words...simply awful. It isn't a big deal for me because I can understand english and play it with english language but there are people out there which have a problem with it. I guess the translation for other languages aren't much better. Paradox should definitely hire some proper translators or doublecheck the translation with beta tester.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a 'must-have' for every strategy lover. Absolutely worth the full price. If you can get it while it's on sale: what are you waiting for? It's a steal. Buy it. The world, your vassals and your army are waiting for you.\n\n\n10/10\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holsterbau/recommended/236850/","holsterbau","hauser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holsterbau/","276 products in account","I have played this game for over 900 hours, because the older versions of the game looked rather promising. Then with every consecutive DLC and "free" update I started losing faith. Now I will just have to say that this game is unplayable, for several reasons:\n\nRather than improving and fixing the AI to suit the game, they do the exact opposite. They made a horrible, mostly useless AI and started designing the game around it. This results in a game that, inevitably, will feel less like a simulator of history between 1444 and 1821, and more like just a bunch of blobs around your blob that you have to fight. It is in no way different from RTS games at this point, except somewhat bigger and semi turn-based. Even for people who do not particularly care about history, this is still dreadful, because the AI is no longer in any way enjoyable. In older versions of the game you could actually see the Holy Roman Empire being made from time to time, but now the bots are such debiles that there is no way you are going to see that, ever.\n\nParadox Interactive are a bunch of kikes who know incredibly well that they virtually own the grand strategy market. Initially it did indeed look like PI was caring about designing an interesting game and the first DLC was kind of alright. Did not take too long to see the trend, though. They know very well that nobody will be making any similar game any time soon. Practically they force loyal consumers to pay for overpriced garbage that does not add anything, because, as already said, they know they have nowhere else to go. There are no high-budget non-Paradox grand strategy games. Below is a list explaining exactly how little all of the DLC does in comparison to the price you are paying for it.\n\nHowever, before I start, here is something you really need to know: DLC is just a cancerous term that has been made, sort of like a political euphemism, to start pushing through human vitriol that can be literally anything and charge for at the price of literally any arbitrary amount. The term "expansion packs" did not exactly cut it for multi-billion dollar corporations like Electronic Arts and Paradox (the publisher) who wished to sell garbage to the consumer. However, that is not to say all DLC can be horrible. The DLC for EU4 is cancer, though. Why is it cancer? Because it does not introduce any new game mechanics to the game. It merely disguises itself as unlocking new mechanics, but in reality the game mechanics are already offered for free, but these work only for the bots. All the DLC does is enables these features to work for you, the player, as well. That is why every Paradox Interactive employee needs to land under a speeding bus on a highway. Anyway, here it is:\nCommon Sense - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? They like to make big lists of features for every DLC, but this is the only significant change you will feel at all: being able to improve development in provinces, add inferior static bonuses to your Protestant nation and being able to support the independence of junior union partners or colonies. Mind you that none of these mechanics are advanced. You will work these out in five minutes. This is at the top of the list because of the fact that you are paying Paradox Interactive 12 dollars for having to pay a horrendously large sum of monarch points for a meagre improvement in your provinces. The most important part is that the bot can do this even if you do not have the DLC.\nArt of War - Costs a little over 12 dollars. What does it do? It allows your ships to carry allies. Does this have any use outside of multiplayer (i.e. for allied bots?) You guessed it. No! Not at all. Okay, but what about being able to designate objectives in enemy/occupied provinces? No, it doesn't work. None of these features work, because the AI is broken. Paradox Interactive is a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in Sweden and apparently also the least competent one, full of hissy hipsters who revolt at the sight of game criticism. More on that below. It also adds a Thirty Years' War mechanic, which really is the least enjoyable event in the entire game. Oh, and by the way, you can finally make templates of armies/navies so, when you grow to become a huge nation with one million manpower, you do not have the go through the tedium of building a new army from scratch after losing someone in a battle. Why should I pay 12 dollars for such an extremely basic feature you would expect in a grand strategy game to begin with? Oh, because Paradox, and apparently we need millions more to pay for all of our five active employees (50% of population of Sweden). Not to mention, this does not work either, lol. If the landscape you draft your men from has any strait, this seemingly bugless ("What could go wrong?") feature fails to recruit men in a logical manner. Seriously, wow. Great job.\nEl Dorado - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? Apparently gold fleets or something. Then some exploration of the Seven Lost Wonders. Then the basic feature, that should have been there to begin with, of automatic exploration. I hope you are starting to see the trend of how you have to pay 12 dollars for very, very basic and barebones GUI features you would expect from a multi-billion dollar company and publisher's grand strategy video game. Oh, and you can make a custom nation. That is probably the only thing worth paying for at all, since there indeed seems to have gone some effort into making this somewhat interesting. The values seem to all be balanced. This is the only compliment Paradox is going to get from me. Naturally, though, this is nowhere near enough to keep me interested, let alone forgive for the greed of those subhumans and senseless game design.\nCossacks - I am not going to buy this because at this point it really is directly insulting not just my own, but everyone's intelligence. They want you to pay for knowing what provinces your allies and enemies are interested in. The moment I saw this, I was, like, do they think we are Down's children or something? Why should I pay 15 dollars (used to be 20 dollars, mind you) for something so simple, something I would expect to see in a grand strategy game to begin with? When you go into a grand strategy game about Europe between 1444 and 1821, you expect all the drama that was going on. You expect to be able to interact with other nations' conclaves and heads of state in an engaging way. This was never in the game, but I had some faith in Paradox and expected this to be like that eventually. However, this dream is shattered and I have been conned by charlatans that simply do not deserve anyone's time, and, most importantly, money. I hope every single one of these debiles drowns in burning petrol.There are other DLCs, but they will only redundantly reinforce my points above. Basically, do not buy them. Stay away from this game. If you do not give any money to these people, you are enabling candidates who might rise up to fame and, in an ideal scenario, come up with superior alternatives to Europea Universalis, Crusader Kings and whatever other filth Paradox pumps out. Do everyone, especially humanity, a favour and do not buy this game or any of its "content".\n\nAs for the developers themselves: in update 1.10, they introduced a feature that makes, essentially, no sense from both a video game and human perspective. Basically, when you go to war with someone, they have military access through every single nation that gives military access to you. Yes. Not the enemy. You. Let us not improve the AI and make them stop going to wars they geographically cannot possibly win, no, let us just add a feature that makes literally no sense at all. You have to be mentally ill, seriously. Screw Paradox. I wish there wasn't a character limit on this.","February 5","false","006.8"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","36","48","6","4"

However I would never reccomend EUIV or Crusaders Kings II to anyone for any reason whatsoever.\n\nParadox interactive is number one on my list of companies that I will NEVER buy from again. They force you to buy expansions by automatically updating your EUIV game and basically forcing you to pay for an expansion to unlock certain features. This locks you out of certain aspects of the game like not being able to develop your provinces unless you buy the Common Sense DLC.\n\nFurthermore it makes all of your previous save games incompatible. I spent 170 hours playing as England and basically getting to a point where I dominated world trade. I can no longer play that save game so essentially all of that time has been wasted.\n\nBesides whatever the initial price tag is you need to consider how much of a dent buying all of the expansions will put into your pocket. You also need to realize that you will be forced by paradox to buy future expansions and that your save games will essentially be unplayable in as little as a year.\n\nNEVER NEVER NEVER BUY ANY GAME FROM PARADOX.

If you're the type of person that prefers the straight-up game with no DLC attatchments, then try this game. Otherwise, listen to my personal opinion and you can determine if you want to get this game or not. And please don't downvote this because EU4 is your favorite game ever, and same thing vice versa if you hate EU4.\n\nOkay, before I start, when I first got this game I fell in love with it. It was much more in-depth than my previous favorite game of Civilization 5, and as you can tell by the hours I have on this game, I'm not exactly new to the functions of this game. The game itself and its mechanics/ideas are great, but Paradox seems to screw up a number of games that they produce.\n\nThe reason why I don't suggest you get this game (unless if it's on sale, in which case I encourage you to try this game so long that the price is fair) is that Paradox loves to constantly update this game. Which yes, in some cases is needed, but many of them seem absolutely pointless (unless if it is centered around the release of a DLC). The reason why these updates seem so useless is that they constantly makes workshop items incompatible with the latest update. So if you've put 10+, 20+, etc hours into a single campaign that you've been working on and had plans for, and that save was connected to certain workshop items, then tough luck trying to play that campaign again. The reason is because everytime that Paradox updates the game, there's always one or two (at least) mod authors that decide it isn't worth updating their creations again (which I don't blame them, I'd feel the same way). So even if you try reverting back to the older version of EU4, then some of the mods are already updated, and same problem - it's an incompatible save. And these updates barely change the mechanics of the game itself - not to mention most of the bug fixes are done immediately after a major update, which is every update.\n\nAnother reason why I suggest to not get this game is because Paradox is sort of like EA 2.0 in which they also come out with numerous DLC expansions that can cost up to $25-$30 when first released (the older ones may be $10-$15). And these DLCs that bring "game changing mechanics and functions" in reality do jack-♥♥♥♥ in changing the game. Yes, if you were to get all the DLCs then the game would change quite a bit from its intial release state; but you'd have to pay a nice hefty sum of $120+ (if I remember I'll insert the actual price of the game + all the DLCs combined here: ) to do so. And unless you own your parent's wallet or have a pretty nice sum of money saved up that you don't mind throwing $120 into the garbage, then it's quite unrealistic that you'd want to do this (which I haven't, all except 1 of the DLCs I have I got on sale for about $5 each, and I only have 4 DLCs. I also got the game on sale as well.)\n\nSo is this game fun? Yes. Do I regret putting so much time into it? Also yes. My suggestion if once Paradox focuses on the next game in the series of these empire-building strategy games and stops with the updates and DLCs for EU4, you should immediately give this game a try. Otherwise, you're just wasting hours of your life and your money away.","May 15","false","261.2"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","45","65","2","3"

It was and arguably still is one of the best games in the Grand Strategy genre. But the DLCs killed the whole thing. First, the price of each new expansion is getting above any reasonable amount for a bunch of not that much meaningful/flavorful features. Don't get me wrong, some of the expansions are great, but lots of them feel like something that should be in the base game in the first place, or not at all.  But that would be fine, nobody forces you to buy DLCs, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe DLC policy of Paradox is absolutely horrendous - once it's launched, you get the DLC installed automatically with a patch of base game and the AI countries are using the benefits of DLCs for themselves (the most striking example is the province development in Common Sense), and unless you pay, you are forced to compete with enemy that has a massively unfair advantage. It is a blatant cash grab and because of that, I won't be buing any more of Paradox's DLCs or new games (even though I was hyped for HoI 4 like anyone else), unless they clean their act or at least release a complete edition... although then there's the risk that it will be like the EU III Complete edition all over again.","April 7","false","235.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Other than its worth its purchase on how you see it.\n\nFirstly to start this review, this game will take your way of strategy in managing a country in a good diplomatic and expanding style. It is not the Crusader Kings 2, but that is not necessary a bad thing, quite the opposite in some ways. If you want to play a game that focuses on managing a country through pretty much basic but a variety of ways which focus around diplomacy, colonies and expanding. This is the game to get.\n\nPro Aspects about the game:\n\nThe Game by itself with its historical starts and able to play pretty much almost over hundreds of different nations from start to finish with many having their own ideas and historical events coming up is just fantastic. This game does show that if you make certain decisions that would have happened in real history it affects your game in the long run. Also its fun to learn about a little history about nations in a game without having to read a book about them at the same time.\n\nAnother apart from being very addictive is to make you focus rather on brute force but rather using deception strategies when managing your country. Ironically when playing later on with smaller nations I had more enjoyment in making them survive in the shadow of bigger powers and then during the end making them into large empires of their own with the former enemies now in fear. You get a sense of feeling like a proper leader focusing on expansion.\n\nCons about the game:\n\nThis might be just a little pick of some stuff but firstly the tutorial to get into the game does not really support fresh gamers to a new strategy style of game. But this is not fully a bad thing since Paradox games usually are kinda daunting to get into so, if you want to play this game (Which I still recommend strongly you try it out) Look online for guides for this is a very meaty and large in content in game. So be prepared to have moments of mass confusion though over time this comes in practise.\n\nOver a large amount of time if not managed properly your save data will pile up and start eating up your storage so if you have limited storage be sure to remove saves you don't want to keep. At one point I managed to aquire over 45 Gb of storage from just saves alone. Then again if this is taking the date of hundreds of nations and yours as well then I'm not surprised.\n\nAlso this game is not a game to focus around and command armies or navies around the world in the battles so don't expect the game to focus around that which is not really a bad thing but should not be mistaken for being so.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAlthough this game is daunting to take in at first and can be difficult in managing countries even on Iron Man Mode which makes you have 1 save on the go, this is for me as a strategy lover my most played, appreciated, loved and enjoyed game I've ever played. If you are a strategy player, this deserves a place in your game library or at the very least for you to try out the demo now and take a nation in a historical way, or change the world map forever.","April 23, 2014","true","442.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"
