It's a great platformer and the levels are very well put together. The fake CRT screen refresh rate line was getting on my nerves after awhile. Great art style and very fluid controls. If you're a fan of platformers, I'd buy it at any price point, if you're on the fence, I'd wait till for a sale.\n\nOne minute review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RKgE3E0IMc","July 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

I would only wish the more of the ASCii character set was used for a real DOS/UNIX look like in the retro early-early 90's, 16:9 support would look approperate on my PC's monitor or TV. No loading issues or anything with my GTX980/i7 4930k. Also - custom refresh rates would serioustly be nice! (how does this work currently? Does it use system?) I have a 144hz with strobe support (BenQ XL2720Z) and platforms have that beautiful CRT feel when I can kick it to 144fps @ 144hz :D\n\nDefently worth $5 - should make a PS Vita port of this.","July 6, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","12","16","4","0"

I'll write my review in list form for a better overview:\n\nPROs:\n\n+ Easy and accurate controls\n+ Many graphic options\n+ Easy to roam menu system\n+ Level editor\n+ Super fast respawn on death\n\nCONs:\n\n- Xbox 360 controller-compatiblaty, but none with the more recent Xbox One controller\n- Later levels are rather cheap than challenging\n- Achievements are bugged, you may receive ones for actions not yet completed\n- Annoying music\n\nSo overall I'd give this game a 7/10. It isn't too hard either, you will get the hang of the controls rather soon and breeze through the levels. I played for 3 hours until finishing the game including collecting all keys.","October 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you're good at platform games and are agile with your WASD keys then this will keep you occupied probably for a couple to a few hours.\n\nIs it worth the price? Depends if you like puzzle platformers, but if the game has caught your eye and you have a couple of hours to kill you could do a lot worse. At the end of the day it's less GBP than can be counted on one hand.","August 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
