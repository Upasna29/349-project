The main thing that drew me into Paperbound was the interesting artstyle. I was really surprised/happy when I started playing and the game was awesome in nearly every way. There is tons of different things to see while playing Paperbound. This includes: 17 playable characters (appearances from characters from Monaco, VVVVVV, Tumblestone, Cards and Castles, and Guacamelee), 18 arena maps, and plenty of gamemodes to play (teambased and free-for-alls). The only thing that I can truly be upset about is the lack of online multiplayer, but the saving grace is the AI. Some people may say not all games need online multiplayer, but this an arena game and I would love to player with friend across the world.\nPros\nFun gameplay\nAppearances from other game characters (Monaco, VVVVVV, Tumblestone, Cards and Castles, and Guacamelee)\nAwesome Artstyle\nMore than enough settings\n17 Playable Characters\n18 Arena maps\nGreat AI opponents\nPlenty of gamemodes for free-for-all and teams\n\nCons\nGame feels much better with a controller (to me it seemed like it’s made for controllers)\nWould be much better with an online mode. (Some would say not everything needs multiplayer, but I would love to play with friends across the world)\nConclusion\nPaperbound is a local-multiplier arena game with an awesome artstyle and it is nearly perfect. With tons of characters, arena maps, and gamemodes to play you will have tons of fun playing with friends or the AI in game. The only thing I wish Paperbound had would be online multiplayer, but since it has AI it’s not a huge deal. If you are playing on having a gaming day with some friends or just enjoy fun arena fighter Paperbound is a must buy.\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKoHH9IngWg\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Each character has different skins, and the guest stars look like they were taken straight out of their respective game. There are five books, each one based on a different classic novel: A Journey to the Center of the Earth, Skull Kingdom, A Book of Five Rings, The Book of the Dead and Dante's Inferno. While most of them are well realised, there are a few levels that are too small for four players to fight in.\n\nGAMEPLAYIf you have any real friend, siblings, cousins or pets with whom you get along with, than Paperbound is for you. This is a local co-op only game with up to four players, and for those lonely you can play with up to three bots, which are really challenging. There are a total of 17 characters, including Captain Viridian from VVVVVV, the Goblin King from Tumblestone, Jonview the Protector from Cards and Castle, Juan from Guacamelee!, and the Locksmith and the Gentleman from Monaco. Unfortunately, all the characters play and feel the same, with the only difference being their attack animations.\nThis game is a one-hit kill brawler, and there are three ways to kill your enemy: by meleeing him, by throwing scissors or by launching an ink bomb. However, the selling point of this game is the possibility to invert gravity: this is a total game changer, making each round really fast paced.\nThere are two types of game mode: Free for All and Teams. In Free for All, you can play Classic Versus, in which the first one to reach a certain amount of frags must escape from a page tear to win, Survival, in which the last player with any lives remaining wins, and Long Live the King, in which the first player who gets a frag becomes the king and must try to survive, while fragging the king makes you become the king. In Teams, there is also Capture the Quill, a small variation of Capture the Flag. They are all a lot of fun to play with friends and family, especially the ones in Free for All. You can also change some options before starting a match, like Number of Bots, Number of Scissors and so on.\nThe controls are really responsive and intuitive with a controller, while the keyboard controls are really awkward, so be sure that everyone is using controllers for the best experience possible.\n\nCHALLENGEAs already mentioned before, changing gravity makes the game more intense than ever, with characters and scissors flying all over the place. In case you don't have someone to play with, there are bots that make the game really challenging, especially in Free for All, and they are quite possibly the best AI I have seen in a brawler in quite some time.\n\nSOUNDEven though each stage has a different musical theme, most of them are quite forgettable. The only track I really like is the Main Theme, which reminds me quite a lot of Magicka. The sound effects are nothing spectacular and worth mentioning.\n\nREPLAYABILITYYou will replay this game with your friends over and over. Unfortunately, there are no unlockables excluding the book of Dante's Inferno.\n\nOverall, this is a fast-paced brawler that brings enough new ideas to the table to feel fresh. I highly recommend this to those with many friends and to fans of smash-up brawlers. If you don't enter in any of these categories, than you won't enjoy this game.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 8\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","March 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","21","36","4","0"

Think final destination, no items from Super Smash Brothers. And while it's got a couple of twists to it, the game's variety will take a hit over time for people who really want powerups/change ups. The game is technically sound, that's for sure, and it can be fun with a bunch of friends. But for others, it's not going to hold up for them due to the lack of variety. It's hard to completely recommend over games like Towerfall: Ascension or Grand Class Melee 2 for my personal tastes, but the base combat is solid. It's not for me specifically, but  I can specific recommend it for those technical combat players out there who don't want a lot of complexity in their fights.\n\n+:\n-Technically Sound\n-Options regarding settings for matches, to customize how you want it. The options really make sense given the game mechanics.\n-Great for chaotic play, but without it being unfair.\n-Controls are solid.\n-Good variety of maps.\n-Solid gameplay choices with survival, king mode, etc.\n\n-:\n- Twist with escaping through a page tear can lead to 3 on 1 situations that needs to be changed up, as it can extend matches for no good reason.\n-No rebindable controller controls.\n-Some combinations of characters and maps don't work because of blending in with maps.\n-Some maps don't work personally, due to a too drawn back camera, despite it being designed (game level wise) well.\n-It's sad that another game like this doesn't have online capabilities, but on the flip side they don't advertise as such.\n\n\nFor more first impressions and gameplay footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BDJUDLoutw","March 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","13","26","2","0"

After I got the game, I had a hard time figuring out the controls for a keyboard, and I found it rather anyoying that it doesn't tell you what buttons do what, and even more frustrating was how I haven't found a way to customize the keyboard. I've tried using a controller, but when I start the game, It disconnects whatever controller I have connected. But even though I had no Idea what I was doing, I still rather enjoy Paperbound. It's even more fun playing with friends (who also have no idea what they're doing)! It's a timeless, easygoing game that is fun for everyone!","April 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The controls are also simple to learn 1/2 games and you won't have single problem with it.\n\nGraphically is eye candy, even in low end pc you will enjoy all battle scenarios and OST is good also, each scenario has is own BGM.\n\nNow, does this game worth buying? Sure it does if you have friends that will come to your house and play with them, if you're like me and your friends don't like this type of stuff you basically have single player game to play alone which is a bummer, if the developer adds MP this game would be even cooler, until then not so much!\n\n~ 6/10*\n\n* Score could change if the add MP.","October 20, 2015","false","7.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Nice selection of characters, though unfortunately due to the nature of the game they are all essentially the same.but they are at least fun to look at and the whole design aesthetic of the game is fantastic.\n\nNow for the bad:\n\n\n\nMy biggest ishue is with the "Classic Versus" game mode.  The theory behind it,  reaching a set score limit and then escaping works in theory, but the problem is that these matches can last for an infinite amount of time due to the fact that if you are killed, the portal goes away.  This is particularly problematic when playing with a partner as both members must reach the goal together.  This is tricky enough, especially when playing the campaign mode in single-player,  but it is compounded on certain stages.   For example, the Grinder, a stage from Dante's Inferno, ok, awesome idea..  touching the walls means death and moving platforms all over.. cool...  but when you ad in AI to the mix,  well my opponents were at a score of -81 when I finally had enough.   My team was able to reach the frag limit several times, but given that it takes a few seconds for the tear to open up, and that my partner was getting killed or killing me the moment it appeared, victory, while possible, seemed very unlikely unless I played for a very long time.\n\nMy other major gripe is that campaign mode does not posess a save feature of any sort for progress.  You could argue that other, similer games do not use this and are successful, but with the nature of gameplay (particularly the flaws in the above game-mode) being unable to stop and return to the book where you left off seems like a major problem.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a fun little game.  I enjoyed playing it despite the frustrations, but it would be a LOT better if these issues were dealt with.","December 8, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
