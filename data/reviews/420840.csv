Does it innovate and excite? No on both counts. But as a physics exercise, Blarp is fantastic at demonstrating what VR, and more importantly motion controlled VR, can do.\n\nThe game is basic, almost painfully so. A psychadelic eyeball called a "Blarp" is floating around in a box with you. You can 'attract' it by pulling the trigger of the Vive Bagel Blaster associated with your right hand, and the Blarp will attempt to make sweet, sweet love to your remote. When you stop pulling the trigger, the Blarp continues on its last path and velocity, whether or not your remote is still there. Also of note is that Blarps can not turn on a dime -- more accurately, they can maybe turn on a manhole cover. What this means is that you bull-and-cape it into running into a target floating in the box with you. Upon hitting the target, another Blarp spawns, and now BOTH of those Blarps independently try to track down your Bagel Blaster when you pull the trigger. As you fling these helpless eyeballs into more and more targets, more of their compatriots spawn, attempting to destroy the interloper (your remote) in their midst. You keep going until you "get Blarped" (to use the in-game verbiage), i.e. a Blarp runs into your remote.\n\nThere are no complex mechanics or systems to learn, just an intrinsic understanding of momentum and spatial awareness. Yet despite the simplicity, the game achieves its goal quite readily -- you realize that there is literally no way to play this game outside of VR. Without the depth perception, you won't be able to determine how far away the Blarps are from your remote, and by extent you'll end up striking out. Without motion controls, you wouldn't be able to 'swing' the Blarps from target to target (although I will readily admit that a PS Move could easily do just this, the only benefit of the Bagel Blasters of the Vive is being able to carefully sneak your way past a Blarp cloud as you gather them up for the next target.)\n\nAs a game, aye, it's lacking. But as a $3 demonstrator of VR technology? Yeah, yeah, I think it does the job.","May 5","true","0.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I found the controller and sheild models kind of weird but I guess it fits with the theme. Very cool being able to control the floating eyes and move around them, really shows off the 3D capabilities of the HMD.","April 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great demonstration of how to use limited space to make the player traverse the available area and work out the best shots. Arcadey goodness and does not put a timer in place to make you feel rushed. One of the better Vive experiences and totally worth the price. Hoping for increased variety of levels and challenges in the future.","April 26","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some reason I thought this was going to be similar to Modbox.  This game is a great example of the thrill you get when entering a new medium... I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly suprised.\n\nI enjoy playing BLARP! but I think it needs local high score lists like Space Pirate Trainer and the ability to mute the music so that you can play your own.  If it had these two options it would be ideal.","April 16","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only played it sitting down and it's still great, can't wait to try it in roomscale. i didn't expect much and I only bought it because it's so cheap, but now that I've played it, I'd probably pay $10-$20 for it.\n\nalso, and maybe this is just me, but I feel like this is the beginnings of a waterbending simulator","April 9","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After all, quite a few VR-"games" which costs three or five times more are just glorified demos. Blarp doesn't fall into that category though. It is indeed a simple casual game, but it is a highly entertaining one. It is neither scary nor violent and it relies heavily on fluid movements and precision on the part of the player, making it perfect for all ages, especially as the learning curve is extremely low : if you ever swung a shopping bag you'll know how to control your flock.\nAs seems to be the norm for VR games : don't let the screenshots fool you. The game looks MUCH better when you are in it than what the flat pictures can convey.\n\nIf you have a Vive and at this (perfectly chosen) price, it should be an insta-buy!","May 22","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't expect to get a lot of hours out of Blarp! Maybe another 2 myself (trying to beat my high score, as that's all there is to do) and possibly another 2 demoing it to people. I'm totally okay with that. For the price I could either buy large Snickers bar or I could spend 2 hours in a gooey, dark cage flinging eyeballs that cut shreds into a dimension of hypercolor.","May 21","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd consider it thoroughly in the "wow, look what VR can do!" category... but it is really fun to sling those things around, especially in the teens and mid twenties.  Up into the thirties, the blarp swarm seems to be pretty unmanageable (mainly because of the extreme size/speed differences that build up), but by that point you've already had a great time and a long turn, so it's time for someone else to play anyway :P","May 16","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game takes a lot of patience when you get dozens of BLARPS! floating around, and can be incredibly frustrating when you're pushing for one more and and a tiny BLARP! sneaks up behind you and game over!\n\nWhile this game might not be for everyone, at the $3 price I think it's absolutely worth taking a moment to check it out.\n\nedit: speeling","May 31","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
