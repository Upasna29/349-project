In Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- players are given choices to make in the game and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story. It features 2 or 3 endings? 1 of them being a Bad end and the other being a Good end. Relevant links will be can be found below.\n\nThe StoryLucy ~The eternity she wished for~ is a Visual Novel, about a boy and an android. You play as the boy, who faces decisions and moral dilemmas that he struggles constantly in this near-future world.\n\nIn the near future, androids have become the way of the norm they can be found everywhere in human daily lives. Emotionless husks of metal have become a part of human society, much to the dismay of the boy because he had always preferred the "old methods". The robot he found at the dump site though, this one was different. It laughed, it cried, it smiled, just like a human… It has emotions..\n\nAudio and Visual elementsBackground, CGs  art – Backgrounds are generally average nothing too fancy to talk about the background art, but as for the CGs I felt it is a little wasted not saying that it is bad in anyway but the CGs they tend to use glares to cover up the background which makes it bright which is good, but at the same time taking away the atmosphere that it could have been created with backgrounds to add more to the game as a whole. Something which caught my attention is that the UI or menu is very beautifully done I love the direction off the VN that it makes the menu and UI looks very realistic which contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere.\n\nAudio Elements – Nothing really stand out for the audio elements except for the fact that it cues in nicely and properly to fit in with the mood of the characters in turn manages to set the atmosphere perfectly every time. There is also voice acting for Lucy available both in Korean and Japanese voice.\n\nTo sum upTo sum up will I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- ? Simple answer yes, it is well worth your time and money for sure and for people who likes a sad story or maybe Sci-Fi be sure to get this game.\n\nClick here for the full review with images etc etc[azusantiara.com]","February 29","true","9.2"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","57","63","8","5"

Having now finished the True End (11.5 hrs in), like I said initially, this is a Visual Novel worth experiencing!\n\n3- With achievements and  extras to unlock, replay value is also good with this lovely work.\nAhhh, the smiles!","February 28","true","2.7"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","48","60","6","7"

PERIOD.\n\nI laughed, I cried tears of sadness, tears of joy,  I bit my tongue in anger, Questioned what defines life truly and most importantly I was touched inside and began to question some of my own demons in my life. I will say that the people who wrote this were not your run of the mill writers, but were both very articulate and intelligent. I won't state my reason for believing this due to possible spoilers but I must say they certainly must have pondered the very topic of this Visual Novel themselves, such as  using  Asimov ((who is one of my favorite writers)), and a few other thinkers and writers as an inspiration as well.\n\nNow I will get to the pros and cons.\n\nPros.\n\nGreat Artwork. 9/10\nGood Mood setting music. 7/10\nNot a lot of Characters but the ones in the Game are meaningful and all are key to the entire plot. Quality over Quanity. 10/10\nMain Protaginist Feels very real, as do his supporting cast. 10/10\nPlot Twist with true ending that was very emotional and well done ((not to mention the very meaningful and Emotional Epilogues too))\nThought provoking, morally and spritually.\nGood Customer support after I had issues starting the Application.\nNo forced romance , friendships or plot, things developed in time and all are meaningful when they do.\n\nCons.\nHad an error starting the game, but that has been fixed.\nPredictible in some ways to a veteran of visual novels of what the "right choices" are to get the true ending.\nWish the game went on longer just because I got attached to the characters ((not really a con just me whining it had to end. :( ))\n\nWould I recommend Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For? Yes, but see Below.\n\nI would recommend it for those who are looking for a thought provoking, emotional roller coaster of a visual novel,\n\nBut for those that want a visual novel with the main plot being sex, or nudity...look elsewhere this one isn't for you.\n\nOnce again thank you for taking the time to read my poorly written review but I can not express enough of how impressed I was with this little Visual Novel.\n\nI would like to say excellent work to the team that put this together and made it all possible as well.\n\nKind regards.\n\nP.S.

The emotional base and development of the main character is very real and you'll eventually come to the point where you can't not feel for him when you understand where a lot of his actions come from. This game poses very real philosophical questions like "At what point does AI cross the line and become human? Does that even happen?" and "Is there even a difference between AI and humans on a developmental scale?" One of my favorite ideas from the game is the thought that humanity doesn't like robots because they show the flaws of man.\n\nMaybe I'm reading into too much into it or I'm just plain wrong. The point I'm trying to make is that this VN tries to make you think and tries to be more than just a story about a boy and his robot. That reason alone should be enough to at least give it a shot.","February 28","true","0.1"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","37","46","4","0"

Also, If just reading the title of the VN causes you to sink in thoughts, then the VN did something special.\n\nAs for Lucy,\nall those points above are applying to this VN. I shed countless tears and my heart got touched very often.\n\nStory\n\nI hate it to spoil anything about the story. I can only say, that the Story  is really really  heart-touching.\n\nTheme\n\nThe theme is settled in the future, where androids are part of the daily life and are helping out with normal chores or other tasks.\n\nCharacters\n\n\nMain character\n\nThe Main character is a normal boy who can make proper decisions. But unlike the most people in this world, he hates robots. It's really interesting to see how his mind is changing from time to time.\n\nThe father\n\nThe father is just ***** not more or less.\n\nLucy\n\nLucy is a cheerful and lighthearted android. Really, right after the first time I met her, I instantly loved her. Her "Ahem" is soooo cute that your heart will melt.\n\nIn short: Lucy is awesome!\n\n\nThe Soundtrack\n\nA reaaally enjoyable Soundtrack, it fits perfectly to the current scene. I love especially the sad and the "thoughtful" tracks (They are emphasizing the situation a lot, that you will get a bigger impact^^)\n\n\nUserinterface (UI) and text boxes\n\nBoth are well designed and are fitting to the general theme.\n\n\nCg\n\nThe Cg's are all really beautiful  and are supporting the whole story.\n\n\nVoice(s)\n\nFirst of all, only Lucy is voiced ( Korean and Japanese)\n\nOh my god  the japanese VA was awesome! She did a gorgeous Job! You can hear clearly all emotions when she speaks. Just awesome. The Voice-quality is very good too.\nHowever, besides the voices, there were also various soundeffects, which were also in a good quality.\n\nExtras\n\nAfter clearing the game, you will unlock the CG gallery and 3 extra scenarios. Also, you have the chance to unlock the true ending.\n\nthe true ending caused me to shed tears again, but left me with a totally satisfied feeling\n\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe devs are really friendly and are trying to help you in the steam forums very fast. I appreciate this a lot ! :)\n\nIn the end, I am very happy that I could meet Lucy and I will definitely grant her, her wish - the eternity she wished for !                         and I wish for\n\n100% recommendation It would be a shame if you would miss this perfect Visual Novel\nThank you M-Vizlab !","March 5","true","11.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","11"

This game makes us question what fundamentally makes us human, what makes us alive. We can reduce a human being to being a simple chunk of autonomus flesh if we wanted to. We can reduce everything down to particle physics. But sometimes, it's hard to believe such simple things can create something so complex such as emotions. If we were able to replicate emotions on a machine, then will it be a machine pretending to have emotions? Or a machine capable of having emotions? To believe that machines are capable of having emotions is like denying that humans are a special existence.\n\nLucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is a very well made visual novel. The art is pretty. (The sprites show a range of emotions to represent what they are feeling.) The music is very good and the Japanese voice acting is also amazing.\n\nIf anyone has ever watched an anime called Chobits, I think you will find some similarities between the two.\n\nIf you like visual novels, anime etc, you would most likely love this. And when you play this game, expect an emotional ride.","February 29","true","9.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","19","21","4","0"

Lucy, an android, is found by the protagonist and a deep friendship (or maybe more?) is formed between them.\n\nThis visual novel is fully voiced for main characters, not for the side characters, but that didn't bother me too much. I've so far only played the Japanese voice acting instead of Korean but I will definitely make time to play through the Korean VA as well.\n\nStory wise, Lucy has moments when you laugh (especially the one about imitating others...) and much sadder moments (no spoilers from me!)\n\nArt - I really love it, though I see some discrepancy to an extent with some sprites.

At some point it will ask the player straight forward and I'm stuck there for near by an hour thinking about the answer (and actually that is the reason why im writing the review). I didn't expected this serious stories but this visual novel is way over my expectation and it is fantastic.\n\nNot only the story but also the voice, both Korean and Japanese is really good and gives a life to Lucy. The effects were awesome and UI is great, it is just so obvious that the team did really hard to make this game.\n\nThe only thing that kinda disappointed me was that there was no auto mode (which is pretty essential to all novel games) but still, that was the only thing that kinda disturbed me.\n\nThis really worth a lot more than it costs so if you like visual novels, you better play this.","February 29","true","11.9"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","0"

Almost as if reading this visual novel is the same as playing a harp with each string representing a different emotion that is then played at various frequency, duration, and intensity to develop into a string of notes turning into a vibrant melody all coming together to become a feast of emotions filled with enough diversity to fit into each and everyone's need. The conductor guiding the flow of the story's ambiance into unison and therefore, producing a single, bittersweet product that is masterfully handled.\n\nLucy -The Eternity She Wished For- is impressive in all respects: the art, voice acting, music, story and many more are to be desired of, given the fitting beauty in many scenes of the story, although seemingly simple, the story is intriguing, touching, and all in all an enjoyable work. As the story unfolds itself, one can't help but to sympathize with the characters and become immersed in the story of just what it means to become attached to someone; whether they are human or not, or blood-related or not. Someone important is simply someone important, nothing more and nothing less.","April 26","true","8.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

I tried to keep it short but I don't really do reviews so take that wall of text as you will. Also I'm kinda slow so you will probably get through the game in 7 hours.)\n\nI usually get bored of pretty much anything after 20 or 30 minutes but Lucy got a vicious hold of me and after 10 or so hours, I was an emotional trainwreck. And I'm still not done with it as I want to unlock the achievements that I missed.\nNow, I don't know what is an acceptable length for a VN but 10+ hours for $9.99 seems like a good deal. The package as a whole is well put together and I can kind of feel the amount of hard work and love the developers put towards it, though I would like to see more. Maybe one day.\nYume Maihara did an excellent job as Lucy. Every scenario that was thrown at her was wonderfully executed. There were a few spots in the English translation that felt off compared to the Japanese VO but it's possible it's only meant to fit the Korean VO. But it was only 3 or 4 lines during the entire game so it's not too bad.\nFor some reason my music volume keeps resetting so I had to keep turning it down in some parts but I assume they will fix that in a jiffy.\nIf you are unsure whether to get this VN or not, give it a few days and see what others have to say about it or wait for a patch for the volume bug as that could get annoying.\n\nHere's hoping M-Vizlab has great success with Lucy ~The eternity she wished for~ and continues to make more emotional games like this.","February 29","true","0.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","1"

It may be humans who become obsolete'\nLucy -The Eternity She Wished For -  and what I wish for  is one hell of a Visual Novel. I was actually really hyped back when I first heard of this Visual novel through it's kickstarter, but since then almost forgot about it, which is why it's release on Steam took me by surprise. I knew that I would love this Visual Novel even back then as Chobits has been one of my favorite mangas for a long time now and one can easily draw a line between those two and the lesson they both tried to convey: 'What is it, that differenciates a human from an Android??'\n\nI plowed through the entirety of this VN in two sittings, both clocking in at roughly 3 hours each, making this Visual novel not exceptionally long, but definitely not short in any way. It has to be noted that I did NOT go through every choice to see what changes, mainly because the story I got was too beautifully told to alter it in any way.\n\nSpeaking of the story, remember how I talked about Chobits a second ago?? I did not make the comparision lightly as it doesn't take a scientist (heh.) to see the similarities. Androids have become a part of everyday life for most people, safe for some who despise them. Our main character (who hates robots aswell, so there's a difference I guess) finds an Android at the junkyard and, spontaniously, decides to take her/it home. After a bit of time he finds himself strangely attracted to his new companion and consults his Robot-fanatic of a friend regarding robots (yes, I AM struggling with whether I should use Android or Robot, thanks for noticing) and their emotions, upon which said friend tells him that no matter how genuine their emotions might seem, they're fake and that he should under no circumstances fall in love with one. His guidance however is in vain as Mr. Main Character falls in love with her/it in no time flat.\nWhat follows is a heartwrenching and -warming (please don't kill me for that one) love-story.\n\nWhen the credits innitially rolled, I feared that it was over. That I had screwed up somewhere along the way. That a choice I made was a terrible one. Then the post-credits scene came, and I no longer knew what to do with myself as it seemed like there really WAS no better option... then I noticed that something was off about the main menu. That the 'Start' button was acting up. When I pressed it out of pure curiosity and hope, I found myself in a SECOND post-credits scene and boy... O boy, that was one plot-twist. I won't go into any specifics here, so all I will say is: I didn't even REMOTELY expect that plot-twist, holy Cthulhu.\n\nSo... I guess I can talk about some of the technicalities ('s that a word?? Well, it is now.) for a second.\nThere're voice options for Korean and Japanese, which I - as should be obvious - turned to Japanese in the blink of an eye.\nHowever, there's only one character in the entire game that has voice-acting: Lucy Valentine herself. And jesus, that's some damn good voice-acting. All the emotions are translated exceptionally well and the character really comes to life via her voice (and isn't THAT an interesting statement??).\nThe art is pretty decent with the CG's being flatout beautiful.\nThere's no E-mote technology at work, but I never expected that anyways, so it's not really an interesting point.\n\n\nSoo... should you buy it?? yes. Yes. YES, you should. There was not a single character at the end I could hate (no, not even the father... read the 'reunion' extra. ;-;), the story was simply beautiful and it`s only 10 bucks!","March 1","true","6.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","3"

It's been a long while where a VN could leave me in a state of reflection, and "Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-" hits it out of the park.

When combined with an interesting cast dynamic, it makes for a great read. Even when it gets to the after stories, it's so amazing and rewarding since this VN does it in a way that I haven't seen before.\n\nIf you're into science-fiction and the concept of androids, I highly recommend this VN.

However by the end I was embarassed for making such a judgment before experiencing the depth of this wonderful game. It is truly a thought provoking journey that will constantly keep you drawn in, leaning on the edge of your seat, yearning for more. The story has it's sad moments and it's happy moments but the transitions from each end of the emotional spectrum are masturfully played out. Never have I felt as many emotions towards a game, as I have when I played through Lucy. To all those who hesitate to buy this masterpiece because it is visual novel or they think their ten dollars will go to waste, don't. This game will truly be worth your time and you will not regret the measily amount of money you pay for the wonderful experience. Once again, Lucy - The Eternity She Wished for, is in my mind, a masterpiece, a true work of art, one that everyone should experience.","April 29","true","4.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

It was only when a friend of mine recommended the VN that I gave it an actual chance ...\n\n... and for real, I should've paid more attention back then. This turned out to be one of the best VNs I've ever read.\n\n\n\n(Apart from the description of the VN here on Steam, I'll keep this review free of spoilers.)\n\nStory: (9/10)The pace of technology can be both astounding and terrifying. If you look up topics like androids, you quickly come to realize that they're not just a popular part of science fiction anymore; they're about to become part of a future that isn't too far away. Lucy does a pretty good job in showing how drastic changes like these will inevitably change how our society works and which problems arise from said changes.\n\nThere are no long, useless fillers that may distract you from the story. The various comedy and drama elements are well balanced too which makes the VN all the more enjoyable and heartwarming.\n\nCharacters: (8/10)The cast of characters is a bit small, compared to other VNs. However, the VN makes up for it by giving them actual personality while also keeping them realistic and comprehensible; something that many VNs these days fail to deliver (if they're trying at all).\n\nArt: (7/10)The art itself is plain but comfortable and the UI with it's modern look is kind of refreshing. The CG for Lucy looks incredible as well.\n\nWhat really annoyed me here was the severe lack of life in the background CG. Now that I think about it, I don't recall seeing a single human being outside of the character cast. Quite the oversight for a story that takes place in a city full of people and their androids.\n\nSound: (8/10)The various tracks harmonize well with the different locations in the VN and some of the calm melodies really stuck with me. It's a shame that there's no integrated music player or a way to purchase the soundtrack (if you do know how to get it, feel free to contact me).\n\nOverall: (9/10)Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For- does an amazing job in showing how our society and technological advancement are linked together and affect each other in various ways, raising all kinds of fundamental questions and conflicts. The story is enjoyable and well-written, leaving little to no questions open when you finish it.\n\nThe execution and the translation are flawless as far as I'm concerned, and I recommend this VN to everyone who likes a heartwarming story that also asks some of the most important questions about humanity and how we identify ourselves.","March 6","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

This game was on sale for around $7 and the reviews intrigued me so much because I love an emotional story, but I was really reluctant to purchase Lucy because I was unsure of visual novels. I forced myself to buy it. I'd rather take a chance and regret it, than regret never taking the chance. So, at only 7 US dollars, I bought it.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW...ISH\nI've played many games that have pulled at my heartstrings and I've shed tears plenty of times, but NONE of them has compared to this game. Happy, sad, angry, and everything between. This game is a masterpiece. I would have honestly paid $60 for this game. Lucy had my heart in a stranglehold.

And what not. Even the good ending can be a distopia depending on your beliefs.\n\nSo it's a pretty adult and merciless  game. In contrast to that Lucy is what you expect her to be. Innocence on two legs you want to protect even if it cost your own life. The game designer used all the tricks so that we'll feel sympathy for her. And we have quite early huge trouble to just see the machine in "her". The father plays a keyrole and I would recommend to put yourself at least for one playthrough in his shoes. See Lucy and the whole situation from his perspective. Think about what he tells you. Also what your friend tells you. It's important to fully understand the situation you are in and the true meaning of your decisions.\n\n","April 25","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

And the story is basically amazing. It is not quite as emotionally moving as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April), but it has its own merits.\n\nThere are a handful of annoying little glitches in the game (e.g. sound levels resetting each time the music changed), and the max resolution is 720p, but those are really the only bad things I can say about this game. It is otherwise very well made. In my opinion, the Japanese voicing was cuter and more pleasing than the Korean voicing, but that might just be my preference of "desu" to "ida"; it is nice to have that as an option in the settings.\n\nI managed to get the "true ending" the first time, so I'll have to play through again to get the alternate endings.

Or they would just be our artificial creation, and robot's memories, personality and feelings were as worthless as your holidays photos..\n\nThe game tells multiple ending story about a prototype robot PIM-001 Lucy and the nameless protagonist struggling against questions stated above.

Like any good story involving A.I. it makes you question the nature of your own mind and if it really is impossible for a machine to have a soul? Is there any difference between one born of nature and a highly complex artificial creation? One was built in a lab, one in a womb, both learn but in different ways. Must you form your own emotions for them to be valid? Do humans realy form thier own emotions and wills as we might think? Or is it all down to conditioning? Is free will required? Do humans even have free will? What is the nature of free will? What constiutes a soul? Does it even matter if your friendships are with artificial creations, perhaps devoid of a soul, if what they give you is better than anything men of flesh and blood have been giving you? All of these questions and more are asked in this well told story and like some of the best sci fi it does not tell you the answer. It provides you with facts, it provides you with varying opinions, and then it lets you make up your own mind and both sides are valid.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the game is well constructed, artwork solid and I did not encounter any bugs. But this game is made or broken on it's writing and the writing is solid. Full of emotion, charm, funny breaks at the right moments as an emotional release and a strange sense of foreboding even under the happiest scenes. This game grabs at your heart. It borrows heavily from Asimov in terms of concepts but that is no bad thing and it provides an engaging and fresh aproach to the questions Asimov posed and which still do not have full answers.\n\nIn short, it will make your laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think. The only complaint is that I wish that it was longer and in all honesty, that's not a complaint at all.","March 6","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

In the year 2050(?), androids are commonplace. Robots created in the image of humans assist people in their daily lives. However, despite their appearance, they are undoubtedly inhuman; imitations made to serve under the dominant beings of the planet. Like all technology, advances over time can vastly improve functionality, so what happens when someone pushes those advances to their limits and tries to create a robot that can function exactly as a human? A robot that cries, laughs, smiles, and even hopes. Is it still a robot? Is it still an artificial imitation? Or can it be considered equal to us? Can a collection of metal and wires truly be considered human? Many believe it cannot, but I believe that Lucy is far more human than us all.","May 3","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you haven't played a VN before, this is a great place to start.\nKeeping short at probably just under 5 hours ( I tended to pause and go AFK while the game was open) the game isn't as full-featured as many other VNs out there (Katawa Shoujo for instance). Nevertheless, the game is a great way to introduce someone into the world of VNs. Having spent over 25 hours in Katawa Shoujo, and having touched on other VNs and the like, I still enjoyed playing this game. It has a great storyline, fantastic art, absolutely spot on voice acting, and enough different paths to take that the replay value is valid another couple of times. I didn't find any part of it slow or boring, nor did I ever think it was dragging on.\nLucy - The Enternity She Wished For is a great way to get into the world of VNs and appreciate what they are. While not the most full featured VN out there, it provides a great base for getting a feel on the world of VNs. If you're looking for somewhere to start, this is the perfect place. Well worth the price, congrats on getting funded on Kickstarter and Greenlit for this, I'm glad it made its way to Steam and I found it, it was a nice experience and I look forward to future projects from the developers behind it.","May 17","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be honest I'm surprised that it turned out to be such a detailed and refined visual novel, at the start I expected a normal robot and human romance story where the end would be sad, either the robot breaks down or it dies in an accident... In fact, it was the robot that chose it's own end, if you're a man of seeking a sense of sadness to make yourself cry to relieve stress, this is the perfect visual novel.\n\nHere's why I like this visual novel and anything it can improve on :\n\nEnjoyables :\n-The translation was perfect, it perfectly showed the emotions of Lucy and it was definitely unexpected out of this visual novel.\n-Korean vocals recorded by Emily was definitely superior, she had put great effort into mimicing a robot's way of speech, but it wasn't the normal type of robotic speech, although the words were robotic and formal, it was human, you could hear the hesitation when scolded by the master, it's plain and enlightened mood, a really fantastic vocalist!\n-Although there were only 6 main characters that's actually relevant to the main story (you, lucy, father, mother that doesn't care about "you", your friend baek and the young engineer that repaired lucy), they were all designed in details, their art was nice, definitely, but what's of more is that their way of speech really reflects the reality of the future society in the story, although they loved and enjoyed robots and andriods, they did not forget the difference between human and machines, which made "you"'s love towards lucy look sinister but charming.\n-Music was definitely out-standing, matching the moods properly and bringing the tone of sadness with a sense of calm peace.\n-[SPOILER ALERT]The story ended with a sad end with lucy being burned down by father, but there's actually a "true end" towards this where lucy is repaired, even if the story script was set that lucy was "beyond repair", the MC actually spent the next 15 years of his life researching and learning about andriods, so that he could repair lucy and one day, lucy actually remembered the lost part of her memory card, despite the impossible.\n^-The end was actually the most enjoyable part, although the twisted end was a scene where you should let your tears fall, it doesn't only bring sadness via sadness, the happy end after the sad end was quite a suprise and you'd cry even harder after knowing that this end was possible ( remember to watch the extra story scenes! ).\n\nThings this game should improve on :\n(well I can't really complain about this game, it's truly a master piece and don't expect erotic scenes, it's plain romance and comedy with a twist of sadness, but very very well detailed.)\n\n-Could've made some special events, instead of making daily school life changes as the story.\n-There was literally no mentioning about the life with his past mother, whether he forgot about it or the story didn't mention about it, I hope there would've been more hints about his deceased mother.\n-Was a dissapointment that the vocals weren't in japanese, but korean vocal is rather pleasing with emily's sweet tone :d\n-Wastes a bit of time doing scene changes when you could've just skipped the animation, aka. unnessecary scenery changing animations >:C\n\nThat's all I can think of >.< I'm sorry for my inexperience in writing these but I'm writing what I truly think, I hope this helps you into deciding whether you should buy this game or not, it's a game that's definitely worth your money and time, it's longer than the normal visual novels you expect, although it's one of those sad end visual novels, those who are under reality stress, please use this as a relief of pressure, crying or knowing something sad would definitely help you express your emotions better! Lucy - The Eternity She Wished For is definitely worth your money even at full price, although I would highly suggest you to buy it during sales, it would be best to buy it full priced and show support to the creators :D Enjoy and have a nice day!","May 23","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MandzPH/recommended/430960/","MandzPH","Mandz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MandzPH/","10 products in account","I’ll try to keep spoilers to a minimum, but I might ramble on for a bit. So…\n\nAn emotionally compelling VN in wherein the story revolves around a boy who finds an abandoned robot in the junkyard. It’s a story capable of sending you in for a ride on a rollercoaster of emotions as it tackles the long-contemplated idea of “a robot being advanced enough to pass for a human” and how ‘she’ can find their place in a world when some people are not onboard with having her around. It’s a very polished visual novel that combines amazing aesthetics with a well written story that hooks you in and doesn’t let go!\n\nStoryAs with most visual novels, the story unfolds in a text-based manner, occasionally showing character sprites to help reflect their emotions visually as well as show crisp backgrounds to convey the locations. Animations are kept to a minimum, so as to not to distract from the reading experience, but still allow liveliness when a particular scene calls for it.\n\nThere’s also points in the game where it pauses and allows you to make decisions. After a few playthroughs, I noticed that some of the decisions doesn’t really impact the story that much, and while I was initially disappointed by the linearity, I quickly learned that it’s because the game simply took the effect of decisions in another direction: the decisions only affect how a certain scene plays out and mainly serves to show different reactions in respect to the characters currently in the scene. Add to the fact that this game eventually gives you extra content from the main screen as you unlock more scenes and you’ll find yourself replaying the story to find different scene outcomes and be rewarded with side stories.\n\nAnd yes, the side stories. After finishing the story for the first time, you will find yourself having access to additional content that are just as equally heartwarming (and sometimes heartrending) as the main storyline. This side stories also provide more flavor and color to the rest of the game while supplementing some information not apparent on the main story.\n\nOverall, a complete and satisfying experience.\n\nCharactersThe main cast is quite small actually, but vary enough in opinions, and character that they don’t feel redundant, one can even say that the number of characters in the story has been kept to an absolute minimum, since the story is told from the perspective of a normal person living a normal life. The circle of people around the player character carries different views with regards to technology, androids and discusses it to explore the game’s central theme from different angles.\n\nIn relation to the linearity of the game mentioned earlier, another good thing it added to the game is that it allowed the main character to have a certain degree of personality (despite being controlled by the player) as the decisions do not deviate too much from the main plot. Because of this, you are then given a front row seat as he changes from a person who completely despises machines and technology, to someone who forms a tight bond with his android as the titular character’s kindness, friendliness, and (sometimes irrational) selflessness slowly wins him over. It’s the wonderfully executed interactions between them that just make you care about them and gets you invested in what happens next.\n\nSoundSo far, only the titular character is voiced across all the scenes though it is quickly compensated by the surreal, brilliant performance of her voice actors (both Korean and Japanese, and you can switch between them on the fly!). The voice acting singlehandedly gives Lucy life as well as allow a deeper level of immersion in the story as you read on. Add to it the background music that shifts, changes, and pauses depending on the current mood and you’ll find yourself in the moment along with the characters without ever being distracted by the seamless way everything works together.\n\nTechnicalI’ll be honest, I don’t really feel like I have to talk about the technical stuff – as bugs, if serious, will eventually be ironed out. But I guess it might help sharing some of my observations while I’m getting the game to run.\n\nGame’s folder size is 846MB, not sure if it would very across different steam installations. But I may have to say this is a reasonable size, considering the game’s relatively humble scope. For users with moderate internet speed, this means that downloading the game from scratch would take from 25mins to 1hour, guaranteeing immediate startup.\n\nI’ve read from some other users that they experience crashes while trying to run the game. I didn’t see my share of that thankfully (or maybe the issue was fixed when I got the game). The closest I got to an error was a single, crash-to-desktop moment when I was clearing multiple save files one after another, and I didn’t encounter it since.\n\nProbably the only thing that bothered me was the fact that the Saves folder location is placed directly on the game folder, along with a single “Config.nkenv” that tracked both achievements and unlocks (as pointed out by developer ‘eeenseok’ on a community post). I haven’t personally tested it yet, but this may mean that the save files will be the same across multiple users on the same computer (it’s not like I mind sharing my save progress, but this a genre that derives merit by avoiding spoilers to users who are just about to test out the game for themselves, especially on a computer in which a friend may have previously played on before and has already unlocked crucial parts of the story).\n\nThat, or I’m missing anything regarding the Saves folder – in that case, just ignore what I said. :D\n\nAll in all, I’d like to thank MVIZLAB for bringing -Lucy, The Eternity She Wished For- on Steam. I wish the best for you guys, and may you guys become very successful as a company! Cheers~\n\nOn a sidenote: Any chance for the missed Kickstarter target (the 25k one) content to be released as DLC? Because .... you know, just sayin :D","April 17","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I enjoyed every second of this game and I even plan on playing through it many more times.Never has a game or other media gotten so many emotions out of me. I felt many feels throughout the entire experience, I felt joy when good things happened to the characters, anger or sadness when bad things happen. Its not often that I get so attached to characters like I did with Lucy.\nBonus points to the Devs because they didn't exploit the fact that Lucy is a female character and use her as fan service. They made her seem as real as they possibly could, and they did a fantastic job.\nI recommend  "Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-" because of the experience it gave me. It's worth the $9.99 pricetag.\nI will not forget how it made me look at my life.\nThis is truly an amazing game in my eyes and I hope others will see it as I do.","May 3","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's kind of like you're playing a game version of the anime Chobits. The art is nice, and I feel the characters are fairly relatable though they are your typical archtypes from manga and anime. The background music, for me, got kind of old after half an hour or so, but you can turn that off.\nThe voice actors that were used for Lucy, both Japanese and Korean, I just find annoying, but luckily you can disable the voice of hers and just read what she's saying.\nWhile at first this game is really interesting, it does drag on some. I get bored with some of the scenes that are really wordy. It's a wonderful story overall, though it is linear. Most of the choices, except the last one, don't seem to matter much.\n\nThis is definitely a game for someone who doesn't mind reading. Every time your character switches to someone else, or the day changes, you see the Three Laws of Robotics again and again, which gets annoying.\nI was annoyed enough about the wordiness that I finally turned off all the sound/music, put on Netflix, and enjoyed the story. I became GREATLY engrossed as it neared it's end, and there's more after the credits role.","May 8","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Voice acting has a choice for Korean and Japanese so you have nice choices, even though there is a grand total of 1 character that is voiced. I think the game has a memory leak or something because it caused a bunch of "memory low" errors and a blue screen but it's negligible as a problem.","April 8","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
