And so, he went on to create Audiosurf, and at the time, it was. The way it analyzed and understood music files was unparalleled, and many other games tried to match it. Some did reasonably well, some failed. Dylan began an ascension as he improved upon Audiosurf further - introducing things like (difficult to find) separate scoreboards for mono players, [as-tags], and a buff to all the characters that weren't Pointman.\n\nSoon, Dylan's ascension took him from us and into the next plane over. And as time wore on, we began to notice flaws in the original product, many of which stem from Quest3D, its engine, being garbage, but also some discrepancies in the music matching algorithm. Then, recently, a great glowing ball of pure astral energy descended from the clouds, and in an echoy, yet very much familiar voice, it asked a simple question:\n\n"Wanna see me do it again?"","August 16, 2015","true","125.5"," 230 of 255 people (90%) found this review helpful 136 people found this review funny","90","230","255","136","2"

If you like attacking scores on puzzle games like Tetris Attack, then puzzle league is for you. Play Vegas as an introduction and study how the scoring system works and you'll be hooked. If at first you can't compete then pick some obscure song that only you and a handfull of people own and capture that high score.

Introducing Audiosurf 2, the sequel to the very popular and acclaimed indie game released back in 2008. Any song from your collection can be chosen to ride, and the game will generate a unique track for the song you choose. At slower parts, the track will rise and the block traffic will be low. At more intense parts, the track will rapidly descend, greatly increasing the block traffic. Although the original Audiosurf only had a handful of modes to choose from, thanks to the steam workshop integration that the sequel offers, the amount of game modes and skins that are available is endless, although many of the game modes do generally involve avoiding a certain object or color, while collecting another. That being said, with the many different variations that are available to download, the fear of becoming bored with this game is never an issue. The visuals look beautiful, and are definitely an improvement from the first one, not to mention the vast amount of downloadable skins that are even more aesthetically appealing.\n\nThis is, at the time of this review, an early access game, and as such, expect a few bugs and glitches that are still being worked out. In my experience thus far, however, I have yet to experience any problem that would be considered anything more than slightly inconveniencing. In conclusion, this game is a unique experience that provides endless hours of gameplay, all while enjoying your own music and having the choice of seemingly endless ways to experience it. If you are still unsure, pick up the first one during a sale, if you enjoy that one, you will undoubtedly enjoy this one as well.","November 25, 2013","true","26.0"," 120 of 132 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","120","132","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/recommended/235800/","zeream","Zeream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/","160 products in account","Update:  So apparently the developer and his staff have fallen so low as to actually start censoring distaste for his game (click, its a link to an image.)[dl.dropboxusercontent.com]  Sigh, how far Audiosurf has fallen.  A real damn shame.  And yes, since release this game still has all the issues I underline in this review.  Read on for the review by the way!\n\n\nOriginal:  I have to say, game didn't live up to release.  I am disappointed as a puzzler player.  I will not be reviewing this as a standalone title, rather as a comparison to the original Audiosurf.\n\n\nPuzzle modes feel vastly inferior and have much less response than in Audiosurf 1.  Ironmode has been cut, as well as pretty much all the modes from the first game.  Easy modes have been cut completely, and elite and regular modes have instead  been "merged" together.  Elite is now the default and only puzzler mode difficulty, but the powerups are all wrong for elite mode.  The first Audiosurf had 3 different difficulty modes for each puzzler and mono gametype (not counting the ironmode modifier), and it made getting into everything quite easy and fun.  Audiosurf 2 will probably alienate you if you are new to the game or an expert, because it lacks these training modes and the old modes do NOT feel the same as they used to.\n\nFurthermore, it seems the hitbox has increased and the responsiveness of the controls seems to be lessened so you will have a harder time collecting the right blocks.  For example, often a player would strafe to one side of the board and back to their original position in a fraction of a second to get the right block out of a fast-moving row of blocks; this is now near impossible without picking up half the blocks in that row in the process.  In another example, the first game had a safety mechanic where if you collected many blocks at once you would not necessarily overflow because the overflow mechanic was time based; abusing this in the "Eraser" and "Eraser Elite" puzzler modes was fun and useful, since it allowed you to get really high scores and made the gameplay really intense.  Its been... fixed(?) in this game however, so based on the speed and the traffic of most songs you are either going to be erasing half your board every few seconds or overflowing every few seconds, without any recovery as such.\n\nSpeaking of which, there is no traffic meter anymore, so when you go into a song you don't really know how intense its going to be beyond the slopes, but lets be honest most of us have already listened to the music we play on this game so we know where the ups and downs are.  As such, cutting the traffic meter was a major setback, especially for intense puzzler mode players.  If you wanted low traffic for your pusher modes, well, you're out of luck.  If you wanted high traffic for your eraser modes, again, out of luck.  Since you also move slower (well, it sure feels like it.  I can't find my sweet sensitivity spot anymore like I could in Audiosurf 1) couple that with closer traffic and you'll have an even harder time navigating to get the right matches.  Visibility of the matching-board has also been reduced, so seeing individual colors is harder.  Game sounds have also been reduced making it harder to distinquish between collection of white blocks and color blocks.  All these changes make the puzzle (and mono) modes harder or deminish experience, however that added difficulty does not make the game more engaging rather more frustrating.\n\nAlso despite being so much more graphically advanced, I feel like its just simply more noisy, hindering complicated puzzle gameplay.  The first game had the simple yet colorful style going for it, not to mention easy customization of said color schemes.  You could make it intuitive and responsive easily to your playstyle.  Customization options are now embedded in coding editors, so you will not have a very easily-customized-on-the-fly experience like in the first game.  In other words, unless you want to play with code you probably won't get a good puzzler game mode out of the box or on workshop.\n\nProbably my biggest compaint, however, is the camera; it used to zoom in on you quite a lot and you felt the adrenaline rush of going faster, but now it... zooms out?  What gives?  This not only makes it harder to control but eliminates that rush!\n\n\nIf there is one thing the second title does well however, its the mono modes.  So for everyone looking for a mono sequel, this is where you want to look.\n\nIn addition to the good mono modes, Audiosurf 2 has excellent library support, soundcloud tie-ins, and the aesthetics going for it.  It also offers more modes for music than in Audiosurf 1, and there have been a few interesting community made ones developed over the past two years.  However, its just that; a few.  The game only contains default content as well, which is scarce at best compared to the original game.\n\nIf you are looking for hardcore puzzler modes to go with your music, then you want to look at Audiosurf 1, not this title.  I have to say the leaderboards also function a lot better on Audiosurf 1 as well; they feel like an afterthought in Audiosurf 2.\n\nMight I mention that since the game went early access in '13, it had some interesting content thrown in during the first 3 months and 2 years or so later nothing was really added besides a few aesthetic improvements.  Workshop community content didn't improve either.  It seems people bought it, played it a little, waited for new content but nothing came, and forgot about it, and the community reflects this as there are few if any additions since then that are not purely aesthetic.  No new game modes, no nothing.  It seems even the developer just gave up and forgot at some point, and only recently rememberd and decided to finally "release" the game by adding some superficial and unnecessary interface improvements that don't add anything.  Definitely not worth waiting several years for.  If that doesn't tell you anything about how much the developer cares about this game, well...\n\n\nAt the end of the day, given the lack of community feedback and attention as well as developer attention this game is largely just a graphical improvement over the first game for those who like mono modes.  Beyond that, this game doesn't live up to the prequel, especially not gameplay wise.  As such, given my playstyle and what was expected in the time of development and what occurred, I do not recommend Audiosurf 2.","June 15, 2015","false","11.4"," 198 of 272 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","198","272","9","14"

The game is very fun, and the new modes are a blast. Older modes seem much better thanks to the new visuals. The mods from Steam Workshop also add a lot of content to the games such as new modes a nd visuals. Plus as the game is still in devolpent there's always new features on the way.\n\nIt's hard to show the cons of the game, as they can all be fixed in due time, or are being fixed as I write this. The menus are by far the biggest problem, they are a little bit cumbersome, scrolling is iffy, and gamepad support isn't in supported in the menus, however don't take it to heart, as all of these will be fixed in due time.\n\nFina say: I can recommend this to anyone who knows how a beta/alpha works, and loves their own music library.","November 25, 2013","true","28.9"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","2"

Simply by loading it up, the menu appeared very unpolished, the gameplay felt stagnant, and the visuals were bland at best. This was in contrast to the original's flashy title, fluid and immersive gameplay, and cool backgrounds which moved to the music, adding to the experience.\n\nAll of that, however, was early on in Audiosurf 2's Early Access period and I decided to wait for a full release for a final judgement.

I liked that challenge better in AS1. I do like that all of the modes are still available though (I think all of them are there at least).\n- Menu isn't as good looking or clear as in AS1 either\n- No music on startup. The opening track of AS1 and the menu graphics gave the game some personality, no such thing here.

I understand why, but this game would sell so much better if it would be possible. And sales are needed for those global scores\n\nWould I recommend this game considering these thoughts? Sure.

The graphics tend to be distracting and overall many of the skins don't look great.  The menus/interface are not polished.\n\nWhat I would have expected from an Audiosurf 2, but is not contained this game:\n\n- Broad audio source integration - youtube, spotify, pandora, iTunes, anything honestly.  Soundcloud is a start but this is 2015, most people aren't collecting mp3s on their drives anymore.\n- Ways to tune the track algorithm that don't involve completely different game modes.  Speed, hilliness, colors, slope, shapes, more/fewer lanes.  Lots of low-hanging fruit here, none of which the devs touched.\n- Basic run stats.  This is a given in any rhythm game.  I want to know what I missed, where I missed it.\n\nEdit: Apparently this is controversial, so I'll provide some further explanations.\n\nThere are upwards of 75 million global monthly users of Spotify alone.  Youtube, meanwhile, has almost a billion monthly users and the most popular category of content, by far, is music.  Add to that other streaming services like iTunes radio, Pandora, iHeart, Google Play, last.fm, Slacker, Hype Machine - for a whole lot of people, mp3s are not a part of their music listening formula.  There's no elitism here about what's better or worse, it's just how it is.\n\nSupport for streaming is obviously not easy.  You'd have to buffer the input stream or allow for real-time track generation.  It may not even be possible to make it work with the default game mode.  But anyone who says it can't be done is entirely incorrect.  It is certainly possible, and for anyone whose primary source of music is online - it becomes a necessary feature to enjoy the game with the music I actually want to listen to.  The value of this game is drastically decreased to me without it.  That's a valid factor to include in my review.","June 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 192 of 322 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","192","322","10","17"

Featuring an assortment of modes, mods and skins, AudioSurf has never played or looked better.\n\nGameplay.\n\nGameplay of Audiosurf 2 is a huge step up from the previous title in the series. In this edition of the much loved game, players can now download from a huge assortment of game types from the Steam Workshop; with easy, initutive controls anyone can begin making their own game mode with ease. The base modes included with Audiosurf 2 are the much loved Mono Mode; albeit, slightly different this time, Double Vision mode, and much more from the original. A new mode makes its debut in Audiosurf 2, named Waveboarding; this mode is similiar to Mono, however is much more intense (Great for those heavy rock songs). All these gamemodes can be used on any song you can throw at the game; now including SoundCloud support. This is a much welcomed addition as it allows players to enjoy the game without having to download an mp3 of their favorite songs (Which can get very cluttered/bulky, especially if you like your music).\n\nGraphics\n\nAudiosurf 2 looks absolutely gorgeous. Never has music looked this good on a screen. Each movement of the map is fluid, the animations crisp and colorful, and the game gives off an overall atmosphere of quality rarely seen in Early Access Indie Titles these days. What makes Audiosurf 2 stand out even more from the crowd is the skin section: using the Steam Workshop (Yep, this game just loves that workshop), users can download a huge assortment of skins, ranging from Classic Audiosurf 1, to even a Mass Effect skin. The skins completely transform the way you play and can even help you get better scores, with some simplifying the game down so you don't get sesnory overload when the beat drops in the music.\n\nOverall, Audiosurf 2 is a game you need to pick up if you're a music fanatic or just want a casual relaxing experience, that can be turned up to give you a burst of adrenaline. For $15, you can't go wrong.","October 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","1"

If you're new to the series, I heartily recommend this, as it sports many improvements over the first. If you're not a fan of the first, you may still find there is something here just for you, thanks to community enhancement!\n\n======================================\nPros+ UI: So slick, so intuitive.\n+ Graphics: Much improved all around.\n+ Sound: It's your sound, but more immersive!\n+ Gameplay: More of what you love, and more on top of that!\n+ Settings: All there, easy to get to and change.\n\nCons- Can no longer weave between blocks due to proximity to each other.\n- It didn't come out sooner\n- Can be hard to find exactly what you want searching for tracks online.\n- Doesn't resume last song played on startup.\n- You can't 'add' folders permanently.\n- Easy to mix up the exit button for a back button.\n\nNeutral+/- Some big changes to everyone's favorite game modes/track generation.\n+/- Would also love to see it support last.fm radio/youtube playlists/etc.\n\n=======================================\nOnce more, with feeling! Audiosurf returns bigger than ever, with steam workshop support, a hugely streamlined interface, and a lot of polish around the edges. Audiosurf 2 provides more of the same, and in this case, (or in my opinion) that's a good thing! But let's take a look at the changes.\n\nThe interface is probably the biggest one. You'll notice there is now a very minimal, out-of-your-way style, mostly consisting of small tabs and boxes for you to click on, and I want to draw your attention to a very special one...the Browse Music tab. This opens up a tab that lets you browse for your music...but also search for music online, and that's an awesome feature to have in a game about surfing music! That same section also autoclears text queried into it when you click outside and back or hit backspace, which is super convenient! Woo!\n\nThe other main tabs are browse modes and browse skins, and I appreciate them both equally. Audiosurf 2 is about having options, and if the default skins and modes provided aren't enough (or good enough) for you, the community has you covered. They've made some wonderful things that really enhance the value of the game, but I don't want to spoil the fun for you!\n\nThere's better community integration, allowing you to see in real time how you're stacking up to the leaderboard, your own best score, challenge people, and even dethrone them from their top songs. You can see what other people are listening to, and play the top tracks with one click. Another handy feature is the ability to pre-listen to a track, and when you're looking for something new and fresh not already a part of your collection, you'll be thankful for it. The whole of the UI is slick, responsive, and clean.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly the same, with some prominent changes to everyone's favorite mono and ninja mono modes. First, when you hit a grey block in mono, it clears out a colored block on that row. Second, in ninja mono, you no longer have to manually clear greys, but greys will clear your whole grid, and not give you points for them, so watch out!\n\nOne thing that upsets me slightly is the new track generation. There will be many occurrences of blockades, as I like to call them, where there are two lanes of greys going at once. This issue is amplified by the new generation causing blocks to be so close together that it is almost impossible to slide between two greys. You may also find yourself going down the only seemingly safe lane to become trapped in an unavoidable blockade. This means that at times ninja and mono can be less about evasion and more about scouting ahead, a change I'm not sure I care much for. The puzzle modes remain largely the same, (I believe.) I only encountered one bug in my playtime, and that was a completely minor graphical glitch.\n\nI played a lot of songs in a lot of genres to test everything out for this review, and tracks load faster now. I think track length is no longer a limiting factor, and the tracks are about as responsive as the first Audiosurf (moreso with mods.) One minor annoyance that remains is that the song being broken up into blocks, in mono, can create some dischordant timing when a song picks up; half of those notes or beats will need to be avoided, so it can feel like you're working against the track, not with it. Hip hop and electronic music in my opinion remain the best rides, bumpy and smooth but ever changing. On that note, the game runs like butter at 120FPS even on my GTS450, it also loads very fast.\n\nThe graphics are much improved, but there are some things I like less, like the shape of the blocks, but that only applies to some skins, and the community mods can make this game as beautiful and engaging or challenging as you should ever need--and if not, nothing is stopping you from giving it a go! And oh, my, should you. Even if you're not a fan of the original, give this game a purchase and I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 21, 2015","true","13.2"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","3"

To this date, last.fm integration is still limited to user-side exploits and sketchy configuration (as typing your password into a .txt file).\nOn top of this, the game is still glitchy and bugged for many, it seems, so, that while the Early Access tag was removed, a little was changed (apart from a graphical overhaul).\nRegardless, the game is still enjoyable with its bugs and limitations, except if you are a Mono player, of course.\n\nIf you need ratings\n\nGraphic: 8\nSound: X\nLongevity: 7\nGameplay: 7\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nBuy it if you liked the puzzle characters of Audiosurf, skip it if you're a mono player: you will find only empty leaderboards and single-player-like gameplay.\n\n\n\nNow follows the Early Access Review\nI'll be short.\n\nI'm writing this review only because I thought about it, and I've been an ♥♥♥ with Dylan, on the forums. I've been truly, excessively negative about this game just because he didn't add a proper last.fm support for months (still kinda crippled as last.fm integration but what the heck! At least it's there).\n\nAs early access game, I believe it's worth your money. It's AS1 but with better graphics, mechanics and workshop.\n\nSure there are still things to fix (you can't change settings during a song, there's no way to change colours except downloading a different skin), but overall none could say this game isn't worth your 10 bucks.\n\nAs Audiosurf 1 was the game that made me use steam almost daily, so is Audiosurf 2. I bloody love this game.\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nI might write another review as it gets out of Early Access.\n\n\n\nFinal notes and thoughtsWhile I recognised being excessively negative back then, I must admit that Audiosurf 2 is still a huge disappointment. I wish I could say that this game is well worth 15€ (or whatever is the pricing in your region) but, if you are a mono player as I am, it isn't.\n\nI regret having spent money on this game, even though it gave me many hours of fun, it's now over: I will have to compete against myself and my friends in real life, not against thousands of people around the globe.\n\nI'm embittered and deluded, hence I won't recommend this game.","December 17, 2014","false","143.0"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","6"

When Audiosurf 2 was announced I was thrilled and I jumped at the early access. I was very disappointed by what I played, but figured it would be made well by release. Well, here we are at release and I find the disappointment is still here.\n\nFirst, I suppose I should mentioned what I was hoping for. Mostly I wanted a prettier Audiosurf 1, maybe some new modes, leaderboards separated by game mode, and mod support was a bonus. Let me also mention I love the puzzle modes and hate mono. They delivered on some aspects. It is prettier, there are new modes, better leaderboards, and mod support. Unfortunately the old puzzle modes came in half baked and seemingly as an afterthoght.\n\nSo, what went wrong. Let's start with a minor quibble, the UI. It feel like the embodiment of form over function. The old Audiosurf UI was ugly as sin, but was quick to select my character, my song, and get playing. This UI has a column with it's own separate-screen menu for character, for skin, and for song. What was once a three click process (and one between songs if we're playing through an albim) has become a four click minimum. But the UI qualms are minor and livable. The gameplay issues, not so much.\n\nThe gameplay: The new modes are all mono. A few deviations from the old mono mode, which I always found dreadful, and a new wakeboard mode, which makes a great audio visualizer but a horrid game. It's like the old Mono mode but even less interactive. Not fun at all.\n\nThe puzzle modes themselves, they each have only the expert mode from Audiosurf 1 (no casual or pro). You respawn instantly at an overfill. Perhaps worst of all, only one of the provided skins (Dusk) is any good for puzzle mode. It is the only one where the upcoming cars and the puzzle grid are very clear. Mystic comes close, but it is hard to tell how big the empty puzzle grid is. The other skins are woefully unreadable; distant colors are hard to tell and the puzzle grid becomes lost due to too much reflection, lack of decent contrast or other visual noise. And in every skin, Dusk and Mystic included, the powerups are very difficult to read from a distance, as they are disembodied, borderless shapes, hard to read until you are on top of them. Even the "classic" skin is difficult to play in.\n\nThat all being said, at the time of this writing there are several use-made skins, some perhaps some more readable (I've not bothered as they gameplay is not worth it), and one which restores Pointman Pro. Perhaps with the proper mods, the fun of Audiosurf 1 can be restored, but I ask why on earth the base game does such a poor job of what the original did so well?\n\nIn the end, if you were a fan of the mono modes in Audiosurf one or are looking for a rhythm based game based on reaction speed, you will probably enjoy this. If you liked the puzzle modes of Audiosruf 1 or are looking for a rythem based puzzle game, well, Audiosurf 1 is still fantastic.\n\nIn the end, until the tremendous shortcomings of Audiosurf 2 are fixed by the modding community, stick with Audiosurf 1.","June 15, 2015","false","1.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Therefore I have changed my tone of this review.\n\nI am a decent Audiosurf 1 eraser player. I am writing this review assuming you have played AS1 before. There are a few differences to note while playing this new sequel.\nYOUTUBE: Click here to view one of my plays in AS1 for proof.\n\nNote that these are differences/changes from the previous game, might be better suited for you or not.\n\nRandomized TracksThis is the biggest complaint of the game I have so far. Everytime you play a track, it's not the same patterns of colour blocks coming to you. Sometimes I see the live scoreboard and I see people scoring huge points for something impossible on my own track at that specific moment. Why not be consistent? In AS1, only bonuses were randomly generated.\n\n-The blocks stay on the board for a longer period of timeBeing a player who usually choose fast songs, this ultimately makes things harder for me. I am constantly looking at a full board and it is hard to visualize which blocks are already scored and ready to leave. It's so long that I have to exceed the limit of rows in order to clear the block, assuming the blocks were about to score. This is something I am trying to adapt to.\n\n-Too many whitesAgain, being a player who choose fast songs, whites ♥♥♥♥ the puzzle scoring up quite often and can be quite disastrous. We only pick whites up because of the attractive bonus points. But it seems that whites are almost as numerous as yellows now or even blues? Again, this is something I am trying to adapt to, I am treating this as a new challenge for me.\n\n-No difficulty settingIn AS1 you had the option to choose from Casual, Pro, Hardcore and I was usually playing Pro.\n\n\nOverall, I think the change of UI was quite refreshing, however I feel there is much room for improvement. Adding support for SoundCloud is great, however I cannot view my own playlists or likes which is kinda of missing the point.\n\nThese are my first impressions so FAR. If you are a veteran player, you might have to take some time and practice to get used to the new rules. Other than that, this is a new refreshing game which will get you back to AS!\n\nTime to dethrone!","June 2, 2015","true","13.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","0"

This sequel however is sloppily built and doesn't retain the things that made the original good.  Wakeboard mode isn't very good at all, and I don't see why they even added it. Half the original modes like eraser and pointman are gone, and even though they weren't the most popular modes, they were fans and pros favorites. Removing them was a very bad idea .The puzzler aspect of the game is pretty much gone, and its a twitch based skill game only now.  This game just isn't any good to me and it seems like the publisher isn't concerned about getting it finished. So sadly, I have to say I can't recommend this game. The original will remain one of the best music games of all time, with is surreal ,hyperspace like tracks and charming spaceship characters.

Though its graphics (and performance) are substantially better and better optimized than those of its predecessor, most other parts of the interface remain unpolished and rudimentary. Some popular characters from the original, including Eraser, are still not included as part of the game's roster, and puzzle characters are fairly poorly represented overall. The biggest new addition to the series, the new Wakeboard characters, are fun once you get the hang of their gameplay style but they still suffer from the same lack of gameplay depth that plagued the Mono characters from the original.\n\nThe game's creator is reportedly working on adding back the old characters and features into the game, and Audiosurf 2 does have fairly good modding support that should extend its lifespan after its official release. That being said, the fact that separate scoreboards exist on a per-character basis means that many popular tracks have nearly empty high-score lists. Gaining a throne on a particular song when only three or four novice players are your only opponents isn't anywhere near as satisfying as topping that same scoreboard in the original, and the lack of cross-character competition makes it harder to justify branching out and mastering the varying playstyles of each character and game mode.\n\nAudiosurf 2 has a fairly solid foundation, but the gameplay it tries to execute was better done in Audiosurf 1. There's definitely room for improvement and I don't doubt that the game developer fully intends to surpass the quality of his earlier work, but as of now, I'd recommend holding off until the game nears full release.","April 11, 2014","false","20.3"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

It absolutely is.\n\nThe main negative I have is the UI; as of December 28th this could use a lot of work. As in, an OVERHAUL scale of work. But besides that, I'm in love with this iteration. The Workshop support looks incredibly promising to me, although I've yet to try it.\n\nOne thing I've seen listed as a negative is the fact that the traffic patterns change slightly whenever you replay the same audio file. And to be honest, I see that as more of a positive than a negative. Not only does it create even more replay value for me by keeping things fresh every game, but it also eliminates the highscore seekers who play the game for hours on end only to memorise the exact pattern of each song to get the perfect score. In my opinion, if getting a high score is that important to you, you need to reevaluate some priorities in your life.\n\nBut don't listen to me rambling.

At the time I didn't know about the store, or even that there were other games. All I knew was that there was this cool little game that turned my songs into racetracks and it was awesome. Now obviously I eventually stumbled onto the rest of Steam from there. And it was while using Steam one day I saw that the game had a sequel.\n\nNow personally I am of the belief that AudioSurf never needed a sequel. It was a game with endless replayability. A new song comes out? Play it. What would a sequel do that the original hadn't already done better?\n\nI decided to find out. I put the game on for 70 minutes approximately a year ago after it came out. It was ugly, no clean interface, and worst of all you were forced into the new wakeboarding mode. I put it aside, thinking it would get better. Fast forward a year later to tonight when i see the latest update and decide to see if it's any better. Thirty minutes later, I can determine that it has gotten better, but not by much.\n\nThe catchy title screen and the mellow background tune as you chose your mode and track? Gone. In it's place is just a static menu with no real background noise.\n\nRemember the lovely roller coaster of a track with all sort of shapes and patterns exploding around you? Yeah well that's been replaced by a bobsled chute with some fancy colors.\n\nThe crisp and cool looking racers and blocks? The racers all look generic and you're collecting blobs of jelly rather then blocks.\n\nThe wakeboarding mode is alright but I just want to race, not remember to hit jumps and then scramble to remember how to do the tricks. There's also a new mode called AudioSprint where you hit two buttons to duck or slide under blocks. It's different but with a fast paced song it becomes a chore and a frustration rather then anything fun.\n\nThis game can be modded....yay? I don't see the appeal of it myself.\n\nSo basically TL:DR, the game doesn't do enough to make itself stand out from the original. The core gameplay is there, but altered and made to look like crap compared to the original. The new modes are only okay, nothing exceptional, and you can mod the game if that's something that should appeal to you in any way, shape, or form.\n\nReccomendation: Just go buy the orignal.","September 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

Audiosurf 2 is a rhythm-based game created in 2015 by developer Dylan Fitterer. The original game was well recieved by critics and fans and was quite popular in the gaming community so why not release another game you know?\n\nOk whats the deal here, it can't be much different to the original can it?\nWell it kind of is to be honest. I've only ever played the demo of the original Audiosurf game which was released back in February 2008 and there is a tonne more content on this 'overhauled' version of the game. New modes, skins to surf on, connectivity to Soundcloud so you don't actually need to have music on your disk drive to actually play the game and Steam Workshop capabilities make this a helluva' lot better than the original.\n\nI've never played the original game, what is it about?\nSo the objective of Audiosurf is to rack up points by hitting the procedurally placed 'blocks' on the track of the level, which can be controlled by either a controller, mouse or even keyboard if you're feeling lucky enough... Punk. As well as this, you need to dodge the grey 'blocks' in the track, otherwise you'll lose a combo or streak of points and it'll be higher to obtain that high-score that you've been spending four and a half days trying to achieve.\n\n\nWhat sorts of songs can you play on this?\nAnything your heart desires! Depending on the BPM of the track, it changes the difficulty of the game entirely. Say for example you're into music like LCD Soundsystem and Coldplay with most of the time, a low BPM, the game should be somewhat easy if you know what you're doing. However, if you like genres of music with a higher BPM such as Gabber or Speedcore, then get ready for a bumpy ride my friend.\n\n\nIs this game worth getting at all?\nAbsolutely! If you're a fan of music or rhythm-based games, then this is definitely something you need to pickup in the near future or when it goes on sale. I actually bought it for full price back near its release date but I've definitely got the capacity to run a load more hours into the game.","May 11","true","7.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

This is largely the same as the original Audiosurf, but with the addition of new modes and skins (with even more to be obtained from the Steam Workshop). Enhanced visuals, gameplay that relies more on scoring high than obtaining perfection, and of course a game that's limited only by your music library. During Early Access, the UI was fairly bland and the menus were a mess to navigate. Now, it's much more refined and better looking. The game UI is fairly simple compared to the original game, but that's not really a bad thing; sometimes, it's best to keep things simple. The improvements make for a much more polished game as opposed to Early Access. That said, if you're still not sold on these new features, then you're probably better off with the original Audiosurf.","May 26, 2015","true","12.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

Why would you want to jump over parts of the song? Isn't the fun in catching point blocks rather than catching some sick wicked air? Wakeboard Grid mode answers that question: the amount of blocks in your grid affect the multiplier for when you hit waves and get air. This turns it into an amazingly complex battle of choosing when to hit a wake, or when to stay on the ground and collect blocks for more points.\n\nThe other great feature is Steam Workshop integration and gamemode modding. Find that one of the new modes isn't fast enough for you? Make it faster. Don't like the color of that map? Change it. Want to turn Audiosurf into Beat Hazard? Nothing is stopping you. The mods use the simple to learn LUA language, which you may already know if you're into Garry's Mod.\n\nHowever there's still a long way to go before the game is ready to be released. Many features are still being added for modders, and the UI is still plain as heck (and the plain UI makes it VERY confusing to use!) but I do think this is all obvious stuff that will be fixed or changed before it goes to release.\n","November 26, 2013","true","10.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This was DESPITE the polarizing comments about the status of the game and it's unpolished status. I wanted to give it a chance and see for myself, what potential, if any, this game has. Like many others, I'm among the ones who cannot bring themselves to recommend this game in its present status. There are my opinions:\n\n\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n\n* GRAPHICS: The game looks gorgeous, with its smooth coloring and shading, and the Steam Workshop promises to produce some really good fan-made skins to make the experience completely customized. If you don't like Stadium or any of the skins built in because you want something more minimalist, you can choose the classic skin, or one of the fanmade ones. There's something there for everyone.\n\n\n* SCOREBOARDS: The modes now have their individual scoreboards instead of all of them being intermingled. This certainly makes it easier to see where your score stands among the multitude instead of having to hunt for it among the throng.\n\n\n* IN-GAME SCOREBOARD: If you go back to play a song again, there's a little box in the upper right hand corner that shows what you scored the last time at that point in the song. I personally love this feature because it lets you challenge yourself.\n\n\n\nTHE CONS:\n\n\n* UI: The only good thing going for A2 right now is it's sleek and minimal interface, but a lot of things are missing, such as a reliable menu to customize the volume, the sound effects, and colors all in one menu. In the first Audiosurf you could even change the colors of the individual blocks. This is something I personally miss.\n\n\n* SLOW SONG RELOAD: When you want to play a song again, the reload time is longer than necessary.\n\n\n* LACK OF INTRO ROAD MAPS AND SONG DETAIL: When you choose a song, you no longer get an overview of the map or a detail as to the blocks per minute before you start the song. This was what let you know of the difficulty of the song before hand and was a great detail if you wanted to know what songs were difficult. Right now, you can only see the current scoreboard for that song.I think it would be great if they put the scoreboard together with the old road-map.\n\n\n* LACK OF DIFFICULTY AND IRON MODES: The fact that there were Casual - Easy, Medium - Pro, and Difficult - Elite modes was a way to separate the strong from the weak, and what made the game fun to get into. If you were a beginner, you stuck to the Casual; if you wanted more of a challenge, you tried Pro but stuck to the side lane when you found our you weren't ready; if you wanted to be one of the cool kids you chose the Elite characters and just clicked Iron Mode, which turned any downhill song over 200 bpm into a headache. With each mode just being a single mode, it no longer feels as if you're shooting for something when you start at Casual, because there are no individual tiers. If you're someone who's used to playing Elite, the songs you're used to playing are no longer challenging. There are songs on which I do dismal on in the first Audiosurf, that here I can get among the top scores. That doesn't feel right.\n\n\n* LACK OF OLD MODES: So far, this incarnation of the game is heavily Mono and Wakeboard-biased, so much so that the built in skins are made for it. This is great if you're a Mono-fan, but for those---like myself---that have spent 99% of our time playing the puzzle modes in Audiosurf, this game has lost nearly all of its appeal. Eraser, Pointman, and Vegas, are gone (though you may find someone working on a mod in the Workshop), and Pusher is but a mere shadow of its former self, reduced to only 3 different colored blocks instead of 6, with an embarrasingly easy difficulty level. In addition, because of the new Engine and Interface, you can no longer see your points for individual colors.\n\n\nIt seems as if they tried to compensate for all of this with the Dethrones Update, where they introduced three new modes called "Audiosprint" (a two-player mode where you have to jump and duck blocks), "Audioshmup", (a mode where you just have to dodge anything that moves), and Audiosphere, (which seems to be Audiosurf 2's answer to Hexagon, just set to your own music). These are lackluster modes, that are aimed strictly towards Mono players because all you have to do is dodge things, just as in Mono. The different colors are gone, and so is the challenge.\n\nPart of what made Audiosurf so great was when you graduated from Mono into the puzzle characters. The game went from fun, to frustratingly, yet lovingly difficult because you went from just doging things, to playing on characters that each had their own quirks and strategies to learn. If Mono bored you, you tried Pusher, if you were tired of that one, you tried Eraser and so on. This made it so each time you switched was like learning to play the game all over again, giving it extreme replay value.\n\n\n_______________________\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n\nThis game has a lot of potential to be greater than its predecessor, but right now, it doesn't compare. You may enjoy it if you're a Mono player, but if you're an Eraser, Pusher, or Pointman player, this game won't offer you much. Perhaps if someone in the workshop is able to work out a mod for them, or if the developers bring them back, this game may have a bright future. In the meantime, until a worthy update is released, stick to the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 12, 2014","false","8.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There are many features and variants of play (even in early access!) already and has the most interesting art-style (in my opinion) of the genre so far.\n\nThe game has two main, basic gamemodes: Wakeboarding, and Mono. The rest are variants of these. Mono and variants were available in Audiosurf 1 already, but Wakeboarding is new and exclusive to the second game.\n\nMono is the mode where you dodge "music level bars", and try to hit colored orbs with a flying ship to get points. There is also an overlay below where you try to fill it up all the way to get bonus points. Wakeboarding is where you are, well, wakeboarding on the track and you try to fill up the overlay like in Mono. However, on the "climax" of intense areas of the song (like bass drops in Dubstep), you are able to do tricks that give you a lot of points, and you get a higher multiplier depending on how filled up the overlay is.\n\nObviously, like any game in this genre, the game uses your own music to generate the track. Whenever the track is intense/the loudest, the color turns more red and goes on more of a downhill slope, and when it is the least intense/the quietest, the colors turn more blue and go on an upward slope. Also, the game supports almost all music file types, like MP3, FLAC, MP4, WAV, and more! It even supports Soundcloud! (finally!)\n\nMy favorite new features of this game are the improved leaderboard and the friend challenge/dethrone system. Finally, you can see how well you are doing while playing compared to the top and bottom people on the leaderboard! And, you can now challenge friends to beat your score on a song you just played (although the song must be on either Soundcloud, or you both have the same song)!

A rhythm game.\nCan you really have sequels in rhythm games, especially ones where the library is defined by the player instead of preselected tracks?\nYes you can! Audiosurf 2 features more modes, better workshop support with lots of different skins and modes, improved engine, better graphics/sound and features lots of ways to play the game even if you don't have music tracks saved on your PC via soundcloud support and of course Song of the Day.\n\nMy only complaint is the different formula calculation for score in the Mono mode which is defined a lot more from RNG when compared with the original game but I hardly find that a reason to not recommend this.\nYou can play versus your friends, people in your region or even globaly so there's a big community with semi competitive status.\n\nAlternatively you relax and unwind on your own terms and songs with different modes and settings; the game appeals to anyone and everyone and I think this is what makes it a must buy if you like rhythm games and even if plan or not to be featured on the leaderboards.","February 23","true","41.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bepis/recommended/235800/","bepis","capes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bepis/","18 products in account","For people coming from Audiosurf 1: Try the demo first and see for yourself if it's worth the price.\nFor people who have big music libraries who want a new game to mess around with: Get this.\n\nAlthough the game follows mostly the same mechanics as the first Audiosurf (ride on a rollercoaster based on your favorite songs, gathering points and beating other people's scores), there are plenty of things that set it apart. The first and biggest addition is the workshop, which gives you more than enough options to try out different skins and modes, and lets you find the best ways to play your songs. The other big addition is soundcloud integration, which means you don't even need a music library in order to play on a ton of different songs.\n\nOf all the mechanical changes to the tracks, the best is the algorithm change that basically gets rid of the 'uphill only' songs from Audiosurf 1. That means that people who have softer songs they want to play can actually have fun with them in this game. Next is the addition of 'corkscrews' (Audiosurf 1 had these as well, but they didn't affect your score as far as I remember), which is either a good or a bad thing depending on how much you like having to use new strategies to get higher scores. It adds a few new elements to the gameplay that will seperate the pros from the casual players.\n\nOne of the changes that I'm not a fan of, but can understand the reason why it was implemented, is the randomization of blocks in the track. While it helps balance out the different audio formats that enter the leaderboard, it brings in a notable factor of luck to the gameplay. Plus, when you restart the track, you have to wait for it to load again, which is tolerable, but gets annoying if you're playing songs that are 10 minutes or longer. If you aren't itching to be a pro player, this won't affect your gameplay.\n\nFor the people who only want to play this competitively, you might just have to deal with mono (which is the simplest gameplay mode). I find the puzzle modes fun, and they're much more challenging than mono, but there aren't a lot of puzzle players in this game to begin with. There is a 'song of the day' section which always has tons of players on it, but at the expense of you not playing on your own music. Unless you only play popular songs or soundcloud songs, you'll have to stick with mono in order to have groups of people to play against.\n\nAnd lastly, for the players who don't care about competitive score at all, this game is going to be heaven for you. With all these skins and modes to mess around with, you won't get bored of the game anytime soon. The upgraded graphics allow some creative seizure-inducing (or seizure-avoiding) arrangements, meaning you can pick skins to make the game look as pretty or as simplistic as you want.\n\nAs a big music game fan, Audiosurf 2 is well worth the $15. I've gotten a ton of time and enjoyment out of it (as a note, I had over 200 hours in Audiosurf 1 as well, but that wasn't on this account). And, if you're still not convinced by this review, you can just try the demo.","February 27","true","199.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Surfers of the world!\n\nThis is my first review so go easy.\n\nI have always been a mono player and I love that mode because you can really just unplug a bit and surf the song of your choice. With Audiosurf 2. You can't simply cruise through a song and have a good time. The blocks come faster and so close together that catching 80% of the blocks on a moderately difficult song is nearly impossible.\n\nI want the Audiosurf track algorithm back. It was perfectly balanced and the tweaks that have been made in Audiosurf 2 break the game.\n\nI regret purchasing this game. It has the feel of an Audiosurf knock off, not a sequel. The very component that made Audiosurf so much fun (the track algorithm) is the thing they have changed the most. If it aint broke don't fix it.\n\nOn the other hand, I really like the performance chages that have come in. Performance wise it is far superior to Audiosurf.\nI like that the game is moddable.

It now even left Early Access even though some parts are not finished, or at least don't look like they are. Stuff like the song ending screen which is just text, with no explanations (if you didn't play Audiosurf you have no idea what the bonuses mean), no images, just bland lame text, you feel like you've accomplished nothing, you just see some plain score written there, not even standing out.\n\nIt looks good on paper, better than the original Audiosurf. But it's not.\nIt has some cool things like the modding support, which allows for a lot of variety in both gameplay and visuals. But it's the only thing it got. Oh and being able to play songs from Soundcloud, even though that's not such a big deal for me.\nFor me, it just isn't as fun as Audiosurf. It may be a bit fancier, but it didn't improve on anything else and doesn't even manage to keep the core of the game polished. Gameplay feels less responsive and less intuitive, there are less difficulties (even though I always play as elite so I don't care that much), the interface is far from being polished (not even finished to me) and can be kinda confusing, it lacks some information, the looks actually don't improve on anything except being fancier (I even think it makes playing more cumbersome by wanting to do too much)...\nIt just needs a lot of improvement still.\nThe only problem is that the dev (Dylan) doesn't seem to be willing to put that much effort in it. Now that the game is out of Early Access, I'm treating it as a finished game and a sign that he really isn't going to improve much more. So my final words are that this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequel that hasn't been worked on enough.\n\nMy advice: get Audiosurf, it'll be cheaper and will be a better overall experience. You'll get what you want: a very good music game.","June 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

Depending on how the game changes between now and launch, my final review could be different.\n\nAudiosurf is literally one of my favorite games, so I jumped on the Audiosurf 2 Early Access as soon as it came out. For those of you unfamiliar with Audiosurf, it takes any song you have on your hard drive and creates a course out of it. Whenever the music is fast and exciting, the course is fast and exciting. You get points by gathering blocks as you go down the course.\n\nThe main idea behind Audiosurf 2 is to support mods, namely custom modes and visual themes. This is a really cool idea, but I'm not sure it will scale well in an Audiosurf game. My main concern is this: in the original game you choose a character who has a certain special ability. At the end of the song, your score is compared to all of the other scores in the level you chose (so if you chose a Casual character, you would be compared to all of the Casual scores, etc.) In Audiosurf 2 it looks like the scores are only compared within the mode that you choose. What if I find an unofficial mode that somebody made that I really like, but nobody else plays it because it's not built in? On the other hand there is no way for all scores to be compared in any meaningful way because the developers can't guarantee that the scoring systems will be comparable.\n\nIn the original game I started out playing Casual characters, and quickly found that Mono was the best. Eventually I worked up the courage to start playing Pro characters, and I did quite a bit of experimenting until I figured out how to play Eraser well. Unfortunately there is no Eraser mode in Audiosurf 2 (though I am sure it is only a matter of time before somebody makes a mod of it).\n\nMost of the official modes are variants of Wakeboard, which was teased in a couple of trailers a while back. Most of the points you get in Wakeboard modes comes from the jumps and tricks you do. The problem with this is that you have to wait until the song is about to get fast (which happens maybe three times in a song), jump, and push a few buttons to do some tricks. It doesn't feel like it requires much skill on the part of the player, so I've been avoiding the wakeboard modes as much as possible.\n\nThere are a couple of modes that are more similar to the ones in the original game. I felt more at home, but again my favorite character isn't there.\n\nAudiosprint is a good example of what is possible with community-created modes. It's designed to be a party game where you take turns playing. It's pretty simple: either jump over or slide under the obstacles as you pass them. The runner emits this horrible scream every time she hits an obstacle, which is really distracting and will probably make you hit more obstacles. It's pretty hilarious in a group setting, but utterly obnoxious when you are playing by yourself.\n\nAnd then someone made Triple Vision. My roommate and I played a game of it, but I think it would work best with three people. It also would have helped if we had communicated more on what colors we should go for, because we filled it up quite often and lost a lot of points that way.\n\nAt this point Audiosurf 2 is not worth getting. Audiosurf still has lots of people playing it, and you'll be able to compare scores with all of them. If you don't have Audiosurf yet I would highly recommend it; as I said, it is one of my favorite games, and my go-to game if I have a few minutes to chill.","November 25, 2013","false","1.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

With the new game mode, in which you actually surf and do tricks in order to score points, there is a fresh new way of experiencing the vibe this game can give you.\n\nIt's not just literally riding your soundwaves; if you aim to play this competitively against friends or global leaderboards, you have to be agile and stay cleverly focused at the same time to puzzle your way through your favourite tunes. Think fast old man!\n\nWhether you like Symphonic Metal like me, or whether you like hits, classical, disco, hip-hop, or even that dubstep people seem to like nowadays, Audiosurf 2 will make you experience your favourites like never before.

It's fun, my computer runs it quite well and it is cheap.  For less than the price of a combo meal at a popular family restaurant I have had hours of enjoyment.  Actually, I'd probably still recommend it at double the price.\n\nHowever, I had to work pretty hard at it to get to this.  This is an early release and of course it will be unpredictable and incomplete.  I'm fine with that.  In fact, it's interesting starting it up and seeing what has changed.  The problems I found getting up to speed was partly due to the fact that most forum hints assume a knowledge of AS1.  If there's a tutorial for AS2 - as some forum posts suggest - I haven't found it.   Collecting colours in mono, puzzle characters, a radio station?  If these are in AS2 then I've yet to find them.\n\nI find the tracks to be smooth and the ship is perfectly manoevrable.   I had no trouble finding my music on my computer in any file and it plays without problem.  I enjoy the leaderboards and the dethrone list is wonderful.  It's a real buzz to find that someone else out there has my obscure music when this happens.\n\nI did have lots of trouble finding other people's games.  At first I assumed my songs had not been played since nearly all of them gave 'No entry'.  But then I found some songs discussed in a forum thread and realised they were there - somewhere.  This has been my biggest problem and one which won't impact the knowlegeable but really needs fixing before the game is sold to a wider market.\n\nThe internet only came to my home town 18 months ago and I have years of CDs.  WMP since several years back has read the tag of a CD and searched online for content detail.  Those of us with no internet connection had no choice but to rip as 'Unknown Artist' - 'Track 1' onwards, and manually transcribe the details from the CD cover.   I also had a whole heap of vinyls converted to CD back when this was the done thing.  Resulting in non-standard or nonexistent tags for thousands of songs.\n\nI can be somewhat OCD so I have spent the past several days learning all about Musicbrainz and running my music through it, only to discover that many Australian releases are not on there.  So I have learned tag name standards and become a contributor, and it takes me about fifteen-twenty minutes to prepare a 'new' album to play in Audiosurf 2 so it can be found and matched against other players.  This is not how it should be and someone who buys the game should not have to go to this much effort to make their music compatible so they can compete against the group. At least they ought to be aware that this is required before they purchase.  It's okay for beta, but not after that.  I think a tutorial on music tags might help - I didn't know they even existed and I won't be the only one.\n\nHaving come this far, I am enjoying the game and beginning to try the different modes and test my skills against others.  It's a great way to relax.  I will probably now find the tutorial, radio etc.\n\nPROs: Attractive, undemanding, cheap, helpful forum moderators and developers, has good music :)\nCONs: Requires an understanding of the mechanics of the game to play in its present state, not much support for the total newbie","June 7, 2014","true","97.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElegyForMot/recommended/235800/","ElegyForMot","[MSG15 Elite] Elegy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElegyForMot/","161 products in account","Honestly, what sets this game apart most is the community. The game is solid for competitive play, and is, of course an amazing way to visualize your music to add a new element of depth to any song you want, but there are other games that can do that as well. The developer is pretty cool and will check soundcloud for people recommending songs of the day, which is a neat way to interact with the players. The game is constantly being improved upon in the bleedingedge beta, which is another thing that sets this apart from games with a more stagnant community, such as Symphony. The algorithm for playing this game is really better at picking up electronic songs, but that's true for virtually every procedurally generated music game on Steam.\n\nThe community, though. I've made more friends through this game than anything else I've played on Steam. The leaderboards comments is an interesting platform for communication because only the top players will be seen by everyone, since the song of the day is loaded to by default. It's an interesting way to get yourself seen, especially if you put enough practice into the game to consistently be on the top charts. Albums can have their own community, especially if the album is from someone or something that promotes such amongst its fans. For instance, the LISA soundtrack and the Undertale soundtrack are good instances of where you can find people that love music and love these other games as well, and serves as an interesting way to share interests.\n\nSoundcloud integration is also neat. Unlike other procedurally generated games, where you can easily spoof a top score by modifying a local file, having score graphs combined with a fixed source for audio makes competitive play actually viable. When someone does cheat, it makes it very obvious when they do, and the cheat reporting system in the beta can take care of them. There's also the whole aspect of overlap between Soundcloud community and Audiosurf 2 community, if you're not aware of 'Soundclown', it can be, well, interesting, and what makes it more interesting is the procedurally generated tracks for some of the mashups, shitposts, collabs, soundclowns, and whatever else. You can recommend songs to your friends, which is an area where this game could use improvement since it uses the dethrone tab to handle recommendations as well.\n\nRecommendations:\n-Play the bleedingedge beta\n-Browse skins (the included ones are fine, but the most impressive ones are on the workshop imo, which is how it should be)\n-IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY MONO, READ A GUIDE OR ASK A TOP PLAYER! Mono is the primary competitive mode and it does not play like what you're probably accustomed to with rhythm games. There is strategy involved on top of dexterity and skill.\n-Make friends. This will help you find more music, on top of probably helping you improve your game. Sometimes there are songs you really want the top spot on and you can ask your friends to leave the top spot alone if you think they could take it. All sorts of benefits.\n\nStrong suits:\n-Community\n-Track generation\n-Playstyle (mono, mono turbo, specifically are my favorite)\n-Soundcloud integration\n-Anti-cheat\n-Active developer\n\nAreas for improvement:\n-Notification system is clunky. Dethrones, beats, recommendations are all in the same tab and otherwise rely on email to notify you. Make a throwaway e-mail if you plan on using one at all, it will fill up faster than you think.\n-Soundcloud log-in system isn't working. You can't log directly into Soundcloud, but you can still enjoy it by searching for what you want, though it'd be nice if this feature were working so you could access your playlists and such\n-Track generation. I know I listed this as a strong suit, but it could still use improvement. There's a thing that can happen, referred to in the game's code as "troll powerblocks" where a powerblock will spawn in without any notes in front of it, making it useless and forcing players to rely on storing blocks in their grid beforehand. Track generation works best for electronic stuff now. You'll see some songs people want to play but don't really work well on audiosurf 2's trackgen. If you played Guitar Hero 3, you'll remember Cliffs of Dover. All guitar song, right? Trackgen only captures the percussion portion. This is sadly the fate of many rock songs, you'll wind up playing the percussion line most of the time. Through the Fire and Flames? Classic for rhythm games due to its note spam? Doesn't translate well into AS2's trackgen. Still a top song, though.\n\nRating compared to other rhythm games: 9.5/10\nOverall rating as a game: 8.5/10\n\nThis is the most robust rhythm game available on Steam as it stands now, so if you're looking for a rhythm game this is it. I'd say it's worth the buy even when it's not on sale.","January 29","true","572.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

There isn't much to say about the game beside's that it's better then the first Audiosurf, although that as also an amazing game.\nIn my opinion i like Audiosurf 2 alot more then 1, Reasons for that is that there's ''alot more to do'' then in the first game.\n\n- Mods? Yes Please! probably one of the better things that has happened to the game, And let's people who play the game get more interactive with the game itself.\n\n-One thing i always ''struggled'' with in the first game was the camera angle, or the zoom of the camera in the first game. This one dosn't have that problem!\n\n-The graphics are better... Defenetly since the release of the DirectX11 it's a been a great improvement for this game.\n\n-The UI is also different, better in a way. I've been playing since really Early Acces, And i have to admit at first i had to get used to the new UI since it's got out of Early Acces. After a while i started liking it. But i'm still used to the old UI :P.\n\n-Audiosurf 2 has a better way of ''writing/riding'' the songs then Audiosurf, It picks everything up way better with Drums, Bass, Vocals etc. Also it's sometimes possible to ride songs that last 2hours! woo!\n\nOverall in my opinion, Again. This is a great game! I'm glad this game excists, It helps you ''do something'' while your listening to music, Defently for some people, like me, This is very usefull and a great way to still spend time. 11/10.\n\nNow.

That's the word, Audiosurf 2 just isn't smooth enough, you don't get in sync with the music because something is wrong. The obstacles should "tilt" the music when you hit them, the way it is now you never know if you have hit something or not. The track feels weird, sometimes you start to go uphill and you can't even see what's ahead (a disaster for ninja mode). Unfortunately I couldn't bear to play this game for more than a few minutes to find out exactly where it went wrong, I just went back to the original Audiosurf. The goal with these kind of games is to relax, Audiosurf 2 does the opposite of that.

Wanting a way to kill time AND listen to music, I thought buying this game would be a great option.  But no, I threw $15 bucks straight into the toilet.\n\nThe interface for this game is horrendous, and the game being in early access is no excuse.  The main menu was constantly stuttering and loading.  As well, searching through your music library with the Audiosurf menu is tediously slow and unorganized.  Without even starting the game, I was a bit dissappointed on how I spent my money.\n\nOnce I did start however, I was certain that my money was wasted.  The wakeboard mode is a laugh and not even worth time.  It's simply not fun at all and those massive jumps you pull off distract from the actual gameplay and rhythm of the game.  Knowing I wouldn't enjoy this mode in the first place, I was happy that the original mode was included as well, but the original mode barely even worked at all.  Basically none of the note blocks were on beat with the music I'd play and everything that was set down was seemingly random.  And despite picking the super steep, the game barely felt fast at all.  In fact, it was impossible to tell I was even on a slope and instead felt like I was just on a driving on a fast, straight highway occasionally bumping up and down.  Once playing through some songs I like, I was fed up with the game being out of sync and the slow ♥♥♥ menus.\n\nMaybe when this game leaves early access it will be much more playable and fun, but for now, please save your money.

Audiosurf 2 is one of the few games that makes adrenaline rush through me. It combines appealing graphics along with musical sensation to create a masterpiece. However, the community Audiosurf 2 has is what really makes the game fun. I personally am very competitive and enjoy beating other people's scores. There is a global leaderboard for every gamemode and some very tough competitors to compete with. You can access SoundCloud, play practically any song you like and you can share the song with friends. If that wasn't enough there's also a workshop with over 500 community created skins and gamemodes.\n\nJust don't expect it to be like Rock Band or Guitar Hero. You aren't required to hit notes on the right beat or anything. The main goal is to collect a grid full of notes, or at least as full as possible. There are also new modes that have their own twist of gameplay.\n\nThere are no easy, medium or hard versions of Mono, Vegas and the rest. There's one set difficulty which seems hard at first but gets easier as played.\n\nOverall, it's worth a try. If you aren't completely convinced then wait for it to go on a sale.

Better visuals, more game modes and the added workshop portion adds even more content. However if you have played Audiosurf for the Mono and Ninja mono game modes, then you will be disappointed. Those two modes are my favorite and are completely changed for the worse in Audiosurf 2.

Totally changed we have a lot of many new cool features.\n\nIn collaboration with SOUNDCLOUD, you can browse between millions of songs made by the users of the previously mentioned music platform; feature that i found quite interesting and kinda annoying at the same time, because some songs are re-edited or mixed by the users, you can find nice mixes or you can have the terrifying experience of play a chorus track of your favorite track sing by someone else with a weird voice.\n\nHowever, this characteristic invites you to play new songs made by stand alone singers / bands, based on the last songs that you have played, at the moment i have played some of them and them are fantastic.\n\nTalking about the gameplay, you have the old game modes plus new and interesting ones.\n\nReminding old game modes we have:\n- Mono / Ninja\n- Pointman\n- Eraser\n- Pusher\n- Vegas\n\nAnd the new ones are:\n- Casual\n- Casual Puzzle\n- Wakeboard\n- Audiosprint\n\nApart from game modes, we can now choose between different skins for the stage. That makes this game more enjoyable than ever.\n\nAnother useful feature implemented in this title is that you can use the Steam Workshop, breaking the limits and go beyond, letting the community create new game modes or skins.\n\nDefinitely this sequel is turning Audiosurf to an endless fun and making it deserve a place in your library.\n\n10 / 10\n\nA Masterpiece !\nSkulls of the Shogun is a 2D Turn-Based Strategy game. This game has a colorful cartoon style that makes it enjoyable and visually friendly.\n\nWith a comic and a good story, it takes place in the ancient Japan. The story begins in the battlefield, after the "General Akamoto" (you) got betrayed by one of his lieutenants. Stealing your name and your sword.\n\nIn the afterlife, your mission is recover your name and get your revenge against the imposter.\n\nFighting against undead and rival clans through many challenging levels.\n\nTalking about gameplay, every team has 5 moves per turn, 3 different kind of soldiers and 3 kind of wizards plus a general, game ends when you kill the enemy general. Every character has its own hability and battle stats.\n\nSoundtrack is well made, relaxing and smooth.\n\nPlaying in it co-op it's a funnier experience, up to 4 players you will have a good time with your friends.\n\nA lot of fun packaged in this great game, definetily a must have.\n\n10 / 10\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.","November 8, 2015","true","40.5"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","39","73","10","0"

Love music? Well now you can surf your favorite music and when I mean surf it, I mean surf any music genre you are comfortable to listening in AudioSurf 2. AS2 is a leap-forward and an improvement from the original AS1. With the addition of creating your very own mod from several choices and options, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with the next trending game mode. If creativity is not your major then do not worry, you can visit the AS2 Workshop and find many types of mods, skin and game modes.\n\nMy personal favorites from the Workshop are flightPlus, Twisted Mono, and Evasion.\n\nAS2 is a step-forward because of the improvements in generating blocks and obstacles in-sync and on the spot. The many skin mods in the workshop vary from simplistic designs to facilitate gameplay to skins with more "eye-candy" to recently skins requiring a little more power to experience the best details. My favorite skin is the Substranum Classic skin. Also Wakeboard is introduced to AS2. Basically, the mode is a stunt game mode where you actually surf to your music and take air at different times depending on the song itself. More points can be earned during "chorus" parts or when the music reaches a climatic point and continues along that pattern. Honestly, I've only played the mode 3-6 times but haven't played it since. Is it a bad mode? It was the first time I've played it but now and then, it's enjoyable.\n\n\nIf you are very familiar with AS1 and their modes, note some modes for now are either missing or left out but with the community taking the wheel on re-designing some of those AS1 modes, it will be possible to play those modes like Ninja Mono. Or for the more casual players, Mono Classic (or Mono Basic in the Workshop).\n\nWhile SoundCloud integration feels useless for me, expect to see Last.fm integration again on AS2 like in AS1.\n\n================================================\n\nSo for $15 you pay for Wakeboard, Mono, Mono Turbo, Pusher, Wakeboard Pro, Wakeboard Mono, but also additional modes free through the Workshop and apart from the Neon, Classic, and Sand skin, the option to download and add even more skins. Is it worth it? Totally. When it comes to listening to music and playing to your favorite music, buying Audiosurf 2 is a no-brainer.\n\nWhile it is still in Early Access phase, expect some hiccups here and there and other bugs. The game is still in-development but it's nothing of bad and is playable.","February 5, 2014","true","72.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No payment for kush\n2. No Headache from kush\n\nbs apart, this game is amazing. seeing the music you love getting transformed into the sickest corkscrew loops and colorful roads is truly out amazing.\n\nThe quality adjustment settings makes even my toaster of a laptop able to run it, so thats a plus. The community is also providing skins for the game, meaning you wont be stuck with some lousy skin starter set, were the only way to unlock new, would be to purchase some overpriced dlc´s (srsly screw overkill for making pd2 a cashcow) bs apart (again) you will most likely find a skin that suit your needs due to a creative community.\n\nAudiosurf is synced with Soundcloud, meaning the music you get to choose from in Audiosurf is all existing on soundcloud, and the other way around (you´re even able to log in to your soundcloud account.) Ive only missed a few tracks that sadly, werent aviable on Souncloud. But dont worry, Audiosurf saves the day by letting you use music stored on your computer, so you should be covered up for good.\n\nOne of the only Cons i can find about this game is that theres very little interaction ingame between the Audiosurfers. Yeah sure, you can leave a comment on the songs about how much you wrecked your friends and foes puwny arses and then later on get a message about how your friend wrecked your score to pieces, but lobby making and realtime PVP could problably work out fine.\n\nso for a summary: 9/10 - fantastic game, but would love to see some more interaction between the players","October 7, 2015","true","112.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Mono is way too easy and Mono Turbo is just insane.  Audiosurf 1's Ninja Mono Ironmode was the perfect blend of challenge and enjoyment and Audiosurf 2 just doesn't cut it.\nOn the other hand, it's moddable, so that's neat (some of the skins are fantastic!).  I'm interested to see what the modding community can do to save Mono but everything I've seen is just a disappointing (nothing but gimmick mods and mods making turbo even more insane).\nThen there's the largely forgettable wakeboarding mode which I'm assuming someone thought of while playing SSX Tricky on their gamecube but was only given a few days to shoehorn it last minute into this game.  With a great sadness, Audiosurf 2 gets a thumbs down from me.","December 26, 2013","false","10.2"," 41 of 77 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","41","77","0","0"

I felt like the visual improvements weren't enough to give this sequel my money. But I did. I liked the first one enough that I wanted to support the developer(s?) a little more. And at first I didn't like it. I prefered the art style and simplicity of the first game. However, after a couple updates my doubts quickly left.  And the biggest reason that I would recommend this to owners of the first game is the workshop support. In addition to what feels like an upgrade to music adaptation of stages, I can go from playing as  Sanic in Greenhill Zone to a Bionicle riding through lava. I can play the classic mode, a clone of bit trip runner, a SHMUP, or just use it as an amazing visualizer. It's one of the most purely fun rythm games I've played in a while. There are still a few features missing that I'd like to see added the the game such as audio level sliders, better UI, or graphics options. However, even if the game didn't recieve any future updates, the stuff flowing out of the workshop is deffinitely worth the purchase.\nSorry if this is a little incoherent. Long day of work, came home to play audiosurf,  and I decided to do my first review of a steam game. Now bedtime.... Or pants time.

I haven't played Audiosurf 1 so I don't know what differences there are between the two, but I believe there's a mod that let's you play under the same rules (scoring, spikes, etc.). There's lots of customization options as well as game modes, and on more popular songs there's a lot of competition. It's a must buy if you spend lots of time listening to music.\n\nPros:\n-Great time killer\n-Lots to learn (isn't as simple as it seems)\n-Lots of customization options (flashy theme is default but you can choose darker ones or less distractive ones)\n-Works on Linux\n-Can play any song from Soundcloud or .mp3 file (no need for maps like in osu!)\n-Can play with mouse or keys\n-Can compete with others\n\nCons:\n-Less known songs tend to have little to no competition\n-Random Layouts can mess up your score (for good or for bad)\n-Can get repetitive if you don't like many different songs/genres\n\nSo, whether you listen to music a lot or enjoy playing rhythm games, this is a nice pick that'll keep you entertained for hours.\n\nEdit: Sorry if there's any mistakes in my English.","December 4, 2015","true","240.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

However there is one major  problem with it.\n\nThe menu is atrocious.  Not the way it looks mind you, but it's functionality.  Searching songs is nearly impossible because not only is it case sensitive, but the search bar is rather small.  Worse still is that if you try to exceed the search bar limitations it negates your ability to backspace.  Meaning you have you retype everything.  Sometimes when you start a song, the menu will revert to the song of the day instead of the one you selected, meaning the song changes.  Other times the menu takes several seconds to change slides from "Friends" to "Global" for instance, which happens rarely, but when it does this it slows the game down completely and you can't alt-tab or open the steam overlay.\n\nThe game is still really fun and when these menu problems are resolved it's easily one of the best rhythm games out there.","January 18","true","49.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

In-depth review incoming:\n\n===========Pros over Audiosurf 1=============\n\n-- Better graphics, and skin mods.\nThe graphics possible in the new engine blow Audiosurf 1 out of the water without question. If you're an eye-candy lover this is great, and the integration of highly moddable skins makes the limit of eye-candy quite high.\n\n--Better engine.\nIt's without a doubt that the new engine being used is better and will offer far more if devs or mod makers take advantage.\n\n--Mods\nAnyone can try their hand and creating their dream game mode, and this will surely be the lifeblood of the game after it releases. Whatever failings in design the developer may make in our eyes, the fix will be just a couple of code lines away.\n\n--Separate score boards for modes\nQuite a welcome addition. This puts an end to all the crying about "balance" (mainly from Mono players) of all the modes competing on the same score board. It should be noted that the official puzzle modes are all competing on the same scoreboard.\n\n--Support for many sound file formats like FLAC and some platforms like Soundcloud\n\n--Challenges/Dethrones\nThe newest update to the game has added a friendly and easy competitive framework to the game. It's far cleaner and quicker than having to trudge through AS1's scoreboards. This in-game framework was not something available in AS1, and allows you to see what is popular per mode so you can be competitive with strangers even in unpopular modes. Definitely a welcome addition if you're competitive\n\nThat's it for the pros.\n\n==========Cons below Audiosurf 1.===========\n\n--Requires always online\n\n--no file browser\n\n--no last.fm\n\n--Unfinished UI functionality\nThe Dethrones update added a great boost to UI responsiveness which is now on par or better than AS1. The UI still needs quite a bit of work to be considered finished compared to Audiosurf 1. Keyboards and gamepad can navigate menus.\n\n--Reloading tracks every time (even just for a track restart)\nThe capacity to save track schemes in Audiosurf 1 for quickly loading in your song is gone. Restarting your song before it ends also requires a reload of the entire track, very annoying.\n\nThat's it for the major cons I see.\n\nSuffice to say, the biggest con of all is this:\n\nThe developer seems to work at a snail's pace averaging one update every 2-3 months. It also needs to mentioned that the dev is very silent about what he's working on. Community interaction is important, and while surprises are nice, it would be nicer if the dev took less than one minute in the future to at least say he's still alive and working on the game.\n\n==========Should you buy it?=============\n\nAudiosurf 2, as far as I can tell, is finally just behind where Audiosurf left us in general game quality. Audiosurf 1 is definitely worth a buy, but Audiosurf 2 is where it will be at. I can confidently say I think it's worth buying if you don't mind the current incompleteness, but more shall come in the future.","March 26, 2014","true","603.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","54"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galvin/recommended/235800/","Galvin","The World's Last Chance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galvin/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMost of what I said before about this game is now irrelevent. New players will never know the struggle. They fixed an ungodly amount of bugs and problems. I'm going to now give the game an 8/10. I'm just going to say this about the game; When you get a good mode and a good skin, and the stronger your periferal vision, the stronger your eyegasm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything below this line was my review of the game taken place two weeks before the release date\n__________________________________________\n\nOkay, so, I'm going to wright the most accurate review I possibly can without losing my temper.\n\nThey tried to make a good game with new content. It was pretty hard for them after Audiosuft 1. It's like inventing a color to them. I have been waiting for years for this game to come out, and it has not impressed me what so ever. This game is the biggest let down and failure since Star Wars: The Old Republic and Duke Nukem Forever. I'm going to explain the good things that are different about this game and the bad things that are different about this game.\n\nGood Things\n- Kinda high res, yeah, it's not too bad.\n- Screen effects aren't too bad.....                      okay, you got me, they are amazing, but read what I put first in the bad things list\n- You can now play songs longer than one hour (but who seriously has that kind of patience?)\n\nOkay, now it's time for the bad things\n- I couldn't enjoy the two good things because I was too busy grinding my teeth at these things\n- No difficulty settings anymore. It's a 1 size fits all idea\n- You cannot change your settings, like mouse speed or sound effects, in game. You must exit to the main menu to do that. Setting mouse speeds are a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you start a song, test it, hit escape, change it (going to the options quits your game and returns you to the main menu), and repeat until you're satisfied,\n- You have no control of the volume\n- Just touching notes is no longer enough.\n- You can no longer obtain notes by hitting them in the side.\n- Mono was totally ruined. It's the best thing there, but it still sucks. Pitifully.\n- The track is long, skiny, distorted and faster because of it. Imagine someone grabbing the track at each end and pulling them apart like warm and gooey cheese. That's what the track looks like. Everything in the track looks, well.. go into word. Put in a picture of a face. Make it about as wide as the distance that the tab key will jump horizontally. Now vertically stretch it to the very bottom of the page. See how distorted it got? That's how everything looks. Now put the normal image to the left or right of it. Imagine a horizontal line that would start at the bottom of the picture and go up to the top of both pictures. The two lines start at the same time and finish at the same time. This line will move much, much faster on the distorted image because it has to make up for the extra area you added, that made it distorted. This is what I mean by the track is long, skinny, distorted, and faster because of it.\n- When Audiosurf 1 came with the Orange Box soundtracks, Audiosurf 2 comes with, get this, 15 different versions of Bonfire by Knife Party!!! Isn't that amazing! I mean, how could we possibly ask for more? Sounds amazing, right?! I hope you saw the verbal irony there.\n- Main menu is difficult to navigate, hard to understand, and designed for Windows 8/Windows Phone (Better known as the tile phone), especially since everything in a tile theme, including all circles.\n- People liked Audiosurf 1 partly because they could relax and think when they played it. When I wrote my book, I just played Audiosurf and my ideas naturally came to me. The gameplay took enough effort that you couldn't hold a conversation with someone, but left enough of your mental resources to daydream and just straight out think, like you do when you're trying to (and can't) fall asleep at night.\n- Mouse Sensitivity is not consecuative. Skins all have their own width of the track. They also have their own character size. Your mouse sensitivity isn't how much of your screen you can move your character, it's the amount of area you have to cover on your mousepad to get from one side of the track to the other. Fatter tracks will give you the illusion of faster mouse sensitivity, while skinny tracks give you the illusion of slower sensitivity. This is a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n\nOh yeah, and, 72 minutes into the game the high resolution capabilities aren't...    new anymore, they got old, and the "amazing" screen effects are getting annoying. God ♥♥♥♥ING forbid that there be a milimeter of my screen with nothing on it.","May 27, 2014","true","327.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Having never acquiring predecessors, for graphical reasons, I can't tell you whether they are right or wrong, but, I can tell you that I enjoy this game, and, updates from the producers and mods from the community are making this game even better. I love the idea of riding your own music, from the soothing flow of the road to the beat-drops of the slopes, I enjoy this game for its unique puzzle generating mechanisms.

It's missing a lot of features that made the original game more competitive to play (easy to pick up, hard to master) though it is a game anyone can pick up and get top scores on provided they can find a song with other people on the scoreboard.\n\nThe graphics are majorly improved, which is a bonus that doesn't always stand out when you're deep within playing the game.\n\nThe original 5 non-mono modes (pusher, eraser, pointman, vegas, double vision) are all missing or very badly ported into the game. Pusher - the only one ported - is missing just about everything that made it special, the only differences to (classic) mono now being colour count and the ability to push blocks.\n\nThe game doesn't have any chain bonuses either, which used to make or break a good Audiosurf run.\n\nHowever, the game has full modding support for both skins and modes, which is essentially what saves the game for me. It's fun if you want to play audiosurf but not quite audiosurf, or if you just want to pick up a beautiful game and rush your mouse back and forward to dodge things that don't even resemble grey blocks anymore.\n\nOverall: 7/10\nAudiosurf beats it in 90% of ways, but hey, we can mod the problems out.","August 8, 2014","true","258.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can download custom skins, gamemodes. All created by players on steam in the workshop, you can even make your own.\n-The engine that creates the map is loads better than the first, it has more rhythm and more flow in my opinion, makes the game alot more immersive.\n\nCons:\n-Tutorials are limited, as for the wakeboard there were no tutorials on how to do any tricks once you're in the air.\n(You can use 1 2 3 4 for tricks in mid air, the top right will tell you if you dont have enough time, try holding them down too.)\n(Left click and right click do some of the tricks as well)\n-Lack of gamemodes at the moment, the game and high scores consists almost entirely of mono or other variations.\n\n9/10\nGreat game, still in early access if they improve on tutorials and gamemodes then 10/10.\nTry this game out, loads of fun.

I'm most pleased to report that this functionality works just fine after jumping through the above hoops.\n\nCompared to when I initially wrote this, it also received a lot of other updates, mostly adding more game modes and Steam Workshop enhanceability.\n\n\nWhat's still lacking is the polish -- for example, the game mode descriptions in the game mode selection screen cuts off. You have to pick a mode, go back to the main menu, and read the full description over there.\nThere was the snazzy end of the track from Audiosurf, where your inner OCD is satiated because the track ends *exactly* as the track ends (:D). In Audiosurf 2, the music stops playing and you go back to the menu a bit before the actual end of the track, and it feels random and just unpolished.\nSimilarly, there's the new Endless Runner-inspired 'audiosprint' game mode as of a recent patch, in which you solely duck under or jump over obstacles. Both the animations for this as well as the controls feel unpolished, and how long you can hold a jump or duck seems based not on some gameplay spec, but on the next obstacle in your way.\nMy biggest gripe is the disappearance of Audiosurf's blocks in favour of, well, eggs that disappear without any 'oomph'. After already looking like 1990s 2d sprites on the track, they flatten into your little block collection board, where they also are far harder to see and pay attention to than they were in Audiosurf. Audiosurf had a jolly little animation of the blocks bouncing on contact (with optional sound effect). Similarly, it's hard to tell if you actually collided with an obstacle or not, whereas in Audiosurf it was the most obvious thing in the world. Like with the above example of the audiosprint mode, everything else also lacks weight and impact. This is also what prompted my original negative review of this game.\n\n\nWhat's actually pretty nice is how switching between different input devices is handled. You can start controlling the game with the mouse, and then if you switch to the keyboard in mid-song the game will 'lock' mouse input until you switch back to the mouse. Be aware though that it needs a few seconds to 'unlock' the new input type, so only do this when you can afford to catch a breather and don't need to frantically dodge anything.\n\nP.S.: For some reason, the keyboard controls changed from relative (press left arrow to go left of where you are) to absolute (hold left arrow to be on the left lane). I'm aware this means having to press fewer buttons to get to the opposite side, but still there is no convincing reason not to have the original control scheme available. This probably was changed solely to make the (digital) keyboard controls behave the same as the (analogue) gamepad controls.\n\n\n\nMid-2014 review:\nThis feels like a lazily put together Unity tech demo and doesn't exactly seem to get frequent developer love (see past updates, http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:4622983]/announcements/ , to observe how rare patches are).","July 6, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

But as someone who got used to the gameplay of Audiosurf, Audiosurf 2 is a big downgrade.\n\nFor example, back in Audiosurf you had the ability to hit blocks from the side, which is not possible in Audiosurf 2 and makes a lot of tracks frustratingly difficult to play as you have to hit the blocks with the front of your ship. The hit detection in general is worse than in the first game. Some blocks don't count as hit at all when they're too close together, sometimes blocks just don't count as hit when you're off by a pixel, and the pawns you can use are simply overpowered.\n\nFurthermore, Audiosurf 2 doesn't offer any resolutions that aren't 16:9, making users with 4:3 or 21:9 play in letterboxed or windowed mode. And since the developer's response to such things is basically "f*ck y'all" I don't expect that to change.

It doesn't have as much as the original Audiosurf in terms of official content.  In addition, the leaderboards are set up differently so it scores each mode separately (so those mono players can be happy :D).  Right now, the only official modes are a revamped mono, turbo mono, mono classic (closer to original version), Wakeboard, Wakeboard Grid, Wakeboard Pro, Wakeboard Puzzle, Double Vision, Pusher,  and three currently-in-development concepts that are quite ambitious (but rather unplayable right now, but the concepts behind them are quite odd and extremely different from the original game).  The three experimental modes are called audioschmup (semi-unplayable mode where you try to dodge everything), audiosphere (basically it's a circle where you can rotate 360 degrees that is located in the center of the screen, as opposed to going linearly), and Audiosprint (supports up  to 4 players at once, two buttons per player, buttons go up or down, you try to dodge things).\n\nSadly no Last.fm scrobbling yet, which makes me sad.\n\nOn the other hand though, the community mods and skins are GREAT.  Due to its integration with Steam Workshop, this community has been able to generate so many awesome things for the game.  Those community-made mods include a LOT of old modes that have been remade.  The skins are really nice too, I would advise you don't use the default one for mono, because that one makes dodging greys nearly impossible XD (because they blend in so well and the whole skin is way too complex).\n\nFor people who REALLY enjoy Audiosurf, this should be a definite buy.  For those who enjoy Audiosurf, you should buy this by the time the full version is out.  For those new to audiosurf, both are nice (but this one will get nicer than the original audiosurf as it approaches completion).","July 10, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Audiosurf 2 surpasses the first Audiosurf astonishingly, giving it a new light. The Workshop community keeps Audiosurf 2 alive, while never losing appeal, because you can play at your own leisure, the way YOU want to play. Games like Rock Band have you select a song they allow, while here, the choice is yours. The track-creation time is impressive once loading a song, so you don't have to worry about being bored by loading times. All-in-all, easily a 10/10 game. Only thing you should know is that there are often hard-to-dodge obstacles that might bother gamers who are easily angered--such as myself, because it throws off my "groove."

So far it atleast to me feels better than Audiosurf 1 was . Sure some of the modes may not be making a come back officially, but in audiosurf 2 those modes can be re made ! Among some of the best skins i've used to play this game go from Amazing (Imaginarium) to out right trippy (Rainbowish/Rainbow headache) the developer has put a lot of effort into it. Mono is no longer is tied to just a few points ...still dodging greys is present, but now on some songs you can make over 1-2 milion points x3. Wakeboard mode is fun as well just wish it wouldn't block ya apon things (haven't played the mode in a while) i've came across Mono Nitro which makes the track go even faster and dodging greys even harder.  its a fun mode i give it that i mainly use it cause some of the skins i use makes it look like a rollercoaster (imaginarium) . Every new update brings something else thats cool to the game . when i first got it lol a lot of people were complaining about unlocking everything including myself till i figured out you just needed to use one of the songs included in the game XD. Audiosurf as a whole has been my crack for the longest time i never get bored with it . Audiosurf 2 is making me want to play it more and more. :3 hope when the game officially releases its going to be really awesome! 10/10 ( i recommend this to everyone ... just be weary its still in early development but still its awesome as hell with each update and skin/mode that comes out to the workshop!)","November 15, 2013","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It doesn't have as much as the original Audiosurf in terms of official content.  In addition, the leaderboards are set up differently so it scores each mode separately (so those mono players can be happy :D).  Right now, the only official modes are a revamped mono, turbo mono, mono classic (closer to original version), Wakeboard, Wakeboard Grid, Wakeboard Pro, Wakeboard Puzzle, Double Vision, Pusher,  and three currently-in-development concepts that are quite ambitious (but rather unplayable right now, but the concepts behind them are quite odd and extremely different from the original game).  The three experimental modes are called audioschmup (semi-unplayable mode where you try to dodge everything), audiosphere (basically it's a circle where you can rotate 360 degrees that is located in the center of the screen, as opposed to going linearly), and Audiosprint (supports up  to 4 players at once, two buttons per player, buttons go up or down, you try to dodge things).\n\nSadly no Last.fm scrobbling yet, which makes me sad.\n\nOn the other hand though, the community mods and skins are GREAT.  Due to its integration with Steam Workshop, this community has been able to generate so many awesome things for the game.  Those community-made mods include a LOT of old modes that have been remade.  The skins are really nice too, I would advise you don't use the default one for mono, because that one makes dodging greys nearly impossible XD (because they blend in so well and the whole skin is way too complex).\n\nFor people who REALLY enjoy Audiosurf, this should be a definite buy.  For those who enjoy Audiosurf, you should buy this by the time the full version is out.  For those new to audiosurf, both are nice (but this one will get nicer than the original audiosurf as it approaches completion).","July 10, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Meaning that those with a large music library will get more mileage out of it. Audiosurf 2 might seem a bit lacking on the modes compared to the first one, but many more are available from the steam workshop. Also available are numerous skins also made by the community. Meaning that while gameplay stays the same, the environment can be mixed and matched depending on the song you're playing. Naturally, different songs have different tracks depending on the speed of the song. Though some may catch you off guard being much more intense than you may expect. This does not take away from the experience however, and despite it's simplicity, the enjoyment comes from whatever song you select just as much as the gameplay itself.\n\nIn it's current early access state the game is not fully complete. This means that those who find its price agreeable will find many more options and additions in the future, further increasing it's value for money.\nAll in all, the music based gameplay means that it is best suited to those with a large music library. Those that have enough should purchase Audiosurf 2 and add an extra layer of enjoyment to enjoying their music.","November 28, 2013","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes my old one look short in comparison. Detailed too. Seriously. Again. Back by popular demand, here I am to review AudioSurf 2, post release.\n\nI had to cut this down from about 2000 words. ACK.\n\nFORWORD:\n\nUpon its final release, Nicklous_lingor requested that I update my review, based on the final version of AudioSurf 2. I smiled, queued my download, and patiently awaited my chance to see the final version of the game.\n\nI admit, I hadn't high hopes. In the conclusion to my last review, I despaired over the fact that the game hadn't been updated in quite some time.\n\nI'd like to start here by addressing the most immediate and apparent change: The interface.\n\nINTERFACE:\n\nPreviously, I described the game interface as looking as though it had been built by an amateur web designer. It was clunky, full of scroll bars, and very, very ugly.\n\nNow however, the interface looks and functions a hell of a lot better. It’s now FAR easier to tell what you are doing, and it is no longer clunky and disjointed. Loading screens have been both fixed a fair bit (so that they’re no longer horrible YouTube tutorials badly forced into the interface) and beautified. To summarise: The interface looks pretty now, and would qualify as usable.\n\nI do have one complaint regarding the title screen and menus, and that is their utter silence: I didn’t hear a lick of music or sound whilst picking my songs, and I found that unnerving to say the least.\n\nThere are massive improvements to searching for songs, including the ability to search your own library and online at the same time. This is a gigantic step in the right direction for the AudioSurf 2 team.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay! This time in a little more detail about each type of mode.\n\nGAMEPLAY: MONO\n\nCasual modes have now been added, and I have looked over these in detail – but first I’d like to address the areas of complaint I had in my last review, starting with Mono.\n\nAs much as I hate to hash over old territory, I’ll describe Mono once more: Mono was basically one of the main methods of play on the original AudioSurf, and was easily the most popular mode for competition. I described Mono as having “Not survived” the transition to AudioSurf 2…and it pains me to say that my statement is still true.\n\nMono still has some significant problems: Most of its modes lack any kind of visible consequence for picking up greys/spikes, and greys/spikes can still end up arranged in ways that completely block off pathways. Note placement is still pretty terrible: It’s mapped a little more to the song, but at times you can barely see the connection between the notes and the song itself.\n\nOn the bright side, it no longer feels as if the whole thing has been dramatically slowed down.\n\nNow there are other types of Mono to cover, and this time I intend to hit all of them:\n\nSTEALTH mode. This is very similar to Ninja Mono from the original AudioSurf, but with the note placement of AudioSurf 2, and AudioSurf 2’s useless greys/spikes – however this mode has a visible consequence: A small bit of red text in the corner that reads “You’ve hit * spikes”, and the loss of a score bonus at the end. Unfortunately spikes still occasionally block your whole path, so if you were hoping for the stealth challenge of AudioSurf 1, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nCasual Mode: This is essentially Mono as it was in AudioSurf 1, but once again with AudioSurf 2’s terrible note placement and greys/spikes. I wish I had better news.\n\n…And I do. This is where things go uphill.\n\nGAMEPLAY: WAKEBOARDING\n\nIf you read my last review, you'll remember that one of the big areas of contention for me was Wakeboarding, which I called out for its boring trick system, clunky trick mechanics and terrible controls.\n\nA lot has improved: Song notes are properly placed, and are actually in time with the music. The horrible trick system has been gutted, and now instead of choosing from four tricks using the number keys, you just...jump based on hills in the music.\n\nNo longer must you try to ramp off of the side of the map in some weird way - you just click to jump. Simple as. It's a lot more fun than it was, and fits the music far better than the horrible last version. I actually played it a little just for fun. Somehow, this is the closest thing we have to the original Mono mode.\n\nAnd greys/spikes matter now. Hitting one has the instantly perceivable consequence of lowering your multiplier! You’ll still occasionally get all-blocking stacks of greys/spikes in your way, but luckily enough on this mode you can jump over them.\n\nWakeboarding is now the most playable of the Mono based modes in AudioSurf 2, and it’s note/grey usage is everything that the other Mono modes should be. Go figure.\n\nGAMEPLAY: PUZZLE MODES\n\nThere’s…actually not much to write here. Puzzle modes are still inherently good-because for the most part they’re ripped straight from the original AudioSurf. There is the addition of casual mode, which is pretty much Pointman, but without consequences for overfilling. There isn’t much more I can say about this.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAt the end of my previous review, I stated “With some serious polishing and revisions, this could be a brilliant game.” I was completely serious, and I feel as though the developers have listened. If this isn’t a serious polish, I don’t know what is.\n\nBut in the end, 90% of the gameplay in this version can still be found in the original game. This is heart-wrenching for me.\n\nOverall? If you loved AudioSurf for more than just Mono, get this game.\nIf you’ve got a hunger for new mods/modes, get this game.\nIf you want to ramp up gigantic watery hills and do flips to your favourite songs, get this game.\n\nIf you’re still worried about Mono: I recommend you steer clear: This game may upset you far more than it rewards you.

It doesn't have as much as the original Audiosurf in terms of official content.  In addition, the leaderboards are set up differently so it scores each mode separately (so those mono players can be happy :D).  Right now, the only official modes are a revamped mono, turbo mono, mono classic (closer to original version), Wakeboard, Wakeboard Grid, Wakeboard Pro, Wakeboard Puzzle, Double Vision, Pusher,  and three currently-in-development concepts that are quite ambitious (but rather unplayable right now, but the concepts behind them are quite odd and extremely different from the original game).  The three experimental modes are called audioschmup (semi-unplayable mode where you try to dodge everything), audiosphere (basically it's a circle where you can rotate 360 degrees that is located in the center of the screen, as opposed to going linearly), and Audiosprint (supports up  to 4 players at once, two buttons per player, buttons go up or down, you try to dodge things).\n\nSadly no Last.fm scrobbling yet, which makes me sad.\n\nOn the other hand though, the community mods and skins are GREAT.  Due to its integration with Steam Workshop, this community has been able to generate so many awesome things for the game.  Those community-made mods include a LOT of old modes that have been remade.  The skins are really nice too, I would advise you don't use the default one for mono, because that one makes dodging greys nearly impossible XD (because they blend in so well and the whole skin is way too complex).\n\nFor people who REALLY enjoy Audiosurf, this should be a definite buy.  For those who enjoy Audiosurf, you should buy this by the time the full version is out.  For those new to audiosurf, both are nice (but this one will get nicer than the original audiosurf as it approaches completion).","July 10, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Through the Steam Workshop you can add new skins and gamemodes which keeps the game from becoming stale. It also includes bumped up visuals and music that seem to be detected and synced up to a greater degree compared to the first Audiosurf. Still buggy but that's to be expected. Definitely worth the money if you enjoyed the first Audiosurf!\n\nPost release edit:\nWow! I haven't picked up Audiosurf in a couple months and saw that it left early access so I had to get back to riding the waves. What a HUGE improvement all around. The UI is more fluid and easier to navigate through. The "matchmaking" was around during early access, but seeing it with more users playing shows how it shines through at allowing you to "actively" compete against others on the leaderboard. It'll update the score compared to the highest and lowest scored user in comparison to your score during the song. It was a long wait, but definitely worth it!","December 18, 2013","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes my old one look short in comparison. Detailed too. Seriously. Again. Back by popular demand, here I am to review AudioSurf 2, post release.\n\nI had to cut this down from about 2000 words. ACK.\n\nFORWORD:\n\nUpon its final release, Nicklous_lingor requested that I update my review, based on the final version of AudioSurf 2. I smiled, queued my download, and patiently awaited my chance to see the final version of the game.\n\nI admit, I hadn't high hopes. In the conclusion to my last review, I despaired over the fact that the game hadn't been updated in quite some time.\n\nI'd like to start here by addressing the most immediate and apparent change: The interface.\n\nINTERFACE:\n\nPreviously, I described the game interface as looking as though it had been built by an amateur web designer. It was clunky, full of scroll bars, and very, very ugly.\n\nNow however, the interface looks and functions a hell of a lot better. It’s now FAR easier to tell what you are doing, and it is no longer clunky and disjointed. Loading screens have been both fixed a fair bit (so that they’re no longer horrible YouTube tutorials badly forced into the interface) and beautified. To summarise: The interface looks pretty now, and would qualify as usable.\n\nI do have one complaint regarding the title screen and menus, and that is their utter silence: I didn’t hear a lick of music or sound whilst picking my songs, and I found that unnerving to say the least.\n\nThere are massive improvements to searching for songs, including the ability to search your own library and online at the same time. This is a gigantic step in the right direction for the AudioSurf 2 team.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay! This time in a little more detail about each type of mode.\n\nGAMEPLAY: MONO\n\nCasual modes have now been added, and I have looked over these in detail – but first I’d like to address the areas of complaint I had in my last review, starting with Mono.\n\nAs much as I hate to hash over old territory, I’ll describe Mono once more: Mono was basically one of the main methods of play on the original AudioSurf, and was easily the most popular mode for competition. I described Mono as having “Not survived” the transition to AudioSurf 2…and it pains me to say that my statement is still true.\n\nMono still has some significant problems: Most of its modes lack any kind of visible consequence for picking up greys/spikes, and greys/spikes can still end up arranged in ways that completely block off pathways. Note placement is still pretty terrible: It’s mapped a little more to the song, but at times you can barely see the connection between the notes and the song itself.\n\nOn the bright side, it no longer feels as if the whole thing has been dramatically slowed down.\n\nNow there are other types of Mono to cover, and this time I intend to hit all of them:\n\nSTEALTH mode. This is very similar to Ninja Mono from the original AudioSurf, but with the note placement of AudioSurf 2, and AudioSurf 2’s useless greys/spikes – however this mode has a visible consequence: A small bit of red text in the corner that reads “You’ve hit * spikes”, and the loss of a score bonus at the end. Unfortunately spikes still occasionally block your whole path, so if you were hoping for the stealth challenge of AudioSurf 1, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nCasual Mode: This is essentially Mono as it was in AudioSurf 1, but once again with AudioSurf 2’s terrible note placement and greys/spikes. I wish I had better news.\n\n…And I do. This is where things go uphill.\n\nGAMEPLAY: WAKEBOARDING\n\nIf you read my last review, you'll remember that one of the big areas of contention for me was Wakeboarding, which I called out for its boring trick system, clunky trick mechanics and terrible controls.\n\nA lot has improved: Song notes are properly placed, and are actually in time with the music. The horrible trick system has been gutted, and now instead of choosing from four tricks using the number keys, you just...jump based on hills in the music.\n\nNo longer must you try to ramp off of the side of the map in some weird way - you just click to jump. Simple as. It's a lot more fun than it was, and fits the music far better than the horrible last version. I actually played it a little just for fun. Somehow, this is the closest thing we have to the original Mono mode.\n\nAnd greys/spikes matter now. Hitting one has the instantly perceivable consequence of lowering your multiplier! You’ll still occasionally get all-blocking stacks of greys/spikes in your way, but luckily enough on this mode you can jump over them.\n\nWakeboarding is now the most playable of the Mono based modes in AudioSurf 2, and it’s note/grey usage is everything that the other Mono modes should be. Go figure.\n\nGAMEPLAY: PUZZLE MODES\n\nThere’s…actually not much to write here. Puzzle modes are still inherently good-because for the most part they’re ripped straight from the original AudioSurf. There is the addition of casual mode, which is pretty much Pointman, but without consequences for overfilling. There isn’t much more I can say about this.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAt the end of my previous review, I stated “With some serious polishing and revisions, this could be a brilliant game.” I was completely serious, and I feel as though the developers have listened. If this isn’t a serious polish, I don’t know what is.\n\nBut in the end, 90% of the gameplay in this version can still be found in the original game. This is heart-wrenching for me.\n\nOverall? If you loved AudioSurf for more than just Mono, get this game.\nIf you’ve got a hunger for new mods/modes, get this game.\nIf you want to ramp up gigantic watery hills and do flips to your favourite songs, get this game.\n\nIf you’re still worried about Mono: I recommend you steer clear: This game may upset you far more than it rewards you. Stick with the original this version has been fixed.\n\nIf you ever want to see a copy of my old pre-release review to see just how much has changed, or the full version of this review, send me a message. I’ll gladly link it to you.\n","June 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

When I say the music is better, I mean it is much easier to find your own music or others through the soundcloud search feature. The scoreboard is much better as well and the interface is much more sleek and less jumbled like in Audiosurf 1. It would be nice if you could hit play with something other than the mouse like the spacebar or enter. I find myself hitting restart and then having to change my positioning on the keys to hit play to restart the song. I feel like this version is far improved upon the past game and I feel like it was well worth it. The workshop and the developer's own improvements make this game shine imo. The negative reviews of this game really started to turn me off in the beginning with rampart reports of bugs and no improvement from the original Audiosurf. After playing though, I feel like those reviews missed the mark and far over-exaggerated the issues this game has.","June 28, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes my old one look short in comparison. Detailed too. Seriously. Again. Back by popular demand, here I am to review AudioSurf 2, post release.\n\nI had to cut this down from about 2000 words. ACK.\n\nFORWORD:\n\nUpon its final release, Nicklous_lingor requested that I update my review, based on the final version of AudioSurf 2. I smiled, queued my download, and patiently awaited my chance to see the final version of the game.\n\nI admit, I hadn't high hopes. In the conclusion to my last review, I despaired over the fact that the game hadn't been updated in quite some time.\n\nI'd like to start here by addressing the most immediate and apparent change: The interface.\n\nINTERFACE:\n\nPreviously, I described the game interface as looking as though it had been built by an amateur web designer. It was clunky, full of scroll bars, and very, very ugly.\n\nNow however, the interface looks and functions a hell of a lot better. It’s now FAR easier to tell what you are doing, and it is no longer clunky and disjointed. Loading screens have been both fixed a fair bit (so that they’re no longer horrible YouTube tutorials badly forced into the interface) and beautified. To summarise: The interface looks pretty now, and would qualify as usable.\n\nI do have one complaint regarding the title screen and menus, and that is their utter silence: I didn’t hear a lick of music or sound whilst picking my songs, and I found that unnerving to say the least.\n\nThere are massive improvements to searching for songs, including the ability to search your own library and online at the same time. This is a gigantic step in the right direction for the AudioSurf 2 team.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay! This time in a little more detail about each type of mode.\n\nGAMEPLAY: MONO\n\nCasual modes have now been added, and I have looked over these in detail – but first I’d like to address the areas of complaint I had in my last review, starting with Mono.\n\nAs much as I hate to hash over old territory, I’ll describe Mono once more: Mono was basically one of the main methods of play on the original AudioSurf, and was easily the most popular mode for competition. I described Mono as having “Not survived” the transition to AudioSurf 2…and it pains me to say that my statement is still true.\n\nMono still has some significant problems: Most of its modes lack any kind of visible consequence for picking up greys/spikes, and greys/spikes can still end up arranged in ways that completely block off pathways. Note placement is still pretty terrible: It’s mapped a little more to the song, but at times you can barely see the connection between the notes and the song itself.\n\nOn the bright side, it no longer feels as if the whole thing has been dramatically slowed down.\n\nNow there are other types of Mono to cover, and this time I intend to hit all of them:\n\nSTEALTH mode. This is very similar to Ninja Mono from the original AudioSurf, but with the note placement of AudioSurf 2, and AudioSurf 2’s useless greys/spikes – however this mode has a visible consequence: A small bit of red text in the corner that reads “You’ve hit * spikes”, and the loss of a score bonus at the end. Unfortunately spikes still occasionally block your whole path, so if you were hoping for the stealth challenge of AudioSurf 1, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nCasual Mode: This is essentially Mono as it was in AudioSurf 1, but once again with AudioSurf 2’s terrible note placement and greys/spikes. I wish I had better news.\n\n…And I do. This is where things go uphill.\n\nGAMEPLAY: WAKEBOARDING\n\nIf you read my last review, you'll remember that one of the big areas of contention for me was Wakeboarding, which I called out for its boring trick system, clunky trick mechanics and terrible controls.\n\nA lot has improved: Song notes are properly placed, and are actually in time with the music. The horrible trick system has been gutted, and now instead of choosing from four tricks using the number keys, you just...jump based on hills in the music.\n\nNo longer must you try to ramp off of the side of the map in some weird way - you just click to jump. Simple as. It's a lot more fun than it was, and fits the music far better than the horrible last version. I actually played it a little just for fun. Somehow, this is the closest thing we have to the original Mono mode.\n\nAnd greys/spikes matter now. Hitting one has the instantly perceivable consequence of lowering your multiplier! You’ll still occasionally get all-blocking stacks of greys/spikes in your way, but luckily enough on this mode you can jump over them.\n\nWakeboarding is now the most playable of the Mono based modes in AudioSurf 2, and it’s note/grey usage is everything that the other Mono modes should be. Go figure.\n\nGAMEPLAY: PUZZLE MODES\n\nThere’s…actually not much to write here. Puzzle modes are still inherently good-because for the most part they’re ripped straight from the original AudioSurf. There is the addition of casual mode, which is pretty much Pointman, but without consequences for overfilling. There isn’t much more I can say about this.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAt the end of my previous review, I stated “With some serious polishing and revisions, this could be a brilliant game.” I was completely serious, and I feel as though the developers have listened. If this isn’t a serious polish, I don’t know what is.\n\nBut in the end, 90% of the gameplay in this version can still be found in the original game. This is heart-wrenching for me.\n\nOverall? If you loved AudioSurf for more than just Mono, get this game.\nIf you’ve got a hunger for new mods/modes, get this game.\nIf you want to ramp up gigantic watery hills and do flips to your favourite songs, get this game.\n\nIf you’re still worried about Mono: I recommend you steer clear: This game may upset you far more than it rewards you. Stick with the original this version has been fixed.\n\nIf you ever want to see a copy of my old pre-release review to see just how much has changed, or the full version of this review, send me a message. I’ll gladly link it to you.\n","June 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

It doesn't seem like much on the surface but once you get into it, it is great.  This game allows for a new discovery of the music you already own and allows you to discover new songs using soundcloud.  Having access to the Steam Workshop makes this game even better.  By default, the skins available are kinda cool but not that great but since downloading skins from the workshop, it is like a whole new game.  People have also modded new gamemodes so there are lots of modes you can do as well.  Overall, this game is awesome.  10/10 seriously.\n\n\nNow for a longer review...\n\nDo you have a large music library full of great songs that you just don't listen to anymore?  Then get Audiosurf 2.  Do you have music that you never listen to because games have their own music or because you just never feel like only listening to music?  Then get Audiosurf 2.  Do you just like music in general or games that use music?  Then get Audiosurf 2.\n\nSince I upgraded to Audiosurf 2 from Audiosurf, I have enjoyed this game immensely.  As I stated above, it is a game that can help you learn of new songs and rediscover old songs.  This game can make almost any song more fun, more worthwhile to listen to because the game itself compliments the music.  The tracks are created in such a way that while playing you can understand why the blocks are where they are and how to play the game better using this information.  The game even allows you to play songs that are not in your library with the use of Soundcloud.  You can search for and find many songs that are interesting and fun to listen to and to play.\n\nOne big question I imagine many people have is whether Audiosurf 2 is worth the $15 and worth getting over Audiosurf 1.  In my opinion, yes.  I paid $15 for the game and have about 2.5 hours in the game and I already feel that I have gotten my money's worth in fun.\n\nAudiosurf 2, in my opinion, is also better than Audiosurf 1 and quite a bit as well.  Why? Soundcloud and the Steam Workshop.  Soundcloud I already mentioned and the Steam Workshop practically makes this game.  The modded gamemodes I haven't used much other than freeride (hit all blocks.  More exciting in my opinion than mono mode) but the skins on the Steam Workshop are incredible.  The modders have made the game so much more exciting and interesting and fun and crazy which just adds to the overall quality to the game.  The skins also don't change anything other than looks so it is still the exact same game but you might have sound bars on the side, more flashing colors, or different looking blocks and ships.  Audiosurf 2 also seems to put the blocks in at better places and has better performance than Audiosurf 1, so that is also a big plus.\n\nAll in all, this game is great.  It makes music come alive in a fun way and is created using your music, not pre-picked music like in Rock Band or Guitar Hero.  The visuals are stunning and exciting, and the game makes listening to your music feel almost like a party.  You could also stream it through steam or twitch and have some friends watch so you can feel like you are the DJ at a party but with the most insane light show in existance.  It is just so much fun.\n\nI recommend this game 100% if you are a music fan.  Even if you were before but you are not so big into music now, this might help you get into music again.  I know it did that for me.  10/10 would DJ again.\n\n(sorry for the long review, I had a lot to say)","August 27, 2015","true","58.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thom_cat/recommended/235800/","thom_cat","Thomcat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thom_cat/","403 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've played over 135hrs of the original Audiosurf, I'm a mono player and look for complexity and speed in tracks.\neg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BmQbm-bh0\nI've tried getting into this, I really have, but it's just not the same.\n\nThe following is of course my personal opinion, but I'm sure many players who shared similar attachment to the first game will  have similar misgivings.\n\nDefault mono feels slow, and it feels lame. I actually like the abundance of coloured tiles, but the way they are structured around large swathes of 'grey' tiles is really annoying at times. Seeing a coloured block in an impassable location, or multiple blocks on different routes just makes me frustrated.\nThere are currently a lot of problems with tiny elements and interactions that feel wrong throughout the game. The pre-hit bounce that tiles have only serves to confuse the player, hit-detection feeling way too late (or far back) sometimes. I can't be certain whether it's the skins or the camera angle or the bounce, but it's frustrating.\nThe lack of solidity and punishment that the new grey blocks have and it leaves me feeling jaded. They feel so inconsequencial that on most skins you can be unaware that you have even collided with them, you can slide through a solid wall of them without a care in the world.\nThe default skins are overly shiny. Not in the consistent neon way that the original had, but the overwhelming, uncoherent kind. There are uneeded ugly white highlights on most of the tiles, some skins replace the grey blocks with random waveform shapes, others with ugly spheres. If you're a fan or readability do not play on the Stadium skin, it was so confusing and unplayable I almost gouged my eyes out.\n\nSo, the default mono felt inconsequencial and slow, so after one song I unlocked turbo mono or whatever it's called, and this left me feeling even worse. I tried several songs, the first was beat-based and on every beat the character would be teleported a good portion down the track; not moved, teleported. The speed was so ridiculous on every beat that you'd have to line up everything beforehand and take wild swipes to try to hit something during the teleport. Hitting every block in an irregular pattern during a beat was actually impossible.\nSo I tried another song, and it started really well, the song was a pleasant speed for me, the complexity reasonable, but oh no, then the song actually kicks in and I'm thrust down the track faster than I can actually comprehend patterns, let alone move the mouse. If I saw someone actually hitting every block down that track I would declare them the Messiah. Anyway, needless to say being unable to actually move the mouse side to side at the rate the blocks were coming down the track made the gamemode quickly unbearable.\nThe guide for this mode reccomends choosing a slow song if you want to get stealth - alone. It's a sign of a non-functioning mode when you can't actually physically play the songs you listen to.\nThere is currently no mid-ground.\n\nI am actually fond of the Hyperdrive 2 skin, it's a gorgeous barrage of colour whilst still being playable, props to the two who made it.\n\nBut yeah, wrapping up, I am not fond of the direction this game has taken, I'm sure it'll get better throughout the rest of development, and there are many excusable things relating to its alpha state (like GUI and lack of modes, etc,) but currently it's way away from what I was looking for. I'll continue to come back to it and perhaps open mono turbo to try some snail-paced songs, but overall I'm going to stick with the original for now.","June 6, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have played the first you know exactly what to expect here as it is a very “more of the same” sequel. You still have Mono mode where the goal is to simply collect blocks and avoid the gray ones while you also have four characters that require you to match blocks up to their respective colors. You have two new modes introduced to this sequel, qne is called Wakeboarding, a mode very similar to Mono but you now have the option to jump which can be used to avoid certain blocks or to pull off tricks. The other is called AudioSprint which plays like a game from the Runner genre in which you try to dodge obstacles via sliding or jumping while being unable to lower your speed or stop. It is an interesting change of pace from the usual brick collecting and one that can be played with three other players via local multiplayer.\n\nSoundcloud has been added and allows you to search up plenty of music even if you have none on your PC which is a great feature. One thing that has seen a very big improvement from the original Audiosurf is the track generation for the slower placed songs and genre which flow much better with the pace of the song. Leaderboards are back and unlike the original you no longer have to sign up for a separate account to compete as it uses your Steam profile instead which was one of the things that bugged me most about the original. What really adds a lot of value and longevity to Audiosurf 2 is the community itself. This is a very mod friendly title in where you can create your own modes and skins to make some really neat stuff such as a Sonic theme, fling a plane to collect more fuel and even a Shmup created by your music.\n\nThe new modes, better graphics, Soundcloud and even the mods themselves don't necessarily make this sequel a must have for those that already own the original. When it comes down to it, it is bigger, better and more content filled than it ever was before yet it's still the same familiar gameplay. There is nothing wrong with that but it does make it a bit of a hard bargain to buy a new game to do essentially the same thing. In a rather rare move for a game on the PC there is a demo available to actually see for yourself if this game is worth your purchase beforehand which is rather awesome of them. For those new to the series this is definitely the one to get however, as this is without a doubt the superior title and a must have for those seeking a fun, competitive rhythm game.","May 30","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The addition of steamworks support for both mods and skins is also good.\nHowever I can't fully recommend the game because of the UI. The UI is honestly awfully designed and looks like a wannabe preppy Apple interface, and is in dire need of a revamp.\n\nTaking it from the top:\nNow the main menu is possibly the only decent part but the lack of an obvious play button is irritating when you are getting into the game for the first time as you spend time hunting where you need to click to actually start.\n\nThe music selection window is on the other hand the worst part. If you want to browse for your own tracks you have to deal with it being a tiny very cluttered window next by the Soundcloud "Popular" tracks option. Even then most of that space is taken up by folder names display which leaves an even smaller part for the actual tracks you are looking for, All this could've honestly been fixed if the Browse music option was its own separate tab instead of locking the large windows functionality to pretty much "Audiosurf Top 10 hits".\n\nThere is no way to preview the track once it has been selected without having to actually start it. I would like for a way to actually see if the track I'm going to play will be an uphill or downhill one. Trying to figure out what kind of track it is based on how the coloured background changes is not good. Especially when the game itself has its own ideas of what todays background colour should be.\n\nThe loading screen looks like a rush job with no proper background and usually the same "How to play" message.\n\nAll in all the terrible UI design drags down a very decent timespender and I hope the devs will actually spend some time to improve it.","June 18, 2015","false","23.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The modes are to whack for me. I like as2's gfx better, but the as1 modes in my opinion are better for a casual ironman mono. That was what i played the most and that is not here, so uninstalled for me a reinstall as1.\n\nI was a die hard as1 fan was even beta tester for it. So could be why i care not for as2. I just can't get into it's modes of play. They are like reversesd versions of audiosurf 1's game modes or atleast for my most played mode. Maybe some one will mod in an ironman mono as1 mode for me one day, but till then I'll stick to as1.\n\nNow as2 does have new modes of play i tried them, but they feel shallow and pointless to me.\n\nWith all this said, an older as1 lover may hate this game, depending what mode they enjoyed in as1. If you was a ironman mono like myself you wont find that here, casusl mode is simular excpt no dodging grays. Instead they help you in as2 with scoring or can. Also in that casual mode there is side lanes not like ironman where had no side lanes. Now ninja feels like ironman mono but not as relaxed  as casual mono ironman in as1 was. AS2 based more on competitive play it seems, if you looking for a competitive feel you'll get that here or will once people start filling up the leaderboards.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy as1 better. I'm sure other people will as well and I'm sure many will enjoy as2 better. All about what you are looking for in this genre of game. 1. Laid back challenge or 2. a more intense competitive feel. as1 for first description of as2 for the 2nd.\n\nIf you are more a #1 type you'll like as1 better.

Tracks feel better now and the subtle randomness everytime you boot up the same song again is a huge plus as it ensures leaderboards don't go stale after someone has managed to figure out the perfect run.\n\nThe addition of Workshop support is wonderful as well, which puts Audiosurf 2 as one of the best visualizer software out there. Being able to get additional game modes means the game will easily remain fresh for a very long time (although arguably it'll never get old if you love music and has a constantly growing collection of music)\n\nAs for cons, the biggest gripe would be the interface, which can use a lot of improvements. Some albums don't get fully detected (only detects up to track 29 of the Elvis 30 #1 Hits album for example). Some weird visual glitches and random CTDs. Not able to change settings in the middle of a song run. Being only able to change the volume level of the sound effects and not the music as well is another miss. I'm sure all of these will be fixed once it gets out of Early Access.\n\nOverall, very promising considering it's still in Early Access. There's nothing quite like playing this in a dark room around the silence of midnight, a drink in one hand and with my pair of Grado headphones for me.","December 31, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything, I repeat, EVERYTHING is improved over the original Audiosurf. The graphics, the gameplay, the FRAMERATE (God I wish every game was optimized like this) just everything! Modding allows users to have different ways to play and different art styles of the graphics to see. Any sound file works so if you have songs downloaded on your computer you can play them right away! If not, there's soundcloud intergration so you can search up whatever you like! I'll admit though, searching up exactly what you want is a little finicky since the in game search engine oddly limits how many results show up. Getting on the leaderboard is tons of fun too, as you can leave a comment to either taunt the lower scores or praise the ones above you. With a new song being highlighted every day there's always something to play.

It was a game I was certain that I wouldn't like, however it slowly became one of my favorite games to play offline/online whenever I needed to just stop and think for a moment(or see if I could dethrone my friends because I'm a jerk like that) With this said, I was very anxious when I first heard the sequel's announcement and made plans to play it instantly.\n\nIs this game better than the original?\nWell, that's a very objective question. What made Audiosurf special is the fact that you aren't bound to any specific soundtrack and can play any song you want as long as it's on your computer. You can also ride the "radio" if you're bored of the same songs and run the risk of getting a new favorite!(One of mine from the original was Bella Ciao)\nAudiosurf 2 allows the same freedom for music, with a bit more variety for playing. There are a few new modes, and it is very easy to use a mod or skin in game, while it is a little harder to find your favorite songs on your computer.\n\nOne negative thing about Audiosurf 2(in my opinion) is that it seems very lenient to the idea of controllers. Rather than moving your little rocket as you tap to the music with your side arrow keys, every time you release an arrow key the rocket goes back to the middle square. This really threw off the skill I had developed playing the first game, so I feel almost like I have to relearn the game entirely. Thankfully, I've pretty much adjusted.\nAnother negative thing is that this game has about the same difficulty of playing mono in the original without "ironmode" on which, needless to say, essentially means that youre basically invincible. Bluntly put, I'm not much of a fan for what they did to mono, and can only really enjoy this game on a mod that(very roughly) imitates the intensity of ninja mono in ironmode.\n\nA great thing about this game is that there is nearly a mod for every one of your interests, and the newer modes such as the air surfing or audiosprint breathe new life into a great game. This game is a lot smoother than the first, much shinier and competition between peers and strangers is much easier and more encouraging than Audiosurf 1. If this is your first time playing and you're curious definitely give it a try; if you're a fan of the original, it'll take some getting used to but this is still a great sequel to the game you know and love.","February 3","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Above all though, the extensive mod support is what makes this game really special - you can download dozens upon dozens of new (and free!) level skins that completely transform the way the game looks. On top of that, there are also user-created gamemodes that add new gameplay mechanics. The replayability of Audiosurf 2 is seemingly endless as a result.

Audiosurf 2 is very much so the same as the first with enhanced visuals and modes, not to mention vastly superior track generation.\n\nThe Mono mode of Audiosurf 2 is definitely the focus, though. It's a large step-up from the original's Mono modes, perhaps this is due to the incomparable quality of the track generation that there is now.\n\nAudiosurf 2 isn't without its own problems, though, just like the original. Audiosurf 2's gameplay is polished, fun and simple as one would hope going into an Audiosurf game but the bland, silent menu and unstable nature of the game when it's loading is somewhat frustrating and holds this otherwise solid title back.\n\nTo elaborate on the aforementioned loading issues, upon looking it up only some people suffer from them. Basically, the game stops responding every time you open the game and every time you load a track. Waiting for about 20 seconds allows it to resolve itself but it's still rather annoying and detracts greatly from the game. This has not happened to me once while actually playing a song, though, so that's great.\n\nA few things also lack polish, unfortunately. For instance, when you finish a track the song itself begins to start anew right at the end before cutting off and taking you to the dead silent post-game score screen.\n\nUltimately, allowing music to play in the menu, bug fixes and overall polish outside of the gameplay itself would allow this title to really shine. If you enjoy rhythm games or if you enjoyed the original Audiosurf you'll enjoy this title as long as you can look past the fairly annoying flaws holding this otherwise great game back. It's worth buying on sale, for sure.","November 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a game I was certain that I wouldn't like, however it slowly became one of my favorite games to play offline/online whenever I needed to just stop and think for a moment(or see if I could dethrone my friends because I'm a jerk like that) With this said, I was very anxious when I first heard the sequel's announcement and made plans to play it instantly.\n\nIs this game better than the original?\nWell, that's a very objective question. What made Audiosurf special is the fact that you aren't bound to any specific soundtrack and can play any song you want as long as it's on your computer. You can also ride the "radio" if you're bored of the same songs and run the risk of getting a new favorite!(One of mine from the original was Bella Ciao)\nAudiosurf 2 allows the same freedom for music, with a bit more variety for playing. There are a few new modes, and it is very easy to use a mod or skin in game, while it is a little harder to find your favorite songs on your computer.\n\nOne negative thing about Audiosurf 2(in my opinion) is that it seems very lenient to the idea of controllers. Rather than moving your little rocket as you tap to the music with your side arrow keys, every time you release an arrow key the rocket goes back to the middle square. This really threw off the skill I had developed playing the first game, so I feel almost like I have to relearn the game entirely. Thankfully, I've pretty much adjusted.\nAnother negative thing is that this game has about the same difficulty of playing mono in the original without "ironmode" on which, needless to say, essentially means that youre basically invincible. Bluntly put, I'm not much of a fan for what they did to mono, and can only really enjoy this game on a mod that(very roughly) imitates the intensity of ninja mono in ironmode.\n\nA great thing about this game is that there is nearly a mod for every one of your interests, and the newer modes such as the air surfing or audiosprint breathe new life into a great game. This game is a lot smoother than the first, much shinier and competition between peers and strangers is much easier and more encouraging than Audiosurf 1. If this is your first time playing and you're curious definitely give it a try; if you're a fan of the original, it'll take some getting used to but this is still a great sequel to the game you know and love.","February 3","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On top of that, there are also user-created gamemodes that add new gameplay mechanics. The replayability of Audiosurf 2 is seemingly endless as a result.

I'm no longer the player I was and was never the very best, but I know what I'm talking about.\n\nThis sequel just feels terrible to play. Direct control is jerky, not at all natural. The perspective combined with the ship design makes it very difficult to tell where the front of your ship is in order to hit or dodge anything. The new animation to show blocks that have matched and will disappear works for mono types - but it makes it near impossible to tell whats matching or not for the puzzle classes.\n\nIt looks a bit prettier, particularly the UI. More importantly, the changes to the puzzle modes to 'standardize' them and make it more consistent for all classes are interesting and make a lot of sense. But none of it is worth it.

I just added in some more specifics on how this game is bad and you shouldn't buy it because I already put it in the comments in response to the developer.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry to say that mono won't change my opinion on this game, especially not as a mod. It may have been (from what I've been told and what I've seen) the most popular mode in AS1 and possibly in AS2, but it takes away the puzzle matching aspect of the game that I love so much.\n\nI started as a mono elite player and played with ninja mono for months, but I got tired of the monotonous (lol) gameplay that it provided. It was boring and I was ready to leave AS1 to gather dust.\n\nBut when a friend of mine showed me the crazy stuff that could be done with eraser and I found Uupis' pointman videos, I never touched mono ever again. I feel that the people who have sat down and took the time to learn the puzzle modes are the ones who stuck by AS1 for as long as they have.\n\nTo elaborate on my issues with AS2, the main problem is that there are no OFFICIAL Elite modes. Going back and playing them again, the "Pro" modes and "Elite" modes from AS1 are so differen't that they almost aren't the same game. I never had much fun with anything below Elite, and while I can understand that some other people may not share that opinion, it seems unncessary and crazy to eliminate the more "hardcore" and dedicated demographic that got most of their fun out of Elite. I remember going at a bit of a scoring fight with a friend of mine years ago, only to have both of our scores eaten alive by Uupis' crazy pointman.\n\nThere are other issues like the block collision being really strange and inconsistent, the visual noise being inconsistent and detracting from the board (though I suppose with mono, nobody really cares), the lack of serious graphical options and tweaks, the implied excuse that if people make mods for a specific game mode, it means that there's no point in making an official one, etc.\n\nI reinstalled AS2 just an hour ago to see if any of my concerns were addressed, and they have not. It's been 5 months.\n\nUnderstand that if the developer released AS2 as just AS1 with the performance and stabliity fixes of AS2, I would have quickly paid double what AS2 is being sold for now. As it stands, I refuse to take this game seriously and I stand by my statement that this is either a cash grab or the developer being mislead by what fanbase you should be prioritizing. Where I endlessly praised AS1, I will endlessly criticize AS2.\n\n---\n\na huge disappointment and i'm ashamed of myself for not researching more on what this game had to offer after coming out of early access before i bought it.  audiosurf 2 is a bad game in a vacuum and is a flat out abomination when compared to audiosurf 1.\n\nwhile the original may have had performance issues and ugly menus, it had great gameplay.  and it was fun.  do you remember when we played games for fun?\n\nsequels are supposed to improve upon the original, not completely break it.  the gameplay is atrocious, the game has actually REMOVED features (...), and the best part is that ALL THE DEVELOPER HAD TO DO WAS COPY THE ORIGINAL'S GAMEPLAY AND FIX THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES.\n\nthe developer of this mess is asking for more money for a worse game.  don't buy it, don't demo it, don't give it any attention.  either force the developer to get his act together or let it die.  don't make the mistake i made.","June 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

The UI is very buggy: can't access music without restarting often, awkward scroll bars that seem to have a low upper limit to how many items can be displayed, typos, etc.\n2.) Game modes are still limited in difficulty range.  The new modes are not particularly exciting.\n3.) The 3x and 4x multiplier mechanic is distracting and useless.  Honestly I wish I could turn that off.\n4.) The twists and turns of the tracks are far more predictable compared to the original.\n\nHonestly, this feels mostly like a re-skin of the original but possibly worse.

I never played AS1, so I wasn't aware of what I was getting into.\n\nFor a while, I played the mono mode, and I was liking the game.  However, as more people started to play, and the leaderboard started to have more result, I noticed that there was something wrong in the way that I played.

And AS2 looked a lot like it could have been this game, but seems they overlooked a very simple thing.\n\nI would highly recommend the game if it had a mono mode with no puzzles and varying level of difficulty (like easy, normal, hard, extreme) or difficulty based on the song itself, as in Drive Any Track.\n\nIf you liked AS1 and its puzzle mode, then I guess you will also like AS2.

It looks nice, you can nearly play every song and even if you play songs over and over it never gets boring.\nI do have a problewm though. I bought this game today and in the beginning everything was fine, but because i don't play games but I live games, I played this a lot. Suddenly, it crashed. Weird, but i just started up over and it looked good. Then it began crashing more and more as I took songs either from my own downloads or after browsing songs. After a few times of restarting my computer it still doesn't seem to go well. Now, I can play maybe 1 song before it crashes at the second one I play. Anyone have a solution or does it have yet to come?","June 8, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I hesitated before purchasing audiosurf2....But I am not disapointed at all.\nlotd of improvements there; more game modes, mroe skins. More things to do.  Being a fan of rythm & music game genre.\nI 'd really recommend this game which is more than a simple basic music visualizer and pretty entertaining while listening to music. The sense of speed , the rythm of the differents tracks the ability to browse through soundcloud is a plus.\n\n","June 3, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Have a look at Drive Any Track in that case.\n\nI purchased AS2 not long after it got to early access.  I never played AS1, so I wasn't aware of what I was getting into.\n\nFor a while, I played the mono mode, and I was liking the game.  However, as more people started to play, and the leaderboard started to have more result, I noticed that there was something wrong in the way that I played.  I was trying to go for perfect runs, as in the tap tap revenge games that I played a lot before on the iphone, and hitting only the colored blobs and dodging the spikes.   I wasn't awaare that you needed to play a puzzle while surfing.\n\nWhat a let down it was.  I'm not a puzzle gamers, and have no puzzle games in my library.. so I hoped all along EA that a mode with no puzzle would appear in AS2.  It never did.  Final is here, a new casual mode appeared, but still contains a puzzle grid.  In fact, I can hardly tell the difference between casual and mono.\n\nAnd asking for such a mode in the forums seems like too much to ask.  Seems like AS2 want to appeal to the snob and elitist crowd, and ditch casuals.\n\nI still appreciate leaderboards in game, and like to compete, but I don't find any fun in matching a puzzle while surfing to my music, it just have 0 appeal for me.\n\nAll I wanted all these years since tap tap is gone, is a game similar to it on the pc.  And AS2 looked a lot like it could have been this game, but seems they overlooked a very simple thing.\n\nI would highly recommend the game if it had a mono mode with no puzzles and varying level of difficulty (like easy, normal, hard, extreme) or difficulty based on the song itself, as in Drive Any Track.\n\nIf you liked AS1 and its puzzle mode, then I guess you will also like AS2.  But if you are in my boat, you should look elsewhere.","May 29, 2015","false","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's the successor to the first Audiosurf... with a TON of options at your disposal. Puzzle modes, match-colors mode, even a sprinter mode... all wraped up in one inexpensive package. Like the first game, the levels are generated by your own music... owned, or even made-up music; it all gets logged to the highscore tables. Graphically, I have to admit it's very diverse. The default "track skins" are interesting enough, but the real joy is in seeing the skins created by the community as a whole. Hell, someone even thought to bring one of the best aspects of BIONICLE (IE: The Lava-surfing) into this game, and created a Takua-themed skin based upon that feature. Someone even remembered the old Slizers (AKA: Throwbots) from back in the day. There's a skin to suit anyone's tastes in here.\n\n=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=\n*Tons of game modes, from puzzle to run-or-die modes\n*Leaderboards for every type of music in existence\n*Casual-esque game (Good if played in short bursts or with friends)\n*Creative modding community\n\n=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=\n*Casual-esque game\n\n=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=\nI give this game a 7/10\nI give this game a [LAVA SURFBOARD]","October 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The look and feel of the game seems more mature and the addition of album art when you select a song is a nice touch. By far the best part is the custom mods/skins; I think I saw a Tardis mod for this game, it looked awesome! So far I have been using 'classic neon'. Also if the first audiosurf wasn't fast enough on Ninja Mono, then this game makes up for it with turbo mono, which is basically Ninja Mono on steroids; it's insanely fast!\nThe game also gives you a leaderboard at the right hand corner of the screen as you play a song, not unlike something you would find in a racing game.\nOh yeah, another thing, THE COLOURS! SO MANY COLOURS!\n\nOverall it's the same game, but with better graphics, more attention to detail and community content which the previous game needed.","March 23, 2014","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So if you incounter any other bugs report to the devs so they can fix them ;).\n\nUI:\nThe dethrone and chalange segmant is great for competitive players and the popular songs sektions help finding songs easely. The menu works great with a Xbox controler althow keyboard and mouse are still my preference.\n\nGraphics:\nFor me the graphics are one of the most importante parts of a game. And AS2 nails it. Even on max settings my lame (and I mean 2gb ram, 1gb graph card, duo core thet berely runs Minecraft) PC Runs the game smoothely with most skins.\n\nLifespam:\nBecouse this game has Steam workshop support it may aswell live forever (hopefully).\n\nTo sum up. The game at this state is worth buying. Great performance with nice graphics and gameplay that will grow in the future if new great players join and help the development by sending theyr feedback and making new content.\nAnd be patient people Dylan allways comes back :)","May 4, 2015","true","78.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Leaderboards are better, there is full mod support and some more game modes, which is good. The ability to just let the computer fly the tracks and use the game basically as visualizer in the background is pretty nice.\nThe new skins are also sweet, though I still prefer the classic one that changes colours with the intensity of the track and speed of the ship.\nGamemodes.. well, the original still is the best. Wave riding is a cute idea but soaring through the air takes you right out of the flow.\n\nBugbear: The blocks on your track are randomized now, so you can get screwed pretty hard by their placement.\nAND the game still runs on an engine from hell where I had to turn the graphics almost all the way down to get a smooth 60 FPS, which is kinda mandatory for a game like this. One setting higher and it breaks down to an unplayable 15-28 FPS.\n\nOther than that ... the game is still great. Riding music is just friggin cool!\n\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you're new to surfing your music - get Audiosurf 2.\nIf you already own Audiosurf, you don't really need the sequel,","November 11, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would be nice to tone down the gfx a little bit and make it more like Audiosurf 1 and be able to play it like Audiosurf 1 with the points for avoiding grey blocks and points for every 3 colored etc. Like a classic game mode.\n2. When it comes to songs that are 176 bpm and above the game seems to lag and have a hard time keeping up. Maybe when it was made the higher bpm weren't taken into consideration?\n\nAnyway, I've played this 6 hours straight after getting it and almost another 4 without tiring of it so that is a huge plus.

It plays pretty much just like AS1's Mono Pro mode. That's good, because the new version that replaced it isn't all that great. It totally changes the way it's scored and feels more like I'm riding a track with my song than actually riding the song. There's too much emphasis in the new mode of getting the grid the fullest to get the highest score/combo. Some songs I play "work" for it, others don't.\n\nThe mod support helps greatly, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it for fans of the original's Mono Pro mode. I played that mode exclusively and was upset to find how much it was changed. There's also a lack of "Ironmode" which made all modes more challenging.\n\nOnly other mode I have tred is Audiosprint mode. It kind of reminds me of Melody's Escape in a way. I'll be trying the new Ninja mode and the Wakeboard mode soon to see how they are and update.\n\nI tried a few songs I love to play on Mono Pro in AS1 in Mono Classic on AS2. It seems like the algorithm for the tracks have improved slightly. I play mostly metal (Viking, Death, Melodic Death, Folk, Thrash, Heavy) and some techno,punk,country, and classical. Pretty much about anything. Songs were insanely fun on AS1 and so far, a lot of them are great on this too.\n\nEnjoyable game so far, it's an improvement in some ways.

This is twice as good.\nI've had Audiosurf 2 since early access, and boy, has this game changed for the better. It lacked polish, glitched the menus, failed to load songs and was a mess to navigate. But the core gameplay was always something special. And now, it really does feel like a product.\n\nWould I recommend Audiosurf to you? Hm. If you enjoy music/rhythm based games and are looking for something casual to play, I think you would enjoy this. It takes songs directly from your music library and generates maps to play on, and you can compare your scores for the same song vs players all over the world. So there's a touch of competitiveness there if you so desire it. Some of the newer game modes are certainly challenging and maxing out points is quite difficult, requiring multiple tries.\n\nThe visuals of this game are really gorgeous, and there are hundreds of skins out there for you to try and cater to your tastes.\n\nIn a nutshell, what makes Audiosurf so good, is the fact that it lets you enjoy your favourite music and let you dance to its tunes using your mouse and keyboard, with a lot of pretty graphics.

The visuals are downright ugly, the user interface is not as intuitive, and the lack of gameplay modes is downright upsetting. However, the ability to play tracks off of Soundcloud and the larger repository of available tracks does give the game some value. For these reasons alone, I will recommend the game. If you have a very large library of music and no need to find songs to play from Soundcloud, then I would recommend Audiosurf 1 instead.","October 30, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is twice as good.\nI've had Audiosurf 2 since early access, and boy, has this game changed for the better. It lacked polish, glitched the menus, failed to load songs and was a mess to navigate. But the core gameplay was always something special. And now, it really does feel like a product.\n\nWould I recommend Audiosurf to you? Hm. If you enjoy music/rhythm based games and are looking for something casual to play, I think you would enjoy this. It takes songs directly from your music library and generates maps to play on, and you can compare your scores for the same song vs players all over the world. So there's a touch of competitiveness there if you so desire it. Some of the newer game modes are certainly challenging and maxing out points is quite difficult, requiring multiple tries.\n\nThe visuals of this game are really gorgeous, and there are hundreds of skins out there for you to try and cater to your tastes.\n\nIn a nutshell, what makes Audiosurf so good, is the fact that it lets you enjoy your favourite music and let you dance to its tunes using your mouse and keyboard, with a lot of pretty graphics. At least give the demo a try.","October 30, 2015","true","53.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the vein of games such as Vib Ribbon for the original Playstation (which is now available as a Classic title on PSN) this is a challenging game in which you can use YOUR OWN MUSIC! Admittedly, that right there was one of the biggest draws for me. Now I can play everything from my obscure video game soundtracks to my entire Jrock collection in a colorful, addictive game!\n\nI know a lot of people say this game is an "epilepsy test" with all the flashy lights and bright colors, but I just say to them that they should play the Dusk skin, which instead has you in a car on a highway dodging other cars. This is also great for those who suffer migraines brought on by visual strain - such as myself. I was only able to play a few rounds of the more colorful skins before I had to switch to give my eyes a rest, so I'm very appreciative that an option such as this was included in the game.\n\nAs a side note: I also recommend getting the visualizer mod for those who miss the old Windows Media Player visualizations. That way you can just listen to your favorite tunes and gaze at the pretty colors all you want.","October 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Audiosurf 2 really is a rythem game at it's most basic, although in this case, that is not a bad thing. There is no objective, just pick a song and play, and that's really it. This is where the game falls flat, there just isn't a whole lot to do. The gamemodes are varied, which is nice, but there aren't multiple vehicles like in the first game which is a little disapointing. Mods are a definate must if you want to keep the game alive and interesting. Another problem is that the main menu seems downright broken at times. The character limit can be a real pain at times when it comes to searching for songs, not only that but somethimes you just can't find the song you are looking for, which is incredibly frustrating. So in the end Audiosurf 2 is a fun little timewaster, but with little variety and flaws that really do ruin the games enjoyment at times, it's nothing more. If it's on sale and you like rythem games, pick it up, otherwise, skip this title.","February 7","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There have been some changes though, and not all of them are good.\n\nGOOD ASPECTS\n\nThe changes to the graphics is really nice, as the limited options in the first game got a bit stale after a while.\n\nI love audiosprint, which is something that I wasn't even aware of until I opened the game up. It's a whole new experience ccompared to the regular game, and that is a very good thing.\n\nApparently the UI used to be terrible and was changed- the current one is quite good, making it possible to swap between modes and skins without being clunky.\n\n\nBAD ASPECTS\n\nWakeboard. This is the ultimate in an idea that sounds good but really doesn't work in practice. I can't see myself using it.\n\nDifferent skins seem to all have their own scoreboards. This is incredibly disappointing. I can understand mods that can affect how the game works doing this, but why skins as well? Maybe it will be changed when the game eventually is released.\n\nHow blocks are placed and their density has been changed. I understand why it was done- there were a lot of complaints that songs with large uphill parts were quite boring due to the low block densities they have. However it's gone too far the other way, where the placement of the blocks seem to have little correlation with the music, and the main thing the music influences being the track slope. This is disappointing, as it feels less like I'm riding my music and more playing a puzzle game with my music in the background.\n\n\nOverall it is an enjoyable game, with my biggest gripe being the fiddling around with the block placement.\n\nEDIT: OK so this is much later, and I'm coming to enjoy the game more. The ability to add mew modes is great and the changes they made to Audiosprint were good. The issues I had with the early access version aren't in the final version, especially regarding block placement. I maintain that it's superior to the first game, especially in the little details like layout and so forth.","April 11, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure this game has nicer graphics and Workshop support for different skins,  it is extremely crippled due to the worse mechanics on some of the major characters. When I first booted up the game it crashed and I dismissed it as being a bug since it is an Early Access game, but then I booted it up a second time and once I chose my song it crashed and locked my computer up for at least five minutes. When it unfroze I booted it up one more time and played two rounds in it. Pointman is extremely broken this time around. If you overfill you get no score deducted. Also sometimes when you go to pick up a block or a power-up, it won't pick up. Also at the end of the round there was no high-score table which is a feature they might not have implemented yet. If you are not sure if you should put towards the extra dollars for this title don't at the moment. They may fix this and make it better but as it is, don't go for it and just get the first game.","December 30, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","3"

It can be confusing when you switch from playing the first game to this one because even though the basics are the same, they are very much different in gameplay.\n\nThe menus are the greatest challenge of this game in my opinion, and the most annoying.\nThe orignal Audiosurf had nice and simple menus that were easy to navigate. This game however, the menus at first are very confusing and you can easily get stuck trying to find your actual music. If you select the wrong folder, you can't simply go back to the previous folder, you have to click out into a new menu and then go back to the song menu and start from the drives.\nAnother thing that bugged me and quite possibly bugged me the most, was changing options during the game.\nAudiosurf 1 let you simply pause during a game to change your options, like mouse sensitivity, sound effects, volume and ect...\nIn Audiosurf 2, you can't pause during the game, change the settings, and resume the game where you left off. (At least I've never found a way).\nThis is incredibly annoying especially when you want to fine tune your mouse sensitivity and have to go back to the main menu and go through finding your song all over again. Then you need to repeat several times just so you can get your sensitivity to your desire.\n\nCompared to the original, the function of hitting cars (Cubes) is, in my opinion, terrible. It's hard to tell where you actually are able to hit the cars and you can't simply do a wrist flick to quickly move through greys (as mono) since they're always packed tightly. In Audiosurf 1, it was easy to figure out where the cars can be hit and that would allow you to know where you can sneak as mono to avoid greys like a ninja. Audiosurf 2 just doesn't allow that.\n\n\nOverall, I do not think the game is bad, it just needs more tweaks. It's been in early access for a while now and I still can't enjoy it myself.\nI would not recommend you buy this game just yet, but I would implore you to check out the original Audiosurf if you haven't already. The creators of this game are amazing and I know they can make this game just as amazing as the original with time.","April 16, 2015","false","1.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","2"

I really wanted to like this game but it just has very few redeeming qualities compared to other music games out there (some of which are completely free...).

It has so many annoying issues that I can't help but cringe and stay away. I can mentions the two biggest ones:\n\n- RNG on Official Mono and plenty other modes. In the game's description, you tell us to "strategize", but placing the RNG factor and randomly generating blocks positions. Random always ruins strategy.\n- Half-baked anti cheat attempt. There was a 10-pages long thread, which has been deleted, discussing about how to deal with cheaters in Audiosurf 2. I really wonder why the thread gone disappeared without a note. Dylan pushed an update which has cheater flagging and separate scoreboard for low-bitrate songs. It doesn't work, because, flags can be abused to takedown a legit score. And 2, songs can be tweaked to make blocks on silent and important points at song, connecting chains at moment it should not happens if you played from a source that has clean song (aka Soundcloud).\n\nJust yeah.

I was very hyped when AS2 came out and I got the pre-beta release immediately. It's a sad conclusion that after months of tweaking the game, AS2 still suffers from development issues. There is still no pop up file browser, which makes finding that one song you wanna play impossible to find. The Workshop is doing a decent job so far but sadly this game isn't THAT popular which results in not a lot of Workshop mods that are worth your time. I'm still a big fan of AS and I come back to it from time to time, the game has a nack for giving an extra dimension to the way you listen to your favorite music. I can recommend AS2 for sure, but it's probably better to get AS1 since that game works like a charm and AS2 basically offers more of the same. The tweaked graphics and (lame) new game mode don't really make AS2 worth while. Not yet at least. I'm still hoping for the developers and Workshop fanatics to turn this sequal in a great game.\n\nI wrote this 1.5 years ago and not much has changed ever since. This is a complete joke, you can't rake in money for a game that's literally YEARS from being a finished product. It feels like I've been conned. This game is still not finished, it's just not fully functional. It still doesn't have a pop-up file browser, it still doesn't have last.fm enabled, the menus have been tweaked but why is everything so small? I have been playing AS1 a lot more than this, this is just not good enough.","January 8, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If you compare it directly to the original, it has several pitfalls: The built in skins are trash, at least for mono players. It's difficult to find greys with it, and the first thing I did was find a skin that replicated the original's. Next, the UI is horrible. For instance, you can't scroll down on the scoreboard for a song, meaning you only see the top 12. There is no profile view. There is no integration with the original website, and no ability to see your own championships or holdings.\n\nTo call mono instanely difficult would be an understatement. It's closer to ninja mono ironmode on the original than it is any of the slower paced characters. Sometimes, the graphics engine paints the entire screen black for fractions of a second, making it easy to miss points. Frequently, impenetrable barriers of greys/spikes/blocks block your path entirely, and only familiarity with avoiding them in the original lets me avoid them. I cannot see a solution around, but muscle memory guides me through okay.\n\nIs the game fun? Yeah. Is it as polished as the original? God no.\n\nBuy AS2, but it'll get better.","December 21, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics render much better and things look as impressively shiny as the original made back when it was new. The recently added Stadium skin is gorgeous and the reactive blocks makes it pop in a convincing way.\n\nAnd, while the developer is working on taking game modes in new directions the Workshop has an assortment of recreations and variations on old modes as well as its own experiments. The major drawback is that the amount of mods fragments the scoreboards, but that will probably change as the community finds favorites.\n\nThe first Audiosurf was a bit rough around the edges and this still has a bit to go before getting there. But it's hihgly playable at this point, and development seems to be moving along steadily enough that I'm glad I supported it from the start.","July 11, 2014","true","193.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The wakeboarding mode wasn't really all that great, and the default skins that came with the game were just okay.\n\nWhile I did fix the movement by doubling the mouse sensitivity, essentially, the workshop saves this game. There are plenty of really fun community modes and quite a few skins that are absolutely gorgeous (my favorite so far is  Hyperdrive 2  , which is stunning).\n\nWithout the workshop I couldn't recommend it, at least not at this price.

It fills a niche in my gaming library that very few of my other favorite games can, and here's why:\n\n- I can play it anywhere I bring my laptop\n- Installing mods is clean and low-maintenence\n- It boots up and exits out quickly and cleanly\n- Unless you're installing mods, it doesn't need an internet connection\n- It has great music (LOL)\n- It delivers a satisfying gameplay experience, and most importantly\n- It's incredibly easy to pick up and play, and just as easy to put down and transition to stuff that needs doing in real life\n\nAudioSurf 2 is the perfect game for a person on the move, who needs to play games to get through the day but whose schedule doesn't allow for long sessions of Skyrim, Garry's Mod, Minecraft, or other games they love. I realize this is the main draw of casual gaming, and while some gamers may see casual gaming as a synonym for "low-quality tripe," I assure you this is not the case.\n\nIf you're looking for depth and complexity, this isn't the game for you. But if you're looking to kill some time between classes or meetings, AudioSurf 2 is as good as it gets.\n\nI'm gonna go play some more now. You should too.","April 2, 2014","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Im going to start with the positive stuff. The graphics are absolutely outstanding, and improves on the first game for sure. The graphics are colorful, fast, and pretty. Another up is that skins, and mods were never easier and more convenient. I was able to get tons of skins for the game and instantly use them, which was amazing! The new wakeboard mode is unique, and adds an epic feeling to a song. In wakeboard mode you can literally surf to your music, try to get high air, and pull off some sick tricks. I love playing wakeboard mode when I'm in for something new. Now for the negative stuff. (Now remember this game is still in early access). The game can be slightly laggy at times. This CAN be fixed, but if you want a non-laggy game you will most likely have to play on the lowest graphic quality. And the only other thing I dislike about it is that finding your own music to surf to is surprisingly difficult. I don't  know if there is an easier way to find your music, (if there is tell me) but the only way I found my music was going into "recent songs," and it would show a list of songs that I've recently played in Audiosurf 1. Besides that, the game is absolutely stunning. The game is still in early access, so I'm going to give the game time to get better. For an early access game: 9/10. I highly recommend this game!","April 2, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only time I ever listened to Nickleback.\n\n\nOkay, but for serious:\nPlayed the hell out of the first one (70 hours). The simple gameplay in conjunction with your library of music is addicting and enjoyable to an endless degree. If it ever gets boring, try a new song, a new genre, PLAY A PODCAST. That's right. Any MP3 you have on your computer can be played through Audiosurf 2, and that means the gameplay stays fresh as long as there is good music still out there.\n\nIn addition to the vanilla gamemodes and skins, there is a large library of user-created modifications available via the Workshop which I HIGHLY recommend you check out.\n\nGreat game.","April 14, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now it may sound boring but when you play your favorite song on this you'll think it is epic.\n\nGamemodes\nThe game has manny official modes and community ones like Mono or WakeBoard to name a few and there is some new added every week or so. Each made has its own unique play style and each can be challenging in its own way.\n\nSkins\nThere are many default skins and also there are lots of skins being uploaded to the community which is great in my opinion. Now if you don't know what the skins do they basicly can change the whole look of the tracks which is great also in my opinion.\n\nPersonal Rating 9.5/10\nProfessional Rating 8.6/10\n\nIn conclusion if you like music based games like DDR,DJHero,Or Guitar Hero then you'll love this game. Also keep in mind this is an early access game which means it has some glitches but no gamebreaking ones that I have seen.","August 13, 2014","true","75.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Audiosurf's an outstanding game, but Audiosurf 2 appears to be better in just about every way. Race through levels generated from your own music, or play tunes from an ever-changing song list that the game pulls from the Internet. Do not play this game if you get any kind of motion sickness or such, but if you can handle it, Audiosurf 2 will deliver with some outstanding visuals and trippy behavior. User mods are well supported by the game, and can completely change how it plays. I just flew through an asteroid field, for example. The developer's extremely active with new content, rules changes, and bug smashings, and this early access game plays like a dream already.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/postoffice1/recommended/235800/","postoffice1","Puppycop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/postoffice1/","177 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAudiosurf 2 is a must for any music lover. The game is simple: pick a song stored on your iTunes or anywhere you store music, and the game will create a track for you to ride on that bumps, dips, and drops to the song.\n\nIt's insanely easy to pick up, but with plenty of difficulty to keep you sticking around for higher scores against other players who have played the same song. Replayability is excellent, I've spent up to 2 hours playing tracks from songs in my library trying to find what song is the most intense and what song is the most mellow. There are different modes of play, from the simple "Mono" that has you pick up colored blocks on the track while avoiding grey blocks to the new "Wakeboard" modes that swap your ship for a wakeboarder who pulls off tricks and flips off of the hills created in your track.\n\nNow why would you get Audiosurf 2 instead of Audiosurf 1? Audiosurf 1 is still a great game with all of the same strengths mentioned above, why not just go with the original? One word: Workshop. The Steam Workshop support for Audiosurf 2 makes sure that you never get bored with the game. Sick of looking at the same neon tracks? Subscribe to a skin mod. Mono Turbo not fast enough for you? Subscribe to a gametype mod. The Steam Workshop makes getting new skins and gametypes so easy it's dumb.\n\nAnother new feature in Audiosurf 2 is to play songs from artists that you follow on SoundCloud directly; you don't need to download it to your computer. I personally haven't used this feature yet, but it's still great to have for people who want to spend the time to download before you play.\n\nWhile this game is still in development, I believe it's a good buy. Grab some good headphones, a comfy chair, and ride the music. The possibilities are as endless as your library.","February 17, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Audiosurf 2 is the second game in the Audiosurf series (if you couldn't guess that) and they have stepped-up their game immaculately! If you are not familiar with the Audiosurf games let me give a quick explanation. In Audiosurf you "ride" your music by controlling a weird space-themed vehicle. You must hit and "collect" blocks to score points. There are various game modes which alter the rules slightly and have unique gimmicks which add a nice variety. A new addition to Audiosurf 2 is the new "Wakeboard" mode where you try to hit "waves" and get big air in which you can do cool and flashy stunts in. The game will let you choose a song to play from your own music collection and will auto-generate a level for you to play. The graphics are really suitable, cool colours for build-ups and hot pulsating colours for the intense drops! And incase you weren't too fond of the colour scheme you have the option to choose from a variety of skins. ALSO if that wasn't enough you can now use various (user created) workshop skins! Overall this game has a lot of pros and very little in the way of cons (I can't name any off the top of my head) and the game hasn't even been released yet! The graphics and effects really help you to immerse yourself within the game and the colour scheme lets you know exactly what part of the song it is and how the level will unfold. Leaderboards are also available for bragging rights (I've already bragged on my facebook account :3) and to show off infront of your mates! Well cya later I'm off to ride my music into victory!!","October 15, 2013","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do not play this game if you get any kind of motion sickness or such, but if you can handle it, Audiosurf 2 will deliver with some outstanding visuals and trippy behavior. User mods are well supported by the game, and can completely change how it plays. I just flew through an asteroid field, for example.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/postoffice1/recommended/235800/","postoffice1","Puppycop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/postoffice1/","177 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAudiosurf 2 is a must for any music lover. The game is simple: pick a song stored on your iTunes or anywhere you store music, and the game will create a track for you to ride on that bumps, dips, and drops to the song.\n\nIt's insanely easy to pick up, but with plenty of difficulty to keep you sticking around for higher scores against other players who have played the same song. Replayability is excellent, I've spent up to 2 hours playing tracks from songs in my library trying to find what song is the most intense and what song is the most mellow. There are different modes of play, from the simple "Mono" that has you pick up colored blocks on the track while avoiding grey blocks to the new "Wakeboard" modes that swap your ship for a wakeboarder who pulls off tricks and flips off of the hills created in your track.\n\nNow why would you get Audiosurf 2 instead of Audiosurf 1? Audiosurf 1 is still a great game with all of the same strengths mentioned above, why not just go with the original? One word: Workshop. The Steam Workshop support for Audiosurf 2 makes sure that you never get bored with the game. Sick of looking at the same neon tracks? Subscribe to a skin mod. Mono Turbo not fast enough for you? Subscribe to a gametype mod. The Steam Workshop makes getting new skins and gametypes so easy it's dumb.\n\nAnother new feature in Audiosurf 2 is to play songs from artists that you follow on SoundCloud directly; you don't need to download it to your computer. I personally haven't used this feature yet, but it's still great to have for people who want to spend the time to download before you play.\n\nWhile this game is still in development, I believe it's a good buy. Grab some good headphones, a comfy chair, and ride the music. The possibilities are as endless as your library.","February 17, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EDIT: Last.fm support has now arrived, but it involves creating a file (with a text editor, this cannot be done within the game at present) with your username and password stored in plaintext. I was hoping for a more elegant solution.\n\nBack to the positive though - gameplay is as smooth as ever, and the new wakeboarding mode (spoiler: you 'jump' before intense sections of track, then glide down whilst doing tricks) is a lot of fun, although it will require you to pick different types of track (ones with varying intensity, as all fast or all slow is no good).\n\nThere are also scoreboards so you can smack the excrement out of your friends and other Steam users with your performance on Justin Bieber tunes. Just be careful because these leaderboards sometime wiped between updates (RIP my Daft Punk highscore).\n\nOverall I think it's gr8 (perhaps because my talent is inn8).

Plus teh game is still being improved upon and new capabilities are being added, so I'd say it's well worth the purchase.","October 28, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feels a bit thin for the price but the Soundcloud integreation is nice. Purchase during a sale, full price only if you must play it.","October 30, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
