The lights, textures, and movement can cause problems. Personally, I got a migraine every time I tried to play, and other games of this type (Portal 2 immediately comes to mind due to the similar mechanics, and Dead Space due to the style) don't cause that sort of reaction.\n\nThe concept is fun, and as a puzzle game, it's definitely good. Just use caution if you're susceptible to headaches and the like.","June 30, 2014","true","0.5"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","0"

The game is short, though. The game runs about as long as the original portal and has more than enough puzzles to be interesting, with some of them requiring very abstract thinking. It looks pretty good technically, though it's very samey, and I wouldn't with the story if I were you. But should you get it? Well...\n\nIf you like puzzle games, DEFINITELY buy this. It's one of the better puzzle games I've played in a while and - unlike the others - it doesn't look awful. The controls are loose and wobbly, but with essentially infinite-use time reversal, you can account for that. It's clever, it's creative and it gives you mechanics which seem familiar, but are fairly unique on their own. This will challenge your brain, but in a good way.\n\nHowever, Temporality is also a very slow-paced game. While you may beat most levels in under three minutes on the clock, keep in mind that the clock counts back when you reverse time. So while it may be an absolute 3 minutes, you'll actually be spending 15-20 minutes per level. The character jogs slowly, jumps awkwardly and the game requires a lot of repetition, minor adjustments to positioning and timing and a lot of staring at a puzzle to figure out what you to do. If you need action, this isn't the right game. And it also goes without saying that if you're awful at puzzle games, Temporality will frustrate you.\n\nFor me, though, it was a worthwhile buy at 7.49 Euro. I'm not entirely sure if I can recommend it at its full price of 15 Euro, though. I mean, it's cool and creative, but also VERY short. If you're a huge puzzle game fan I can kind of see paying full price, but for my pocket I don't know that I could go much higher than 10 Euro. Then again, I'm stingy :)","September 11, 2014","true","13.3"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

Project Temporality challenges you to think in four dimensions and rely on yourself to solve puzzles based on different timelines. The game manages to impress with clever puzzles and rewarding gameplay. It forces you to carefully plan ahead, but because you can simply rewind time to rectify mistakes it rarely becomes frustrating. There is also a deeper story lurking behind all the puzzle solving for players interested enough to delve deeper.","April 17","true","48.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

However, the implementation is so poor that I couldn't enjoy the game and gave up after forcing myself into a few play sessions.\n\nThe controls are clumsy. This game would probably play easier if the camera were just looking from inside the eyes of the character, not from behind. In the first few minutes of the game the camera is even locked at fixed angle, you can't look around the room.\n\nThe constant interruptions by the tutorial text which freeze the game are very annoying. Also, it's the mouse click which closes them, but you don't see the cursor itself, which also feels strange. I'd expect clicking "Next" button or "Close". No voice-overs btw, which is, well, ok for a game which you get for a few euros. The text which appears word by word is annoying as well, it should appear just all at once.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, but you very soon notice that there is just a very limited set of models for environmental objects which they constantly re-use in every room. All rooms look the same because of that. In the end it feels more like a tech demo than a finished game, as if they bought some stub assets on the Internet. And the whole game feels generic and anonymous.\n\nNo environmental sound whatsoever! You walk around levels in complete silence. There are no footsteps, no buzz from the electronics around you etc. It feels like your sound card is broken or something - yet the music is playing. The music is good btw. The only sound I heard was the jump sound which is much like the Game Boy's Mario jump sound from the early 90s. Completely out of place.\n\nThe story is badly written. The very first message you get by pressing E on something in the first room is unintelligeble, and the rest even more, so I stopped reading them after the 3rd one.\n\nLike in most puzzle games, the actual puzzles are more a chore than fun to solve, with some rare exceptions. It's just that the set of actions the player can do is so small that not much interesting could be built around it, and the time-rewinding mechanics doesn't really save it. You step on buttons, run, jump, and carry keys. Then more of the same, and then some more, without any sense of progress or direction. They make a clumsy attempt to get you interested in solving the puzzles in a "perfect" way to earn stars (as if this were some casual game on iOS) but frankly I didn't bother at all. Stars feel too cheap for a 3D game where you control a character. At least in Portal it felt like a mix of FPS and puzzle, not just a puzzle.\n\nApparently there are some bugs with collisions, I got them every 15-20 minutes. Sometimes the character can collide into some object of the environment and get completely stuck (can't move/jump anymore). Once I got the character smashing into the edge of a cliff, stuck in the animation of running. If you jump on a rising platform, the feet sink in it. Camera frequently gets inside objects, including the character himself.\n\nHonestly, this product looks like a prototype for a game, not a real game on sale. It may be ok for the game's low price but cmon, the idea of time rewinds around which this game is designed deserves so much more!","November 23, 2014","false","2.7"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

You are a person with the power of time manipulation (due to a prototype device) which you can use to turn back time and make a clone that does what you did before in order to solve puzzles and go to the next level. That means you can do two or things at the same time. Normally that would make things easier but not in this game. The complexity the numbber of time clones give to the puzzle only makes it harder.\n\nFrom what I played I can say with confidence that the execution of the premise is very good! Complex puzzles that require you to set your mind to ultra super problem solving mode while providing an aesthetically beautiful environment. This is one game that will put yout thinking skills to the test and provide you a fun experience!\n\nGraphics are very good for an indie game as well as generally for a game and truly for what this game is you don't need better.\n\nThis game is not for those who lack patience at puzzle solving but for those who really want a challenging puzzle solving experience or those who want to try a puzzle game (provided they have enough patience) this game is a must have (at least imo)! Project Temporality will give the puzzle game lovers hours of fun and a great (well earned) sence of accomplishment when completing the levels!

The game could do a better job at teaching you some "tricks" which you need to know to solve some puzzles, but with a bit of perseverance and "trial and error" tactics you can discover it yourself.\n\nThe music, story and the way story is told could be more polished, but these do not overshadow general fun of playing the game. I hope more games with similar concept will be made in the future, as it has a potential to be even better.\n\nOverall, a positive experience!","February 10, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The aspects of manipulating time to create several different timelines has been the bread and butter of Science Fiction stories for decades, but apart from Braid this is the first game I've ever seen that explores the possibilities. Since this is a 3D plattform game, the aspects of timetravel that are most explored are of course the purely spatial and temporal, having to go through ways of getting past obstacles by manipulating the timelines. While they overall have done a good job creating puzzles that you have to think through in order to solve, while still remaining enjoyable, some puzzles just feel like variations of previous puzzles. At first I found the story unengaging but at level 8, I felt it took a turn for the better.

I recommend trying it if you have a few hours to spare.\n\nThis game's environment is similar to Portal's, but instead of using portals, the game uses elements like time reversal (Braid) and the ability to create multiple timelines (Nicolas Cage movie called Next).\n\nAlthough the puzzles are relatively challenging (occasionally requiring you to go back in time by more than a minute or two), there are only 14 levels in total, and each of them doesn't need more than 20-30 minutes (real time) to complete. For those wondering, every level can be beaten.\n\nThe levels are lengthy and the level design is nice to look at. There are also messages left behind (similar to PDAs in Deus Ex) which give backstory, and you're free to read them at your own convenience as you can simply revert time.\n\nOne thing I wasn't pleased about was: once you complete Level 7 (reach halfway through the game), the game takes a turn and becomes easier. From then on, there is a strong emphasis on story as opposed to the puzzles themselves. Level 10 and 13 are difficult though.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Level 13 as I was forced to cut down on clone usage and optimize my moves while timing a lot of others. If you play this game and reach that point, you'll know.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like was the 3-star ranking scheme (with 0 stars as being completion only). It's impossibly hard to get more than 1-star. Unless I was really bad at the game (which I don't believe I was), it didn't seem possible to get more than a 1-star rank. I assume you would need to refer to a guide and replay a stage dozens of times in order to get 3-stars.\n\nAll in all, I liked this game. But I wouldn't suggest buying it unless it's on sale or part of a bundle. I've already uninstalled the game after beating it one-way non-stop, so look at my hours played to have an idea for how long the game is.","December 5, 2015","true","8.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After purchasing the game I couldn't find that song anywhere so I went back to youtube to listen to that song every day. I randomly decided to leave a comment about it in the comments section and lo-and-behold the Game company Defrost Games replied back to me. Astonishing! I was being told that they will add that song which was written for the game in the game files and uploaded on steam for me to enjoy it. They have actually done it! And nonetheless for a random fan. I am very impressed and I feel that this company's future is in safe hands and will go a long way. To do such a thing is rare. To communicate with your fans on this level is even rarer. So firstly I would like to give a big Thank You and a snggle hug to everyone at Defrost Games.\n\nNow onto the review.\nEven though I got the game for the music, I ended up loving the game as well. It is a pleasant surprise to see inovation on this level. The game's levels are well designed and the game's atmosphere is nothing short of immersive and captivating. It is no surprise that this Indie game company has won not one, but two categories in the competition Golden Chips (Guldchipset). This is impressive mostly because the competition has only 3 categories. Winning at the 66.6'th % margin says something.\n\nSo what is Temporality?\nTemporality is a game mechanic that here is thoroughly explored and shows the possibilities of the fourth dimension. And it does so brilliantly in a wonderfully designed tesseract approach. In the words of the competition's Jury "Brain workout in four dimensions". This kind of mechanic alongside the game's charm and witty comedy secured it's release on multiple platforms also making the game available in over 70 stores.\n\nWith such a clever design the game starts to shine right from the beginning. Fans of the Puzzle genre will feel just like home with this one. Time lapse and Clone splitting which can go up to the 11'th dimension is just the tip of the iceberg. By the end of the third room you actually start questioning your own decisions. The game has a good difficulty curve and it gets increasingly harder to perform puzzles and platforming in the same time. It won't hold your hand but it feels great to get to the end of a puzzle even if it's just personal gratification. What sets the game apart from other similar games is the way they executed it. The balance between the game difficulty and the puzzle solving, the tiny hub rooms between levels which immerse you even more, the lack of game breaking bugs and the beautiful atmosphere and last but not least the soundtrack!\n\nAnd speaking of bugs, I have only encountered minor bugs such as the odd invisible wall and clipping but nothing major I'm happy to say. I know others have had some lighting problems but most of them have incompatible video cards or outdated drivers. The game has not crashed on me. Not even once. And that's good since I run it on my main machine which has Windows 8.1 OS.\n\nThe game requirements are not high at all and pretty much anyone can download and play it without worries. The menus are simple, straight and not overly complicated and the video options are just enough to support several good resolutions and monitors as I have tested that one three different machines. The gameplay at it's core is simple and easy to understand yet used in such a way that's captivating. The graphics could use a bit of polish but remember this is an indie game. It looks great for what it is. Do I need to say anything about the soundtrack? NO! No I don't. I love it. The price tag that the game comes with does wonders as it feels that the game has just the right numbers on it. Overall the game left me wanting for more and craving for a second part. It wouldn't hurt to get access to a nice and robust fully fleshed level editor as I feel this would most definitely prolongue the game's life. Mods anyone? :)\n\nIt is a nice experience worth every penny, easy to get into and trigger happy to have you brainstorming all over the place. Now I want more. I expect great things from Defrost Games and I'm happy to say I believe they'll devider it. If their next games are anything like Project Temporality then I'm hooked.\n\n\n\n- RGN Relapse Gaming Nation, Day Twentynine","March 24","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quantum Conundrum comes closer but it too falls short IMHO. [Portal why did you spoil me so]","December 30, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To solve a puzzle in a good puzzle game, you gather all the information you need, apply you intuition, and then you can test your solution. Becausing timing is essential in the puzzles in this game, you probably have to rewind multiple times to get it right. Surely, trial and error is required in a good puzzle game, but between each possible solutions you want to test, not within one. It's especially difficult to get the timing right with the third person view (as oppose to a bird's eye view of the room).\n\nThe game mechanics feel dated as well. You are forced to read the story on screen. I know the developers probably don't have the budget to hire voice actors, but there must be other ways to tell the story within a game. I've only played the first few stages, but each stage consists of two entirely separate puzzles. I have no idea why they weren't just separate into two stages. I feel forced to finish two puzzles, or I will have to start from the beginning, which annoys me.","July 12, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game portrays that injustice very well, but I believe more effort could have been placed in condemning the injustices and fixing it also, rather than simply placing the protagonist (and others) in the shoes' of a victim. Moreover, there are some references to animal experimentation which I feel is inappropriate - another injustice that yet again is not condemned.\n\nFrom a game mechanics / gameplay, perspective, the game is very good. It puts together multiple puzzle mechanics to bring a complex new type of gameplay not found in any other game I've played. Although the mechanics are fixed, there are new twists being thrown in consistently, and this provides a variety of gameplay. I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzle aspects.\n\nRegarding visuals and audio: superb. The game is beautiful in both regards.\n\nThe game is also good at storytelling. The reward system for beating challenges means users are fed bits and pieces of the story and I believe this works very well.","July 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","8"

I kinda bought it blindly from the video footage and I didn't spent that much time looking into review of walkthrought, maybe that would have prevent me from buying this game.\nI do not recommend this game for a certain numbers of reasons, which make me regret to have bought this game and this doesn't happen a lot!\nI spent 9 hours to beat the game to be sure at the end my first impressions were right, and they were.\n\nThe game is composed of 14 levels, all of them are accessible right from the start.\nSo I started the story, as to get to the full game experience because there me be some cutscenes around the corner which I might miss.\nWell there are no cutscene and all the story is written on the screen with no voices over.\nThat wasn't a trouble at all for me, although it would have been nice to have a voice for the 2 characters of the story.\n\nFirst hand on, control are a bit clumsy. I tried to work the camera around but it was really painful. The camera is way to close, sometimes it ruins the 'big picture' that you could get.\nThe camera get stuck on the ground when you are on ascending platform 30% of the time. What 30%? That not a lots... Considering you don't see where you are going it is very annoying and some level are all on running up and down.\n\nSo the story is... Well I can't tell you anything about the story apart from the first screen which teach you how to use the time and clone. There are books spread around the different levels. I didn't care to read them beyond the third one.\nAs it was at that time that I found my first bug, and the frustration just got over the fun. It didn't left me until the end.\n\nSo you run in a spacestation, running though the same room all the time, it only change when you get to a puzzle room.\nI got tired to run around, there are blood on the ground, since I get fed up with anything around the story there should be some information on who you are and why in every room there are blood... Maybe a riot or something else, well who care at that point.\n\nThe puzzle are not in themselves bad (This is an important point), they would have been enjoyable without the bugs around.\nThe use of temporal element is great but some of the puzzle are... Just hackable... Or have to be hack to be finished.\nLet aside the visual bug with the lasers (I took some screenshots) that turned the room into a discotech.\n\nI didn't like the jump animation, the character feel just dumb and I still can't see the difference between a normal jump and the bigger one apart from distance. And the jump sound is just annoying, something that felt like a mario jump sound (I was too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at that time already to not begin to hate it).\n\nI did clear the game in 9h, in 2 run of 7h and 2h.\nI prolly spend 1h or more just on level 13 (out of 14 levels) who have to do in one straigh run with no error otherwise you can't complete it. I tried over and over... Up to a version I couldn't finish the level, yes the game don't allow you to finish the game with less that one star. If you are not good at that kind of game... Yeah I have an hard time finishing the level and I can't complete it. My problem with lvl 13 is that the door don't reset properly when you activate some buttons. which screw your gameplay as you can't continue at all, rewinding time don't affect them anymore... Which felt plain stupid..\n\nThere is also no checkpoint save despite the game reseting when you pass certain area. When you spend quite a lot of time on a part of the puzzle. You stop because you have to, when you come back you lost all progress.\n\nOh you can't let a clone die, that is part of the gameplay, and I didn't liked it because who care of that time clone, he is bound to dissepear at some point, so why bot being able to kill them?\n\n\nSo the bugs:\n- Falling from your own high by creating a clone can kill you or your clone. It is well known that jumping using space button forward on the same part of the ground can kill you.\n- Some puzzle are hackable to a way that it's easier to jump where you shouldn't, than doing the puzzle the correct way.\n- To place your character on some moving plateform, you have to jump unless you come from the correct angle. I mean plateform at the same height as the ground of course.\n- Collision bug with the scenery. Yes when working with laser, you can easily get stuck against the scenery. You can get stuck if you are too close to a gate when it opens...\n- When rewinding time, some door are closed but you can go through and some you can't but should be open ...\n- Sometimes you fall, but you don't die. Happened to me several times. I mean you fall where you should die and you don't. Should I die from falling and use rewind to undo getting stuck. I left that to your imagination.\n\nTo conclude this review I won't recommend this game to any body. I always try to find the good in the game even if they are not up to the standard I thought they were.\nBut to finish this game I went to so much frustration... And I had to knock myself out to really beat it, not because it was hard, just because of the bugs... Far too many to have an enoyable experience.\nI looked at the positive comment and didn't see the bugs coming out, I'm usualy the last person to see the bugs but there were way too obvious.\n\nI regret to have bought this game now, but it's done and I will forget about it fast!\n\nGet yourself Portal or Portal 2 for the same price now. Way better, with the help of community maps can hold you for hours and hours and it should be enjoyable!\n\n\nCheers,\nLuuna.","July 22, 2015","false","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Project Temporality puts the player on a futuristic space station and has you go through 14 chapters, each with its own set of puzzles that require you to use time clones to be solved. It might seem like a confusing mechanic at first, but don't let your first impressions deceive you. You perform a route that you'd want a clone to take, then you rewind back and create an alternate timeline. At this point, the action you've done already will be performed by a clone, whilst you can go on to perform another action.\n\nThe game lets you create up to 10 clones per chapter, and hence 11 timelines in total. Many of the puzzles require you to use more than 1 clone, creating a very smart and dynamic gameplay, which encourages you to think several moves in advance. It really reminded me of The Swapper (another good puzzle game), except in 3D rather than 2D and with more control over your clones. The puzzles themselves involve security doors, timers, keys, buttons, lasers, and moving platforms - things you'd expect in many puzzle games except executed with a lot of originality.\n\nSome of the latter puzzles start involving more complex mechanics such as temporality fields, which cause a door or a platform to remain where it was even if you reversed time. Regardless of complexity, solving each and every puzzle felt very rewarding. There was not a single puzzle in the game that frustrated me or made me turn to a walkthrough.\n\nThe game also gives you a star rating out of 3 for how well you did the chapter. Creating each timeline causes you to use up some energy, so the less energy you use overall, the higher your rating will be. This is pretty good for perfectionist type players, though from what I noticed, it is pretty hard to earn the perfect 3 stars on a level, or even 2 stars for that matter.\n\nThe visuals are very colourful and shiny, and do a good job showing a futuristic setting. The music is also really great and relaxing, perfect for when you need to concentrate on solving a puzzle. The game's story is mostly told by reading various data pads around each level as well as two characters communicating with you from time to time. The story is on the background mostly, so don't expect something akin to Portal 2 here. I think a lot of reviews, both critic and user alike, are very unfair for judging a puzzle game based on its story, when the main focus is on solving puzzles via time manipulation.\n\nThere were a few minor problems I came across, but they did not detract much from the overall experience. Like at times you could get stuck, mostly if a door closes the moment you walk through it, but all you need to do is to rewind time back a couple of seconds and you become unstuck. I did notice some big frame drops in some areas (with a lot of sunbeams), but this might not be the case for people with more powerful computers. I also found myself unable to complete chapter 13 the first time round, since I used up all the clones by the time I got to the very final puzzle in it and it was too late to rewind it. So the only way was to restart the chapter from the beginning. Gladly, once you know the solutions, you can blitz through the puzzles much faster. The devs were also kind enough to provide chapter selection, so you can play any chapter at any time, even if you haven't reached it yet.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games or the concept of time manipulation. I've had a very fun and rewarding experience playing this game. No doubt it's now one of my favourite puzzle games.","November 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Project Temporality gives you traditional platforming challenges where you must push a button to make a platform move, but rather than dropping a cube on the switch, you must create a new timeline and duplicate your actions in order to activate the platform while you’re on it. The concept is easy enough to wrap your head around, but the entire Record-Rewind-Replay mechanics are just awkwardly implemented and more often than not I would do something that conceptually was fool-proof but the actual mechanics of the game didn’t translate correctly.\nIt’s an awesome concept but frustratingly implemented.

Well... for worse, honestly. As you've probably figured out by now, this game is about time travel. You can also clone yourself and have clones follow the moves you've done exactly, and by the end of the game, you may have six or seven clones of yourself darting around the level to press switches... and that's about it, really. There's a few other elements that get thrown in there, but that's about it.\n\nPretty much every single puzzle in this game is a sequence puzzle, in which the standard way of playing the puzzle is: go in, push closest switch, look around until you find how that switch blocades you from solving the puzzle, rewind, send clone to press switch before puzzle becomes unsolvable, rinse, later, repeat. Even after the three hours that it took me to complete this game, I was already tired of just going through the motions in a different order time after time after time again. That's not to say that every puzzle is tedious and boring as hell; in fact, there's actually some pretty clever puzzles here and there. It's too bad most of the puzzles are just kinda okay.\n\nIn fact, that's pretty much how I'd describe this game; just kinda okay. There's definitely one area where it seems like all the effort went into (and I'll talk about this later on), but I wish more work had gone into the puzzles and into creating new, fun elements rather than the same old tired things that the game uses again and again. It's just really tedious; an example of a really great idea executed not very great. 5/10.\n\nStory: It's just kinda okay. The earlier parts of the dialogue (there's no voice acting BTW) had some pretty obvious grammar errors and typos, but it started getting sorted out by the end. However, that could also be because I stopped paying attention to the story about halfway through. You can tell that the authors cared about these characters, but the issue is that I didn't really care about the characters. This is somewhat of a "your mileage may vary" criticism, but for me;  I really couldn't care less about what went on with the characters. Plus, some of the dialogue is kinda silly given the scenarios, such as a woman using polite grammar while supposedly vomiting blood and gushing blood from her eyes. It also doesn't help matters that the story tries to be grimdarkian by the end, which just ends up sounding silly more than anything else. 5/10.\n\nGraphics: Yup, here's where all the effort went into. There's a lot of polygons here for a team of seven people. However, there are some technical aspects that are rather disappointing, such as the lack of fine control of graphical fidelity. As far as graphics go, you've got options for resolution (which it starts out in 1366x768 for some very odd reason; also yet *another* game that doesn't use autodetect resolution functions) and a catch-all graphics option, and that's your lot. The game never taxed my card all that much, but it's still a very good idea to give the user that fine control of graphical fidelity if they happen to be using a less beefy card than my GTX 760. Also, there's no anti-aliasing, which unfortunately makes this game look a lot worse than it should. Other than that, Sparta 3D (their proprietary engine) seems to be one solid 3D engine. However, the game is honestly lacking in art style. Pretty much every level looks the same, and even the at-first very impressive sight of Jupiter through the windows becomes rather tedious after the ninth or tenth time. Again, a very high-polygon count game unfortunately marred by the lack of anti-aliasing, fine graphical control, and unique art style lead me to give this game a 2/5 for the visual side. Also, there's blood everywhere for no dang reason and it gets silly after a while.\n\nSound: As mentioned earlier, there's no voiceacting in this game, and I do think that this is to the game's detriment. There's a lot of dialogue in this game, and I think it would've done the story a little better if they had been voice acted. The sound design is alright. Nothing spectacular, but nothing memorable either. The music is good for the first couple of times you hear it; however, since the OST is basically playlisted on repeat throughout the game, you'll end up hearing the same song about six or seven times throughout the course of your playthrough; presuming, of course, that your playthrough is as short as mine. Yet again, just kinda okay. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 5/5/2/2; 4.7/10. Just beneath the borderline of average. I got it in a Humble Bundle a while ago, so I don't feel like I've been burned too badly, but if you've got other puzzle games to play instead of this one, go for them. They'll probably be a better experience for you.","October 8, 2014","false","3.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

This seems like a poor development.\n-Continuing off the Story there appears to be no enemies/fighting, atleast as far in as I've gotten; This detracts from the idea of a 3rd person puzzle because at the very least you should have some crazed robot out to get you. This only has "testing" - and if I want "testing" - I can just play SE for hours on end. So Like I said the stories not so great.\n-As far as I can tell there's no "real" multiplayer - just you and your clones :(.\n\n\nAll in all would I recommend this game? Yes, to the right person. It's definitely not a GTA-styled game even though you may be lead to believe that by the screenshots. And to answer your question about open-world the "tests" are divided into levels - not exactly open-world to me...it is definitely a good game, not sure if I'd pay $15 for it again but what's done is done...","July 1, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers must really like 2001:  A Space Odyssey and 2010: The Year We Made Contact and its sequel); A scientific testing facility where you are the 80-something test subject.\n\nWhat are you testing? Well, you have a brain implant that allows you to move forward and backward in time, as well as create temporal clones of yourself doing whatever it was you did before. It basically is a record-and-playback function for you as a person. And therein lies the kicker. The puzzles you are presented with require you to create not one but several of these clones of yourself in order to solve them.\n\nIt looks and plays really smooth and beautiful, except that a lot of rooms and corridors look very much alike and resources are obviously being re-used a bit too much. But every now and then you get to watch out the window and see...well, just watch the forementioned movies or play the game and you'll get it. The musical score and sound effect round the artwork off quite nicely.\n\nThe physics and modelling have proven a tad temperamental though. Buttons you're supposed to step on sometimes don't trigger because of the odd shape and the character(s) collision detection and lasers, which push you away, may push you into a wall and all sorts of freaky things start happening.\n\nThen there are certain puzzles that involve objects that are shielded from temporal tampering, and that's where the real gamebreak lies. These puzzles come with a checkpoint so you can still reset the puzzle and try again. The problem is that not all objects are properly reset when using these, resulting in bugged puzzles that simply cannot be solved, you cannot proceed and therefor have to play the entire level again, and again...and again...\n\nBut overall this really is a great addition for people that enjoy puzzles set in an FPS game with a SciFi undertone.","September 11, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only wish there was more of it.\n\nWhich is the biggest problem: the story is very short. You barely manage to get the hang of time manipulation and it ends. The general game setting also could use a lot more narration, many topics sketched throughout story progression beg for details and the whole mystery-stuffed campaign leaves one craving answers. Or at least hints as to what may have happened.. to story characters, their mission, the universe.\n\nOther than that I found the game fairly easy - once somewhat accustomed to time-branching, a certainly unintuitive way of solving problems. I absolutely love the music - especially how it befits the mysterious deep-space environment, but find it highly repetitive. Same goes for the graphical setting, with the same models repeating dozens of times across subsequent rooms - but I suppose it is acceptable for an indie game.\n\nAll in all, I only wish I knew about this game sooner and definitely won't hesitate a single second to buy the sequel, if and when there is any.","May 20, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Walk down a hall and step on a button, go back in time to before you did that, and you'll become a new clone of yourself, watching your old clone walk down the hall and step on the button. A downside of this game is it can get slow, sometimes just waiting for things, going back and redoing the timing, and waiting again.","May 23, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were only a few timed-jumping sections and they were very forgiving.  I have somewhat slow reflexes and nothing in this game was too difficult for me in that way.  The puzzles are fair and solvable.  It's the sort of game in which you can sometimes see the solution after careful thought, but you can also use trial-and-error effectively.\n\nThe look and feel of the game are only average; the environments don't differ too much from each other.  The story is pretty good, not great.  Based on those factors, as well as the somewhat short length, I think the current price ($14.99) is rather high.  But I recommend the game in a bundle or at a discount.\n\nThe game has 14 levels and each level has about 4 puzzles.  Unfortunately (and this is my only major problem with this game), you can't save the game at all.  You can only replay each level.  The solutions to the last two puzzles in level 13, for example, hinged on a mechanic that had only briefly been mentioned early in the game (maximum number of clones).  So I had to replay the entire level, which was a little annoying.  There were also a few glitches, such as time-lock puzzle components not resetting as they were supposed to when I rewound time, and one graphics (or something) error which meant I had to restart a level.\n\nThe puzzles really are excellent, though, and on their merit, I recommend this game.","August 8, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
