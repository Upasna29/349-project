"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/408770/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","Before playing, I applied the adult patch in order to unlock the full story (it's not actually a patch; it's a boolean setting). I also altered the font as the white glow around blue words was a bit annoying. On my second run, I put the censoring back on to see how the editing went. This helps provide dual input for the review.\n\nAt first, it seemed like it would be typical anime VN. At the start, it's all guy at school with 2 girls he's hot for. But, that just leads to the real story involving some serious social problems.\n\nIn the typical "what's it like as the opposite sex" style, the adult version involves some extended masturbatory scenes when he first takes over each one. The censored version has at least one awkward cut where the dialog obviously implies what just happened, but the transition also made it obvious that something big was cut out. There's another couple of scenes that give the wrong impression with the censoring in place. If you can tolerate hentai, you may want to enable the adult content just for continuity. It also extends the length of the story, and some of it provides extra plot detail for Akiko's situation.\n\nBack to the story. The initial takeover does involve the curious exploration due to the novelty of being in someone else's body, but it's not the main focus. It's more of a Quantum Leap style situation. The story revolves around him trying to figure out what is going on, learning about the truth of their lives, and then trying to change them for the better. We never find out why or how he was jumping, but we (and he) learn that his two love interests, both of whom he thought were so perfect, actually have dark secrets.\n\nOne of them has a bullying and consequential confidence problem. The other has an exploitative relationship and severe depression. I know most of this all too well. So, I could actually relate to the girls' situations and connect with them more. When all of this started up, I was drawn in. The story does not have branching, but the choices do end up causing slight variations in outcome and dialog. In the end, the choices made while possessing each one will decide if either one reveals their feelings, or if one of the bad endings happen.\n\nThere are a few negative points to mention:\nThe adult scenes could've been toned down a bit. I can understand some R or NC-17 type content, but the extended XXX ones were a bit much. For a VN, they even seemed weird. With Kasumi, the scene was way ahead of what the dialog was saying. There are only 2 or 3 frames used for each of them, so the "action" in the dialog just wasn't in sync. Also, the ending scenes were superfluous. They are simply fan service.\nThe default slightly smiling pose for both girls is used quite a lot during some serious situations. At the very least, it could've used a more neutral expression. It would've been even better if the face showed the emotion of the dialog.\nThe pool scene is too detailed, and it doesn't match the description in the dialog. Right near the start of it, the dialog mentions the water reflecting on the ceiling, yet it's an outdoor pool. Some more dialog also makes it sound indoors.\nThe game is quite short. I'm sure that all of the plot components could've been expanded upon without requiring more adult gratuity, and it would've been nice to have some type of information on how/why he could jump in the first place.\nDue to the mostly serious nature of the story and how it covers some really important topics, as well as hopefully providing an important lesson or insight for certain players, I am recommending this one. I hate to even use this word since it's overused and abused, but some people may be "triggered" by the content. Consider yourself warned. Also, the price is a bit high for the length, but I got it on the Anime Weekend Sale for $3.14, so I think I got my money's worth.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

Aside from a couple of gratuitous masturbation scenes if you use the adult patch, the focus is not on body swapping as a fetish, but on the confusion and uncertainty of having to take charge of someone else's life, knowing you might screw it up. It's a short visual novel (took me a little over an hour to reach all four endings), so the problems the girls are dealing with aren't explored in great depth, but they do feel realistic, and the writing is better than other AJTilley VNs I've read.

But way different.\n\nHighschool Possession is another VN developed by A.J.Tilley (now known as Dharker Studios) about a guy romancing schoolmates, female if you were wondering. The story goes around a guy whose name I don't remember and his relationship with two of the most beautiful girls in his highschool. One would say that there's nothing weird with that, a typical VN, but this is not the case.\n\nWarning! Some Spoilers Ahead\nWhen I was expecting some kind of paranormal activity including ghosts and some other manifestations (the title misguided me), I was surprised with a different kind of possession and not a good one. You, as in the protagonist, are faced with the idea of been inside your female friends bodies and in total control of them, which means you have to make the appropriate decisions to, not only make everyone believe you are the girl but also to change their fates and lives and, if the time is right, make one of them fall in love with you.\n\nPros.\n- Different endings\n- Interesting not so interesting story\n- CGs\n- It has a R18 patch for those of you who likes them\n\nCons.\n- The not so interesting story part\n- Kind of short\n- Almost predictable\n- Music\n\nThen, why am I recommending this?

I went in, expecting a cliched visual novel that should belong in the Steam trash bag but I found myself surprisingly enjoying it.\n\nI have a weird feeling this is gonna be a shorter review than what I usually write as there isn't as much to cover in a visual novel than in other games.\n\nFor those who are unfammilliar with a visual novel then I'll give you a quick introduction. Visual novels are quite self explanatory. It's a novel that you have visuals to accompany you. So for those that only care about the gameplay of a game, then you probbly won't like visual novels, but, if you're like me and enjoy the story of a game or if you're someone who likes to play/watch something  different in you life, then visual novels might be perfect for you. I'm not saying there isn't any gameplay in a visual novel, there is gameplay but it isn't the central focus. The gameplay of a visual novel is just you choosing wht you might say in a certain situation but that's just about the only gameplay there is in a visual novel.\n\nWith the introduction to a visual novel out of the way, I'll get onto the actual review now.\n\nHighschool Possession doesn't have as much gameplay as othr visual novels do but that doesn't always mean that it's going to be bad but the gameplay sections of Highschool Possessions don't come up that often and it didn't feel like I was affecting much of what would happen in the story with these decisions. The game is about 2 hours long and you could maybe streatch it to 3 hours if you want to see all of the endings but there are only around 5 sections of the game where you can change the affects of the game and all of them feel like hey won't make much of a difference to the events that will unfold.\n\nNow onto the main part a visual novel needs to get right, the story. Does it succeed? Yes. The story is really compelling and has a great message to get out to people and even though it's sort of a message to teen troubles, it was still fun going through the story and it included likeable characters, despite only having around 8 included. The story is that you're a boy named Hikaru and he has a crush on 2 female students. He doesn't know which one to ask out. However, one morning he wakes up to find that he keeps on switching between thse 2 girls' bodies, everytime he falls asleep. When he's in their bodies, he gets to experience what their life is like and starts to discover some dark secrets that they have never opened up about. I was really invested within this story and was really curious and wanted to find out what the hell was going on within their lives and wantedd to see how this would all end.\n\nThe visual art that goes along with this game is definately some of the best that's on Steam. The backgrounds looked beautiful to look at, the characters were well designed. The dialogue is for the most part good however, there was quite a few grammar mistakes that I noticed through the story but nothing seemed misspelle which was a good sign compared to a few other visual novels that I've played.\n\nI think that if you're wanting to see what a really good visual novel is like, give this a try. It takes a message that we've all heard tons of times when we were teens and kids but actually wraps it up into a compelling narrative to make you pleased that you've heard it again.\n\nPros\n+ Great story\n+ Good way of displaying it's message\n+ Great visual art\n+ Good character designs\n\nCons\n- Not many choices\n- Frequent grammar mistakes\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10\n\nMy steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 17","true","2.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Actually does have a somewhat meaningful message about the struggles everyone goes through while presenting a completely different face to the rest of the world, although there isn't time to explore that to a huge degree. The different choices don't change very much about the story except for determining which of the four endings you end up with. The writing is of good quality though and the artwork has a more western style, but isn't bad. There are some scenes that are not adults only but gratiuitous just for fanservice purposes, but that's true of almost every VN.  If money is an issue, you might want to wait for a sale, as 6.99 for a 70 minute game might not be good for everyone's budget.","March 12","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

This game hit my feels button hard in some places since I could relate so well with the characters. It might not exactly be for everyone but I very much enjoyed it and would buy it again.","February 11","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After you "disappear" you take on the body of one of the girls you idolize and you keep flip flopping between them. One of which is being horrifically bullied while the other is in an abusive relationship. You help them while in their bodies without them realizing it. It sounds like a wonky Freaky Friday piece of crap but I actually enjoyed it. I felt like I was actually making a difference. I was filled with determination! I felt empowered and good about myself that I was able to help them realize the power in themselves.\n\nIt's a short game so it won't eat up too much of your time and since it IS a dating sim of sorts you can end up with the one of the girls you possess at the end. But the real take away here is it's not quite a fluffy, highly eroticized sort've game. It's got some depth to it that other VN's lack and I can honestly say I appreciated that a lot.\n\n10/10","February 28","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

During this VN u will switch with the bodies of two girls and try to help them with their lives with desisions and such.\n\nThis VN was alright to play through. It was predictable but again I still had some fun playing the VN.\n\nThe characters were alright and the character art was nice too. The BG was alright and the music was amazing:) I really liked the music a lot.\n\nThe only con I found to this VN was that it was short. The bad ending's could of been fleshed more.  I don't think it's worth the full price. I recommened to get on a sale or a bundle. I got this through a bundle.\n\nSo if u want to kill some time then get this VN to play. Achievements are very easy to get since there is a guide on here to help u:). Also there is an 18+ patch to get if u are interested to play the adult version of the game.\n\n","April 15","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, I would love it if the protagonist didn't always talk like A CUCKED BETA MALE but that's the trend in vns. That's probably why japan's birthrate is so low, because no girl wants to date loser beta orbiters with no talent,  confidence, social atptitude, proper hygiene, balls, smarts, or something else to offer other than "I won't hit you like that jerk chad". Ty VNs for encouraging that culture.\n\n\nOh right, back to the review. It's pretty short, and some scenes seem forced, but it's not bad overall. Would recommend during sales.","June 2","true","2.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
