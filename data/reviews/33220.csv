"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/33220/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Conviction is an interesting sequel. All Splinter Cell games put a lot of emphasis on the stealth approach in each mission. You could spend hours figuring out how to proceed without having to kill anybody. You either knocked out your opponents or found a way to simply avoid them and remain undetected.\n\nConviction has a much faster pace. In addition to this, it is more action packed. There are areas where you are deliberately raided by enemies and you need to make sure you can stay alive. You have a handful of gadgets at your disposal to set traps. In addition to these action-packed areas the game basically forces you to do killings by making it interesting. This is thanks to the "mark and execute" option included in this Splinter Cell. This means that after a successful knock-out you can mark two enemies within a relatively close distance and pressing the action button Sam will kill these marked enemies immediately by using headshots. Proceeding from one room to the next becomes much easier with this technique. Also, due to this the scoring system is practically non-existing - you do not have an overall score at the end of the mission where the results are worse if you eliminate enemies.\n\nI understand some people do not like Conviction because of this. Sam also misses his unique goggles that was a signature item. But we have a cover system, finally! Also, you can interact with almost any object you have in your environment. You can climb / jump / cover whenever and wherever you think is possible - you will not encounter invisible walls. This makes the game quite exciting. Story-wise, the game has been upped to another level: it has a more serious tone now as Sam is not part of the 3rd Echelon any more and when he receives intel that the location of his daughter's murderer is known he sets out to take revenge.\n\nIf you think Conviction is a deviation from what we came to know and like in the past I completely understand. Good thing in all this is that Ubisoft realised this and in the latest installment of the franchise (Blacklist) the two concepts are mixed to make sure everybody can have a good time.\n\nConviction is different, but a good Splinter Cell game. Odd one or not, this should still be considered an asset in the series, an asset that I can only recommend.","March 7, 2014","true","15.7"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

This is NOT a Splinter Cell game, even if it's in the title. This game doesn't contains any element of the previous Splinter Cells. This is not a stealth game. If you want to play something like Chaos Theory, or Pandora's Tomorrow, this game isn't for You.\nBut if you want to play with an excellent tactical shooter, this game is waiting for you. Sam Fisher is now a killing machine. During the a playthrough you've got:\n- First of all a good story.\n- P.E.C. challenges (a lot) to get you points, and upgrade your armors, and weapon arsenal.\n- Lot of weapons, and armors for COOP\n- COOP contains a story mode, horde mode and a versus mode.\n- Plot twist of the coop story\n- great cover mechanics and fluid movement\n- enough equipment, to find the combination, that works best for you.\n- You can use the environment for the interrogations.\n\nHowever there are some stuff, i don't like:\n- The game incredibly EASY. The AI reacts the same all the time, Even with a pistol you can play through the game on the hardest difficulty. Too easy to learn the levels and the enemies.\n- Terrible PC port. I have a pretty good pc. Quadcore CPU, 8gb RAM, GTX 750 Titan videocard. But i don't know how, on some levels i barely get 25-30 fps.\n- Uplay.

Why? because its addicting, the campaign is epic, the stealth is fast paced, and the deniable ops is just so fun i can't resest clicking the play button. Even though the game is four yrs old it still has reasonably good graphics for today. Of course the graphics are not as good as some of the newer games but they are not bad at all. Since this game is four yrs old it does not have alot of people playing on the multiplayer-coop servers so it takes time to find a match partner. A big problem I had with the game was the multiplayer wouldn't work an error came up saying something like: "splinter cell conviction multiplayer servers are unavailable at this moment please try again later" and this kept happening day after day so I couldn't connect to multiplayer until I opened ports, reinstalled the game, and reinstalled steam.

While missions are still provided in a similar fashion to the other games, Sam Fisher is also following his own agenda and isn't quite so restricted by what he can or is willing to do.\n\nYou certainly have more freedom on how to achieve your mission objectives and the game is challenging. It introduces the gameplay style that is also featured in Blacklist, and you generally have a primary and secondary weapon with a range of gadgets that you're well used to from all the previous games.\n\nIt's a worthy part of the series and is definitely on the list of my all-time favorites.

If it's on sale, buy it. I'm about to go through the entire game again on  the hardest setting.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Sneaking around and assassinating your enemies with a very understandable system that lets you know that you're hidden from them.\n\n- The graphics are definitely good enough to please modern gamers.\n\n- Good amount of weapons to choose from. Weapons are able to be permanently upgraded if you choose.\n\n- "Last known location" is a cool feature that lets the enemies treat you as if you're still in the same spot that you were caught while hiding. You can trick the enemies with it and set up a flanking counter-attack. Helpful strategic tool.\n\n- The "Mark and Execute" feature is an awesome way to get rid of half of the enemies on the screen when you're really not wanting to run out and go Commando on a room full of people. It acts as a skillset for your character which makes him seem beyond human in gun skills. When Sam Fisher gets really upset, scary things happen to his enemies.\n\n- Enemies curse at you and insult your skill and/or intelligence. Some of the insults the enemies hurl at you are hilarious and are appropriate to what your character is doing or has done to them. That makes the game reaslistic. I laugh a lot at this!\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Linear, closed world. Not a big deal, but, it feels like you can't explore a lot like you can in Assassin's Creed games.\n\n- Requires UPLAY to play it. Some people hate UPLAY but I am OK with it. It never lost my save files or anything. UPlay also gives you in-game items or other kinds of rewards for doing objectives they want you to do in the game. UPlay doesn't bother me to be honest.\n\n- Enemies repeat their phrases a little bit too often, I wish they would slow down a little bit on the repetitive phrases even though they're funny to me.\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction is truly is worth owning if you enjoy sneaking around and murdering people who curse at you through the entire game like I do. The "Cons" of the game are definitely minor so don't let them keep you away from the fun!\n","March 13, 2014","true","44.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Basically, there is no real penalty for going commando with an automatic rifle (except for one level), also a new feature called "mark & execute" lets you take down up to 4 enemies at the same time with almost no skill involved, pretty fun at first but it makes the game a bit too easy, plus you get some wall-hacking goggles so yeah, the enemies dont stand a chance. Add to the mix some explosions, complot theories, a vengance-driven main character and you got the usual summer blockbuster call of duty-like game. Dont get me wrong, i like COD, and this is also a decent game but not a Splinter Cell one.

You still cannot go all gun blazing though, but this might prove itself to be a less hardcore stealth experience.\n\nAll in all, the game is still good, but if you prefer a more stealth-oriented experience, you would probably be better off with Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, or Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which is a more balanced mix between the first Splinter Cell games and the new gameplay of Conviction.","February 3","true","8.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

This one was honestly a bit lackluster compared to the rest of the series. It seemed like this game wasn't even about stealth. Then again, it could have been just how I played, but compared to the rest of the Splinter Cell series this seemed to lose all sense of stealth that I loved about this series. The weapon stash feature was unnecessary in my opinion. I don't know why Ubisoft tries to add weapon customization in their games, but it didn't work very well with this game. It only took about two missions to get full upgrades on the one pistol that I used throughout the entire game. I think I only used the automatic weapons for about 10 minutes throughout the whole game. Just seemed like a pointless feature to me.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are beautiful, I took screens of the ones that I liked most.\n- Interesting-ish story.\n- Interrogation methods are cool\n- Killing guys through windows\n- Explosions\n- Execution mode was interesting, although it would have worked better if it required the player to be more active in it, rather than just marking targets, pressing 'e', and letting it happen.\n\nCons:\n- Controls are wonky as ♥♥♥♥\n- Lack of quicksave ability\n- Lack of stealthy missions; The reason why I like the Splinter Cell games (in addition to the story) is because of how stealthy you can be. But this game it seemed like you just threw out a frag from behind cover, then once it blew up you would just shoot as many guys as you could. I wanted to go around in the shadows and grab guys, not just get headshots and move on.\n- Length; Only about 6 hours of gameplay in the solo campaign compared to Splinter Cell 1 and Chaos Theory which had 10-12 hours.\n- Weapon stash\n\nOverall the cons outweigh the pros with this game. However, if you're a Splinter Cell fan, you should still play this game just to say you played the whole series. Not worth it if you're just playing casually though... unless you like pretty graphics and explosions.","March 4, 2014","false","6.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

SC:Conviction isn't meant to be played like a pure stealth game therefore don't attempt to do so as more often than not shooting your way through everything is way more efficient.\n\nI however wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't care much for the story and is solely looking for a Splinter Cell in the gameplay trend of Chaos Theory or Double Agent, you aren't gonna find it in this one.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe game does offer Coop multiplayer but I didn't find it to be a lot of fun since it's just way too simple and lacks more mechanics in order to be interesting, furthermore the Coop mode is locked to 30 FPS which makes it a pain to play if you're used to higher framerates. Unlike in Splinter Cell's predecessors, there is no Spies vs. Mercs mode in this one.","March 17","true","15.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/33220/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Splinter Cell: Conviction is a good game for gamers that enjoy shooters, military, and a rich-linear campaign. Conviction is about Sam Fisher, an agent that has gone rogue following his work at the Third Echelon. He is on the hunt to find his daughter following a new Third Echelon leader chasing after Fisher to kill him. I have not played any main Splinter Cell games prior to this so I am not sure if it expands on the story. To note, I have not played the Deniable Ops mode, a mode that is using strategy to fend off numerous enemies, and I have not played multiplayer or co-op.\n\nCampaign: Conviction has a good campaign. The campaign clocked in at 6.4 hours on 'normal' difficulty. The story is rich in that there are many twists and turns in the campaign and a wide-variety of settings for the player to play. For example, we get a solid background of Fisher moving on from Third Echelon, to Third Echelon wanting him dead by using his daughter, to then utilising Third Echelon to reveal their overall goal in a great twist in the story.\n\nThe campaign is linear meaning you have to do that particular task, but still works well within the story of the game. The cut scenes are very nice and they flow well. However, I would have liked to see more variety in Fisher's gameplay. For example, when he is angry compared to his normal mood as it was the same despite his emotions.\n\nI feel the campaign could have been at least one-two hours longer.\n\nGameplay: Average gameplay. The gameplay was fluid and solid. The reasoning's is that things such as the execute ability and the gameplay from interrogation elements to using the environment were good.  It was really the little things in the gameplay that made me enjoy it as much as I did including the interrogation, or the cover system in relation to enemy movement, etc.\n\nHowever, there were numerous negatives with the gameplay stemming from the camera movement on Fisher when in cover and attempting to shoot enemies, to trying to shoot enemies and the inability to zoom in. In other words, certain elements of gameplay including the cover system felt entirely disjointed and took away a heap from the overall gameplay.\n\nTo get further longetivity out of the game, I think having slower gameplay that is more fluid would have made the game better, by producing more variety in movement. For example, making the transition from cover to cover slower to capture the feeling of needing to hurry and switch covers.\n\nGraphics and Dialogue: The graphics were surprisingly very good for a game released in 2011. To note, I played the game on Medium graphics out of the three options of low, medium, and high and the graphics were very nice. I felt this game wasn't overly optimised as my PC has specs much better than the recommended specs for this game but I could not achieve a constant and stable 60FPS, even I couldn't achieve a stable 30FPS, including no option to lock the game to 30FPS.\n\nThe dialogue is strong in Conviction. There is a heap of variety in each character's dialogue that truly captures all individual characters personality.\n\nExpansion: For $19.99, I would not recommend the Insurgency pack at all. If you are not going to play the Deniable Ops mode as that can get very boring without friends to play with, then there is no reason to purchase the Insurgency pack. If you have friends that regularly play games with you, purchase the Insurgency pack to get many hours more out of the game.\n\nOverall: The positives were there, but the main positive was the intense story that I thoroughly enjoyed. The negatives were just the typical bugs and glitches and the un-optimisation of the game. The game wasn't outstanding or great by all means but I think it was a good game. It was a fun story to engage in and for me being a fan of Tom Clancy, it was a solid addition in the series. For $17.99, I can provide a moderate recommendation to purchase the game, however I say purchase it if you have friends to play with as you can play all the modes with them. 7.5/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oni_dx/recommended/33220/","oni_dx","Oni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oni_dx/","37 products in account","I played the Splinter Cell series from the beginning, and this is almost categorically not Splinter Cell.\n\nThe narrative, I feel, is a failure, but it's a failure that began with the principle plot point in Double Agent (the apparent death of Sam's daughter, Sarah)—which Ubisoft was understandably obligated to resolve in Conviction. While I can say I mostly enjoyed DA, Sam himself started to become too wrapped up in the story. What made the first three games so eerie and interesting is that there were functionally two narratives: there was the geo-political narrative unfolding throughout each game, that we, as Sam, watched silently from the shadows, almost literally like a ghost, in which we were observers and not actors; and then there was the dark narrative in which we crept through the darkness, drifting from scene to scene in the larger picture. These two narratives, in each of the first four games, would in the end combine, as Sam stepped out of the shadows, finally, to assassinate someone. It was a slow burn—and that was Splinter Cell as I knew it.\n\nIn Conviction, this distinction has disappeared. There is only one narrative, and it's focused on Sam. Creeping in the shadows is only the precursor to the inevitable high-octane action that each sequence is designed around. You could play through Chaos Theory, the pinnacle of the Splinter Cell series, literally without being seen; this play style was not only accomodated; it was encouraged. But I guess casual gamers didn't have the patience or the interest to invest into another slow burn Splinter Cell.\n\nI haven't played Blacklist, but prior to its release I would have pegged Conviction as the death of the series.","December 24, 2014","false","12.8"," 55 of 105 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","55","105","3","5"

Floating objects, inconsistent framerate, low maximum resolution (1280x900), lag ingame and during movies even though my pc far exceeds the requirements, had to hit shift+tab to access the steam overlay atleast 3 times in order to exit or enter the steam overlay (which was then laggy itselft), required to have a ubisoft account to play and must install the ubisoft launcher and it must be running so long as the game is running.

I am a huge fan of the Tom Clancy franchise and have played since the original Rainbow Six, this incarnation of Splinter Cell however is just too much like all the rest. Sure it continues the story of Sam Fisher, and for its age kept the idea of the stealth-them-up feel and aspects like shooting lights to create shadows which are good things. It is however far far to linear. You go through the game in a series of scenarios thrown together with cutscenes in the middle. Throw a grenade in one section, wake up the whole world, kill them then progress to the next section where no-one seems any the wiser, other than the fact that they 'know you're out there Fisher'\nIf you can happily pass hours playing previous Splinter Cell titles then maybe this will be right up your alley, but join the saga here and I can only feel it will leave you unimpressed.","July 2, 2014","false","10.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

New features like interrogation segments also don't do much, apart from being something like inevitable, interactive cutscenes.\nWhat's worst is how the game consantly throws numerous enemies at you, expecting a combat reaction that can be felt as the only obvious choice you're always left with.\nWhat's that? You want to sneak past enemies? Forget it. That's almost impossible unless you go super hardcore and have the patience of a tortoise. There's no room for real stealth with the cramped level design and the act of going into a killing spree is forced in your face.\n\nOverall, this is almost nothing like what a Splinter Cell should be. The new stealth system took me too long to get used to but it does and by the time you do, it's an upset to what this game has turned out to be. Most SC oldschool fans can agree on this.\nThis is a simply shame, a pathetic attempt at appeasing the casuals by Ubisoft.","December 26, 2014","false","32.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

Enemy AI feels smart and some scenes really begin to shine (my favourite - Cafe). You really feel that you cant be a commando and need to think fast, plan and execute ambushes.\n- Graphics is great, but if you want even more vibrant colors and deeper shadows try SweetFx. Worked fine for me with SweetFx injector. it also allowed me to make in-game screenshots. But its not a must, though (as it was for me with Assassin's Creed 1)\n\nPRO's and CON's\n\nPRO's\n- Enemy AI is great (ON REALISTIC mode). They search the area, flank you, use grenades and flashbangs to smoke you out.  "Last known position" system is also brilliant. Really, i got a lot of fun from some of the scenes (Cafe, Airfield, Washington Monument). And i played them stealthy, constantly changing positions etc. It was also a fun to replay them. Clever game design.\n\n- Lots of related enemy chatters and i enjoyed them. Chatters are different in the beginning and on later stages (enemy want revenge).\n\n- Good longevity (not the Call of Duty or medal of Honor)\n\n- Locations are different, well-thought-out with lots of details. All action happens in Washington (2 scenes in Malta, but it really still feels like same city), but locations differ.\n\n- Graphics and animations\n\n- Weapon upgrades that are visible.\n\nCON's\n- Fisher feels more like a stupid bully, not a clever field agent. Even his commentaries - all leave an impression of his lower then average IQ and high aggression level. It just doesnt correlate with his knowledge of gadjets, tech,  etc.  That said, i also didnt liked "interrogations" Sam do. He acts like a plain bully and player just need to tap "E" to see the next part of it.\n\n- Narrative is good, but difficult to follow and being attached. If i knew the ending from the beginning, i wouldnt be dissapointed. Its the details and enemy chatters thoughout the game that make narrative feel satisfying.\n\n- Some scenes dont have side paths to be stealthy (i.e. White House). I know, you could kill anyone and remain not detected, but game was designed with lots of intense firefights in mind. Sometimes there is a wave of enemies thrown at you and while you can stay totally undetected, you dont feel the neediness to do this. Its easier to throw a frag grenade on some stages then crawling and stay hidden.\n\n- Uplay. Well, now its ok, but back a year ago i lost my save games because of it (save synch error) and was forced to start almost all over.","July 4, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemy AI feels smart and some scenes really begin to shine (my favourite - Cafe). You really feel that you cant be a commando and need to think fast, plan and execute ambushes.\n- Graphics is great, but if you want even more vibrant colors and deeper shadows try SweetFx. Worked fine for me with SweetFx injector. it also allowed me to make in-game screenshots. But its not a must, though (as it was for me with Assassin's Creed 1)\n\nPRO's and CON's\n\nPRO's\n- Enemy AI is great (ON REALISTIC mode). They search the area, flank you, use grenades and flashbangs to smoke you out.  "Last known position" system is also brilliant. Really, i got a lot of fun from some of the scenes (Cafe, Airfield, Washington Monument). And i played them stealthy, constantly changing positions etc. It was also a fun to replay them. Clever game design.\n\n- Lots of related enemy chatters and i enjoyed them. Chatters are different in the beginning and on later stages (enemy want revenge).\n\n- Good longevity (not the Call of Duty or medal of Honor)\n\n- Locations are different, well-thought-out with lots of details. All action happens in Washington (2 scenes in Malta, but it really still feels like same city), but locations differ.\n\n- Graphics and animations\n\n- Weapon upgrades that are visible.\n\nCON's\n- Fisher feels more like a stupid bully, not a clever field agent. Even his commentaries - all leave an impression of his lower then average IQ and high aggression level. It just doesnt correlate with his knowledge of gadjets, tech,  etc.  That said, i also didnt liked "interrogations" Sam do. He acts like a plain bully and player just need to tap "E" to see the next part of it.\n\n- Narrative is good, but difficult to follow and being attached. If i knew the ending from the beginning, i wouldnt be dissapointed. Its the details and enemy chatters thoughout the game that make narrative feel satisfying.\n\n- Some scenes dont have side paths to be stealthy (i.e. White House). I know, you could kill anyone and remain not detected, but game was designed with lots of intense firefights in mind. Sometimes there is a wave of enemies thrown at you and while you can stay totally undetected, you dont feel the neediness to do this. Its easier to throw a frag grenade on some stages then crawling and stay hidden.\n\n- Uplay. Well, now its ok, but back a year ago i lost my save games because of it (save synch error) and was forced to start almost all over.","July 4, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

MaE (Mark and Execute) is such a useful ability. Story line is great, Sam Fisher tracking down Reed was intense. Ugh! I don't know what to say. Can't wait till I get Blacklist, bound to be amazing. One thing I'd say though is the mission length, I like long missions and only a couple satified me in terms of length. But apart from that, it was worth buying. The Ops missions are great, infiltration personally is my favourite, could have had more maps to choose from. Weapon choice is fabulous, Desert Eagle for pounding people, or the silenced weapons for stealthy takedowns. Great!

Modern Splinter Cell games, when they come out, are a real treat. Coming up behind a guy to knock him out, and then marking someone across the room to take out instantly is rewarding as Hell. This game rewards you constantly for playing smart, and will not hesitate to end you if you want to play stupid. You can still get by playing this game as a run and gun, it lets you, but it makes the game harder. That player choice is a nice touch.\nWeapon and armor upgrades make things easier by giving you quality of life changes, or make you look cooler, and there's a pretty good system for that. I have my own personal favourite setup or two.\n\nMaybe the controls are somewhat odd.\nThe story is honestly a forgettable action movie.\nThe unlock system in this can be really challenging if you decide to change what you use later.\nAnd sometimes it can be pointless feeling to play solo.\n\nIf you and a friend are thinking about playing this for the co-op section, I really had a lot of fun with that myself. I can give a solid recommendation for this game based off of it's mechanical and variety-based merits for sure.","August 1, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first one was awesome just for introducing such a stealthy game. The second one got even better whilst the third game actually was the best of the series. Double Agent had lots of bugs but a nice idea though. Conviction was no longer a Splinter Cell game. It can be a series on its own. But it actually was a shame for all those classy Splinter Cell games.\nFirst of all no Splinter Cell game would ever have needed a cover system like the one in Conviction. Besides that why does everything turn white and black once you are in the Shadows? It is a nice feature but not needed at all. And why the hell do I have to kill every single enemy I approach?\nI want to knock them out and carry them away after luring them in my direction by whistleing. But none of these features which made the Splinter Cell series amazing existed in Conviction anymore. Even the interrogations which were kind of funny sometimes and revealed useful information did not exist in Conviction anymore.\nDo not get me wrong Conviction is a good game with some nice features but it ain't a Splinter Cell.

There is lack of any optimization for PC platform. There are numerous occasions where game starts lack as hell. On Radeon FX8120, Radeon 7850 2GB 8GB RAM it slows down to 5-10fps (sometimes it is even couple of seconds for one frame). It is very hard to enjoy a game when it runs that way.\n\nOn second this is more like COD game then Splinter Cell. It is totally linear, no other ways how to solve situation. And when there is another way it is very hard to evade enemies with not functional cover mechanics and bad third person camera. Also checkpoints are few and when you want to go silently it could be very frustrating repeating sections of game over and over again.\n\nDespite of it's flaws the game has good level design and graphics. What I liked is autoshoot mode when you mark targets and then Sam makes effective elimination (to use this ability you must do melee kill first before you can use it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/33220/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Splinter Cell Conviction is a 3rd person action game released by Ubisoft in 2010. It is a sequel to Splinter Cell Double Agent, and continues the storyline of Sam Fisher and Third Echelon.\n\nSplinter Cell Conviction sees you guiding Sam Fisher as he tries to discover what happened to his daughter, and fights the same agency that employed you in the previous Splinter Cell games. The gameplay is similar to the previous entries, with emphasis put on finding cover in the environment. To help you stick to the shadows, the game turns black and white while you are hidden. There are a variety of gadgets available to you that fans of the earlier games will recognize. The gunplay is satisfying, however I did not find myself using much but the pistol for most of the game. Although there are other weapons available, usually the best method was just to sneak up close and go for the headshot. I'm assuming that there were ways to sneak through many areas undetected, however my Sam Fisher is a genocidal maniac, so if any enemies managed to survive the game, it was purely by mistake.\n\nThe graphics, sound and voice acting are top notch, as is usually expected from Ubisoft. They catch some flak for bugs and Uplay, but they always seem to bring it in those areas. I didn't experience any bugs, however I did play the game close to 5 years after release, so I imagine they were all ironed out by then.\n\nThe storyline is standard Splinter Cell fare. It's been a little while since I played Double Agent, so I found myself at times getting confused as to who was who. The general gist of what was going on wasn't hard to comprehend though. The story took about 4-5 hours to go through, which is a little shorter than I expected, but was a fun ride while it lasted. Also, who knew that slamming heads into tables is the world's best interrogation technique? Sam Fisher knew.\n\nOverall I'd recommend Splinter Cell Conviction, even this long after release. It's a short, focused thriller that is enjoyable for the 4-5 hours that it takes. I didn't try the multiplayer because I have to assume it's dead by now, but the single player is worth the price.\n\nGrade: B+","January 15, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Veeery disappointing...\nWhere is the pacifism? You cannot go through this game without killing. Unlike the old Sam Fisher, this one is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off! I understand why he is and you can find out why playing through, the shocking truth. But still, you do not have the choice to go through the game knocking people unconscious. This is my main complaint.\nPlus, the game feels like it was developed in a rush. Hell I was able to finish missions just throwing people out of windows without anyone finding me.\nNothing impressive except for the interrogation scenes, although the developers only decided to make some good effort on the first interrogation, then it's all the same scene over and over with different (poor) characters.\nOut of all Splinter Cells, this one is a fail. Looking forward to play Blacklist. I hope it puts the game back on its original track!\nI would only recommend this game for stealth enthusiasts and for its great story turn. After all, I'm still a fan of the franchise.","January 28, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Gone are absolutely any stealth mechanics from the previous games, and instead what you have is a super spy who can't hit the broad side of a barn and moves like a massive drunk. To compensate for this, he can hide behind boxes.\n\nEvery mission is a Call of Duty mission, where the moment you walk into a room, the enemy knows you're there. The difference is that you can hide behind a box or hang outside of a window until they spot you. The moment you kill someone, everyone knows exactly where you are.\n\nThere is an insult masquerading as a "stealth" mechanic. If you're in the cover of shadow, the screen goes black and white. However, absolutely anywhere you need to go is brightly lit by no less than ten light bulbs. If you shoot any one of these, the enemies immediately know where you are. This is okay, as they will know you are there at some point, without fail, anyway. If you want to be found out even faster, simply open a window. If there are ten windows in a room and four of them are open before you arrive, all of the enemies  will know which ones were already open and immediately be on alert if a previously closed window is open.\n\nThe entire time you play the game, the enemies will call out to you by name because they absolutely know who you are and that you're there 100% of the time. "You're just embarassing yourself, Fisher," they'll say. "We're not going in there. Why don't you come to us instead," they say as they totally come in there, anyway, and find you because there's not really anything you can do about it.\n\nYou can't move or hide bodies, there are no guard paths to consider, and there's no stealth whatsoever. Ghosting isn't a thing. You simply move into a room, find a way to drunkenly kill everyone who now enters said room and knows you're there, and then move on to the next exact same encounter. Spy tools you're given include grenades, different grenades, a mirror, other kinds of grenades, and a way to simultaneously temporarily disable any lights near you and give your position away to absolutely everyone.\n\nAs a CoD game, this one rates 2 out of 10. With the words "Splinter" and "Cell" in the title, it drops to a 0.","August 31, 2014","false","17.7"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","16","32","4","3"

I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."\n\nStory You are Samuel Fisher. an ex-spy who worked for the mysterious agency, called Third Echelon, don't know what happened to the first or second, but this one is the third.\nWith a twist of events from the last game, "Splinter Cell: Double Agent" you were forced to kill your own boss to stop a terrorist attack from being taken place in America.\nAfter the events, Third Echelon slowly fell into corruption, with a new head of command, they kicked you out of the agency, took your daughter, and now you, Samuel Fisher is coming back, as the enemy, to save your daughter and destroy Third Echelon.\nOr at least that's how I remembered it.\nSplinter Cell Conviction delivers a thrilling story line that never cuts the action.\nIt's drama, intensity, long dialogue and emotional voice acting was a first to the series.\nThis isn't just another spy vs terrorist story line.\n\nGameplay Splinter Cell Conviction reinvented the stealth formula, opting for more stalking in the shadows and fast pace action.\nThe mark and execute ability, I think is a great change, it really makes you feel like James Bond as an American rogue agent, out for revenge.\nWhat I love about this game is that it really sells the atmosphere, instead if floating objective markers, the game uses holographed white text on walls: http://blog.gaming.stackexchange.com/files/2011/06/Splinter_Cell_Conviction_4_X10.jpg\nhttp://media.gamerevolution.com/images/misc/splinter-cell-conviction-tutorial.jpg\nAnd instead of a floating light bar to tell the player their in darkness, when the player enters a dark area, the color bleeds out of the screen, turning black and white.\nThis is one of the most immersive games I have ever played.\n\nGraphics The game is surprisingly beautiful, the game world is rich with color, the lighting is splendid and the textures are detailed. It also helps that the game's frame rate is really consistent.\n\nAlthough looked down upon die hard fans, Splinter Cell Conviction is a fantastic action adventure game that is worth your time and money.","November 6, 2015","true","30.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","9"

Yes, I played the first games (also really love the first one) but the action in this game is so satisfying I simply had to restart the game after I finished it for the first time. I don't get why people hate this game. It actually does something new for a Splinter Cell game. Sure, there is room for improvement (I didn't miss it, but I guess dragging bodies around could be a feature again, and maybe some more gadgets), but I guess that's something for the new Splinter Cell. I just hope the gameplay will stay the same. If you love the previous SC games (or never played them) and have an open mind for new stuff make sure you try this out ! And if you cherish the previous ones with a passion skip this one.

The console version was great (looking over the horrible network issues it has), and the PC version is just as good, HOWEVER: the campaign is littered with mouth sync issues, the invasive DRM makes the game take FOREVER to start up, audio settings are not as good as the consoles (it's either can hear them kinda or not at all), the visuals are par with the 360.\n\nIF YOU ARE A VETERAN OF SC GAMES: This game plays quite a bit differently than previous titles. There is more focus on elimating all the guards rather than a focus on  stealth. Stealth elements are there, but it is no where near the same degree as the original Splinter Cell game.\n\nThat said, this is definitely a game you should play. It is much easier to get into than previous Splinter Cell games. This is also not a game for children. Violence-wise, this is on the level of a Jason Bourne movie. The key turn off is the amount of language. The f-bomb will be dropped a ton.","November 29, 2010","true","10.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

For me, when I first downloaded the game, the sound was all good for the cut scene's, but then there wouldn't be the slightest bit of sound during the gameplay, and then come back for the next cutscene. All you have to do is uninstall, and then redownload it, and everything is perfect.\n\nAside from this.\n\nAs you can see, I don't think I played enough of this game to qualify myself for a review, but I want to write a review.\n\nSo far, this isn't like any Splinter Cell, this isn't a bad thing, but it is at the same time. When I first played Splinter Cell back in the day, it was a strange concept to me, to have to try to not kill anyone, but rather either use stealth and avoid the sentries completely, or knock them out, and that's what I loved about it, it was a challenge to attempt to not kill, get close to every guy, use your mind to interact with the area around you.\n\nThis game, there isn't even an option to not kill, there's either kill, or lose. What makes it worse is, because of this, it's much easier. This is the first Splinter Cell, I found myself switching the difficulty to the hardest.\n\nIt's still a Splinter Cell because you can't go in an area guns blazing, you still have that small realistic couple bullets and your done thing like the other Splinter Cell's, but the killing makes everything so easy, it's ridiculous.\n\nNevertheless, still fun enough to get, and you can't go wrong with $20 right now, so I recommend it, but bottom line is, that this isnt' like the other Splinter Cell's, so if you're looking for a good game, with the Splinter Cell storyline, get it, if you're a hardened fan that can only play a Splinter Cell like the old ones, I'm telling you you're going to be dissapointed.","March 1, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This in my opinion is the best Splinter Cell game out there, even better than blacklist. This game contains well-made levels and environments for you to progress through and a brilliant story with great characters. The stealth in the game is good, but I feel the future has better to come. The way this game makes you progress through the levels makes you feel like a badass, as do many little details in this game. The engine for this game is good, gameplay is fun but not too fluid (caused by stealth elements), dialogues are good and help story along well, AI is good but not amazing, and the graphic and sound quality both stand up more than fine today. The co-op in this game is also brilliant and fun to play with friends. There aren't really any complaints with this game. One of my all-time favourite game experiences.

But once i finished double agent and came to this i noticed in fact if this game was something else other than what it is it would have sucked, This game needs no stealth because it doesnt fit it sam is looking for revenge thats why this game is much more like max payne than splinter cell. the story is just amazing the cutscenes are beautiful i really really recommend it for both COOP story and Single player story.\n\nAbout The COOP, unlike chaos theory the coop in conviction has a story line I STRONGLY recommend you playing this game and its coop and finish it both in one day none stop specially the coop because all 4 mission are continue of each other, they start where the last mission ends. once you finished both SP and COOP buy splinter cell blacklist because COOP in blacklist is continued of conviction coop but you only notice this at the ending level of blacklist.\n\nATTENTION: Multiplayer has issues it doesnt work most of the times but the solution is simple just buy the game on steam and use hamachi or Tunngle and then use the game LAN option to connect to each other that works all the time.","March 9, 2014","true","68.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has some action parts, but it blends in fine. I don't really have anything bad to say about the game itself, however the co-op mode has one big issue: a ♥♥♥♥ing framerate cap. Yep. In multiplayer, your framerate is locked at 30 FPS for no apparent reason other than Ubisoft being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you can't do ♥♥♥♥ about it.  It can even drop lower than that because you share the same framerate as your partner to "keep the game in sync". Right. Because running a game at 15 FPS on a gaming rig sure is perfectly normal. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Also uplay sucks. Why would you put this game on Steam if it still forces you to install and use Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game store that crashes all the time and keeps deleting your save data. Seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft, get your ♥♥♥♥ together. They could've easily patched all of this, but NOPE, let's just ignore the legit customers, as always. DRM doesn't prevent piracy, it only ♥♥♥♥s things up for those of us who actually bought the game.\n\nSo, it's a good game but you should pirate it.","July 24, 2012","false","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Graphics look like a game made yesterday and storyline, epic. Controls are a little difficult to master at first but it doesn't take long to get used to them. Sam Fisher has made an amazing return in this not-so-new game and he is angry. I wont spoil anything incase you do buy the game but it is bloody awesome. This is also the first splinter cell game to introduce the 'Mark and Excecute' ability. This ability enables you to put a mark above up to 4 hostile's heads and then kill all of them with the press of one button (if they're all visible). So much fun. But, you can only use the ability after performing a hand-to-hand takedown/human sheild. So it's alot of fun when you grab a guy for a human sheild with the press of one button, and then press another button to blow out the brains of four other people. Awesome way to clear out a room. Even better when it shoots in slow motion. Looks awesome. I first got this game about half a year ago, and i can not stop playing it.

Your mission is to kill 2,000 braindead potty-mouths. Your enemy will never shutup and never figure out how not leave his head exposed while taking cover. When the enemy comes to look for you they like to stare at the wall or the ground and give up if your not hiding in the wall or if your not laying on the ground.. I guess... It's a rather silly game. With silly enemies... Silly weapons that have unlimited ammo and just a lot of silliness. It's not terrible because its so easy to whiz through.

Graphics look like a game made yesterday and storyline, epic. Controls are a little difficult to master at first but it doesn't take long to get used to them. Sam Fisher has made an amazing return in this not-so-new game and he is angry. I wont spoil anything incase you do buy the game but it is bloody awesome. This is also the first splinter cell game to introduce the 'Mark and Excecute' ability. This ability enables you to put a mark above up to 4 hostile's heads and then kill all of them with the press of one button (if they're all visible). So much fun. But, you can only use the ability after performing a hand-to-hand takedown/human sheild. So it's alot of fun when you grab a guy for a human sheild with the press of one button, and then press another button to blow out the brains of four other people. Awesome way to clear out a room. Even better when it shoots in slow motion. Looks awesome. I first got this game about half a year ago, and i can not stop playing it.

To give you an idea, when I first started to play it, one friend send me the following messages:\n"I just want to know"\n"Why"\n\nAnd I immediatly felt ashamed of playing that game. Because I knew. I knew, but it was in a pack, so I should as well play it right?...\n\nYeah, it's THAT game of the serie. You know the one which for the fans of a serie officially doesn't exist.\n\nWhere to start... Let's just talk about the positives. It's relatively stable and doesn't crash, and the interrogations are ridiculously over the top.\n\nThat... Pretty much covers it.\n\nNow, for the "rest". It's no longer a stealth game. It kinda try to be one a little, but it's definitively not. The problem is, while it tries to be a third person shooter, the lack of accuracy and the fact it obviously wasn't made to be one makes it fall flat on both aspects. Characters models are ugly, like, it's like if they were back to between Splinter Cell 1 and 2 in terms of ugly. The animations are worse and melee kills feel ridiculous(and characters often glitch all over the place in ridiculous ways with ennemies launching into the air in stupid poses or collapsings like a sack of polygons), explosions are even worse, making ennemies stickdolls instead of ragdolls, because they are so rigid while being blasted by explosives of various shapes and kinds. Grimdotir looks like some kind of troll face put on what is supposed to be a sexy body, making her look like an abomination. Controls are very impractical, with a scheme that is more than questionable. Yes, you can remap everything, but it's worth mentioning they get the default controls "wrong". Run is toggle instead of a press to use. Game is ridiculously short and can be finished easyly in 5 hours for a first playthrough, cutscenes included.\n\nAs such, you don't have a save feature, because, well... There is nothing really worth saving in this game anyway. Literally.\n\nThe story is super bland, with the classic "oh my god, they want to blow an EMP in a major city" threat. They try to do something with Fischer's daughter and Grim, but it feels forced and just doesn't work. People in general are so bland you won't even bother remembering their names. The art direction choice of putting big texts and pictures on flat surfaces as you progress through the game tries to be "cool", but just feels stupid and in the way. It's like they were trying to copy David Cage. By the way, that's an insult, just so you know. The only difference is the lack of JASOOOOON and QTE.\n\nThe coop may be interesting, if there was, you know, people still playing it, and if it wasn't working around the mechanics of the regular game, which are, as I said, not good.\n\nOh, and they also took the mark and execute system from Ghost Recon, because if there is one thing Ubisoft is a world leader at, it's reusing assets. It's not a bad system, assuming it's well implemented. It's not in that game.\n\nThis game is overall a disaster everyone would like to forget, and the one everyone brings when some over enthusiasts fans say Splinter Cell is "the best video game serie". Sorry guys, but Conviction would pretty much single handedly shot down any pretention to that title any video game serie would have, if the PC version of Double Agent didn't do that already.\nDon't even bother buying that, you're better without it, believe me.\n\nTo finish on a positive note, at least you aren't constantly attacked by eagles or have to endure constant honey badger meme references while playing it.","May 28","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"Come out ***sy!" "We'll find you Fisher!"... The cheese monsters haunt me forever now... never forget.\n\nNow in all seriousness, Ubisoft could have honestly gotten a better writer for this game. Like, prefferably someone with a G.E.D and who doesn't write a story like a junior high student would. (Not saying I could do better, but the dialogue was terrible. To the point where I grew so annoyed with it I just stopped. Barely made it past the 3 mission I believe.\n\nControl scheme was a little awkward... The one thing I seriously hated with a passion was the bloody shift key press to run/walk. Not hold, just tap the key and go. Now while I can see how some people like that, I always preferred holding down the shift key to sprint because I know for a fact when my pinky finger comes off of the key, I can go super stealth mode again.\n\nI'll be honest, I bought the game because I played Splinter Cell double agent as a child. And I was lucky enough to recieve a refund for the transaction.\nActual game score imo; 2/10. 2 only because of nostalgia.

I have mixed feelings for this game. I like it. But on the other hand, I hate it. Not because it changed Splinter Cell but because it's so frustrating to play and I want to bash my controller on the dev's heads! What were they thinking? In Deniable Ops, no restart to checkpoint, I can only die if I want to retry the checkpoint???! WHAT?! Stupid devs can't even program nowadays! Also, how come in Realistic mode, enemies can suddenly see in the dark?! It's so weird! I'm in the shadows, duh, the screen is completely black and white and someone can spot me from 20 meters away?! What?? Also, there's too much reliance on a single context sensitive button. It can be more fluid but many times, it can allow unintended actions.\nNow the changes are good. The BEST cover system in any video game and Sam moves more fluidly. It is also easier to shoot and kill people.\n\nIf the devs took more time to program and not rush to release it, this game would have gotten a better rating from me.

This is possibly the game that made Splinter Cell purists like me feel betrayed while we played this P.O.S. I am a huge Splinter Cell fan and when I played this, I honestly didn't feel like it was part of the franchise. I will explain why.\n\nLet's start with Sam's character. Everything I loved about Sam in the first three games have been boiled down into an unlikable sob. His humor, wit, and actual personality has blown away to making him a CoD-like protagonist. His focus is his daughter who was believed to be dead in the last game, Double Agent. Let me show how he re-enacts the Story: "Boo Hoo,   the one I love is dead, and now my old agency is going after me, what should I do? What's that? Bourne Supremacy? Never heard of it." Other than that, The Story is pathetic as the writing is cliche, at best. I am not going to explain the trainwreck of the story, but I will explain one of the events: The main villain becomes the president by killing the old one. Because you know, that's how politics work.\n\nThe gameplay is also abysmal. Let's start with the AI: It is possibly the worst I've ever seen in a Triple-A product. In fact, I will say 7 Days to Die's AI is better than this, and at least the zombies in that game don't walk into walls or stand motionless. The AI constantly shouts out swear-words at you, giving away their positions, they spray their weapons when they fully spotted you, and constantly do so AT THE SAME SPOT even when you move away when people from another country away could of seen you doing so, and they call it "clear" by checking the same three square yards of floorspace. So If the terrible AI doesn't scare you away, the level design, combat,  save system, and gameplay features overall will do the job. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory had Gigantic levels free to explore but it was set on a linear path. Fine with me, but Conviction is NOTHING but linear, small levels. My 2400 square foot house is bigger than one of these levels. Gee, no wonder why it looks like the game spent all it's money on making the game look pretty. A+ Graphics = linear levels because the game devs usually don't want to put all time and effort into putting beautiful textures into a gigantic level. The combat itself is actually good, but it fails for Splinter Cell combat because Stealth combat is meant to be clunky and difficult to make you focus on stealth itself. In this game, you can headshot everyone with "Liam Neeson approved" precision and clear the room without troubles. Good for a shooter, but terrible for a stealth game. The save system is checkpoint based, which is a bad choice for a Stealth Game. You can finish the game in an hour by running through all the levels alerting every guard, cat, and flea and they cannot do anything when you see the Three dots in the top-left corner of the screen. And on to the features. You can move cover to cover by pointing out a spot on the screen and Sam will just move there. It feels like I am a man riding on Sam Fisher's back projecting him where to go like he is a horse. Knocking out-oh wait: KILLING guards without using guns will allow you to use the Execute Function, which means you can point out two guards and Sam will kill them for you. Carrying bodies is now removed, enemy interrogations is reduced to Major Characters, all non-lethal gameplay is cut out, and hiding focuses on an on/off in the dark feature. You are now either unseen or not rather than the in the middle like in SC:CT. (EDIT: I forgot to put this in, it took me about 5-6 hours to Complete. SC:CT took me about 14 hours to complete. Add that to the list of what sucks about the game.)\n\nIt's not Splinter Cell. It's just another Soulless, Shooter based AAA-Entry to add to the pile. Token nods to the Original games for at least being stealth games. This is nothing Like Splinter Cell. It is too focused on Combat, has numerous issues in Gameplay that both is bad choice making and  lacking the Splinter Cell feel, riddled with Bugs in Cutscenes and in actual gameplay, terrible voice acting, abysmal storytelling and writing, and I can go on.\n\nSo in conclusion, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ABOMINATION if you want to try out Splinter Cell. Buy The first game, Chaos Theory, or even Blacklist if you want a good time. Buy Blacklist if you want similar but more thought out and balanced gameplay with original features and AI that can tie it's freaking shoes. Buy The First Game, Pandora Tomorrow (If you can find it) or Chaos Theory if you want to play the best. Just... Pass this one over. You will thank me.","June 9, 2015","false","7.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

Picking up bodies is supposed to be a standard in stealth games which Conviction lacked, sadly. Regenerative health was done right as it took only a few shots for Sam to die. The gadgets were decent but I was left hoping they were more effective. Mark and Execute was a fun feature. It made things easy but I also found lots of utility for it. But all in all, the gameplay lacked variety.\n\nThe stealth segments were great and usually very tough. There was no option to distract guards without being detected so the only course left was to kill or sneak around them. It made stealth a lot more challenging this way. The absence of air vents was a welcome subtraction from a game belonging to the stealth genre.\n\nAI was buggy. Enemies would either behave very intelligently or play entirely dumb. At times, even those Sonar goggle ninjas were unable to pinpoint my position. Enemy AI took a lot away from the overall experience.\n\nMission structures were decent. Level design was great and the settings very picturesque but the missions, themselves, were fairly linear. The plot was made to appear complex but there was very little underneath the surface actually.\nThe presentation was excellent! The way objectives would get projected on the walls........ very cool stuff.\n\nI wish this game was more feature-rich and had a better variety of gameplay elements. Conviction had almost everything in its favour but Ubisoft blew it.

Problem with stealth games is that they are not very interesting when they are simplified. And this game does try to make a Splinter Cell game more accesible.\n\nIt is less of a stealth game as a stealth combat game. Many encounters are forced on you. You can avoid killing some of the enemies but it feels very wierd doing so. The game encourages you to smash people faces and playing differently so means missing game's main attraction.\n\nThe stealth-combat itself is ok. There are some systems I quite don't like. There are many things the game likes to do for the player. There is the "execution" which allows you to mark up to three enemies and after press of a button watch Sam shoot those poor buggers. There is the cover system, which allows you to move from cover to cover just by showing Sam were to go. While it works well in theory it is too disconnected to be satisfiying. It is not a player doing any of that. You are just watching animations playing out. I want to be Sam Fisher. Not watch Sam Fisher doing stuff. It gets old very quickly.\n\nAnd that is the biggest problem with the game. The simplified stealth system isn't enough to keep the game interested even though the campaign is criminally short. The devs seems to be aware of that as they try to vary things a bit (there is a middle section which is a terrible third person shooter set in Iraque with a very vague connection to the rest of the plot. There is also one section focusing on spying on people via cameras followed by a scripted chase scene.)\n\nStealth systems like this one works just fine in games like Arkham series, where they are one of many attractions. This game gets repetitive too quickly in a too short campaign. And it is shame as level design is probably better than in any previous SCs allowing to approach enemies in various ways.\n\nAlso the controls. There is one button, which is use for everything - from opening doors to climbing and pressing switches. Good luck guessing what Sam will do when he stands to three or more interactible objects.\n\nPlus the story is garbage. Oh and AI. Gosh they are stupid.\n\nThe presentation is nice though. I did find the idea of having objectives projected on walls a bit strage though.","October 24, 2014","false","6.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It has nice graphics, good sticky cover, fun gameplay and a few well designed levels, but.....  As a Splinter Cell sequel it completely blows and betrays the whole idea of SC gameplay. Instead of making it more open ended like Thief 1 or 2 They`ve decided to dumb it down completely. It has checkpoints, a binary light/shadow system, forced action sequences and the mark & execute nonsense. You also can`t jump freely or adjust your movement speed with the mouse wheel. Non lethal takedowns and the function of moving bodies around were also cut from the game :(\n\nAnd why oh why do I need to use Uplay when I bought it from Steam ?","July 19, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game adds a lot of replayability with the Deniable Ops missions, which can be tackled alone or with a friend.  That brings me to the only negative I have for this game...the online connection has been extremely wonky and unreliable, so bear that in mind up front.

You hid in shadows, picked locks, and tried to finish a level without being detected. You tapped into security cameras, or planted your own, to learn combinations and secrets so you could advance sneakily through a level. There was an immense thrill to being a master covert spy.\n\nSo what has happened to the franchise? This game still promises stealth - you can sneak, hide, duck - but it's much easier to go in guns-blazing and shoot everybody. There are certain levels where mass-murder is the *only* option. Where is the brooding yet honourable Sam Fisher that everybody used to love? This Sam Fisher is a serial-killer scumbag. This feels like yet another generic-shooter with shadows tacked on so they can claim it's a Splinter Cell game.\n\nThe graphics are good - not standout, but generically average - and the sound is fine. Controls are competently designed. But the level designs are hopeless. Every level felt like a chore. The interrogation scenes are gratuitous violence of zero consequence.\n\nI get the feeling that the publisher forced the studio to simplify the game, to appeal to a wider audience. But this game has been dumbed down into nothingness. Just like porridge, it might sustain you, but there's nothing enjoyable in the experience.","December 28, 2014","false","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nice graphics, good sticky cover, fun gameplay and a few well designed levels, but.....  As a Splinter Cell sequel it completely blows and betrays the whole idea of SC gameplay. Instead of making it more open ended like Thief 1 or 2 They`ve decided to dumb it down completely. It has checkpoints, a binary light/shadow system, forced action sequences and the mark & execute nonsense. You also can`t jump freely or adjust your movement speed with the mouse wheel. Non lethal takedowns and the function of moving bodies around were also cut from the game :(\n\nAnd why oh why do I need to use Uplay when I bought it from Steam ?","July 19, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only two complaints I have about the system are that it just generally feels like cheating and that sometimes it bugs out. Sometimes in your favor and you kill a guy that just ran behind a wall. Sometimes not and you waste your execute.\n\nIt has the now standard 8 hour single player story and several co-op modes that are definitely a blast to play. The matchmaking has been broken since day one so don't figure that into your purchase unless you have a friend to play with.\n\nThe controller support is also janky and unless you have an official wired 360 controller I'd suggest sticking with mouse and keyboard.\n\nI personally liked the game a lot as a long time fan of the series, but for someone who isn't, it's good that the game has dropped in price like it has. Totally worth it at the current price point.","February 11, 2011","true","115.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now this is a change in the gameplay from the previous SC titles. It's more fast paced, action orientated and Fisher is just as agile as Ezio Auditore but the game is great. A strong, compelling storyline that has you hooked from the start, it really does feel like your playing The Bourne Identity, heh.\n\nUnfortunately the stealth element iis downgraded. Don't get me wrong, you can get up close with people and take them down, but at some points it's just easier to blast them in the head from a distance and then continue.  Another downside is being 'in the dark' because if you're like me, 70% of the game will be in black & white. And you can't carry bodies to hide them.\n\nNevertheless, the music kicks ♥♥♥, the gameplay is fast and smooth. This game suffered from a lot of issues and I was unable to play it online back in 2010 but it's fixed.

His friend lays dead in the bushes merely ten-to-fifteen meters away. Well-trained eyes adapted for night-time hunting, you track the guard's movement, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Something happens though, he sees his buddy's foot with his flashlight, rushing over to confirm that, yes, he is indeed dead. Now the entire area is under alert, but not yet ready to call in reinforcements. To them it's possible that the attacker left. You know better, and plan to snap the whistleblower's neck when he's not looking. Coming back around the guard shines his light up and right at you. He's close enough to shoot. You're high enough to pounce. In one fluid movement you bounce off the ledge and onto the guard below, silencing him as you surely will with the rest of his friends inside.\n\nTo anyone who's never played Splinter Cell before, that's pretty damn new. To those who have, it's still new. Splinter Cell: Conviction gets a bad rep from old Agents, most of which is because its different. That "Death From Above" moment pulled in the above description? For most intents and purposes, doesn't happen in earlier games. Gameplay is vastly different than older Splinter Cell titles. From its use of regenerating health to "Mark and Execute" which is an instant-kill button, much of Conviction feels like a AAA blockbuster shooter. And you'd be right; it feels almost exactly like one.\n\nYou can mark targets and track them through just about anything. You'll take cover and pop-up to take pot shots at goon's heads. And you'll pretty much kill a whole bunch of henchmen before going into a high-octane firefight. It sounds more like Call of Duty or Battlefield rather than the Splinter Cell so many grew up with. Dragging bodies and non-lethal takedowns have gone MIA as well, nowhere in a stealth game which should have them. And many Splinter Cell veterans have slandered and outright insulted the game just on that alone. The motives were clear; make money by making the learning curve easier. By no means though will any CoD fan be able to master this game simply by picking it up. Like earlier titles, stealth is something that is learned. It's easier to tell when you're hidden too, the world around you turning black and white with the exception of bad guys. If the world is in color, then that means you're able to be seen easily.\n\n"But ScoutS3an," You may ask. "Why would this make it a bad game to the veterans? Wouldn't this be giving them a break?" You'd be right, but Splinter Cell veterans (at least ones I've seen) love the challenge of completing a mission by knocking just about everyone out and never being spotted. As such, they slander Conviction for being too action-y and too fast-paced. Which is true. But like Sam Fisher, some fans have adapted to the change. And Splinter Cell's story, in my view, does have some reasoning behind these big changes. Hiding bodies? You're not leaving any witnesses who can tell their friends where you are, especially when the NSA is one of them. Don't think you can get through this next room stealthily? Does it matter when there's no government that could exploit it?\n\nConviction's story picks up after Double Agent, roughly three or so years after it. Sam Fisher, ex-NSA and ex-Third Echelon, along with being the world's first Splinter Cell, has left Third Echelon. Clues behind his daughter Sarah's mysterious killer leads him around the world to find leads, ending up in Malta. Contacted by his old friend, Anna Grimsdoitter, he helps her solve a conspiriacy involving Third Echelon in exchange for one thing: Sarah. I won't spoil it, but the story is a standard affair to some extent, though I've felt it was better and less hollywood-inspired than Call of Duty's. And it's my main reasoning behind Sam's radically different style of operating: He doesn't work for 3E anymore. Why bother leaving all those loose ends when you could just silence anyone who stands in your way.\n\nCo-Op is the same way, though I'd think Archer and Kestrel would at least have the option to use non-lethal moves considering they're employed by 3E and Voron respectively. And the co-op story is set some amount of time before the main story. I haven't played it in a while so you'll need to figure that one on your own.\n\nReally, the only reason I picked up the game on Steam was to get the deluxe stuff for Deniable Ops, which is something the older games severly lack; a terrorist-hunt styled game mode which can help the good get better at the game.\n\nWill finish review when I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ to wake up on time.","March 8, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can only be put that way since the game can get quite tedious in places but all in all, its very playable and the story line makes sense throughout.\n\nWhen I want to kick back, relax and play something, I'd grab the controller and give this game the time it deserves. I wouldn't recommend Keyboard + Mouse however, since it was designed around a controller. Works perfectly though and you can blast through the highes difficulty with ease.\n\nGot friends? Play some Co-Op, You'll not be dissapointed and very rewarding. Final conclusion: A must have for casual gamers. Graphics are on par, story is perfect and content is always being updated with more weapons.\n\n4 / 5","November 21, 2010","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great even.  As a longtime fan of the Splinter Cell series, I was definitely wary going into this one.  From the previews and videos I'd seen, I expected something completely out of the spirit of Splinter Cell.  My expectations were pretty accurate, but surprisingly the game departed from the series in an interesting and satisfying way.  The Mark and Execute feature in particular is a great twist on the series' traditional slow-paced, tactical gameplay.  In the old games, you'd stalk guards until they were isolated and take them out one by one, silently (or sneak past them).  But with this new ability, the developers have boiled down that old method to one which is much less tedious but still gets the same point across.  Now you stalk down and silently kill one guard, then strategically position yourself and take out the rest with one fell swoop.  It combines the tense sneaking of the old game and adds a whole new layer of tactics to it.  Good show Ubisoft.","September 17, 2012","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Getting there or the state of arriving is always much more exciting than the catch. Splinter Cell sets this game in a charming cool thick-blooded scene after deadly scene, guartineening late hours of cold sweat in intense play. However good it is, like many other games it has flaws mainly with some of badly made single player campaigns that rarely require use of stealth and cunningness. However when the need for stealth and sneaking comes into play it is a thing to behold. Moreover the real attention and focus should be on the co-op missions and the early sp missions as I permanently will never see a lamp-post, light bulbs ever the same again. For that matter hallways, corridors and lonely empty rooms, where death can make a friend of. Making it through the mazes of offices and warehouses is an achievement and sometimes even an epic, never has ten yards mean so much. 99% of the game is played in elegant stark contrasts of blacks and whites, very little colours involved once the lights are shot out. Nothing about this game escapes the "daggers of the mind" if you catch my meaning and the palpable deadly imaginations that is portrayed deftly. This is the one that would have had Jack the Ripper's approval, especially so if sneaking around in the dark is your thing as was the most infamous killer that was never caught.","December 11, 2012","true","60.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/professionagriefer/recommended/33220/","professionagriefer","Probed Uranus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/professionagriefer/","92 products in account","You hang on a ledge, a flashlight toting goon below you. His friend lays dead in the bushes merely ten-to-fifteen meters away. Well-trained eyes adapted for night-time hunting, you track the guard's movement, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Something happens though, he sees his buddy's foot with his flashlight, rushing over to confirm that, yes, he is indeed dead. Now the entire area is under alert, but not yet ready to call in reinforcements. To them it's possible that the attacker left. You know better, and plan to snap the whistleblower's neck when he's not looking. Coming back around the guard shines his light up and right at you. He's close enough to shoot. You're high enough to pounce. In one fluid movement you bounce off the ledge and onto the guard below, silencing him as you surely will with the rest of his friends inside.\n\nTo anyone who's never played Splinter Cell before, that's pretty damn new. To those who have, it's still new. Splinter Cell: Conviction gets a bad rep from old Agents, most of which is because its different. That "Death From Above" moment pulled in the above description? For most intents and purposes, doesn't happen in earlier games. Gameplay is vastly different than older Splinter Cell titles. From its use of regenerating health to "Mark and Execute" which is an instant-kill button, much of Conviction feels like a AAA blockbuster shooter. And you'd be right; it feels almost exactly like one.\n\nYou can mark targets and track them through just about anything. You'll take cover and pop-up to take pot shots at goon's heads. And you'll pretty much kill a whole bunch of henchmen before going into a high-octane firefight. It sounds more like Call of Duty or Battlefield rather than the Splinter Cell so many grew up with. Dragging bodies and non-lethal takedowns have gone MIA as well, nowhere in a stealth game which should have them. And many Splinter Cell veterans have slandered and outright insulted the game just on that alone. The motives were clear; make money by making the learning curve easier. By no means though will any CoD fan be able to master this game simply by picking it up. Like earlier titles, stealth is something that is learned. It's easier to tell when you're hidden too, the world around you turning black and white with the exception of bad guys. If the world is in color, then that means you're able to be seen easily.\n\n"But ScoutS3an," You may ask. "Why would this make it a bad game to the veterans? Wouldn't this be giving them a break?" You'd be right, but Splinter Cell veterans (at least ones I've seen) love the challenge of completing a mission by knocking just about everyone out and never being spotted. As such, they slander Conviction for being too action-y and too fast-paced. Which is true. But like Sam Fisher, some fans have adapted to the change. And Splinter Cell's story, in my view, does have some reasoning behind these big changes. Hiding bodies? You're not leaving any witnesses who can tell their friends where you are, especially when the NSA is one of them. Don't think you can get through this next room stealthily? Does it matter when there's no government that could exploit it?\n\nConviction's story picks up after Double Agent, roughly three or so years after it. Sam Fisher, ex-NSA and ex-Third Echelon, along with being the world's first Splinter Cell, has left Third Echelon. Clues behind his daughter Sarah's mysterious killer leads him around the world to find leads, ending up in Malta. Contacted by his old friend, Anna Grimsdoitter, he helps her solve a conspiriacy involving Third Echelon in exchange for one thing: Sarah. I won't spoil it, but the story is a standard affair to some extent, though I've felt it was better and less hollywood-inspired than Call of Duty's. And it's my main reasoning behind Sam's radically different style of operating: He doesn't work for 3E anymore. Why bother leaving all those loose ends when you could just silence anyone who stands in your way.\n\nCo-Op is the same way, though I'd think Archer and Kestrel would at least have the option to use non-lethal moves considering they're employed by 3E and Voron respectively. And the co-op story is set some amount of time before the main story. I haven't played it in a while so you'll need to figure that one on your own.\n\nReally, the only reason I picked up the game on Steam was to get the deluxe stuff for Deniable Ops, which is something the older games severly lack; a terrorist-hunt styled game mode which can help the good get better at the game.\n\nWill finish review when I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ to wake up on time.","March 8, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can only be put that way since the game can get quite tedious in places but all in all, its very playable and the story line makes sense throughout.\n\nWhen I want to kick back, relax and play something, I'd grab the controller and give this game the time it deserves. I wouldn't recommend Keyboard + Mouse however, since it was designed around a controller. Works perfectly though and you can blast through the highes difficulty with ease.\n\nGot friends?

A brief summary: Sam was one of America's "Splinter Cells", operatives who, as the situations warrant, have the "Fifth Freedom" of being allowed to kill as he sees fit.  After the death of his daughter he went under-cover as a double-agent, and this eventually led to his leaving the service.  Dragged back into it by his former handler, Sam must once again step up to save America.\n\nThe single-player part of the game was fun, but felt brief.  I blew though it in about 8 hours (albeit on easy, I wanted the story), compared to the usual 15 hour runs on the previous games.  As of yet, I have not been able to find a match in the multiplayer, so haven't gotten to play that.\n\nMy biggest gripe was that there wasn't any real reason not to gun down every bad guy you run across.  Before, sneaking was your primary goal; after all, America doesn't hold with wanton slaughter ('cause we're the "good" guys, after all).  But this time around, I felt no compunction not to end the lives of these scum.\n\nA fun addition to the line, and great to develop the character of Fisher, but ultimately, buy this on sale.","February 8, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Getting detected means nothing now that there is no longer a health bar you have to worry about keeping full. Health regenerates like in Rainbow Six: Vegas or Creed cause apparently Sam met Marcus Fenix and learned that trick. They tried too hard to make Sam badass (I guess to compete with games like CoD and Gears), but he was already badass in my book.

It has nice graphics, good sticky cover, fun gameplay and a few well designed levels, but.....  As a Splinter Cell sequel it completely blows and betrays the whole idea of SC gameplay. Instead of making it more open ended like Thief 1 or 2 They`ve decided to dumb it down completely. It has checkpoints, a binary light/shadow system, forced action sequences and the mark & execute nonsense. You also can`t jump freely or adjust your movement speed with the mouse wheel. Non lethal takedowns and the function of moving bodies around were also cut from the game :(\n\nAnd why oh why do I need to use Uplay when I bought it from Steam ?","July 19, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A brief summary: Sam was one of America's "Splinter Cells", operatives who, as the situations warrant, have the "Fifth Freedom" of being allowed to kill as he sees fit.  After the death of his daughter he went under-cover as a double-agent, and this eventually led to his leaving the service.  Dragged back into it by his former handler, Sam must once again step up to save America.\n\nThe single-player part of the game was fun, but felt brief.  I blew though it in about 8 hours (albeit on easy, I wanted the story), compared to the usual 15 hour runs on the previous games.  As of yet, I have not been able to find a match in the multiplayer, so haven't gotten to play that.\n\nMy biggest gripe was that there wasn't any real reason not to gun down every bad guy you run across.  Before, sneaking was your primary goal; after all, America doesn't hold with wanton slaughter ('cause we're the "good" guys, after all).  But this time around, I felt no compunction not to end the lives of these scum.\n\nA fun addition to the line, and great to develop the character of Fisher, but ultimately, buy this on sale.","February 8, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are now replaced by something much dumber.  This can only be described as James Bond directed by Michael Bay.  Its just baffling that this is the direction they decided to take this series.  Stealth takes a backseat for full on kill everything and move forward action.  Yes stealth is still a thing but its only a means to an end to sneak up on some of the stupidest guards in gaming ever.  You can easily get them from the front by just being in shadows and boom they dead.  This game rewards you for melee kills for crying out loud!  Kill someone with melee and get your takedown where you tag multiple enemies press a button and insta kill them all at once.  There is literally no downside to being spotted because you can easily slip from where they saw you and get around them and continue your slaughter.  I mean there's a section where you have to go up against a helicopter thats invincible!  Just run from cover to cover till you reach your objective.\n\nThere were parts where i flat out ignored enemies and won!  I gave this a second go to see if my hate for it was unfounded and in a way it is.  If you can accept that everything you used to know about this series is gone than it can be an enjoyable game.  Trying to actually stealth through was torture but just killing everyone in your way made life easier and I turns this into a 4 hour romp through a season of 24 or something.  There's something to be said that a side game mode is more enjoyable then the story.  You just kill everyone in an area and one mode makes it where setting off an alarm fails you.  That was so much more fun than the single player campaign and its not even that special!  Thank goodness for Blacklist for at least improving on this!","August 11, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The single-player story is like a typical action movie - sweeping soundtrack, big scripted set pieces, fancy cinematics, implausible but gripping plot, and a bit too short. It was a bit confusing and difficult to follow, but that's no big deal.\n\nGameplay is solid but a bit formulaic, with tight linear levels lacking multiple approaches, and dumb AI that would do well to eat more carrots (they can't see in the dark). The stealth mechanics based around shadows and “last known position” work fairly well, but are a bit too arcade for my tastes. Multiplayer matchmaking is dead, which is sad as co-op missions seem like fun.\n\nAs for those who keep saying this is much worse than the old games like Chaos theory, I slightly disagree, its not significantly better or worse. I am ok with the slightly more streamlined and faster paced direction they have taken, the difference is not as big as many make it out to be.\n\nAs a console port, this is fairly good. There is sadly a checkpoint save system, but it is not as bad as in many other games. Otherwise, there are enough settings, no mouse acceleration and skippable cutscenes. On a geeky side note: the unreal engine used here is excellent as usual (allowing me to sleep my pc while fullscreen and later resume right back into the game in 1 sec).\n\nWorth getting in a sale.","January 15, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are now replaced by something much dumber.  This can only be described as James Bond directed by Michael Bay.  Its just baffling that this is the direction they decided to take this series.  Stealth takes a backseat for full on kill everything and move forward action.  Yes stealth is still a thing but its only a means to an end to sneak up on some of the stupidest guards in gaming ever.  You can easily get them from the front by just being in shadows and boom they dead.  This game rewards you for melee kills for crying out loud!  Kill someone with melee and get your takedown where you tag multiple enemies press a button and insta kill them all at once.  There is literally no downside to being spotted because you can easily slip from where they saw you and get around them and continue your slaughter.  I mean there's a section where you have to go up against a helicopter thats invincible!  Just run from cover to cover till you reach your objective.\n\nThere were parts where i flat out ignored enemies and won!  I gave this a second go to see if my hate for it was unfounded and in a way it is.  If you can accept that everything you used to know about this series is gone than it can be an enjoyable game.  Trying to actually stealth through was torture but just killing everyone in your way made life easier and I turns this into a 4 hour romp through a season of 24 or something.  There's something to be said that a side game mode is more enjoyable then the story.  You just kill everyone in an area and one mode makes it where setting off an alarm fails you.  That was so much more fun than the single player campaign and its not even that special!  Thank goodness for Blacklist for at least improving on this!","August 11, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Some reviews below claim to get only 25-30 fps on singleplayer, so I still think this is the most computer intensive game I own. (Although, some speech is prone to muting itself randomly, so that's something you'll have to deal with)\n\nOne deal breaker for a lot of people though: It requires Uplay - and thus, the Internet - meaning that trying to play it in offline mode is pointless and trying to play it without signing in to Uplay is pointless, even though the servers for this game aren't supported.

An important thing to remember is that this is more of a Jason Bourne type game then the infiltration extraordinare that Sam Fisher is famous for. You don't get a pair of goggles until halfway through the game! Also, certain areas don't really have alot of cover or available hiding spots, forcing you to use the mark instakill system. I played it on realistic and found it to be fairly challenging, and I would reccomend a stealthy approach for most things.\n\nIf you DO find a part you cannot beat, I HIGHLY reccomend the various gadgets. Flash bangs, Remote Mines, and Frags where pretty much all I needed for the difficult parts.\n\nOverall a very basic splinter cell type game.

Some reviews below claim to get only 25-30 fps on singleplayer, so I still think this is the most computer intensive game I own. (Although, some speech is prone to muting itself randomly, so that's something you'll have to deal with)\n\nOne deal breaker for a lot of people though: It requires Uplay - and thus, the Internet - meaning that trying to play it in offline mode is pointless and trying to play it without signing in to Uplay is pointless, even though the servers for this game aren't supported. Good going, Ubisoft, I wanted to play your game somewhere that isn't at McDonalds or at home.\n\nAs for the actual game, it's similar to Blacklist but the AI is a bit more basic.

It's a lot more action oriented with a bit less focus on stealth, but the gameplay is still awesome and you can definitely still use stealth a lot if you really want to! However, it has a buggy multiplayer/coop setup. It lags and disconnects quite a bit. Unless you have optimal internet speeds, don't expect to be even able to host matches. And it's likely that even if you're not the host, you'll still get disconnected. To host, you HAVE to port forward quite a few ports.

He has been hiding himself for a while then he need to get back to action again!\n\nThis game is worth coop-ing with your friend. (There's no Spy vs. Merc)    The "deniable ops" mode is a randomly generated single and coop mission. There's a campaign for Coop mode (linked to Blacklist, play this game in coop campaign to find out how)\n\nStealth mechanic is easy to understand but hard to master. Like other Splinter Cell, darkness is the key. Even there's no night vision goggles in this game but it represents sonar goggles (Goggles that help you see through thin walls)\n\nI like when the character is hidden in the dark the environment turns dark and white color (the reason is, character's eyes get used to the dark environment and then be able to see again)\n\nThe unrealistic issue in this title is in the dark Sam Fisher (or any character you play) can stalk, stand, crouch, T-bagging, walking and running in front of the enemy without being seen. (Except for Blacklist, they made AIs be able to barely see you in the dark)\n\nBack to deniable ops, in this mode you can replay over and over even the same map! Customize your character to look like a badass assassin, a Thug, a PMC, a soldier or even urban Sam Fisher!\n\nStories in Singleplayer and Multiplayer are intense, action packed, faster than old Splinter Cell and rich.\n\nAfter all, this the best game to practice stealth for new players who new to stealth games or elite-spies from other games. Easy to learn the mechanic of stealth; patience, awareness, cooperative and making decisions.\n\nHave fun !","May 26, 2015","true","92.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People seem upset that Ubisoft has somewhat deviated a little bit from its more traditional stealth role and forces a lot more shooting/action upon you.\n\nWhat people don't understand is that Sam Fisher, as a character, has developed and changed.  In past games he was working on  leash by the government-- he can't just blast a room full of chinese politicians in the chinese embassy, lest he create an international incident.  In this game he is NO LONGER restricted by the government, and he's no longer on international soil anyway.  He is free to do what he does best-- KILL. THEM.

At the very end of this scene you have the option of killing Tom Reed or letting him live but if you let him Anna Grimmsdorttoir kills him instead and Sam respond by saying something like "Why did you do that" and thne Anna Grimmsdorttoir responds by saying"well times have changed" and then basically sam shruggs his shoulder and then begins to walk off and says whilst he is walking "you know at the beginning when I said this ends, I will walk off, that what I am doing now".\n\nSplinter Cell Conviction is a great game but has many flaws to it.\nFlaw number one been that the AI don't detect you realisitically, I mean by this sometimes you can literally walk to them and they won't react or even begin to detect you.\nFlaw number two been is that who actually has unlimited ammo but this can also be seen as a good point because it allows the player to use the weapon more that he has picked.\nFlaw number three been is that the sonar goggles are annoying to use because sometimes it give me headache which is not particulary good.\nThe good things about this game are that its fun to goof around and experiement with the eneimies. You can also see if you are a true stealth operative.\nIts innovative it something new to the franchise.\nI would reccomened this to a friend as of right now because it is on sale, I would not reccomend it if the game was not on sale because it is not worth £14.99.","May 27","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
