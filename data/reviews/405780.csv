Even have old school text parser type puzzles in it.\n\nClassic point-and-click adventure fans should feel right at home here. Saddly you only have 1280x800 resolution but even still game looks fine. Faces on 3D character models may sometimes look like wax figures but huge hand-drawn portraits in dialogue window are very beautiful indeed. Enviroments are especially beautiful and night sequences with northern lights are breathtaking and eerie.\n\nPerhaps notepad could have used little bit more. I really love natural looking notes, books and magazine cutouts in my adventure games, it just makes it feel so much more lifelike enviroment and luckily what they have feels very authentic, giving great backstory and making it feel like real place where real people might live. I guess it's bit nitpicky thing to say but notes in Syberia series were huge reason why I fell in love with it back in the day as well.\n\nOne of my all time favourite point-and-click adventures and really hoping to see new game by Turmoil Games someday.\n\n\n...also remember polar bears get bored too.\n\nFinal verdict: 9 well fed and happy polar bears out of 10","October 22, 2015","true","11.2"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","0"

For me all that text puzzles was not hard. I like that game has very significant touch on mythology of northern tribes. Also it's was not bad portraying everyday life of each member of station and their voiceacting. And dating with only one female person on station was not bad (also it's optional in progress, you can miss it if you want) idea at all.\n\nBut some logic puzzles....was really troublsome. Among them of them was a master key riddle, cause I dont even imagine what "Master key" is, only information what I gets through the game was not enough for me and Triangulation task  (cause I really terrible in geometry). Only minus of this game I found only in clues to solving thoose two quest (I used walkthrough to complete them), all others was not hard.\n\nI must admit that game have it's charm.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/405780/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","Click here to read my full review at Mouse N Joypad; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/alpha-polaris-a-horror-adventure-game-review/\n\nWhile it lacks the finesse needed in the genre, Alpha Polaris nails several key areas. They took one of nature’s most beautiful anomalies and added a dark presence to it. You’ll truly feel the isolation of living out in the tundra. Unfortunately, the developers seem like they tackled a larger project than they could handle, and the game focuses itself in all of the wrong areas. Characters are boring, most of the action takes place during the day and paranoia is exchanged for rationalism. All of the details feel smooth and polished, but gets lost in its poorly paced and executed storyline. Hardcore fans of PnC adventure games will find things to love, but everyone else will have problems with Alpha Polaris’ missed opportunities.\n\nThe game is an impressive undertaking for a small team, but the developers at Turmoil Games have sadly missed the mark. The game has an amazing premise; you’re a biologist named Rune Knudsen, who’s residing in a research center for an oil company in the icy hills of Greenland. You are not Nova, the woman who’s slapped on all of the promotional material. She’s a microbiologist who works for the company and was born into an indigenous tribe native to the icy wilderness. Rune is there to study polar bears and was given a room in the facility to paint the impression that the company cares about the environment. After capturing a sick polar bear, the lead researcher Al returns from an expedition with news. Not only did he find oil in a giant crevasse, but has also found an old cave with piles of bones and ancient symbols on what appears to be the hide of something (or one).\n\nThis kicks off the ‘Horror’ aspect of the title. From that night on, the characters all experience waking dreams, where they envision themselves doing awful things to one another, and a looming presence that beckons them. The Northern Lights roll in, causing electrical interference and blocking radio transmissions, leaving our scientists with no outside communication. The next morning, the polar bear escapes, leaving a trail of blood as it runs off into the white unknown.\n\nAnd this, sadly- is where the game begins to fail. None of the characters show any sign of fear. The facility seems the same, and everyone just goes on about their day, despite everyone having a minor freak out the night before. I know I’ve already made one comparison, but I think bringing up John Carpenter’s The Thing is justified here. In that movie, the unease stemmed from the creature that was terrorizing everyone; but it wasn’t the central fear. It was the people around the situation. The paranoia, mistrust and savagery of the characters were the main grab of that movie. In this game, everyone just continues- brushing everything off. No one accuses anyone of releasing the polar bear, or even acts irrationally. You have to wait until night for anyone to start acting irrational again, which makes the day segments as scary as a sponge cake.\n\nAll of the occult stuff is pretty terrifying, and the Lovecraftian nature of this beast looming over the station is an amazing setup. Your characters are isolated, vulnerable in a hostile and unforgiving environment; and yet you spend half of your time in the safe daylight, making deserts. But when it does hit, it hits pretty hard, and I never thought I would think of the Aurora Borealis as being scary, but this game succeeds in making it terrifying. Sadly, everything your character does is reactionary, and you never really feel like you’re making decisions, but rather watching a movie unfold until you can get back to the ‘pleasant side’ of the game.\n\nThere’s a romance angle with Nova, who is a far more interesting character than the unfortunately named Rune. She’s the one you spend an eighth of the game preparing a tasty snack for. She has a much more interesting backstory, and I felt would’ve been a much better protagonist than the dull Norwegian bear stalker. I guess they wanted to focus on the ‘environmental themes’, but sadly these messages are as subtle as Birdemic. Too much dialogue is spent on this shoehorned in message when the story is really about an occult. Maybe I didn’t make the connection, but these two ideas don’t blend very well, and I would’ve loved to see a more focused approach to the scary elements of the game.\n\nWith it’s pacing problems, the game also feels like it holds your hand, walking you to the next puzzle every time. When the game does hit its conclusion, Alpha Polaris starts to flow. Characters turn on one another as they question their own sanity and actions. This kind of stuff should’ve came in sooner, but better late than never. Once again, sadly, the game’s twist is pretty predictable, and the ending falls very flat. The game leaves you little to maul over or contemplate and didn’t stay with me at all. No amount of darkness and isolation will make this as scary as some of gaming’s greats.\n\nThe puzzles are as divided as the crevasse in the game. Some of them are so simple; you’ll do them in your sleep. Some are so difficult; I had to look them up in a walkthrough. Maybe I’m just dumb, but there’s a key puzzle that I doubt I would’ve ever gotten, and even having the answer after an hour’s worth of head scratches, I’m still confused on how it made sense. Sometimes the game will give you a vague idea of what to do next, only to find that a small map has been added to a back wall somewhere between scenes, expecting you to notice. The puzzles that do work are amazing, though; I enjoyed one where you have to use tracking equipment by moving around and triangulating coordinates.\n\nOne of the best parts of this game is the audio design. When it comes to horror games, this is a must. Music is free, open source catalogue music, but it’s used perfectly. When the darkness hits, the game’s tone shifts into one of the most terrifying I’ve experienced in a while. Slow and methodical, the subtle use is refreshing in an era of using heavy-handed soundtracks to convey a fright. The voice actors are also top notch and sound like they were directed very well for an indie title. The dialogue could’ve been cringe-worthy, but the actors deliver every line with precise execution.\n\nCutscenes are well paced, and might be some of the scariest parts of the game. Both because of clever camera movement and direction, but also because they look like they came right out of The Adventure Company’s catalog. To say they look best suited for the early 90’s would be kind. They’re very stiff and lack any polish. The developers seem like they know this however, so they cleverly hid these shortcomings by placing the slower moving moments in darkness, while using fast-paced editing in more lit conditions. Despite the very dated graphics, they do a great job with the tools they had.\n\nAt the end of the day, Alpha Polaris does many things right but falls on its face too many times for me to fully recommend. If you’re a fan of games like Syberia or Broken Sword, you’ll probably get some enjoyment out of this one. I mean, in all honesty, adventure games seem like a guilty pleasure for many fans, so what’s one more? If you’re not a fan of the genre, this game won’t change your mind. It’s marred by too many structural problems, and while it hits moments of amazing atmosphere, the rest of the game feels like a slog. I do commend the team for tackling an ambitious and unique experience, and I hope they continue honing their craft because, for a first game, this was a good entry.","October 30, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It is a point and click "Horror" game that was very underwhelming. Here is why\n\nFirst off, the controls. Obviously, a point and click game does not have the most intricate system of controls, but none the less there were some problems here. Interacting in the game could be difficult, as when you try to select an item you often will leave a room instead, forcing you to go back and try to select the item again. It can happen four or five times in a row depending on which item and room it is. On top of that, the loading screens in between rooms are ten to twenty seconds on average. This would not be a problem, except for the fact that you have to go through a black loading screen for every room.\n\nSecond, the story. I will not go into the actual story too much as I want to avoid spoilers. My main problem is how unsatisfying the resolution was. After suffering through multiple days of loading screens, I was hoping for a lot more than what I got. It's sad, because the buildup was done well, however it seemed to rush the ending for whatever reason. What makes this more sad is that it has a very good story and story idea, but because of the games format it seemed to be held back. The game progresses through in game days, each days end marking a new progression in the story.\n\nAnd the gameplay, oh the gamplay. It was very good at times, but then you get things that are pointless or difficult, and sometimes both. Like baking dessert. In a horror game. Again, this would not be bad, but the item selection and loading screens make it feel like a chore more than a fun bit of filler. Some of the interactions are hard to figure out and some items hard to find/obtain. I do give it credit for not having the main character pick up things he does not need and just carry them around. This is mostly due to the self contained environment.\n\nMy biggest problem though is that it just was not scary. Most of the scares were done in cutscenes, but they are easily (and sometimes accidently) skipped. The ones that were in game didn't have a great effect. And this is because I really wasn't able to connect with any of the characters. I don't even remember most of their names. And because this is not first person horror, I don't even really care about what happens to me. Because this is point and click, you can't even die, at least not as far as I can tell.\n\nOverall, the game was not horrible, but it needs work. Reduced loading screens and an increased ease of item interaction would make it much more enjoyable. Flesh out the story and you might have a great game. If you are looking for an interesting, albiet it frustrating, point and click, I would say check it out. If you want some scares, I don't think this is the game for you. I hope the game gets worked on and improved in the future, but for now, that's all I can say.","December 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

However, that could just be due to the fact that supernatural stuff doesn't freak me out much -- I find it hard to really get into it when I don't believe it could actually happen. I also didn't really get a sense of adventure due to the fact that 95% of the game is spent in and around the same building. Basically, the game is a point and click escape-the-room type of game.\n\nRegardless, I thought the game was enjoyable and worth the money, and I can see how a lot of people would legitimately be freaked out by it. The story was well-written, and the puzzles were engaging. Overall, I'd recommend it.","February 13","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Characters are just kinda there. They have personality, but you never really connect with them in a really meaningful way, so when one of them dies it feels more like a plot development than a tragedy.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is really inconsistent. Most of them are easy, but a few of them are just maddeningly cryptic, with the text-parsing puzzles being the worst of them all. Most of the time you'll either be reduced to randomly trying every word mentioned in the game hoping for a hit, or just looking for a walk-through, either one of which is enough to break immersion and sink any buildup of tension.\n\nVoice acting ranges from average to below-average.\n\nOh yeah, the only female character in the game gets damsel'd  near the end, because of course she does.\n\nAll in all, the game is just way too mediocre on every level to really be worth it, unless you get it super-cheap and are really hard-up for a point-and-click adventure.\n\nEDIT: On retrospect, this game does ONE thing that I so desperately wish more point-and-click games did, by having you be able to double-click on an exit point and skip the tedious walking animation to get where you want to go and just instantly move to the next screen. The absolute tedium of waiting for a character to cross a large area to get to the next location is one of the many things that very quickly killed any desire I had to play Deponia, and it's such an obvious move to pad the time out, so it's a breath of fresh air to see a dev buck that trend.","April 21","false","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Why? Because the way some things work in Alpha Polaris are ridiculous. From the way triangulation works (stand in the correct spot to click on a compass multitool and get proper coordinates) to guessing words for the parser riddles, there are moments where you might wonder why it's done that way. On the other hand you get riddles where you pretty much get the step by step instructions on what to do, like with the Bombe Alaska recipe for Nova.\n\nIf you don't mind the unbalanced riddles or perhaps you're a worker on the Arctic and know exactly how to triangulate an escaped polar bear's location, playing Alpha Polaris can turn out to be a great experience for you. Even though I was a bit disappointed with having to look up a walkthrough I did enjoy this game a lot.\n\nSince I like point and click adventure games very much, I found this to be a very nice title, especially when there's not that many quality games in this genre which are more recent. Alpha Polaris is a 2011 game, and if you're a fan of games like Grey Matter or Black Mirror, you shouldn't be dissapointed.\n\nAs for the graphics, they are amazing when it comes for the locations and in-dialogue characters, and not so much for the 3D model of Rune.\n\nThe main heroes and story are pretty interesting, especially the main hero, the Norwegian Rune, with his slight accent.\n\nI recommend this game especially to people who are looking for a fun and exceptional point and click adventure game.","May 11","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It suffered from a lagging second act that ended up turning into a heavily rushed third act.\n\nThe parser puzzles were vague, and you had to REALLY dig to find the answers (I didn't find them very forgiving at all) and the generator puzzle was...well...again, puzzles should be logical, and rely on the player's knowledge of the game world.\n\nOther than those hiccups, it was something I enjoyed and reccomend getting, definately on a sale.","January 11","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
