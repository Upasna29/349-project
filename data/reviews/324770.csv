The uniqueness comes from that you indirectly control her around the ship using the surveillance cameras that are at your disposal as the security operator. Some cameras are broken beyond repair, some have shattered screens, others are wired incorrectly; but most of them work fine - this creates an authentic feel of realism and desperation as you work together with Lea.\n\nThe basic premise of the plot is that Lea awakens in a fungi-infected ship. An experiment gone wrong or intentional disaster? As the security operator, you guide Lea around collecting notes, solving puzzles and learning more behind the mystery of the post-apocalyptic world of the ship.\n\nWhilst there is no combat there are enemies that can, and will, kill Lea; being a point and click: puzzle solving, atmosphere and mysterious algorithms are what you're facing. This is obviously a budget game but what money went into this game it does well, rather than being a jack of all trades, it specialises in what made the point and click genre in the first place. The animations are a bit clunky, there's minor visual glitches, a lack of system options and other problems that I feel are not enough to detract from the, mind the pun, eXperience of this game, but are worth pointing out regardless. As said, the cameras you control don't all work, this can create unsettling and tense moments when you can only hear horrific sounds with a handicapped vision - you must guide Lea through dangerous situations like this.\n\nSure, this isn't the best game ever made or the most innovative thing since sliced bread, but what it does it does well, but as a result the game burdens some minor flaws. No AAA polish here. Having said that, if you love mystery solving, puzzles, pure survival horror I think you will take a keen interest in this game. The way in which you collect notes/files has it so that, since you are the security operator, you must log onto the ship's data bank with a username and password (obtained from guiding Lea around) and search through the databse to your pleasure. Most of it is optional and provides a very, very detailed backstory up to the events leading to now, and other secrets that I won't spoil. But eventually, you'll need to dig around in order to progress. And the game gets real hard, you need to pay attention to Lea's comments and use the map wisely.\n\nOne thing I do love about the game is, well.... I won't spoil, but load your save game up a few days -after- you last saved. :)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10. Points deducted for minor technical flaws, poor performance in the latter stages of the game, slow pacing (the game is quit long, but that's a good thing!) and uninspired character development.\n\nThanks for reading.","October 25, 2014","true","0.3"," 299 of 328 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","299","328","2","9"

You are sat behind a security camera network and the only way to communicate with the main character is by switching lights on and off.\n\nThere are many puzzles to solve that inspires you to press on and reveal more of the mysterious storyline.\n\nThe graphics are dated but are still detailed enough to add atmosphere to the games environment.\n\nSound effects are very good in this game from opening metal water tight doors to voice acting.\n\nI do recommend this game however you will need patience at times. Camera's can be a little awkward to control at times and your  main character does walk just a little to slow to destinations. The story on other hand is very good and keeps you interested throughout.","November 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

Why has it taken me so long? Because it's pretty badly optimized. The last part was so laggy it was unplayable on my older PC. Not such a big problem anymore, although I wouldn't say I like the actual ending and not knowing it all those years probably made me like the game somewhat more... Anyway, the game mechanics are the one thing that makes this experience worth it. It can be a bit slow. Lea sometimes require a lot of patience to navigate to any given objective, but there's a lot to read and figure out in the mean time. Controlling the surveillance system, searching for all those passwords and decoding them, taking controls of robots and other mechanized equipment (including bathysphere)... that's all just amazing. It's so disappointing not to see any more games like this – with similar mechanics and interface. It would be so at home in every second sci-fi game where you can hack cameras and security systems...","November 26, 2015","true","21.3"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","20","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locoweed/recommended/324770/","Locoweed","Locoweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Locoweed/","2915 products in account","Interesting take on an adventure game. I enjoyed the novel approach of indirectly controlling the character, and choosing what you want to see through various cameras. Unfortunately you can only get 2.5 cameras going at once.\n\nThe plot has some pretty amazing holes in it. The entire story as far as it gets explained to the player is mostly handed to you in some text files pretty early in the game. I was hoping there was going to some more explaining at some point, but unfortunately not. It's 1970 in the computer files, then suddenly the game takes place 30ish (?) years later with no explanation why.\n\nA lot of the game is getting codes and logins so you can read old files and emails to get MORE codes and logins. Apparently more effort was put into making little backstories for the characters in their files and emails than the plot of the actual game itself.\n\nWhile you don't have to click every suspicious item in a scene for things to collect like most other adventure games, you do instead basically have to check off every controllable point to ensure the character finds everything she's supposed to find.\n\nThere isn't any kind of fast travel, so if you realize you need to backtrack, you basically have to slowly click a breadcrumb trail and wait around for her to catch up.\n\nIt appears to be a French port, so expect some weird English voice acting.\n\nThere were a couple bugs where the game didn't register some upgrades, or I moved the character out of an expected position, which basically causes the character to hang, yet not the game itself, forcing a reload.\n\nFor some reason, the load times are RIDICULOUSLY long. My PC is less than a year old, but in some areas, it would take at LEAST a minute to load, which is insane for a 8 year old game, with small indoor areas.\n\nI kept playing this very slow paced game with the hopes that the story would improve. Sadly it didn't, AND I was rewarded an amazingly weak ending.\n\nI kind of wanted to recommend this....but meh.","March 1, 2015","false","34.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

You dont actually control the character. You guide her through the areas by turning on lights, opening doors, and watching her through security cameras. Some cameras work fine, some dont, and at first I loved it. But the game fairly quickly devolved into getting log in codes (youre on a computer) to log into other old accounts to find more codes to open doors/safes/even more accounts. If the game were more about just guiding her through the cameras and exploring, It probably would have bumped this review into a recommend.\n\nGraphically, the game is dated. Still retains a lot of creepy atmosphere, but the character animations are a bit strange sometimes. Audio wasnt bad, but the voice acting wasnt that great. I didnt mind it, but she reminded me of a computer voice. She didnt really react or show emotion.\n\nThe largest draw back for me was just how buggy the game was. Sometimes the character would get stuck and you would need to reload. There is a robot vehicle part that got stuck. Sometimes events by objects wouldnt trigger. The game itself would crash if I opened it and had Skype running in the background (no idea why), and sometimes alt tabbing would trigger errors.\n\nEven with all the negative, the story was interesting, but not interesting enough for me to try and stick it out. All of the fighting with camera angles, codes, emails, and bugs broke immersion way too often for me to stick it out for the sake of the story.\n\nAs it is, I cant recommend it. If you do give it a try, I honestly hope you have better luck with it than I did bug wise.","February 23","false","4.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Seems like a pretty common one and I even remember having the same when I first bought the retail copy back in 2008. This should be a big enough indicator of the level of polish that went into this game and, from what i remember, there where indeed other gamebreaking bugs...\n\nOther than that, it's quite a nice game at heart and definitely a unique one. Even if it's also very tedious at times, I would have gladly played it again, but probably not if it means struggling against huge bugs like that.","February 18, 2015","false","1.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Indirectly guiding a non-player character through an adventure using nothing but your own power over a decaying security system?\n\n"Sign me up!" I cried.\n\nThe reality unfortunately fell short of my high expectations. A good portion of the early-to-mid game is spent directing the focal character to each and every light switch in turn, just to make sure that she stops and searches EVERY SINGLE NOOK AND CRANNY for keycards and other important objects that you often CANNOT actually see yourself due to the awkward position and orientation of the cameras. For me, this was a frustrating and drawn-out experience. Not only because it often feels like Lea Nichols moves about with all the alacrity of a pregnant sloth, but she will potentially not notice important plot items if she doesn't specifically STOP MOVING at key locations. Prompt her to move a little faster to the next light switch, and she may just miss that all-important keycard, scribbled note, or whatever-the-heck else you need to progress to the next stage of the plot.\n\nIt feels like the story was supposed to carry this game, and perhaps in Europe, it did. The over-arching plot is tied together with topics ranging from secret societies and government programs, to secret terrestrial species, and secret office romance. But the delivery via the English voice-actors leaves quite a bit to be desired in the emotion department. The English-speaking Lea Nichols seems rather deadpan... Which actually contradicts what is written about her in the computer system that you're required to hack into on repeated occassions.\n\nSpeaking of "computer hacking" aspect, that aspect of the game was actually somewhat interesting, requiring you to decrypt or discover the users' passwords using a variety of methods. Browsing through all of the data does take time and patience, however, and your progress in gaining access to all the user profiles is hampered by Lea's ability to find and relay ID codes and passwords hidden within the environment.\n\nThere ARE interesting moments and discoveries to be made over the course of the game, but I am left feeling as though the parts of the game that I enjoyed were too few and far between for me to recommend this game to the general public.","November 16, 2014","false","22.0"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

Voice acting is bad. The interface/tiny fonts are bad. The inevitable desktop clutter of the camera windows, which don't align to the window but rather overlay one another in a haphazard way is the worst-and is also the main game mechanic. Expect frequent crashes, unhandled exceptions, and critical errors without any hope of a working patch. The greatest sin of this turd is that only 90% of the game was properly translated into English. This means that you will encounter confusing dialogues and unsolvable puzzles that rely on entering a code. Early in the game, a tedious set of puzzles involving entering codes, opening e-mails, and cross-referencing a chart results in a word meant to be used as another password. The NPC repeatedly keeps reminding you of what you should be doing, but the password doesn't work. Until you realize that no one bothered to translate one part of the puzzle. The numbers that tell you what word to enter result in a proper name-in French, but the correct solution is in English. This means the game is only playable with a comprehensive walkthrough or an intimate knowledge of French and pre-Christian Greek philosophers. [Seriously.] Set in the 1970's, but chock full of anachronisms, this could have been a fun, quirky adventure. Instead it is a lesson in tedium. Example: Open this camera. Try to find an object for the NPC. Open another camera. Spend a few moments trying to fit in on your screen. Click the light switch on the hard to read map. Wait for the slowpoke NPC to travel there. Smash keyboard when you discover the automatic camera tracking decided to open a third camera on top of your other windows, then switch the cameras you had previously tweaked by hand to new ones. Listen as the NPC complains that you are taking too much time. Finally get all three windows to a size and position to see the thing you want her to pick up--oops! Unhandled exception error CTD... Reload a savegame? Sure, but don't expect it to resume where you saved. If fighting the game controls, being berated for not doing so, and constantly worrying when the next crash is coming sounds like fun to you, by all means have at it. I was lucky to buy this on sale for less than $2.00, but it's still not worth it. In fact, it's not even worth it if it were free.","March 25, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Unlike many other games, you are not controlling the protagonist directly but by giving the protagonist clues like switching on a light, hacking a door and so on. This is a very interessting concept but is limited by many UI decisions. Also sometimes the protagonsit does not understand the clue you are giving and therefore does not do what you want him to do. Still, I would recomment it if you are a story interested player.\n\nNow on the state of the steam release.\nThe English and Spanish version worked for me without a problem, the French and German one did not start at all.\nSupport on the forum is basically not existing so me, as a German, is apparently out of luck to get the German version running anytime soon.
