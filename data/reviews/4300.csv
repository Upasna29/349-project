The ability to pick up, carry, and swing around objects is a unique mechanic, and you'll use it often and to great amusement throughout the game. Everything is affected by physics, which can lead some some really fun and dynamic gameplay.\n\nOne of the most notable things that sets this game apart is the fact that each set of levels has its own distinct theme, and will have you performing wildly different objectives from the others; the result is that each feels like its own smaller game. This is a really interesting way of keeping things fresh throughout the adventure.\n\nRoboblitz also features great visuals, and good sound design. The game isn't necessarily without its flaws (some weird physics occasionally, a couple of the bosses are really difficult), but it's definitely worth playing through. Fun little game.\n\nI should note that, particularly in boss encounters, this game can present quite a number of bugs, which can lead to some very frustrating repetition.  If this isn't for you, you may want to stay away (or take advantage of some sneaky console commands to help you get past buggy bosses).","November 19, 2013","true","7.6"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","0"

Well, now I can!\n\nI enjoyed this at first, as it did take me back to the earlier days of 3D puzzle platforming.  The freedom to sort of hop anywhere without hitting invisible walls and just play around a little bit is nice.  The levels are fairly well made.  You get a decent array of tools that allowed for some ingenuitive thinking.  However, once you reach the boss fights, this is all for nothing.\n\nThe boss fight are an absolute mess.  They don't work.  They really don't work.  Try as you might, the boss encounters are bugged in numerous ways that will make it horribly frustrating if not outright impossible to win.  Not because the fights are so hard or challenging.  The fights themselves are just faulty in design and don't work the way they were intended.  I made a thread on the Steam forum talking about how wretched are, so feel free to go check that out if you're curious as to how broken the boss fights really are.\n\nI actually emailed the development studio about this, suggesting they patch it.  The response I received was this, "unfortunately we're far past the point of being able to update the game[.]"  This person is a damn liar.  Roboblitz is self-published for computers.  This is an actual case of the developer just not giving a crap about fixing their messed up game.\n\nDo not even consider buying Roboblitz unless Naked Sky Entertainment actually decides to patch these horrible boss encounters to make them work.  Should they ever do so, I will gladly re-evauluate the game and revise this review.","December 5, 2013","false","3.1"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","26","51","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/4300/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3805 products in account","Quick review:\n\nShort Verdict: This game is an action-puzzle platformer where you control a robot trying to ready a cannon at a space station. While potentially good, this game has so many problems and bugs (random crashes included) that I just can't recommend it. I wouldn't even recommend you play it even if you already have it. Unless you somehow enjoy getting frustrated.\n\nPros:\nCute robotic/tech graphics\nNice BGM\nA lot of nice ideas and unique concepts (that fall short)\nExploring for upgrade points adds fun and replay value to the stages\nNice in-game hint system if you don't know what to do\nDifferent tools and weapons for you to use in different situations\nCons:\nVery clumsy controls\nI couldn't play it with a controller because it exchanged the right X axis for the Y axis (in other words, moving the stick up would turn the camera left and tilting it right would make the camera go up)\nIt made me downgrade PhysX in order to play\nThe game crashes from time to time without warning\nBoring action/shooting part\nPuzzles are way too easy\nThe stuff you're carrying often gets stuck on walls or on the floor\nA lot of other bugs, like a shuttle door not opening when enemies try to force their way out\nPoor upgrade system with very little information\nThe boss battle I tried didn't work as should (it should break grates, but didn't), even after watching a video and reading the in-game hints to make sure I was doing the right thing\nHealth bar is really hard to see in the heat of battle\nBought on / for: Monday Bundle 30 by Indie Gala Weekly for and average of US$ 0.34 (R$ 0,85). And that's about US$ 0.34 more than what I'd pay for it.\n\nSimilar games: None that I remember right now. Please, tell me if you have any suggestions, because I'd really like to play a conceptually similar game that's actually playable.","October 24, 2014","false","1.6"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

GET IT ON THE Xbox360 INSTEAD BECAUSE THE PC PORT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO FINISH BECAUSE OF THE BOSS FIGHTS THAT DON'T WORK.\n\nThis was the first game I'd ever bought on XBLA as a kid, and it's still one of my all-time favs. As soon as I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it, and I was VERY dissapointed with the PC port.\n\nHere's the good things about the PC port.\n\n-Make your own levels\n\n-Play the game with headphones (And be amazed by the fantastic soundtrack)\n\n-Turn up the graphics to the max which makes the game look better than on the Xbox360\n\n-Play the game with a MUCH higher framerate so the controls feel much tighter and more responsive\n\nBut, then there's all the problems with the PC port. (These problems are not on the XBLA edition which I recommend you get instead)\n\n-Dashing doesn't work quite right.\n\n-Buggy boss fights. Here's some examples of them:\n\nOne boss got stuck and I had to nudge him out in order for him to get to where he needed to go in order for the final stage of the fight to start.\n\nAnother boss isn't even possible to finish (And therefor making the game impossible to finish) You're supposed to get it to charge at you and smash into the gears you're standing above, but it doesn't charge, it just slowly hovers towards you instead, meaning that it doesn't get the impact on the gears needed to finish that stage of the boss fight.\n\nThe rest of the bosses are just as frustratingly buggy making the boss fights completely unplayable.\n\n0/5 - Impossible to finish. Get it on XBLA for the Xbox360 instead","February 7","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They didn't bother to make them easy to kill, nor did they make it obvious how to go about killing them. Beyond that subtle difficulty, the game holds interest with its basic story, handful of weapons, lasers, a spin move, barrel throws, tractor beam, levitation gun, and a few additional power ups. The game play is very consistent making it a tolerable game, but nothing stood out that would make me recommend buying it.","December 14, 2011","false","8.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WarpScanner/recommended/4300/","WarpScanner","WarpScanner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WarpScanner/","500 products in account","While this is a negative review, I want to stress that I don't think this is strictly speaking a game that doesn't try to earnestly be good. That is, this isn't one of those games that are remarkably bad that you see on Steam so often. I played the Xbox 360 Demo back in very early Xbox 360 Arcade days and thought it was fun. And for the most part? Its actually not really straight up bad, its just below par and it has a number of issues that make it impossible to reccomend.\n\nPros:\n-The game itself might not be amazing, but when it was made on the 360 it was only 50mb in size. The PC port obviously doesn't have the same strict size limitations that early Xbox Arcade titles had of course (and they seem to have increased the game's overall size to over 300mb, probably higher quality sound and textures were the result). But still, considering that it originally was very small and yet still a fairly pretty game for its time is an engineering feat one can at least apreciate.\n-Has good music.\n-Very pretty art design.\n-Core gameplay concepts for a 3D physics Puzzler are at least amusing and it has a generously wide selection of weapons and tools.\n-Has a sense of humor.\n\nOK, now the reason why despite those things I can't reccomend this title:\n-The game crashes. Only an hour and a half into it I seem to have run into a part of the game that constantly ends the game and brings up an error code.\n-Incredibly bad difficulty curve, some of the levels are absolute boring cakewalks (namely combat) and then the game will throw you into a 'boss puzzle' that will have you pulling your hair out in frustration as you try and figure how to beat a boss that constantly curb stomps you with plasma fire.\n-Glitchy and inconsistent physics which make getting around in the levels a bit of a pain at times. This isn't that huge of an issue though.\n\n\nWith all this in mind, I am going to jump back into the game and see if I can't complete it anyway despite the game ending bug.\n\nEDIT: I was able to get past that part that kept crashing but only 30 minutes later I ran into another issue, a door that was supposed to open at the end of a boss fight failed to open (I think its because the boss got stuck on some level geometry and the door just never triggers) So yeah unfortunately I'm not going to finish this one.","January 23, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are six components to acquire, each of them preceded by two "puzzles" and a boss fight.\n\nFirst and foremost, the puzzles in this game should hardly be considered puzzles. All you're tasked with is moving objects from point A to point B. The difficulty comes from the terrible physics and frustrating controls. For a game that relies plenty on object manipulation, these flaws are a huge deal breaker.\n\nOf the many games I've played, this is one of the few I just can't bring myself to recommend unless you want to test your patience.\n\nGrade: C-","February 7, 2012","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
