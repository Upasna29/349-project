It handled the topic at hand with surprising delicacy. The main game is basically Kelly, the protagonist, basically visiting her grandfathers home in the country when the weather turns bad, so she heads home. She and her mom start talking on the phone, and in the midst of the conversation, it is revealed that one or more tornadoes are going to be touching down in the area. So, Kelly must try to get to the safety of home. All the while, she is chatting with her mom, and later with her dad and her brother Ben as well.\n\nIt is obvious that she has been estranged from her family and has recently come back to live with them, which has resulted in conflicted feelings and a lot of trying to regain the relationships she once shared.\n\nI wont reveal the ending, but it was both ambiguous and obvious (funny how that works). Through the game, you are basically driving home as mentioned before, and the only knock I have is that you actually have to hold down the D key or (on a gamepad) and trigger.....the entire game, which is annoying. Outside of that however, I thought it was a fairly seamless experience. The dialogue was interesting and the interactions felt real.\n\nThere is an epilogue, and this is really where the variant choices and decision come into play (as was highlighted on the product page via the current first page curation (800+ variations). they all take place in the epilogue, and without revealing the actual content (as it would also serve as a spoiler for the main game), I will just say that this was at least as interesting as the main game.\n\nThe extras were all cool as well. Ben's stories were all well written and fun to read. Kelly's photo class final was fun to look at, and the soundtrack was excellent.\n\nI give this eight snapshots of a tornado out of ten possible before getting sucked into it because you got waaaaayyyyy too close.","April 13, 2015","true","26.3"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","37","47","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/344500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Three Fourths Home, the first visual game by developer [bracket] games, is a beautiful piece of interactive fiction. As a finalist for the IGF’s Excellence in Narrative award, Three Fourths Home is a balancing act between game and story, between driving and speaking, and between truth and fiction. Available for PC and Mac, this game is a worthwhile experience for those who like interactive fiction and branching narrative, but gameplay won’t inspire or challenge many players.\nThe player, twenty-something Kelly, is on a long drive home. Whatever history you craft for your version of Kelly, it becomes obvious very quickly that she has a strained relationship with her family. Her mother is frequently biting and sarcastic while her father self-medicates; her brother’s mental illness casts a vague but lingering shadow over family interactions. Three Fourths Home doesn’t offer you a lot of answers—almost none, in fact—but it does offer a realistic view of the ways families speak to one another, blending secrets with facts in ways that only make sense to the participants.\nThe wide Nebraska cornfields provide a unique backdrop for the game. They’re desolate but thriving, unique but plain, a perfect complement to Kelly’s family. And when a storm kicks up and grows in intensity, so do your feelings about the situation. You can’t fix the relationships any more than you can stop the storm—all you can do is keep moving forward, advancing the conversation and hoping you can figure it all out in the end.\nSpoiler alert: you can’t. There are some things that can’t be fixed. All you can do is understand; an option the game affords you without forcing it upon you. This is one game where exploring the additional menu options and replaying multiple times will enhance your appreciation of the narrative. While you’ll always come to the same end, each playthrough will help you navigate the conversation a little better, just as reliving a memory will.\nThe writing in Three Fourths Home is beautiful, although reading the dynamic gray text may strain the eyes a bit at times. The dialog is elegantly crafted and realistic, and Kelly’s brother’s short stories are an excellent way to flesh out the family’s character without using a ham-fisted approach. It encourages the kind of understanding that comes from analyzing a situation after the fact, making it a flawless way to approach the story’s holes and questions.\nThree Fourths Home is an interesting example of the interactive fiction/video game divide. While it absolutely has to be a game—the combination of visual, audio, writing, and interactivity require this medium—there’s very little for the player to do.\nTo advance, you have to hold down either the right arrow or ‘d’ key, otherwise all progression stops. So prepare for some finger cramps. While this mechanic makes sense—forcing you to manage your interactions along with your car progression, just like when you have a conversation while driving—it feels like too little, until it’s too much. As it stands, holding a key down to drive is a tedious way of getting the point across when you’re much more focused on the conversation.\nAdding more complications like having to steer or follow directions would definitely complicate the driving, but also distract from the necessarily slow pace. It’s hard to say whether that would be an improvement or just a distraction, but as it is, it treads a very thin line between being too much and too little gameplay, and sometimes feels like it leans too heavily to one side or the other.\nThree Fourths Home is a simple game— you can’t lose. But you can’t really win, either. All you can do is see it through to the end and fill in your own ideas about what “success” means in this context. Those who want a traditional game experience with wins, losses, and challenges aren’t going to find it in this game.\nThere’s a lot to like about Three Fourths Home. It’s the kind of game that makes you think. It’s the kind of game that makes you want to force others to play it so you can talk to them about it, and collectively tap into the moody, melancholic heart of it. It’s a perfect example of using game mechanics to tell a story, while also sometimes stumbling to do it well.If story and interactive fiction interest you, and if you like musing on regret and memory and family, you’ll find something to like in Three Fourths Home.","July 23, 2015","true","9.7"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","1"

The story is ultimately unsatisfying, as it leaves far too much left open to speculation and interpretation. A little ambiguity is nice, but this much just feels empty. Plus, as others have mentioned, having to hold the "d" key down is unnecessary and annoying, and the text in the main game is eye-straining.

The main story, as far as I can see, has but one ending no matter which dialogue choices you make: the "interactivity" besides picking your words is holding down a button to drive...while you read. The graphics were simplistic and didn't work that well in terms of the main story. The epilogue was done quite a bit better: it had multiple endings - some bad that end it early, one "good" ending, all equally bleak - and the graphics actually fit the emotional tone of the narrative. Furthermore, at least the epilogue showed you the main character, as opposed to the main story where all you see is a car going along a background, and all the characters are merely heard, not seen. They're expressive enough but some facial expression would have been nice to go with it.\n\nYou'll notice I spent two and a half hours on this game. That was the main story once, the epilogue four times, going through the extras (including letting the soundtrack run all the way through for an achievement,) and then a final cutscene. So to do absolutely everything, less than three hours. Full disclosure: I did receive a free copy of this game from the developer. Do I think it was worth the time I invested? Only partly. Some of it was good, the rest I did not find a very engaging story - it IS a character study, do not assume plot of any kind. Will it be worth the time AND money that YOU invest in it?

And for the epilogue, its tell by conversation between Kelly and her mother, while she's waiting for a bus in the middle of snowy day. All choice matter in epilogue, the story can be different because it is depend on what you choose.\n\nOne thing that I like in this game is characterization tailored through story.

Quite simply this is much more about the story than the game. And to me that's not such a bad thing.\n\nThe characters are believable, I suppose in part because you get to decide how Kelly should respond and in turn guiding how the other characters repsond. I found myself at times telling her to say what I would say and at other times playing along with the narrative - saying what I think would bring more of the story out for me to hear.\n\nThe other part of the believability is how well they're crafted. You don't know their backstory. You get snippets from them. Snippets from other family members. Snippets from Kelly's replies. Enough to make a picture, enough to let your imagination fill in the blanks without thinking the storyteller should have given you more (but wishing they had).\n\nActually the storytelling is so good I do want more. I want to go back and play it again. Change my answers, try and learn more about everyone. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any spoilers.\n\nSo storytelling before gameplay? Yeah that's how this car rolls...through Nebraska...in a storm...but only when holding the buttons down...(play it, you'll see what I mean).\n\nI gotta say, wouldn't you pay such an itty bitty price for an amazingly well crafted and engaging story with believable characters? So why not pay it for a story and game?","October 19, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The conversation with your Mom comes to a climax talking out all of your problems.\nTechnically this game is a cheap Unity production. The graphics look horrible and the game concept to drive the longway and keep on talking is poor. I can just praise the richness of dialogues which seem very realistic. But then you realize the raindrops are going through the text and if your car stops also the background sirens stop (wtf?). The decision matrix concentrates just on the epilogue. It's not easy to catch the right bus (which is allegedly 404). Very annoying is to crawl through "extra content" after you reached all endings.

I decided to play after hearing Kinda Funny's Colin Moriarty sing praises of it, talking of how sad it was; how thoughtful.\nSorry, it's not.\nIt was fine at the beginning, but I probably only think that because I thought it was an introduction to something that was more than 40 minutes long. I was thinking I would be playing for about 2 hours, but alas. My fault.\nAnyway: the story is pretty darn boring, for starters. I felt little to no emotion. I couldn't care less about the characters. The developers attempted to build and develop the charcters, but in my opinion, utterly failed. There was nothing particularly thought or emotion provoking at all. We only get small details about a family that isn't in the best shape, and that's it.

If you do, it's worth the entrace fee. We are inventing and defining this medium as we go and I'm enjoying each step along the way. Three Fourths Home being one of them.\nThis is not a huge powerhouse of narrative exposition, nor is it a "videogame" in the classic sense.

Somebody on this team is a decent fiction writer, which feels odd in this day and age.\nMy least favorite part would be my fingers getting tired/bored from holding "right" the whole time.

(Part 2 is available on my same Youtube channel if you want to spoil it)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCV9hrCu2G8\n\nI have several complaints about this game..\n(Be aware that reading this review does have minor spoilers)\n\nFirst off, understand that even with the initial 10% discount, $7 USD is too much money for this kind of game.\n\nSecondly, a big complaint is that I honestly think the choices you make likely matter not in the end as it seems that everyone is going to get the same or a very similar ending.\n\nThird, I dont understand the point of needing to drive, of having controls for lights and a horn.  The lights and horn and zoom controls included offer absolutely ZERO SIGNIFICANCE in the game.\n\nFourth, Whats the point of needing to hold "D" down the entire story to drive?  Why not just make the car drive automatically and offer a pause option to the player if needed?  It's not like holding down the D button on your keyboard gives the game some great gameplay mechanics.  There is nothing to dodge, no reason to stop driving, slow down.  It's just making sure you hold down the D key to keep the story flowing along!  FOR AN HOUR!\n\nFifth, parts of the story make no sense at all.  Ben's story he tells his sister is "a cool story bro" but offers nothing to the main story's plot, makes no sense in the situation at all.  There's a massive rainstorm, tornadoes are risking the lives of everyone in the story, but Ben is going to tell her a 15 minute fantasy story he wrote about a mystical beast in a fantasy land?!?  Uhh, okay.\n\nSixth problem is that parts of the story also are awkward.  Options to have your star 24 year old female obsessing over the masturbation of her younger 16 year old brother while driving in a rain storm talking to her mother feels out of place, awkward, and 'forced'.. not natural.\n\nSeventh problem.. Unsatisfying ending to say the least.  Why build up this much tension and require the player to read and hold down a D key for an hour for "that"?  WTF.  Garbage.\n\nI like the writing, parts of it.  I like the theme of the game just fine.  But for $7, or over $6 at the current 10% off when I bought it... ehhh.  I just think it could have been done much, much better and for the price, we should probably get something besides this completely random, unsensical mess of a story.\n\nIf the game is 80% off, it might be a good value for the people who tend to like this kind of game, including myself.  Anything over an 80% off sale will likely leave you shaking your head and thinking exactly what I thought at the end.. "WTF".\n\nTwo thumbs down, as much as I want to like it, for all the reasons above and the fact that the negatives outweigh the postives.","March 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","21","36","3","2"

I finished it in about an hour, but it was a bittersweet hour for me.\n\nThree Fourths Home (Extended Edition) comes in two parts. The main story and an epilogue, the latter not being in the initial release. Strangely, the epilogue had a harder emotional impact on me, but even if it didn't, the Extended Edition only costs an extra 2 bucks. Chump change I don't mind giving to have the whole unadulterated experience.\n\nAs a story, it's best for those who are currently going through or have recently gone through their coming of age, for it thematically focuses on matters of family and the young adult's fears for the future, stuff not normally dealt with in a medium that is well-known for escapism. So as a game, it's definitely far from the norm, and whether or not that's a good thing will depend on how receptive you are to the idea of reading about the realities of relationships and growing up. Some reviewers think that more games like this are needed. Others think games should just keep being what they've always been about. I think it would be wiser to maintain an open mind when browsing the store page. Opinions are always subject to change as time goes on. The game scorned today for its complete lack of 'gameplay'  might become the game desired for its contextual significance tomorrow. Food for thought.\n\nOn a closing note, I have 52 games on this account at the time of writing this. This is the first one I've reviewed, because unlike the others, many of which are excellent, memorable and purchased in good faith and without regret, this one was all that and more for it struck all the right chords within me. So I recommend you buy it and play to the end just to see if it might do the same for you. And if it doesn't, the refund option will still be there, and you'll have only lost an hour. But it'll be an hour in the world of someone who you might just end up becoming one stormy morning.","January 27","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I backed it just for the game because it looked interesting, but it didn't make it. After playing this game, it's a bigger shame that it failed.\n\nThree Fourths Homes lies more on the interactive fiction side of the adventure game spectrum so if you need to shoot things or stick a rubber duck onto a fishing pole than this isn't for you. Interactive fiction/narrative games live and die on the quality of their writing and I'd say the game delivers. You play as a young woman named Kelly who's returning to her family's farmhouse in Nebraska after not being in contact for some time while a large storm is brewing. Gameplay is simple you just keep driving by holding down a button while you make dialogue choices. Having to hold down a button might be annoying for some but I have to admit I actually stopped noticing that I was doing it and it sort of helped a bit to immerse me more.\n\nLike Kentucky Route Zero and Walking Dead Season 1, the choices you make in the main game are more about shaping who Kelly is and her relationship with her family. The writing is also low key and manages to bring some real humanity and character to the cast that a lot of games struggle with. You get a good feeling for Kelly and her family and you grow to care. The atmosphere is also really good and at some points it can be quite haunting. The ending isn't unpredictable but the epilogue greatly enhances it, really tying together the themes of regret and decay that the game has in a strong way. The Epilogue is the best part of the game because of this and really helps the game to stick with you after its done.\n\nOverall Three Fourths Home is powerful and to the point, a really nice first outing for a fledging dev. I hope the best for them and I'd be willing to back them again if they give To Azimuth another shot. If you like interactive fiction and/or narrative driven games Three Fourths Home is well worth your time and money.","May 12, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It isn’t any of the things usually required for an item to be offered by Steam. But it is (in my opinion) two things less commonly found on Steam: a totally inclusive artistic experience, and a detailed work by a writer bursting to express themselves through an emotional outlet involving the player.\n\nIt’s an account of a young woman, Kelly, early 20s, talking on the phone to her parents and younger brother, Ben, as she attempts to drive home in the midst of a Nebraska storm, tornado approaching. It’s a family, like any other, with a great deal of love, and lots of issues. It’s very difficult to say much without saying too much, so this will be an unusually short review, with fewer details.\n\nThis is the story of a search for self by all participants; characters, players and writer/developer, in no set priority that I can determine. The characters could be kinder toward each other, but in how many families is that generally the case? Everyone in this family has lost something, and throughout, they struggle to regain, or accept the changes that come with loss. Much is expressed through hints and subtle emotion and comments, since only the player is in the dark, and learns certain things through the dialog choices they select during the long conversation over the phone. The existing storm and the approaching tornado add a sense of inevitability, a feeling of the foolishness of man to focus on the minutia of our lives. This game is largely about aspects that may seem petty, but in reality are the very things that consume nearly every moment of our existence. Perhaps ultimately this is about the attempts all humans make to discover themselves through their attempts to discover each other.\n\nOne very simple choice I made in this game was so utterly tragic and heartbreaking that I nearly stopped “playing”, for fear continuing would taint the developers intent. I’m very glad I didn’t\n\nSome hints to enjoy this game more completely\nExamine the menu option for the game controls. Some are simply there to add a sense of heightened reality. One that I sorely wish I’d known of is the control for playing music in Kelly’s car. The music in this game is one of its strongest features (and that is saying a GREAT deal.) While the music would have added to my game enjoyment, I listen to the music by itself, and enjoy it immensely. Not just the music, but the sounds of the weather add much to the story. Headphones are a strong consideration. (The text is all silent, read from the screen.)\nAt no point assume this story is over (attempting to exit the game emphasizes this.) Perhaps the presence of achievements, ordinarily a distraction in such a game, may actually serve the purpose of indicating completeness more than accomplishment. Do NOT miss Kelly’s photo essay. And by NO means skip over Ben’s stories. I only hope that some day a game is developed based entirely on these, and similar, atmospheric short stories.\n\nWhile comparisons to other games, such as Journal, To the Moon or Kentucky Route Zero might be made, this game is far more immersive and artistic than those. Perhaps more than any game that will come along any time soon. If you want to learn something about people and families, and perhaps even something about yourself with a game that does have some degree of replayability, Three Fourths Home is quite possibly the game for you.\n\n\n4CD&W","April 14, 2015","true","1.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I liked the idea of exploring the characters life and background through dialogue and the minimilistic approach the developer took. However, the game felt like reading someones short-story fiction they submitted to a group critique for an undergrad advanced writing course. I'm not much a fan of visual novels, it's not my cup of tea. This one in particular had some beautiful visual elements that matched where you were in reading the dialogue that added to the mood and really played on your emotions. But, after a while the game just really felt like it was dragging on.\n\nIf you like visual novels and are drawn in by character studies, this is a great game for you. It really is designed well and the visuals are fantastic. The writing is very well done as well, but it felt like something that kept going for much longer than it should have.","November 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was just curious. I was surprised by how atmospheric this game is. Sure, it's short but in this short time you can learn about characters and their story. Maybe not entirely; there're some things to wonder about. Which is another charm for this game. If you have the patience and you're willing to listen them out, then you have nothing to lose. You might even get attached to some characters, that's how real they seem. My favorite one is Ben the Benji - protagonist's little bro. I fell in fap, i mean 'love', with his mad writing skills. His stories are darn awesome. I read them holding my breath. That's how cool they are. The Drunkard story is my favorite. I wish there were a blog or something where I could find more of his works. I also simply loved that part of the game when Benji starts telling Kelly a story about the Beast and how they're both so into the story that the sirens and intense thunderstorm suddenly become quiet. And when there's lightning, you can catch a glimpse of the Beast which makes the story even more amazing.\nExtras are delicious, too.

Having said this there's no denying that the dialogue will flow forward on the same path regardless of your choices so here's why the replay value is limited.\n\nThree Fourths Home is a great visual novel with excellent story and writing: a cursory look at online reviews will show you that quite a few people were left pondering on how the story tied with their life long after they stopped playing and this should tell you plenty about its quality. Depending on how much you value "artsy" games and novels it might be overpriced for what it does but if you see it on sale or, like me, in a bundle pick it up, you won't be disappointed.","July 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its subtlety fleshes out emotions well in the first part of the game, and while the epilogue felt a bit heavy-handed and harsh at first, it was brought back down to Earth with its climax. Not all the characters are likeable, but that reflects the reality behind the story. The extra content is also a nice touch, fleshing out the world further and giving the feeling that the family's story goes beyond the main narrative.

You learn about Kelly, her family, and the trials that have led to this place and time. Kelly is trying to get in home in the middle of a summer storm in Nebraska. While driving she is talking to first her mother and then the other members of her family. The interactive comes in the form of selecting how Kelly responds during the conversation.\n\nIf you are looking for a game with a lot of interactivity, this game is not for you. But I suspect anyone reading this would know that already. If the general descriptions of the game have piqued your interest, then the game is worth your time and money. With that said, make sure you play the second scenario (Kelly waiting for the bus in Minnesota) to get the full sense of the game. Also, the stories that are included as extras are worth your time as well.","March 21, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Three Fourths Home is a game about holding right.\n\nThree Fourths Home is a tight little (emphasis on the little) visual novel about post-college woman who comes home and doesn't want to be there. As someone who typically loves the not-video game genre with things like Gone Home and the Beginners Guide this is probably the first time I ever questioned where a game like this was worth the purchase.\n\nThe visuals are actually interesting even if they are a little static and the sound design is spot-on, placing you in a car ride during a rain storm but it's actually the narrative that was the biggest let down of the game. The subject of having to return from school, back to a small town and back to living with your parents is a story that's becoming more and more real for a lot of people and something video games haven't really tackled. And the portrayal of this feels honest. There's a contrained politeness from the main character when she's talking to her mom and dad but that's where it ends. The story's told through a series of phone calls between the main character and her family but it feels limited and constrained. Characters can only really stress how dangerous a storm is until it gets VERY stale and where we're meant to read into what's not being said and extrapolate and think about the situations, what we find feels shallow and a little predictable.","December 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great writing, too—just realize that it's more of an interactive novel than a traditional video game. That's not really a criticism, but I feel like a lot of the negative reviews come from people who didn't really know what they were buying. I feel like it's a little overpriced for the length (both the main story and epilogue took me a little under an hour), but I'm a fast reader, so it'll probably last most people a bit longer. The white background also hurt my eyes after a while; the epilogue was a lot easier to read because of the darker background. Overall, I'd highly recommend Three-Fourths Home.

As such, it isn't for everyone - but if that premise interests you then I recommend it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIt's essentially a discourse between a small cast of characters. The player can navigate the conversation at their leisure, branching occasionally. The dialogue has to be strong for this to work - and it is: strong enough that it would probably transpose very well to the stage. This feeling is helped by its minimal aesthetic and atmospheric soundtrack. It boils down to a humble, human story about family and life and stuff. It is beautiful.\n\nI played through once, which took me about an hour (including the epilogue - which isn't really an epilogue at all, it's a critical second chapter which fills out the plot.

The game is very brief, which is fine, and consists of two telephone conversations (one during the main game, and one during the epilogue) with the protagonist's mother.  The conversation itself feels mostly authentic, but I was slightly distracted by the fact that the mother keeps simulataneously telling your character to be careful driving in the bad weather, but refusing to get off of the phone.  That is a minor complaint, but the bigger problem is that the story doesn't really go anywhere.  The Epilogue is a bit better than the main game, in my opinion, and I do like the very simple art style.  If you enjoy story-based games, and can catch this on sale, I would say it's worth checking out.  It's clear that quite a bit of care went into the crafting of the experience.","May 29","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
