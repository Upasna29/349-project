It proudly tells me this on the menu screen.  And I have to say, on the strength of this product, should I ever decide to join the glut of people currently making cheap-arsed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horror product in their bedrooms...I might make it a point to avoid GameGuru like the plague.  I also might not opt to make and release a game, especially for money, until I confirm that I:  a. Have some actual talent making games, and b. Have some remotely worthwhile ideas to fill said game with.  Luckily for all of us, Mamedov Yuriy has no such hesitations.  He/she/they have made a game, and while it starts promisingly enough in the first few minutes - in which you run down a dirt track through some admittedly lovely scenery - it's all pretty much downhill once you actually reach a large, spooky, asylum-like building and step inside.\n\nIn VERGE:Lost chapter - that's precisely how it's written, so for reasons of aesthetic purity, I shall keep it that way - you play a small, kangaroo-like creature (a wallaby, perhaps?) who hops along the corridors of said spooky building, goes through lots of doors, and triggers an excruciatingly long load screen approximately once every thirty-seven seconds.  That's when you are not enduring excruciatingly long text screens which, in addition to scrolling by at the speed of darkness, CANNOT BE SKIPPED, at least as best as I can tell.  Oh, and did I mention that you CANNOT SAVE at any point of the game, be it manually or by way of predetermined checkpoints...in spite of the fact that you'll basically be requiring a "primal scream break" every ten minutes or so, lest you put a FIST THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN?!\n\nNow, none of this is to say that there's absolutely NO redeeming features to this game.  Some of the sound is actually rather effective - emphasis on the word SOME - and some - again, SOME - of the graphics aren't too bad (well, some of the outdoor graphics anyway; the interiors are pretty much uniformly ♥♥♥♥♥).  Other than that, the painfully slow and vertigo-inducing movement basically led me to pack this one in before I'd even so much as laid eyes on a monster, though a quick glance at the trailer on the Store page assures me that I didn't miss out on much.\n\nY'know, when I was a young'un, I wasted an awful lot of my time and money watching almost every ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-budget horror movie I could lay my hands on.  Nowadays, I'm relieved to report that I only waste similar amounts of time and money playing every ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-budget horror GAME I can lay my hands on.  Hey...waitaminute...th-that's not any kind of PROGRESS, is it?  God preserve me...WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!\n\nVerdict: 2.5/10.","October 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 116 of 141 people (82%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","82","116","141","39","2"

Having said this I wanted to voice my opinion to aid anyone interested in this title. I cannot recommend anyone to purchase it. "VERGE" is incredibly short just as the previous game "My Bones" I played from this developer. I completed it with both alternate conclusions in maybe fifteen minutes. Although there are not as many bugs and grammatical errors. The "Demon" does actually work in this game.\nAgain from an artistic stand point I can appreciate what the developer was trying to achieve, but this alone doesn't justify a price tag of any kind. This should be offered as a free experience for the casual and curious. I paid ninety nine cents for this download, and while this amount is inconsequential, it is unmerited. A basic "Copy & Paste" review for this dev's second game.

Heavy rain starts to pour down and you find yourself seeking shelter. This is how VERGE:Lost chapter, the second title from indie developer M. Yuriy, opens. Let it be said now that if you intend on playing this game, prepare for some incredibly long loading screens that happen quite often. One complete playthrough for me had 8 load screens, which lasted between 30-60 seconds each.\n\nThe game starts off with a truly laughable rain effect that does anything but set the mood for terror. It's simply a couple of transparent JPG images looped to create the appearance of rain. The rest of the graphics are decent enough, though if you want to get the better experience remember to press ESC and go into the settings to set them to high; the game automatically runs on medium by default, which is much less impressive. There are only a couple of areas that have any real tension to them, but they last so briefly that it's all over before it actually began.\n\nWhatever scare factor and terror potential that VERGE: Lost chapter houses is completely obliterated by the unreasonable load times. There's nothing quite like sitting around, picking your nails for upwards of a minute every 2-3 minutes. Just as a rough estimate of how often this occurs, I beat the game in 30 minutes; during that time I experienced 8 load screens. That means on average, every 3.75 minutes I came to a standstill at a load screen, and out of the time I spent playing the game, roughly 5-6 minutes was dedicated to load times. That, ladies and gentlemen, is worse than the Playstation 1 era.\n\nOverall, VERGE: Lost chapter isn't anything special. You can choose from two different endings, but neither of them are anything to write home about. The "good" ending even has a massive plot hole in it. It's definitely not worth sitting through the loading screens again to go back for the other ending, either; just YouTube it. Without these awful sequences, the game might've stood a fair chance, but since they won't be getting patched out or fixed up, completely avoid this mess.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 15","false","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

That engine does not have the same power as more popular engines like Unity or Unreal. So going into this game I knew the capabilities of the engine and what it had to offer. I also have some experience with Game Guru and its previous versions when it was called FPS Creator. Now with that said and out of the way I really enjoyed this experience. The first thing that struck me was the graphics. Yes, Game Guru does not feature the best graphics on the market but I was surprised at how good this looked at Game Guru standards. It created a great atmosphere and got me sucked into the game. The second thing was the sound design. The placement of sound effects and music were placed at perfect times to give the jump scares an authentic feel rather than cheap. Overall I really enjoyed this coming from a fellow Game Guru user and for $2 I would say give it a try.","March 15","true","0.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","2"

Just terrible.  There are no redeeming factors here whatsoever, let alone any horror.\nI should have known after playing My Bones that this would be terrible but I seem to be a glutton for punishment.  I thought maybe, just maybe the developer would have built on the initial game which showed some promise under the layers of terrible design choices.\nAt least this time round, whilst still terrible, the text in the notes lying around is at least on a par with a 12 year old text messages, as opposed to the gobbledegook of My Bones.  Good luck trying to find all of it.  For some reason the developer thought it would be a good idea to put the writing literally on the walls, only the walls were white and the text was a slightly brighter shade of white.  But no matter as it's not worth hunting down, the story makes absolutely no sense.  Something about an asylum and an experiment involving children and how one of them becomes superpowered and then rages out of control  Then there are clowns for some reason.\nTechnical flaws are abundant.  The game lags so hard and is so badly optimised, yet still looks like absolute crap for this day and age.\nThen there's the door issue, which is seemingly the only thing you can interact with in this game.  You open the door, it swings wide open, but you can't cross the threshold until the door has completed its opening animation which takes several seconds too long.  Absolutely ridiculous, and the developer thought the best way to draw attention to this was to throw a few doors in during the game's only chase sequence.  It's beyond laughable.\nThen there's an odd "choose your ending" thing at the very end for some bizarre reason, which was basically about making a choice between a cozy bed or an electric chair watched over by an ominous looking clown.\nNone of this game made any sense whatsoever.  And at the end, spoiler alert, and this seemed like the developer was actually just trying to insult your intelligence, as if playing the game wasn't enough of a torture, but in the ending epilgoue text, it talks about how after you escape from the asylum you run to your car and drive away as fast as possible.  The only reason you wandered into the asylum in the first place was because your car broke down!!!\nAvoid like the plague.","November 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"
