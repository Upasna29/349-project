I'd consider this game to be the best game made by DXF Games up to this point, both in terms of game play polish and variety.\n\nYou play as a cleric whose fellow party members are killed by a dragon. You're then given the choice to loot one of the corpses, then - vowing revenge - you head to a nearby town that serves as a hub for managing equipment and procuring quests to complete. These quests involve anything from killing enemies to retrieving lost items to fishing, among other things.\n\nGraphically, the game resembles something that you'd play on Sega's battery-munching Game Gear system. Everything's bright and colorful and low-resolution. For the most part, this doesn't get in the way of playability, but it's worth noting that some of the text can be hard to read.\n\nI daresay that the soundtrack is the highlight of the game for me. The game's developer plays bass guitar, and his band provided the soundtrack for the game. The music on its own is fine and surprisingly fitting for the action, then the vocals start and bring it to a whole other level. They just have this Randy Newman-esque narrative style going on. It's actually pretty charming and hilarious. "Let's go to the field. Giant cricket!"\n\nThe actual game play is simple at a glance, with simple controls and very little in the way of mechanics to get used to. There's actually a lot more going on behind the scenes, though, with plenty in the way of stats and conditions and how they're implemented not needing to be directly communicated to the player.\n\nThe pacing is somewhat slow at first, but you can do a lot to customize the speed of your character's attacks and whatnot to make things more to your liking. I'm pretty boring in how I play, so I generally just pump all of my stat points into strength and constitution, but you can really experiment with your character's stats and equipment to the point that replayability is highly encouraged.\n\nDon't go in expecting a technical marvel, in either case. There's no PhysX here. The overall feel of the game is akin to what you might play on a Game Gear or an NES, even though - as I touched on before - there's a lot more going on behind the scenes that effects game play in a meaningful way.\n\nLevel design has a ton of variety to it (with my favorite being a dark cave level so far). Some levels have a lot of verticality to them, while others are almost maze-like. Others have sub-areas to explore, and some of them even include boss battles that do a lot to mix things up a bit more. The enemy placement complements the level design really well, too, which is always nice to see.\n\nOverall, if you want a nice, inexpensive game with a ton of replay value, I can't recommend Just a Cleric enough.\n\n\nFull disclaimer: I assisted in testing Just a Cleric prior to its release, even prior to its listing on Greenlight. I also provided light feedback with respect to content and usability. (I also assisted with testing and feedback on past DXF Games projects.) I also received free pre-release builds of the game outside of Steam, and I received a free code for redemption on Steam to test Steam-exclusive functionality.","May 19","true","3.9"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

He's very vocal with the community and has fixed some things that really irked me when I first made this review. My review was initially negative, but the developer fixed the issues as fast as you can say, "Just a Cleric." So don't be afraid to contact him or post issues on the forum. I will leave my original review intact, but my new review is as follows...\n\nPROS\n\n-Great and hilarious original soundtrack filled with crunchy bass lines and HILARIOUS lyrics.\n\n-New game plus feature that introduces cool new features that I don't want to spoil for you. HINT: Jump around EVERYWHERE when in new game plus. Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\n-Cool, but very basic leveling/upgrade system. This is both a con and a positive. I'll explain the cons of this in the con section below. You can upgrade your gear to plus 4 and after that you can get your items blessed for even more power, whcih is a very cool feature.\n\n- Once you get past the difficulty curve, the game is a joy to play. I ended up playing for a few hours last night and didn't realize the time flew by so fast.\n\n-NPCs are hilarious as well and blend in with the cutesy atmosphere.\n\nCONS\n\n-No place where you can farm for money or gear between missions. The gear can be pretty expensive.\n\n-The font is pretty atrocious, but hang in there and you'll adapt to it\n\n-Sometimes the Cleric has a hard time listening to your button commands.Only seems to be this way when you're under attack. The overall feel of the controls is avergae at best.\n\n-Lacks a skill upgrade system. The stats DO affect your powers, but I would have found leveling more enjoyable with something else to invest points in, like maybe passive skills that increase run speed, Attack speed etc, but the leveling system is still solid.\n\n-Sometimes difficulty can seem more artifical than fair. That's when you gotta outwit the opponent by using the ladders to destroy them. Trust me, it's a godsend, especially against the Dragon.\n\nIf you end up buying this game I HIGHLY recommend focusing on mostly the Faith stat because you're gonna get annoyed by sitting there for at least  a minute or two to heal your magic points in order to heal your hp, only to go fight a Boss that drains your HP like you're wearing a styrafoam armor set. I'm not saying ignore all the other stats, but make sure you have a healthy amount of faith. Also, the SPEAR type weapons are the absolute best weapons to use.\n\nAfter all my frustrations with the first few hours of playtime, I finally got the hang of it and now I'm having a blast with it. I'm actually destroying New Game plus at the moment with no issues. I recommend this game if you're into Metroidvania style games and also want a good laugh in the process due to the amazing music.\n\nGive it a shot! It's cheap! :)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW\n\nPros:\n\n-Great music, very funny lyrics and that bass line is crunchy\n\n-Decent character upgrade/leveling system.  (there are cons for this I'll explain later)\n\n-The townsfolk are funny, The humor in this game is top notch.\n\nCons:\n\n-Lack of farming/grinding for levels or items. This is a problem because of.....\n\n-Expensive Gear. This wouldn't be a problem if we were able to farm  to buy said gear and upgrade the gear more frequently.\n\n-Steep learning curve. I'm just going to say. I HATE the Werewolves and the Dragon. Never ending infuriation.  It seems that the enemies tend to hit you first if you dont have a spear.\n\n-No checkpoint system. Dying over and over and over again would be acceptable if we didn't have to go through the same stage over and over and over and over and over again, wasting valuable time.  Checkpoints NEED to be implemented to lessen the frustration. I would be able to deal with it if the game had such a system.\n\n-Difficulty seems more artifical than fair. Trust me, I LOVE difficult games if it's implemented correctly. Here it just seems artifically difficult,\n\nIf you end up buying this game I HIGHLY recomend focusing on mostly the Faith stat because you're gonna get annoyed by sitting there for at least  a minute or two to heal your magic points in order to heal your hp, only to go fight a Boss that drains your HP like you're wearing a styrafoam armor set.\n\nThis game has ALOT of potential and the developer immediately responds to issues and fixes bugs promptly. At best, this game feels alot like an early access title. As much as I like the developer, I can't recommend this game.","May 20","true","8.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toeli/recommended/467330/","toeli","Toeli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toeli/","88 products in account","I´ve had the possibility to talk to the Developer a lot and I´ve been keeping an eye on this game since it was put on Greenlight. So far, this game has been one of the best Indie-Releases I´ve played to date, but let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe Developer is a great guy who already developed a few other games, JAC being the first one who was put on Steam Greenlight. I don´t know where I met him anymore (I think it was somewhere in the Off-Topic-Hell here in the Steam-Community), but he told me about JAC and after I saw the Greenlight Trailer I immediately knew that this game had potential. After two or three weeks he uploaded a Demo for everyone to try. This Demo was the moment I was really convinced to buy this game. The humor in this game is so awesome, almost every NPC is admireable and throws out one gag after another. Situational Humor, funny Tooltips... The Demo alone already entertained me more than most games in terms of humor.\n\nGameplay-wise this game reminds me of the old Castlevania Games, mixed with a weird blend of different games. The Cleric Class from the Old-School-RPG´s (take Baldur´s Gate from BioWare as an example), the deadly traps you know from Dungeon Crawlers and Side-Scrollers (like Castlevania), a lovely Pixel-Art-Graphicstyle (which only adds to the charme of the game, I couldn´t imagine this game being 3D or whatever), everything in this game kinda matches.\n\nYou start off as a Cleric who never gets to do something (yes, you´ve read it correct, you never get to do something).\nHis Party-Members are so strong, he just stands somewhere in the back, drinking Milk, while his Party Members have been bringing wrecking carnage upon the enemies. One day though, he has to take a ♥♥♥♥ after a fight (because he drank too much Milk) and while he is gone, his friends are being attacked by a Dragon. Once the Cleric returns, all of his friends are dead. The Cleric swears to take revenge for his fallen comrades and pillages the dead bodies for loot. (Oh yes, that is macabre, isn´t it?). Actually, this is the first important step in the game. You are able to get the entire Gear during the game anyways, but this choice will influence your early game. You better not ♥♥♥♥ this up. Choose wisely.\n\nThe game itself is simple but challenging. Don´t expect a game that will change the entire RPG-Genre.\nMost of the time your objective is to reach a certain spot of the map, collect a certain item, destroy a certain item, find a certain NPC or protect a certain NPC. Every few missions though, a mighty boss appears and you have to figure out how to beat him. Memorize the attack patterns and exploit the weak spots. The game itself really is challenging sometimes, you will definetly find yourself repeating some stages over and over again, but the Developer really listens to Feedback, he even decreased the challenge in the first playthrough, so that the game doesn´t get too tough.\n\nOnce you´ve beat it for the first time, you´re going to find yourself in the New Game +, where the enemies have been reworked completely, delivering a harder challenge now, spitting at the poor Cleric with lots of debuffs, new attack patterns etc. Especially the Bosses are a REAL challenge now. And as if this wasn´t enough, there´s even a Super Boss  to beat. (But I haven´t reached him yet, so I can´t really say much about him).\n\nSumma Summarum: If you´re searching for a game that is able to entertain you, this game will definetly be able to fit your needs. Challenging Gameplay, the best Humor in a game I´ve seen for a long time and the charming Pixel-Graphic make this game what it is. The Developer is really listening to the Feedback, looking for opinions and ideas on how to improve his game. Hardly I´ve seen a Dev that has been so passionate (might have something to do with the fact that he´s been working on this game in his free time during the last two years. You can see the Heartblood he pumped into this title). I´ve spent 4€ on it, and that´s far less than what I´ve spent on some "AAA-Games" who have been disappointing, to say the least. If you´re even slightly interested in such games, consider to pick this up. You won´t regret it.","May 22","true","7.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Some levels are small and require you to beat the nearby enemies in some way, while others are more maze-like and feature optional paths and secrets. There's also a New Game+ mode that has incentives such as stronger enemies, hidden powerups and some different items to obtain.\n\nThe controls are simple enough, with your character being able to equip a variety of weapon types and to learn a series of spells. You can choose what stats to increase when levelling up and even reset them for a small price if needed. I've found that increasing Faith is quite useful so you can recharge MP quickly and use the healing spell any time you find yourself in trouble.\n\nSome missions are rather difficult, but it shouldn't take long for any action game fan to get the hang of it. Get good, will ya? Most of the time you can turtle out of battles, even some bosses, to heal yourself and there's a rather cheesy fire shield spell that trivializes several areas. As a wise man once said: "Ninjas can't catch you if you're on fire".\n\nThe low-res pixel art gives a cute cartoony feel to it, not unlike Environmental Station Alpha. Plus, it has a silly soundtrack with corny lyrics.\n\nAll in all, the game feels like an improvement to one of the dev's more well known games, Hasslevania. Frankly, the ongoing Hasslevania 2 project, as I remember it from the betas, would feel more unrefined and slow-paced than this one. Just A Cleric is good fun, lasts for a couple of hours and is well worth the small asking price.","May 23","true","18.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In town you can walk around and talk to the eccentric npcs to buy/upgrade your equipment, and then when you're ready you can take on various quests like watering plants, stealing eggs or protecting cats from zombies! The writing/humour in these quests is fantastic and definitely the best part of the game (even the soundtrack is both hilarious and catchy).\n\nThe controls are pretty standard (move, attack, jump and spell) and the combat works fine (although the hitboxes are a little wonky). The game also has four different stats you can level depending on your playstyle. Personally I prefer Faith since you can spam healing/defensive spells more often if you level that. Now that DOES lead to a balancing problem since you can always just hide and heal up if you're low on a quest, but I won't complain since some of the levels can be pretty tough.\n\nMy only major problem is that you can't grind between quests so if you're ever stuck there's not much you can do besides tough it out. This shouldn't be an issue once you've learned the game (or abuse the healing trick) but it would be nice if you could get some extra money and materials between quests.\n\nOverall Just a Cleric is a fun (but simple) indie game that's definitely worth the price. Thumbs up to the dev who's very involved in the community and always listens to player feedback.
