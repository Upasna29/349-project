Don't let the only 2 hours or so of playtime affect this, I've been playing this for quite a while now. I've seen it change a bit and for the better.\n\nPros:\n\nPretty dang fun gameplay\nEasy to host a server if there's a need for one.\nThe graphics and lighting are cartoony and smooth. Really good on the eyes.\nI haven't run into any serious or game breaking glitches while playing it.\nSeveral Gamemodes (Guards and Thieves, Zombie Rush, Soccer, Madball, Team Death Match, etc.) so there is variety other than just stealth modes.\n\nCons:\n\nSometimes a server you connect to may make your (or others) ping a little high, but the Devs are working on having actual servers.\nCurrently only multiplayer, but that too will change in the future.\n\nOther than that, there's no serious issues with the game. The Devs are constantly adding stuff and have tons of plans ahead for future gamemodes. If you're a fan of Stealth games, this is certainly the game to get.","July 10, 2014","true","16.0"," 77 of 90 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","77","90","0","0"

If there was ever an early access game that deserved it's asking price, it's this one.\n\nOne thing that should be appreciated is this isn't an early access game where you'll find lots of bugs or glitches. In the many hours that I've played on all the gamemodes I have not encountered a single one, which has been pretty impressive. You will not clip into geometry, fall through the world or any other weird occurances. Everything works just as intended. The occassional lag will happen but that will occur due to the host. (Roll your mouse over the admin of the room to see their location.)\n\nIt's graphics and graphical options are very limited and it could probably run on a toaster but thats actually a great thing because that means more players will be able to play flawlessly. Personally I feel that artistic style>graphical fidelity anyday and OGAT has oodles of style. Not to mention it scales perfectly. I assume the engine is Unity, it's very well optimized.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, responsive (if the server is decent), and well balanced. Some are quick to shout OP, but that wouldn't happen if everyone took the time to understand how to effectively use light. Light is a big part of most of the gamemodes in OGAT, it will be your friend and it will be your enemy.\n\nThe devs should truely be rewarded for their support of OGAT and the dedication to the community adding SO much to the game it's ridiculous!\nJust take a look here http://ogat.gamepedia.com/GameMode and scroll down to see all the gamemodes they are planning to add to the game! It's like they want to recreate all of the best gmod mods, and I'm all for it!\n\nOne thing that a few of my friends have made notice was that the game has no music in it what-so-ever. It really didn't occur to me at all that it would be an issue, but for some people apparently it might be. So if soley the sound of guns and grenades don't satisfy you, that might be a bit of a problem.","July 16, 2014","true","52.0"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","45","55","0","3"

Because it’s in early access they only have multiplayer available (but they will add single player in the future); so you make a quick account, you either host or join a game, pick either side (or you are assigned it, depending if you host the game yourself or someone else has hosted it), and you’re in and playing.\n\nThe maps, which are fairly nice and big, have more than one item to steal. At the start of the round, thieves are given ONE of those items as target to steal.You can steal more than just that, but you won’t win the round unless you steal that particular thing. Thieves have the ability to see in the dark, making it easier to find your way, as well as to sneak through vents and a few other similar things. To balance it out, thieves are very easy to kill.\n\nGuards are not told what the thieves have to steal, so they must guard everything. They can’t sneak through vents, and they can’t see in the dark at all; they do make the make really, really dark for you, to add complexity. To balance it out, guards are harder to kill.\n\nBoth can interact with lights (turn them on/off), and turn on/off flashlights, which for thieves can serve as camouflage from other guards.\nFor each of them you have some 3-4 type of guards and thieves to pick from, each wth their own stat set (some have more health, some less, etc).\n\nI’m quite happy with the way they’ve balanced out the classes so that they can play off each other’s advantages and disadvantages in that sense, with the darkness for the guards and the ease to kill the thieves…\n\nThe rounds never last very long, but they are insanely fun to play with friends as much as with strangers. If Guards and Thieves aren’t your thing, or if you get bored of it, the game offers variety, not only different maps for you to select from, but also of game modes. Most of the game modes are all based on teams, though. You have capture the flag mode, zombie horde mode (in which you can be human or zombie), and a quasi-slender in which you can be slender going after the human or a human trying to find x pieces of something in the map… each one with their own particular skillset.\n\nAlthough all those modes are fairly similar, they’re all fun to play. The game also offers one more mode, a soccer game, as well as a massive multiplayer map that is a bit RPG-like in that you even get an inventory and things like that (even if you’re basically pitted against one another). My experience with that one was fun, but of terrible lag when trying to move, so I ended up dying easily.\n\nAt some points I had some connectivity issues (it wouldn’t let me join official servers), but for the most the game ran smoothly.\n\nAll in all, I think although it has a very basic premise, is very fun to play, and for an early access it has quite a bit of maps and modes, with more added often. With the upcoming multiplayer and map editor, I think Of Guards and Thieves can be a real blast!","September 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

Buying the full game gets you access to a lot of stuff, but you should definitely play the demo for a while to get a feel for the game.\n2. I said before it didn't go on sale, but checking online confirmed that it has actually gone on sale quite frequently.\n3. I used steamcharts as my source in saying the game is dead, but that didn't factor in players from other clients, which I now know there are.\n4. The "Hackers" I encountered so often are just players glitching, the devs are fixing it soon.\n\nThere are issues present, there are also bright points. For example, the devs listen to the community and care about their opinion. The fact a developer took my negative review apart and pointed out what was incorrect about it shows how much they care about the game. Another point I have is that it's still in Early Access. All things considered, this game is way better than 90% of the Early Access garbage that people get conned into buying. This also means that eventually the game will get released as a full version, which should boost the playerbase significantly. There are regular patches, and the gameplay itself is fun and addicting, inducing a "one more round" type feeling. I think I've actually convinced myself about this game, now excuse me while I go reinstall it.","January 28","true","1.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","2"

Movement feels tight. Lighting is gorgeous. Sounds are immensely satisfying. Don't be fooled by the Early Access tag: OGAT is already a blast, and it can only get better.\n\nTo start: OGAT's strength lies in the fact that any game mode is possible. The mainstay, of course, is Guards and Thieves. Guards defend six objects, but only one is the Thieves' target. In a battle of misdirection, it's a tense standoff where sharp timing is key. Classic gametypes execute perfectly in OGAT, but the game's core is so strong that the devs can (and do!) experiment.\n\nClasses\nAs you'd expect, each class has strengths & weaknesses. Cobras are quick and strong with terrible HP. Juggernauts are strong with high HP but painfully slow. You'll have preferences based on your playstyle, but all classes are fun and effective. Many more classes are on the horizon: Sniper, Engineer, Hacker, etc. Also on the way are "Gadgets", a wide variety of tools to customize loadouts.\n\nLighting\nThe game centers heavily on its lighting. For Thieves (and Zombies), their main advantage is night vision. For Guards, it's a constant struggle to keep the map well-lit. Bright red light switches line the walls. When switched off, Thieves can impose their advantage. A suddenly-dark room compels moments of risk / reward for Guards. Do I rush in, or consider the room "lost"? Darkness is dangerous territory. To counter, Guards have flashlights...but their beams are of little comfort.\n\nSound\nWhen light is scarce – which it often is – you need to locate action with your ears. The rustling of a bush. A distant knife swing. A shattering window. Since the game's sounds are so useful, verbal communication (not incl. in-game) is a borderline disadvantage. It's a bizarre feeling at first, but it works very well. As an alternative to voice chat, holding Mouse 3 brings up a radial menu with commands like Go Left and Follow Me. Text chat is always an option too, mostly used while dead on the floor.\n\nProblems\nOGAT's biggest stumble is currently a lack of dedicated servers. When you want to play, sometimes you can't find a server that works – let alone one on the same continent. Dedicated servers are in-progress, but the simple fix is: more players! More players = more player-hosted servers. So, ultimately, a Steam release alone should go a long way to address its main issue.\n\nVerdict\nIn my opinion, Of Guards and Thieves is a powder keg of potential. Even in its current form, it's an absolute ton of fun with friends and strangers alike. With a solid core and great features on the way, there's simply no reason to pass it by. Get in on the ground floor and let's go!","July 14, 2014","true","15.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

A top-down shooter that requires solid team-mates for it to be rather enjoyable.\n\nOf Guards and Thieves comes in many game modes. There is the original and most enjoyable game mode (IMO), guards and thieves where the thieves attempt to steal documents from the guards. It's somewhat comparable to what Splinter Cell Double Agent had as it's multiplayer minus the 3D aspect. Team deathmatch is also featured (pretty self explanatory). Bomb Defusal where terrorists must place a bomb in one of two spots. Zombie rush which emulates zombies versus survivors. VIP extraction mode where guards have to protect the VIP while he rushes towards an extraction point. IG mode where you have to get a set amount of kills (usually 40) to win the game. Capture the flag mode (which is also self explanatory). There are also "fun" features to the game such as a soccer mode, Mad Ball where like TDM there is a set limit but explosive like balloons are on the map, and a slender mode (slenderman game?) where players only have torches and have to search for the slenders. I have yet to play soccer as it's been difficult trying to get a game going but for the most part (and especially with a good tactical/thoughtful/mindful team), GaT (guards and thieves) mode is the best.\n\nControls are quite simple where the mouse will direct your player, can fire your weapon and turn on your light with the right mouse button. Different classes are capable of having different weaponry and moving and different speeds. You cannot equip a gun and throw a grenade at the same time though, either one or the other has to be done. Thieves have night vision and can see in the dark while guards can't. They can also enter or walk through certain parts of the map (like vents) to gain better access to rooms. One of the greatest feature in game is the ability to turn lights on and off. Having them on can deter thieves while having them off invites them. Adding features that enable one to bend the environment are extremely limited at the moment. You can move an automobile (by driving it) and you can turn the lights on/off for cover or exposure of enemies. This is about as far as it goes.\n\nSounds and music at this point are decent. Nothing over exciting or fascinating, just basic.\n\nTO THE DEVS : You guys have something good here, but I think adding one or two AI's may help. I've seen some other games modes I've wanted to try but couldn't do to the server being lock down by a password (with only 2 players in it) or there simply isn't anyone to play with. Also, why is there a necessity to choose to throw a grenade rather than simply throw one from the hip? It's a pain being in a fire fight then quickly switching to a grenade. Moreover, why not add some more capabilities to bend the environment? The light switch thing is good, keep building off that or add something new? I also have some issues with the levels as it can get annoying if the guards decide to camp out where the thieves spawn, making it nearly impossible to enjoy the game. For this reason, I feel the maps are slightly small and don't offer enough spontaneousness the thieves can take in their approach.\n\n\nIn all fairness to my reviewer, I play this game 15 to 20 minutes at a time. It really depends who I'm playing with as it can quickly become fun and engaging, to dull and boring if no one is moving around or attempting anything. As a standalone game RATING : 6.0/10\n\nRATING : 7.0/10 (pretty good for early access)\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots\nThis is typically what you will be seeing","October 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

Here's a tip: Try the ♥♥♥♥ing demo first.\n\nHere is my review:\n\nWhat it is lacking so far in this game are features that are being implemented in the future in addition to a few bugs. This, however, is to be expected. If you take time to look at the page, you'll find a big-♥♥♥ blue box that says "Early Access". This is a big red flag for people who don't want an incomplete (however playable) game. But here is what the game does feature: A very smooth and easy to figure out system for multiplayer with minimal to no lag, in addition to a highly cooperative gameplay style. This game relies heavily on teamwork and strategy, and features a variety of game modes to play. In addition to this, there are a variety of maps and a lot of different ways to play.\n\nI could elaborate on it further, but I think I may end up sounding a little repetative. I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for a fun game to play with friends or just have fun in online. I imagine the final release of this game will be a massive improvment on everything already in-game, and would most definitely be worth your time and money.","February 16, 2015","true","3.2"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","19","26","5","0"

I discovered this game through a friend from school almost a year ago, and fell absolutely in love with it. We would play at school all the time, spending hours upon hours (time I should've spent towards work, but eh) playing this game whether at school, or in skype calls at home.\n\nI don't commit to games well. Jade Dynasty, the Sly Cooper series, Runescape, and Of Guards and Thieves are some of the biggest titles of my life. Though I've owned 100s of games in my 17 years, there are no games I've invested more time into than these four. Of Guards and Thieves is a very simple concept. WASD to move, mouse to shoot, guards vs thieves (or guards vs zombies). But the strong community of great people, a connection to all of my friends, and the countless hours of fun have turned this simple game into a game I treasure. The staff at SubvertGames are amazing and always willing to help. I've talked to and played with a few in-game, which is a pretty cool experience. How many games have you played where you're playing with the developers? They're interesting people, they come up with great ideas, they listen to the community, and they're all around great.\n\nA great thing about the development team is their ability to make a great game. I'll warn you now, this is no hack and slash, run around and kill everything type of game. This game requires strategy and skill. A thief that expects to rugby tackle and shank guards into the ground will get nowhere, and a guard that wanders aimlessly near corners and dark places almost deserves to be stabbed to death. If you treat this game like a 2D top-down shooter, you'll get nowhere. I put more thought and effort into my playing than I do playing Stratego.\n\nFor an early access game, this game is pretty glitch-free. There are a few bugs here and there, but there's not a lot I've ever run into in the past year I've spent with this game.\n\nThe game is constantly expanding. When I joined, there were 2 classes for each team, and one gamemode. It was a wonderful game, but my friends and I kept brainstorming new ideas as we got bored. Now the developers are talking about custom loadouts and a map editor? Can I get a hellyeah.\n\nI love this game, and I would love to see your beautiful face in the community. This is a wonderful game, with wonderful developers, and it deserves your $15. If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me or find me in-game. I will do anything to sway people to join this growing community.\n\nI'll see you on the battlefield.\n\n-PickleFluids","July 16, 2014","true","17.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The lighting is impressive with flashlight rays glinting through bushes.  Very good looking game for an early access.  It could likely be left as is in a final product without any complaint.\n\nGameplay:  The concept is a blast and its implementation works very well.  A game is generally fast paced and discourages mission-focused individuals from camping.  Despite some lag issues on a number of servers, the game runs smoothly with people flowing in and out rooms, vents and windows.  The mouse responsiveness needs to be improved so when busting into a room as a guard, you can quickly pie slice the room with your flashlight.\n\nSound:  Something I assume will be worked on in the future (i.e. Early Access).  There is no music and what sound effects there are tend to be minimal.\n\nOverall:  I'm having a lot of fun with this so far and I'm excited to see how it develops in the future.\n","July 18, 2014","true","2.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's a stealth/strategy/top-down shooter and it's loads of fun.\n\nOf Guards and Thieves basic rules:\n- When joining a server and when any game ends and returns to the server, immediately begin spamming "start" or "go" so the Admin knows they're permitted to begin the game. You are more important than them, after all.\n- Always end every game with "gg" regardless of how you thought the game went.\n- If you are a Guard, hide in bushes whenever you can, it doesn't irritate other players at all.\n- If you are a Thief, hide behind doors with the Cobra class whenever you can, it doesn't irritate other players at all.\n- Juggernaut and Guardian classes are your best friends, they aren't OP and are the most fairly balanced classes in game.\n\nPROS:\n- Small, mostly tight-knit community. There are multiple familiar names I see in-game that gives the game a sense of community. Always fun to play with people you enjoy playing with.\n- Good strategy game with a "jump feet first into the action" mentality, if that's your playstyle.\n- Can be played either casually or with intent to scar other players for life.\n- No huge advantage to purchasing the full game. (YES, you have more classes/gamemodes but the game is entirely playable with the demo version, and the classes (aside from Juggernaut and Medic) really don't provide much of an advantage. ~70% of players don't have the full version.\n- Enough variety in gamemodes to experience a wide range of fun.\n\nCONS:\n- Small, tight knit community. Sometimes there are barely enough players to get more than one or two good full servers running.\n- Some gamemodes (Zombie Rush, Demolition especially) are near impossible without some basic teamwork. Having idiots on your team can ruin a game, but each game is 5min so not for long.\n- Some gamemodes are kind of gimmicky and not very fun for all gamers. (Soccer/Faceless come to mind)\n- Early Access, I never have had the game crash but occasionally if someone joins a server as the game is starting the server can crash. Not too often does this happen though.\n\n10/10 would hide in a bush behind a door again","March 15, 2015","true","214.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","1"

R to reload etc. It feels great and smooth and overall gameplay is amazing yes.\n\nI just have this "feel" this is going to become a "big" nice indie game, big in the sens that there are going to be players on it and will not be server abandonned for sure.

Guards and Thieves, you are divided into two teams, Guards and Thieves, obviously. There are several objects of interest on a eg big office floor, the thieves know which one they can/must steal, the guards have no clue until they either hear the alarm or catch one thief red handed.\nSurvivors vs Zombies, this reminds me of L4D and it sure as hell took a lot from it, except, it's more balanced as you can kill the survivors rather quick, if you know how. That doesn't mean the survivors are underpowered.\nYou also have Capture the Flag, Team-Deathmatch, and Football.\nThe map design is very detailed and offers many places eg plants, bushes, shadowy corners etc for the thieves to hide in as well as ventilation shafts, destroyable windows etc. Also very useful is the fact that anyone can use light-switches, the guards only equipped with torches, the thieves have state of the art nightvision and torches as well. You still have generic light sources though eg computer screens.\nEven though it appears rather simple, skill can and must be acquired in order to master the game, though it's not a ridiculous learning curve as in Chivalry, but either way, it is incredible fun.\nThe game is Early Access and being updated constantly and there are more features than I already mentioned and tons more is planned that is already visible in the menu, just not click-able.\nIf you want to check it out, I will post the following link\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf0e4EzY2pA","April 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

(yes you can shoot through windows and vents and throw stuffunder opennings)There are many different gamemodes for you to try out that requires different tactics(zombie rush, TDM, ect)\nbut it all depends on if you want to buy the game.(which I would recommend that you do)\n\n~Of Guards And Thieves 10/10 IMO","November 27, 2014","true","81.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The Thieves must steal an item and the guards must prevent that. Only thing is, the Guards don't know which item the Thieves are stealing, so you must always be careful: you might be guarding the wrong item.\n\nThe game looks really pretty, and has amazing lighting effects: the shadows are the best friends of Thieves, and hiding in them can save your life (and end the one of the unlucky Guard).\n\nThe game does lack in music, but it makes sense since you must listen carefully to lights going off and people getting killed.\n\nOther game modes include Zombie Rush and Soccer, and more modes, skins, characters and maps are being added constantly by the developers.\n\nOverall, it's a fun multiplayer game, full of stealth, action and references to other indie games.

Game modes are pretty basic, TDM, bomb defusal/placing, capture the flag(Or precious objects rather) and a zombie rush and soccer mode (Both of which are quite fun to play and fell less tacked on and more tasty side dish, Zombie rush is quite popular among players so be warned if tht's not your cup of tea) . The maps are well designed and make the most of the games lighting and tight controls, though the lack of music and any sense of danger reduces the atmosphere to nought, but the gameplay is very fun and competitive and the two novelty modes are fun in their own right. I can recommend this game because of the easy to learn controls and its' very interesting concept, what makes it even better is that the current already fairly meaty experience is only the tip of the iceberg so if you feel the game is not worth buying despite the many recommendations and our need for many new players just wait a few updates and then reconsider.","July 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm pretty skeptical of Early Access games, and I generally don't like them because they are usually unpolished, barely playable (like DayZ) and just messy.  So, after wasting money on other early access games, I was hesitant to shell out $15 for another one.  However, I was really amazed at how well the game played.  It feels like a "finished" game, rather than a placeholder until they eventually make the game you bought, which you might hate in the end.\n\nThe concept is good and it is executed well.  It's a 3D top-down shooter and light plays a huge part of it.  You play as one of two factions,  As a guard, you get guns, a flashlight and must fight off the sneaking thieves in a dark location; the Theives slink around turning off lights and climbing through vents and windows to reach their objective.  They are much weaker and use the dark to engage up close.  It's actually pretty scary as a guard as the lights off on the corridor you're in, meaning there's an enemy behind you.  It's actually fairly tough, but not overly unfair.\n\nThere's also a zombie mode which plays basically the same, except with a zombie enemy team.  That needs the most work, I think.  There's some parts of the game that really need to be refined, like the aiming and hitbox system.  If your crosshair/character isn't at just the right spot/angle, you'll miss - which, as a thief, is very bad when you have one chance to not die.\n\nAll in all, in spite of all these petty issues that need to be addressed in the future, I am very satisfied with this game.  If The company that made this skipped town with all of our money and the game never got updated beyond this, I wouldn't feel like I didn't get a full game.  If the devs stick around, there looks like a lot of promising content coming down the road.  I wait impatiently for the level editor!\n\nSo, in short, yeah - it's pretty good.  It's not for everyone, but I think you'll know if you're the kind of person who would like a multiplayer stealth shooter.","September 22, 2014","true","18.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you have friends to play it with this is a game you must buy. Playing by yourself is a little different, there aren't very many servers to choose from. One of the best parts of OGAT is the team work aspect but if you don't have anyone you know to play with, just playing online is a little difficult to communicate. Many say the thieves are underpowered, this may seem so at first, but many play the thief like the guard, and that is why they aren't doing well with the thief.

You can download the free version on their site, mac version available. Buying the game gives you extra classes/features. I'm using macbook pro.\n\nSingleplayer isn't available yet. Game is early access so there are lag issues, small playerbase and few maps, but there's usually a good game to join.  The classes are well balanced.  The stealth is there. The action is there. It's not pay to win so you'll have fun with the free version as well. I love this game and can't wait for the devs to finish.  The updates come in slow so be aware. It's a small team so give them time.  This used to a be a huge issue for me.  But seeing them reach out to the community and updating us on what they're doing really helped with the waiting process, and restored my faith in them. They've made some improvements since my last review that addressed some issues.  Updating the map editor will definitely make me a happy camper.

If you want to give this game a demo, you can play the game free however with limited privileges on kongregate. Simply type "Of Guards and Thieves" on google and you can try it out before you buy. If you are satisfied, you can purchase the game with full privileges!\noverall 10/10","July 16, 2014","true","42.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is currently in early access and honestly there aren't many problems. Let's get the negatives out the way: there seems to be some issues with networking and not being able to join other players games at times, although I personally never encountered this in the free demo. Despite it's flaws the game manages to suck you in. The default mode is basically "Payday but you can play as both sides." On one team you have the Guards who have to defend the map. The other team are the Thieves who have to steal an object which isn't revealed to the other team. There are a multitude of classes each with their own pros/cons in certain situations. The developers have added a BUNCH of different gamemodes such as Soccer, Zombie Run, Capture the Flag, Instagib and more. Each gamemode brings a new style of gameplay to the table that make the game refreshing & fun.\nI can 100% recommend OGAT if you are ok with playing the game in EA and if you have some friends you can get to tag along for the ride.","September 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The guards are tasked with keeping the thieves from stealing one of the various marked items throughout the map. Here's the catch- only the thieves know what that object is. This opens up oppportunities for strategic play, such as pretending one object is the one by continually trying (and failing) to steal it. This will bring the guard team's focus to that item, and leave the actual target less defended. As a thief you have night vision goggles, allowing you to see the guards from much farther away than they can see you. The guard team relies on flashlights and lights that can be turned on and off allowing for strategic advancement or better area control. While the thieves have less firepower than the guards one of their classes, the cobra, features a metal gear solid-esque knife pistol loadout that is a one shot kill from the knife (sacrificing range and encouraging sneakier play). Best of all, this game is free. Free? Yes, free!

The stealth is fun as thieves but the Juggernaught class has an AK47 thats not silenced which can be used to trick the guards into thinking the jug is a friendly if he shoots when they can't see him because guards have no silenced weapons.

It's not that the game is buggy or unplayable. It's the contrary, this game is fairly polished and without glaring technical issues. The problem with this game comes down to the underpopulation, which is usually a problem with multiplayer only Early Access games.\n\nOGAT is a fast paced game despite being a rather technical, strategic team game. Round timer is 5 minutes and games can be over quicker than that if the offensive team completes whatever their objective is. Each class has a set primary weapon, secondary weapon and varying numbers of equipment items. There is no way to switch out of your default class set and you have a finite amount of magazines for each of your weapons. It is important to note that I said magazines. In this game, if you reload prior to emptying your current clip, you lose all of the remaining ammo. So don't go shooting a couple of times for a kill then reload. You'll end up running out of ammo and will have to go on a literal suicide mission to get some more.\n\nThe maps are asymmetrically designed to suit the strengths of each side. Maps start out lit in favor of the Guards. Lights can be switched off or on to give each side an environmental sight advantage. There are vents that can be used only by the Thieves but Guards can still shoot into them if they see a thief run into one but vice versa also applies. The other movement limitation that applies to the Guards seems silly to me. Guards cannot pass through a broken window. I would undertand if it was a size issue, but there is a Juggernaut class for the Thieves and he's larger than the majority of Guards and has more health and weaponry too. The Juggernaut should abide by the same movement restrictions that the Guards have.\n\nThe balance of the classes will take some time to figure out because of the many factors involved. Each class has a different movement speed, different weapon set, different max health value. That's keeping it simple because you have to analyze each weapon's balance too. Each weapon has max damage, reload, rate of fire, ammo(capacity) and magazine count stats. I noticed, like other tactical shooters, your shots will spread to the left or right of your crosshair if you repeatedly fire a weapon for longer than 3-4 shots. I like that it's a factor in the game because despite being a top down shooter it adds to the tactical element and technique needed to successfully aim your shots. The equipment covers your usual tactical pieces of equipment: flares, grenades (frag, glue, incendiary, smoke), healing syringe, molotovs and stones. They are planning to add a few more, so don't worry about the lack of flashbangs, because they are planned for the future. The currently provided equipment does a good job of controlling space. Can't see around the corner because of darkness? Throw a flare over there and spot that sneaky thief. Guard watching the exit of the vent shaft you plan to pop out of in the light? Smoke grenade has you covered. Need to slow down that thief approaching an escape? Glue grenade will slow that thief down to a crawl.\n\nThere are multiple game modes besides the eponymous Guards and Thieves mode. Soccer, Zombie Rush, Team Deathmatch, Instagib Team Deathmatch, Bomb Defusal, VIP Escort, Capture the Flag, Instagib Capture the Flag, and Mad Ball. There is work currently going on for a few additional modes as well. Hosting games is easy enough and the admin tools are fair. You can choose the combination of game mode and map that you wish to host, friendly fire (on or off), team swap, auto-balance, player kick.\n\nNow the one downside of this game is its current popularity or rather a lack of it. I haven't seen more than 150-200 global players logged into this game at once, even during primetime western hemisphere gaming hours. Even when it has reached over a 100 players, usually between 50%-66% are in game. For as easy as it is to host in this game, that is inexcusable. You'll even see host in the world chat room asking for players to join up to populate their game.\n\nOverall, I'm mostly positive on this game because of all that it has to offer. If the community grows for this game it could be a hit. Otherwise, this game is not going to last for too long without the support of a good community. I'd like to see this game do well and it would be a blast to see this game streamed among friends.","October 5, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The demo is now in the steam store, there's a standalone client  here[www.ofguardsandthieves.com].\n\nMy experience with Of Guards and Thieves is much greater than the hours shown on this profile: I have spent thousands of hours on the free client (and still do).\n\nOf Guards and Thieves is a top-down third-person shooter that focuses on a balance mechanic of one team having higher firepower but limited vision in the dark(Guards), and another team having lesser firepower but night vision goggles(Thieves).\n\nThe primary game mode the game's name is based off of, "Guards and Thieves", is a mode where guards must protect one of six objects by preventing thieves from stealing said object reaching an "exit point" with the object in hand. The game type, while fun, does lack fundamental levels of balance, as every larger map increases the difficulty for Guards to successfully defend, with certain object positions completely indefensible. The primary issue with this game mode is that due to the guards not knowing which item the thieves want to steal, they have to spread their forces thin to protect the map, which thieves then exploit, swiftly leading to a win. If the thieves want to secure their win even more, they can confuse the guards by pretending to target a different item and conditioning them to focus defenses in an area opposite the real target, to add insult to injury.\n\nThe second most popular mode, Zombie Rush, is a quasi-Left 4 Dead clone, with spitting zombies, bulky zombies that throw rocks, and fast zombies that kill quickly but also die quickly. This mode is also very fun, but probably the most imbalanced mode in the game. The inherent flaw with Zombie Rush is not just the brain locations varying in difficulty to attack (wide bottlenecks with large spotlights and you can shoot the people attacking the brain from spawn, for example), but the inherent design of zombie's lack of range or speed combined with a horrendous hit detection mechanic making melee-based zombies highly dependent on your target not having above 100 ping. Even then, slight delays while attacking this mode's arguably strongest defender class, the Scout, can cause the game to audibly make the sound of the zombie striking the player multiple times and not lead to even damaging that player. This leads to a full game of zombie pros mowing down the zombie-side players with Scouts, rarely suffering any casualty that wasn't due to user AND team failure.\n\nOf Guards and Thieves' game offerings lack balance in almost every game type they offer. The only game type with a semblance of balance, Soccer, is a gimmicky game mode which shows off the extremely strange object physics of the game when lag is involved, and seems exactly like you'd expect Soccer to be in such a game. Except, the players have knives..? And the knives are your ability to kick the ball..? And the server settings can be turned on so you can kill each other with said knives.\n\nIt's a weird game, and it has a lot of issues (like the cringey seasonal decorations which make the maps worse for certain sides), but if you can get past the horrible community, strange business design, nearly dead forums, and horribly balanced gametypes, you can enjoy it for what it is: a shooting game that's really weird.","December 23, 2014","true","135.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a stealth lover I often play games like Metal Gear and Splinter Cell. So it is no surprise that I have found this game! I have a need a need… to be unheard and unseen, like a phantom in the night.\n\nThis game reminds me of the multiplayer on the Splinter Cell series. Spies versus Merks is a game where one team with heavy weaponry and little vision. With only their flashlights for site in the dark. The other team the ability to see in the dark and escape in shadow.\n\nOf Guards and Thieves filled the whole Ubisoft left when they took my beloved Spies versus Merks out into the backyard and beat it over the head with sticks and stupidity. After that incident I couldn't find the game that was as good as what Spies versus Merks was. And this is it, Of Guards and Thieves has given me what I've been looking for.\n\nNot only that but there are other game modes besides the asymmetric game mode of stealth action. A variety of games and more to come. Such as Zombie Rush, Mad Ball, Soccer (Football), and Instagib (A game type taken from the classic game Quake). Even a level editor currently not released but will be. Soon I hope!\n\nPROS:\nAn easy game to learn and play. There are not many game breaking glitches and the ones that are there are not easy to come by. Like I stated above it filled my need for stealth. You can lose yourself for hours in this game. The art style is perfect!\n\nCONS:\nPlayers on the game are rare to find when it comes to someone that knows what they're doing. Some classes on the thief side are unbalanced such as the medic, more of a personal opinion but I feel the medic on the thief side is pointless. As well as the juggernaut, a heavy weaponry class given to the thieves that is pretty powerful. I have given a suggestion to the developers in terms of balance in this class. However no response has been given. On that topic the developers are not clear whether or not your opinion and suggestions are noted. The developers haven't given a clear direction for this game. Whether or not it's going to be Free to Pay or one time pay model. As some conversations with the developers suggest they will have ULC (unlockable content, content that is built into the game and set to unlock once payment is initiated).\n\nThe direction of the final game is unclear. As said they suggest they will have ULC. If done for just skins, costumes, or other customizables. It would be a real shame to see this game go down because of stupidity in locking away game modes. From the sounds of it this will be a one time payment and you will have the game. Whether or not it will be the full game is up to the developers.\n\nDespite this I do suggest this game as it is fun to play and it is often overlooked and underrated. The gameplay primarily reminds me of Spies versus Merks but at the same time becomes its own game. For this I have hope in this indie title, hope that the developers don't do anything stupid, hope more players find this game, and hope for a new breed of stealth lovers.","August 8, 2014","true","154.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phrimer/recommended/302590/","phrimer","A. Bellari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phrimer/","125 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOf Guards and Thieves if a great game to get into for those occasional ALL NIGHTERS as well as a means of a quick fix between shifts! The developers have done a great job in maintaining the servers with the recent influx of players. More so, after making onto Steam. Grats, by the way!!!\n\nCurrently, there are a number of modes available, Team Deathmatch being my most favorite, but we'll take the time to go over each one.\n\nGuards and Thieves (GaT)\n\nGuards and Thieves is a great mode, more so when working with a team that has experience with each other. You have the Guards! and you have the Thieves! The Thieves are tasked with acquiring a specific item from within the playable map area and returning it to another location for extraction, in turn, ending the round. The Guards must pull security on a number of possible objective items within the map, overtime, narrowing there focus to a specific item. Most easily determined by watching the thieves and speculating what, in fact, they were going for. The round concludes when the Thieves escape with the objective item or when the duration of the game has elapsed, and the Guards have proven successful at defending.\n\nBomb Defusal (DE)\n\nIn Bomb Defusal, a random player from the Thieves team is given the "bomb". The objective here is to get that player AND the bomb to one of two predetermined locations for arming. Once you have come upon these locations, your team must provide you with ample time to plant the bomb. Once the bomb has been armed and planted, the Guards may still disarm the bomb, concluding the round\n\nOn another note, if the thief carrying the bomb is killed BEFORE arming it, the Guards would likely form a perimeter around it and ensure that no thieves can reobtain it. Mount an assault quickly, as the thieves are capable of reacquiring the bomb and carrying on with the mission.\n\nV.I.P. Escort (VIP)\n\nThis game-mode is tricky! Again, you have the Guards and you have the Thieves. A player from the Guards is randomly chosen to become the V.I.P. Their team must careful escort the V.I.P. to the extraction point located at predetermined locations in the playable map area. The duration of this game can range anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. So plan your assault quickly and maneuver about the map carefully.\n\nTeam Deathmatch (TDM)\n\nBy far, my favorite game-mode! Team Deathmatch is a classic fight to the finish. The first team, whether it be Guards or Thieves to reach 20 kills, as a team, takes the cake in this one! Simple, but fun! Are you afraid of the dark?\n\nInstagib (IG)\n\nWhile still having access to the normal assortment of playable maps, the Instagib mode gives you additional choices for the chaos sure to come! With the current selection of maps, I'd recommend anywhere from 4 to 8 players in this one! You are armed with a one-shotting blaster of death! Duck and dive behind obstacles seeking cover or conceal yourselves in the bushes waiting to pick off would-be attackers!\n\nCapture the Flag (CTF)\n\nGuards are blue and Thieves are red! The objective here being to seek out the opposing teams flag, situated within a field colored with that of the other team and to quickly return it to your teams collection point. This one, being colored with that of YOUR team. Careful though! There are likely to be members of the opposition on offense as well as defense! Watch those bushes!\n\nCapture the Flag (Instagib) (igCTF)\n\nA nightmare in itself, this game-mode combines the rules and objectives of Capture the Flag with the one-shotting blasters you are armed with in Instagib. Nothing too different here! Get the flag and take it home!\n\nZombie Rush (ZR)\n\nOne of the more amusing modes of the game is Zombie Rush! With a bit of a turn on the norm, you have the Guards and you have the Zombies! Currently you have a hard hitter, a tank, a smoker for concealment of movement and an acid spitter that applies a field where ANYONE who enters takes smaller bits of damage over time.\n\nThis mode is similar to Capture the Flag in that there is a single objective for the Zombies... EAT BRAINS!!! There is a jar of brains situated somewhere within the playable map area. The Guards are tasked with protecting this jar for the duration of the game. What's that in the bushes!?!?!?\n\nSoccer (SOC)\n\nOne of my least entertaining modes, but great given the right circumstances, is Soccer. In Soccer, there are two teams with two goals. Fairly simple, except.. EVERYONE IS CARRYING RAZOR SHARP KNIVES! Don't be alarmed! They're just used to kick around the ball. GAME ON!\n\nMad Ball (MB)\n\nI can think of only a handful of my friends who like this game. Not because it's bad, but because it's chaotic! Everyone is given a certain number of soccer balls rigged with explosives that arm themselves after being deployed. Bounce them through windows, around corners, cracks in the doors. You can even setup your allies for failure if that's your thing!\n\nFeel free to join me in-game or come check us out on Twitch[www.twitch.tv]! I have a feeling we'll be streaming this game for a while!!!

The game is still on early access, but don’t judge just yet, THE GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST TO PLAY!\n\n\nThe game overall is a handful of creativity and originality, the graphics are pretty solid, the gameplay and the controls is really easy to learn and master and the physics are just hilarious in an awesome way.\nCurrently there are a lot of game modes you can choose from, since Gat [Guards and Thieves] where you choose which team you want to play and depending on that you will have to steal a specific item or catch and kill the thieves and there is ZR [Zombie Rush] where you can be a zombie and eat brains or to be more exact THE BRAIN (you’ll get it if you play)!\nNow it’s your turn to ask: That’s lots of game modes? No, its not, but it’s the only two modes you can play in the free version. Yes, there is a premium version and yes it is worth getting it! What’s the difference? Well, you’ll have game modes such as:\n\n- Capture the Flag\n\n- V.I.P. Escort\n\n- Team DeathMatch\n\n- Bomb Defusal\n\n- Mad Ball\n\n- Soccer\n\n- Instagib [you play with a railgun that has infinite range and is one shot, one kill]\n\nJust that? You may ask. Absolutely NOT! You also get more classes to play, each have a particular set of equipment including main weapon, secondary weapon, and gadgets.\n\nClasses including:\n\n- Assault\n\n- Scout\n\n- Medic [Premium]\n\n- Guardian [Premium]\n\n- Carrier [Premium]\n\n- Shadow\n\n- Cobra\n\n- Juggernaut [Premium]\n\n- Saboteur [Premium]\n\n- VIP [only in VIP Escort]\n\n- Sage [only in Instagib Modes]\n\n\nBut wait! There is more. You also can leveling up that can lead you to be recognized as a good player while being in a server and be disputed by the people that may want to be in your team. Also one of the best things of OGAT is that developers really listen to the feedback of the players. They are currently working on new classes, skins for the classes, special weapons, new maps, new modes and new features, some recommended by people who support the game. Only downside of the game is that currently is kind of hard to enter in a server, before the last update it wasn’t, and probably now I made you think ‘Aw then maybe the game is not worth it’, WRONG! Creating a server is the easiest thing you can do on this game and also the developers are working on dedicated servers open 24/7!\n\nIt is really a game that’s worth your attention and support.\n\n\n~ 9.5/10\n\n\nP.s: You can also stab players in Soccer mode which contributes to major laughing moments when the other team are short in member because they are dead.\n","October 3, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Well theives steal and guards guard! go figure, you have different classes of Thieves and Guards with different weapons and items, there are also several items to steal but only the thieves know which one they have to get, how ever as a  thief you have to be careful if you just go after one item, the guards will get suspicious and work out that item is your target so you need to vary it up and stratagise to lure the guards out of the way so you can nab them item and get to one of the 3 escape area's, you both guards and thieves have flashlights only thieves only sue theirs to lure guards and guards only turn theirs off to hide from thieves, in a straight up gun fight Guards so becareful. Not sure how long I played this game today atm but I had a damn good time doing it once I worked out what I was doing, which only took a couple of games, remeber right mouse turns off your torch and mouse wheel switches between weapons and items such as Molotov Cocktail or Smoke Grenade for the Thieves and Frag Grenades as the Guards, I can definately see me playing alot of this game as the days go on.","August 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So the guards (cops) can't see their nemesis in the dark, but they can switch on the lights in any room to make them instantly visible again.\n\nTo balance a little more the cops have stronger weapons than the robbers; so they kill easier than being killed.\n\nThe game on itself is great fun, really (look at how positive it is reviewed by so many people); but i'm missing an important item in the game;  I can't sit back and relax with this game. It's obligated to be sitting bent over your keyboard and mouse.\nTo sit back and relax while playing this game one thing is missing; support for controllers/gamepads (not joysticks). If the game would finally support game controllers (x360). With a controller i could sit relaxed in my computer-chair, or i could set the pc to output to my TV (over hdmi) and lay myself down on the sofa whilst playing this game. That would be so much better than getting than getting RSI-pains because of the constant mouse+keyb usage.\n\nConclusion; it's a very good game BUT it 100% misses controller support. So Devs, please add those lines from the Xinput API so we can finally use our controllers with this game. That is really my one and only remark about this game. When controllersupport is added; this game would receive 95% from me (sorry, but perfect games don't exist in my world)","January 30","true","3.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If one thief gets an object its nearly impossible to get the "right" thief who really got the object(s).\n\nIn my opinion they should add maybe something like a "trace" (like footprint as sample) if a thief got an object (like in TF2, the CTF maps). This would be much easier at least for the guards to have "some view" of the situation which thieves got things. I mean honestly, the thieves has a full view over the map all the time and the guards are mostly running around the map like idiots or camping all objects, the thieves spawn or exits.\n\nIts just an idea, still its not "that" bad but it need a bit balancing still.","April 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't know what negative could possibly be said, I played the free version of this game for quite some time.  The developers truly care about the opinions of the players, gameplay is fun at all time, suspenceful, and challenging.  If you're considering this game I can't give you more clear of a "green light", if it's on sale it shouldn't be a question at all.\n\nThis game will bring you the best feelings of covert, stealth, strategy and fast-paced combat.  There is virtually no learning curve with a very high skill cap.  This is one of those games where you might find yourself 32-0 one round parading around the map claiming you're jesus.\n\nTL;DR BUY THIS GAME.","June 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What can i say ? His loss. Bet i could've kicked his racist ♥♥♥ easily. :D\n\nWell, my review is still positive, because i love this game. The gameplay is great (even though the matches are a bit unbalanced most of the time. That's the admin's fault mostly though.) and the devs are really awesome. They really are trying to improve the game.\n\nI know there's also a f2p demo version of the game, but please, support the devs and buy this version. Premium classes and being able to host all the game modes (you can only host gat and zr if you're a f2p user.) makes the purchase a worthy one for sure.\n\nEDIT :\n\nWell, the devs are great and all, but they really screwed the netcode up. Your ping doesn't matter at all, every server's lagging. It's pretty much unplayable now. I hope they fix that soon.\n\nEDIT 2 :\n\nHeh, they sure are taking their sweet ♥♥♥ time. They didn't fix the netcode. In fact, it's even worse now. Dedicated servers are unplayable for everyone. If you're from EU, US servers are ♥♥♥♥ and if you're from US, EU servers are crap. This basically means that %75 of the servers are unplayable no matter where you're from.\n\nAh, and the community is even more toxic now. Yeah, i know they were never  "that" nice, but now they're pretty much cancer. Most of the new players don't even know how to play the damn game.\n\nWelp, this is a multiplayer only game with crappy netcode and a toxic community.  I only recommend this, because the core gameplay is still good and i really don't want to write a "not recommended" review for this game. Damn, i love OGAT, i really do. It's so much fun ! Well, if it works like it should, of course, which it does not, for the time being.\n\nEDIT 3 :\n\nYeah, because mass disliking my review will fix everything that's broken about the game.

Outsmarting the enemy and shooting your way through to the goal are equally valid strategies.\n\nPoints of interestOnly multiplayer at the time of writing this review\nFocused on team work\nChallanging stealth elements\nTons of fun to be had with friends\nGreat gamemodes: Thieves try and steal artifacts while guards are out on the prowl, you can even play soccer :D\nSummaryGraphics: 7. Nothing special here, but the game makes use of light and shadows in a very special way\n\nMusic: There really isn't any music at the moment, which is fine; the whole purpose is to be immersed in your enviroment\n\nCinematics: None, or not necessary. This a stealth shooter, not a movie... but this might make a good movie..?\n\nStory: meh 7. Guards and Thieves trying to make a living by doing their job\n\nContent: 8. Hours of fun for fans of shooter/and or stealth games\n\nControls: 7. Pretty basic here, WASD to move, e to interact, left click to shoot, right click for flashlight, scroll to select guns\n\nGameplay:8. Focusing on stealth and tactics rather than head-on assault, this can be challanging at first, but becomes easier as you play\n\nMy opinion: This game is a perfect bland of shooter, stealth, and top-down gameplay that is worthy of your time. Great game even in early access.\nScore: 7/10\n\nFollow  Vantom Giveaway's curator page here for more recommendations of great indie games.","November 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Manipulating lights, listening carefully, watching your angles, controlling your shots - this game does have some real nice tactics at its core. Though, instead of focussing on the great core of the game (guards and thieves) the dev decided to add soccer/football, zombies, kart racing, crafting and an "open world" style of play - all of which I feel could have been left out in favor of more time spent polishing and promoting the core game.\n\nBeacuse of this shift in focus I cannot recommend this game right now.\n\nTLDR; Devs turned their good stealth combat game into Wii Sports","January 18","false","9.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

You have few cool classes:\n\nGuards= the scout (run fast and throws flares and glue grenades to slow thieves), assault (the guys with a the best rifle, throws frag grenades), riot (the though dude with a riot shield, a gun and throws smoke grenades), carrier (the versatile one who throws incendiary grenades to defend), medic (he heals from distance with a TF2 seringe gun, attack with a pistol and his melee weapon heals too).\n\nThieves= the shadow (uses a crossbow to take down guards from afar, throws smoke grenades to lure), the cobra (like solid snake, he uses a knife, a pistol and throws rocks to make noise), saboteur (same as the guards carrier but weaker), medic (same as the guards but....), juggernaut (the thought guy with a rifle, a gun and frag grenades).\n\nYou see the game from above so you can anticipate enemy's movements and set strategies. Plus you can see nice lighting effects.\nMany guys are ranting because they want first person view...\nBut it's out of the subject of the game.\n\nMaps are nice but some are difficults to master, like the cemetery or the millitary camp.\nUsually you will play on the offices or the mansion...\n\nSome modes to play (you got some others but there is a full list on the wiki):\nThe Guards and Thieves or Gat (thieves must steal a specific item and reach the exit, there are some other items so they can lure the guards...)\n\nZombie rush (zombies must eat a brain the guards are protecting. Zombies are weak but fast and deadly in close combat. They have 5 classes, from the zombie runner to the bloiter, everything you saw on other zombie games is here except the one with a retractable tongue).\n\nVip (a player is the target of the thieves/assassins, and must reach the exit without dying)\n\nBomb defusal (few locations are marked and the thieves must plant a bomb and let it explode, guards must stop them)\n\nCapture the flag (everything as been said).\n\nTeam deathmatch (same !)\n\nSoccer (well the most annoying one, you hit the ball to throw it... in the goal).\n\n\nBut again the problem is, like a guy said on an other game, balance.\n\nThis game is too much unbalanced. Some games modes are incredibly unfair, like zombie rush.\nSo you will see all the time players taking the same classes and will rush mindlessly.\nVery few of them are working together. Only thieves are forced to work as a team because they are very weak.\nActualy teams are composed of the assault class vs cobras.\n\n\nAnd like other indie multiplayer games, the community is sometimes bad.\nPlayers are not the only problem. In fact it's servers admins.\n\nGames are hosted by players. So quite oftent you have conection problems. But this is not the most enerving...\nAdmins are often completely not responsible.\n\nThey can do what they want and it's usually for the worst.\nMany players thinks the game is unbalanced so they punish if someone take a specific class.\n\nAnd the most annoying, they do not "clean" their hosting.\nFew times i was insulted by players and the admin just do nothing about that.\n\n\nSo i don't recommand this game until they bring dedicated servers and do more stable hosting because actually you lag and are often disconected.\n\nIf you buy this game, please..\n\nBe fair play !","September 22, 2014","false","25.5"," 15 of 42 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","15","42","3","0"

Bear in mind this is still Early Access!\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Incredibly addictive if you like this type of game.\n2) Quite relaxing to play (oddly enough)\n3) Simple to play - You're either a guard or thief. Guards defend items, thieves steal them and return to the exit point.\n4) Great multiplayer, and more features are going to be added later, like single player etc\n\nCONS:\n\n1) No option for voice comms/mics, although there is a TS server.\n2) The highest screen resolution you can get is 1280 x 960 (so far)\n3) Still a bit buggy. For example, after a recent update, the controls reset themselves to different bindings. Easy to fix though.\n4) As it stands, it's still a tad rough round the edges.\n\nAll in all, it's worth a look.

This is a multiplayer stealth game, the guards use flashlights and heavy weaponry to root out the thieves while protecting precious objects and the thieves use darkness and cunning to evade the guards and steal their objective. I'm talking from the "GaT" gamemode which is the best mode in the game hands down, it's what the game was made for. In GaT the thieves are instructed to steal one of six items, the guards are tasked with defending all six items because they don't know which one the thieves are stealing. The thieves can steal any items they want to try and throw the guards off and defend the wrong item which makes it a challenge to play as the guards.\n\nThis game has some wonderful lighting and it uses light in a unique way, hiding in the shadows has never felt so good and rooting out a squad of thieves trying to sneak past patrols is equally satisfying. The graphics are nice as well, but it seems all the effort went into getting the dynamic shadows working and the lighting engine.\n\nThe point is that the thieves are weak in comparison to the guards they need to lay low and take their time and communicate with their team if they are to win, if you go in all guns blazing you won't get anywhere and you will bring down the team because you will keep dying. The thieves need to stick to the shadows, stay away from light and use cover to their advantage. Being on the thieves team is the best part of the game.\n\nThere are some bad things about this game: Firstly, it can be quite empty, but the community is quite small and you will see familiar players and make friends with them. Secondly when the dev brought modes like TDM and zombies everyone jumped in to play them even though these modes completely defeat the point of the game, I'll tell you how an average TDM goes: the weaker team gets trapped in their spawn and they are picked off until the time limit is reached and that's team deathmatch. Zombies is similar to GaT but the zombies are boring and unoriginal making GaT and bomb disposal the only modes worth playing.\n\nThe latest update added Sandbox TDM and it is quite fun if you can gather enough players. The premise is that it is a 1x1 km city that is empty and there are supplies scattered around the map, the goal is to attack the other team using stealth and your team to your advantage. The best part of this mode is joining with 3 others and roaming the map hunting the enemy team until you eventually fall to someone with better equipment.\n\nThe game is in early access, but the demo connects to all the servers meaning you can play with anyone even if they have the full version. The full version adds a couple of extra classes and the game free when it fully releases, but you don't really need it and the price is a bit high for this game, I bought it in a sale and I'm glad that I didn't pay £11 for it.\n\nBut I recommend this to anyone who wants a more interesting multiplayer experience rather than a generic first person shooter.\n\nIn context to it being early access, I do have to say that it will probably get better, but if I had to give it a rating it would be a rating of: Ferrerro Rochet/10 i.e. what's here is amazing, but it doesn't last long and it soon becomes an empty box.\n\nOh and another word about the multiplayer - this game is a total joy to play with friends so bear that in mind.","July 29, 2015","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For starters, when the game started on Game Jolt, all the servers were US.  Now that it is on Steam, you are lucky to find one US server at any time of the day.  There is no US dedicated server and if there is it is either always full or under maintenance or something cause I never see it anywhere.  The cool Sandbox mode they added is only available on a DU Dedicated Server.  Can we please run our own servers and also have Sandbox Mode?  That is the reason for the lag in Sandbox, it is not localized for everyone.  It's like the Dutch and Russian servers get to beta test all these awesome features and we are left with nothing for months.  Also, the amount of game modes are large, but they are for the most part the same thing.  the death matches for one are far too balanced in favor of the Thieves because of night vision.  Something that would be cool is a First Person mode.  It would certainly let people have an interesting experience, a first person multiplayer stealth game that doesn't have Tom Clancy before the title.  There could also be a mode where the thieves have no weapons to fight back so they have to rely on stealth, because honestly, bringing in AK's and sub machine guns isn't exactly thief behavior.  That's more mercenary or terrorist behavior, which would fit since one of the modes is ripped directly from Counter Strike.  I can't complain since it loves to have fun with pop culture like stealing the Half Life 3 Source Code or the Super Meatboy Poster.  There is also Faceless which doesn't take much imagination to realize it is Slender in top down, but that game mode isn't really functional since no one can find any of the pages, and even if they can they can only find one out of 8, allowing Faceless to kill the survivors hundreds of times over before that.  All in all, give it a try.  But Subvert, could we possibly see a couple new and unique game modes?  I have a couple which could be rather interesting and from the people I have tested it on that would cooperate, it proved rather fun for them as well.  If you do read this, hit me up and I can let you know what I have planned.  And if not, I'll just stick to running it privately on my own server.","August 11, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start off with the things that I like about it:\n\n-Graphics: It's very original, colorful and it has a "cartoon" style to it!\n\n-Gameplay: OGAT is fun to play because it has a lot of gamemodes, arenas and classes that you can use!\n\nNow it's time for the bad things about it:\n\n-Community: It has a very, very, very restricted community that can barely reach 90 players online per day!\n\n-Servers: Dedicated and normal servers have an average of 100 ping. If you have a good connection, you can luckily get 50 ping. Sometimes that bad ping makes the matches almost unplayable!\n\nEven with those negative things said, I reccommend this game, but only if you have some friends to play with.","August 1, 2015","true","101.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
