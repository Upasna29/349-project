"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alvarakk/recommended/263500/","Alvarakk","ALVÅRAKK >Immortal<","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alvarakk/","10 products in account","REVIEW OF RECENT GAME CHANGES by ALVARAKK, 16/01/2014 (updated 09/09/2014)\n\nMY BACKGROUND\nI started playing DnT with first released on Facebook about one year ago and I have been playing regularly since. I was admitted to play-testing group and granted access to the developer's test-server. I am a pro-player, with some 5,000+ ranked PvP matches and reached top 3 ranking position consecutively in the last three PvP seasons and last stats show me at highest KDR (Kill-to-Death Ratio) in the game. I am currently ranked #9 in PvP season 4.\n\nTrust me when I tell you, Dragons and Titans is NOT WORTH your time or money. .\n\n* The game patch of 01/04/2014 introduced lock-on auto-aim which drastically changed the movement controls in the game, made several dragon combos obsolete, and completely removed the need for players to learn and master their maneuvering and aiming skills. In the recent months Wyrmbyte carried on to dumb-down the game in hopes of attracting more players -- ultimately failing in that too as player numbers in Multiplayer PvP at peak times of the day stand at around 400 now (compare that to DOTA2 or LOL where you have tens of thousands). They reduced the competitive aspect of PvP into a witless and uninspired routine of holding down the fire button and moving your mouse back and forth to control the firing range. Teamplay and coordination have been rendered obsolete in lieu of a contest where players compete only on who can dish out more damage fastest. The advantages of precise timing and tactical thinking have been stripped out of competitive PvP and matches have descended into routine of blindly rushing the opponents in the hopes of out-damaging them. Outcomes are primarily decided on what combos individual players picked up, which is random and unpredictable.\n\n* The update of 10/06/2014 continued the steady decline changing the mechanics of the matching-system.\n-Teams are now truly and completely random and unpredictable. The most shocking change is that the pre-match setup stage was removed, which is where you used to be able to get a minute's worth of chat with the 4 teammates the game picked up for you and discuss combos and tactics. Now, you are plunged directly into match with no opportunity to plan and prepare.\n-To make things worse, players can not choose or predict what map is going to be played (there are 3, each a completely different mode of play), so they don't get can't pick a suitable combo and enter matches blind and ill-prepared.\n- The other drastic change was that the restrictions on selection of dragon and weapons was removed. In the past players could only pick a weapon and dragon that was not already in use by one of their teammates and generally whoever was first to click it, got it and mostly refused to relinquish it. Whilst this caused a lot of heated pre-match bickering and some truly foul behavior between teammates, it also forced players to think about what combos best supported and complemented that of the rest of their team. This is no longer the case and players have foregon support roles and invariably stick with the cookie-cutter combos that give them the biggest DPS advantage. This change has also taken away from the formerly enjoyable variety offered by DnT 's myriad of choices, and along with it the need for new players to familiarize themselves with all weapons/dragons and take time to learn their strengths and weaknesses. To illustrate the point, most matches now include a bland carbon-copy selection of combos, with most players equipping Winter Floe and Skyburst and riding either an Imperial or Gemtalon.\n- In the same stroke, Wyrmbyte hammered-in the last nail to DnT's coffin by preventing players from teaming-up with more than one player. Thus, they dashed all hopes of players being able to form into clans or guilds and fighting it out in Full 5v5s. We are now left to suffer matches that are little more than a frustrating lottery and where skill and experience have scant impact on the outcome.\n\nOTHER ISSUES\nDisappointingly, Wyrmbyte continues to ignore feedback from their play-testers and experienced players alike, resulting in a completely unbalanced PvP and proving to the gaming industry that their diminutive team is just too amateurish and does not have what it takes to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience. Also characteristic of Wyrmbyte is their complete inability to improve and fix their game code, where the blight of bugs seems completely out of control. Major bugs that have been in existence at the early stages of the beta testing, persist still with no indication from Wyrmbyte as to whether they have any plans to sort them out. The introductions of STEAM client failed to stem the constant flow of speed-hacking cheaters that continue to abuse the game and take all fun out of it for genuine players. On top of that, new game issues and exploits are cropping up at an alarming rate and each new game update from Wyrmbyte is a guaranteed source of new and persistent problems.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSomewhere along the way Dragons and Titans drifted off-course and lost all sight of becoming a balanced and challenging 5v5 arena and is now being precariously carried-away into the chaotic waters of a mediocre free-for-all. The spectacular dragon themes and above-standard quality of art alone fail to sustain player interest and unsurprisingly their numbers are dwindling daily. This game had promising potential in its early life, which was however ultimately squandered by Wyrmbyte who failed time and again to improve and polish their product.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nThis game will disappoint and frustrate you. Stay away from it.\nThere are better free MOBAs out there.\n\nUPDATE\nAs of 09/09/2014 there is still no option to choose map or predict which one will be played. No pre-match team screen to discuss tactics. Speed-hackers continue to dominate the game and the cheaters are completely out of control. Whoever in Wyrmbyte is making decisions on game development should hang their head in shame and just leave the gaming industry forever. So much fail.","June 16, 2014","false","136.2"," 627 of 714 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","627","714","8","19"

This is again, very poor design for a MOBA and even a basic MOBA needs this.\n- Developers reasoning for bad design choices is that there isn't enough players to allow for people selecting there maps, this is very counter inuitive, because I'm sure more people would play if you could select your dragon as a team and chose the map. Which brings me to my next point.\n- Small player base that isn't growing.\n- global chatroom has people of all languges speaking in it, it should be seperated by language as you cannot communicate properly\n- the community that there is have been quite immature at times and quite toxic, there is only a few exceptions.\n- lack of depth in gameplay\n\n\nI do not recomend this game, but since it's free, you should try to see if you have fun with it, It still can be very fun at times but I would suggest if you wanted to play a dragon in a MOBA, you should go and play Jakiro on dota 2.

It's a real shame a game with such huge potential is sinking into obscurity.\n\nTo all People that are playing Dragons and Titans or consider to play it:\nPlease don't waste a single ♥♥♥♥ing Cent on this, this is the last opportunity to change the developers thinking and to maybe sort out the mess again.","June 13, 2014","false","460.6"," 102 of 111 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","102","111","0","0"

It just lacks structure in the shop aspects of the game, the prices change frequently and sometimes get removed entirely.\n\nWhen the time comes to buy a new dragon and or weapon, you don't buy the individual one you need for a certain job, you get what the random eggs/chests give you and that's it. This completely ruins the strategic aspect of the game entirely. Making it very hard to create a decent build or get the "most efficient" combination of weapon and dragon. Earning the in-game currency 'crystal' takes ages, especially when you consider the chances of receiving an exceptionaly less useful weapon/dragon.\nPairing with your already non-combinable combinations of weapon/dragons you may already own.\n\nI give this a 3/5 rating based on the fact that you can't buy what you want with your hard earned crystals that take time to farm.","August 15, 2014","false","275.7"," 121 of 142 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","121","142","2","0"

The more you play and the longer you play the more perks for your dragon and you. That part is good.\n\nThere is a single player, co-op and pvp. There are only 3 maps so single player gets dull quick. Co-op allows you to play with other players on your team but the AI is relatively weak so they get steam rolled pretty quick. The only real joy would appear to be pvp. The matching system in pvp however makes it so as a new player you might be playing against very high level dragons. You will be killed easily and quickly by them, often. As such, while you may occasionally have a good game in pvp. Largely you will be used by high levels to bolster their kill ratios.\n\nThere also appears to be a fair amount of hacking going on that seems to be unchecked. All in all, it appears like a very fun game but as a new player don't expect easy or enjoyable, you will be a wonderful target.","April 30, 2015","false","150.8"," 114 of 147 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","114","147","8","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lhumierre/recommended/263500/","Lhumierre","Lhumierre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lhumierre/","448 products in account","Don't get baited.\n\nThis game has the worst tutorial ever created. The controls are clunky and you have to jump through hoops to play 5v5 pvp.\n\nIt is terribly unpolished and not worth the time. Dragons don't move by the standard right click to location they follow the mouse cursor, you press spacebar to fly backwards like a hummingbird and each dragon gets 2 skills only. You bring a weapon from the cash shop into battle that gives you 2 other abilities.\n\nThere are tons of dragons to choose from but the game doesn't feel like it has a core element. There are dragons that clearly outrank others in terms of innate abilities. The games in game graphics are worse than they are in screenshots. The screenshots for this game seem to have been touched up to give it a better presentation.\n\nComparing this to other MOBA/ARTS games out there, I rather play any other one than this.\n\nEdit: I have played a couple of multiplayer games as you can see to my play time; it’s really a cluster♥♥♥♥ of things going on. The Map isn't that intuitive given the movement limitations and controls.\n\nI've used a golem type dragon that fires boulders that ricochet when they hit an enemy or wall. Together with a Purple rod that allowed me to set mines and automatically teleport me to the nearest gold roost.\n\nDuring many exchanges I noticed players talk in the lobby about the weapon they purchased from the shop given them a distinct advantage.\n\nThe main problem with control is the fact that all of your abilities directly are targeted at wherever your mouse cursor is. What causes the rift is that your dragon also follows the cursor religiously for movement. So when fighting you have to constantly be flying backward or standing still to get the 8 way directional aiming to do what you want.\n\nStanding still in a fight is never the answer, Flying backward slows down your movement considerably to almost about half. If the controls where polished a bit more and maybe rework the 5v5 map to better compliment the fact we are using dragons more it could have been a good niche market.\n\nThere are tons of dragons to pick from and weapons to accompany them, variety is good. With the already oversaturation of the ARTS/MOBA market I can't recommend this game over anything else in its current state.","March 12, 2014","false","11.4"," 352 of 511 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","352","511","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/recommended/263500/","seraphyx-","Seraphyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/","210 products in account","The game seems okay but a lot mechanics don't really work for me.\n\nFirst of all there will be INSANE amounts of grind, absolutely insane. Each stage seems to have 10 levels, each level has 5 objectives to complete, three of the five objectives require specific dragons and items to be completed so you will more than likely have to buy them with real money if you want to complete the objectives.\n\nThe reason you might want to complete the objectives is because they will give you rewards (like a new dragon if you complete all 5 objectives in all 10 levels, so 150 total "levels" * an average of 7 minutes per level = 1050 minutes/17.5 hours total assuming you finish them all in your first try, which you wont). Again, this is a huge grind if you want to do the single player missions to try and get new dragons or items or whatever else they may give you.\n\nGame difficulty seems to ramp up very quickly as well. I'm barely on act 1-5 (undead crypt?) and it's pretty much impossible to complete with all the dragons they throw at you. I opened one door and 5-6 very powerful dragons spawned. I used all 3 revives and still wasn't able to kill them.\n\nI haven't kept track of how much money you get per completed mission but it's very very little. Half way done with "act 1" and I only have about 400 gold or whatever the currency is. To purchase a dragon pack (3 random dragons) you need 5000, to purchase weapon pack (3 random weapons) you need 2500 I believe. Steam says I've played 2.2 hours, remove about 15-20 minutes to account for the tutorial and you can see how slowly you earn money.\n\nThe microtransactions SEEM pretty reasonable compared to other games but I haven't spent too much time looking at and comparing everything. Some dragons are 3-5 dollars which isn't bad.\n\nThe mechanics that don't work or that I'm simply not a fan of is the movement and combat. Most of the time it's just a huge mess of enemies clustered together flying around each other trying to hit you. My only recommendation would be a complete overhaul of the controls where you use WASD (or whatever keys you bind) to move and have the dragon shoot where your mouse cursor points (restricted to 140-180 degrees of the direction you're facing, otherwise it would just be silly). Whether the developers are interested in putting all this work to change it, I don't know.\n\nOptions are terrible. I wanted to lower the volume and you can only toggle both the sounds and music on or off. You can change your resolution and that's about it. It feels like a really terrible mobile port or browser based game. The game has potential with the idea but it's not really worth investing any time or money into at this point. It is free though so by all means try it, but if you have bandwidth limits or something then I wouldn't recommend it (although it's only 300ish mb which is nice).\n\nIf the grind is lessened and the controls are done better I think it would definitely be worth investing some time into. I have not played the PvP yet so any sort of balance or matchmaking issues are obviously not covered in this.","March 12, 2014","false","7.3"," 165 of 249 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","165","249","0","7"

This game IS good for someone who is new to MOBAs.  Playing around on it can be fun, and you can have a good time just pounding on the computers if you want.  I like the way that you can mix the activatable abilities of your dragon by swapping in different weapons.  It's a feature I haven't seen in the other MOBAs I have played.  The weapons usually don't provide abilities that are broken with any specific dragons, so the balancing on it isn't too bad.\n\nHowever, if you are familiar with MOBAs, you'll only really play this one when you don't have access to your favorites.  The monetization of this game leaves a lot to be desired.  I get that they are trying to make money off of their product, but they didn't have to make it into some sort of CCG for dragons and weapons.  It's nice that they provide a daily login bonus, and that every 5 days you get another free (random) dragon, but the amount of gems that it takes to get the booster pack of dragons or weapons is pretty high, and you don't even have the option of picking out a specific one of either.  They love to point out how many gems you would have earned after each match if you had just been willing to spend the money on a Titan Pass, too, which I find to be very annoying.\n\nAll in all, this game shows a lot of potential, but it's just not living up to it for those of us who are already familiar with MOBAs.","February 5, 2015","false","35.4"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","41","51","2","0"

Dragons and Titans doesn't feel overwhelming and its has just the right amount of pacing to get into it and have fun. There are no microtransactions for any player to feel frustrated and most of the items such as the runes, rune slots, the weapon packs, and dragon packs, can be purchased through in-game currency. However, the exeptions are that you can't purchase the dragon skins, the avatar riders, also the dragons and weapons individually. You can upgrade your weapons and the dragons you have so you can become stronger, faster and better. Players get to try five weapons and dragons each week as well. There are other ways to get free dragons but purchasing the Titans Pass can save you the hassle by getting all the weapons, all the dragons, the skins, the riders and all of the acts. When you do, the in-game currency gets an extra boost the more you play. Not to mention you recieve the latest weapon or dragon now and then. The Titans Pass only lasts for a year, but don't worry you still get to keep everything else except the currency boost. The only thing I can complain about are the Acts. If you do it for the story and free dragon they're okay but it does get tedious the more you play. I wish the makers of Dragons and Titans would be a little more creative on the gameplay for the acts. But everything else is very much worth it.","October 27, 2014","true","487.1"," 63 of 91 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","63","91","4","2"

Eveyone does the something every game. It's a facebook app so it's more so made for the causual player. The concept of the dragons is the only thing that keeps my interest. A fade for right now. All the so call experts players do is play with their friends or so-call clans, which is basically the best stretagy in this game for winning. TEAM WORK. The rating system is a joke, just based on W/L. Rather than individual achievements. The losing team players may have better stats than the winning team, yet gets no rewards for KDR, structures destroyed, gold collected, minions killed or asssist , Just the L. Meanwhile, the winning team feeder who goes 0-8 and contributed nothing to the W get points, stupid. It's annoying to listen to the so-called expert players and moderators talk about how much strategy it take to win, really when either team can have the same dragons and weapon its no STRATEGY involved other than the team who has BETTER TEAMWORK WINS. Their's no in game gear to buy to adjust your STRATEGY, their's not picking of dragons or weapons to counter the other team STRATEGY. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST. Hell, you can't even see the other team pick until the game actually start, maybe thats a developer STRATEGY. A poster metioned this game is better than DOTA2, this game is childs play compared to DOTA2, clueless comment. Lets take DOTA2 for example, every charatcter has it's strenght and weakness, you can't play 2 of the same hero on different team .BTW it is the dumdness thing in any MOBA game to have the same charatcter on different teams. You have different roles for each player in DOTA2, support/carry/mid/hard lane/jugler etc. You have real STRATEGY involved, last hitting creeps, pulling creep wave, dening creeps, calling for ganks. You can counter any character with another one, for example Drow ranger or Sniper who are consider OP by noobs can easily be owned by a Huskar or Spring Breaker, Huskar can be handle by a Chos knight. Again picking the right character to counter your opponent, it's called STRATEGY. NONE OF WHICH EXIST IN THIS GAME. Next, it's the most buged game i've ever played always crashing, I tried playing with my game pad EVERY game I lagged out and crashed. All the so-called expert  players speed hack/cheat. Now, the nickel and dime aspect, i will disclaim I have spent more than $130 USD on this game and have played grater than 200 hrs. Everything  is randomized so you grind for 5K crystals and randomized a dragon or weapon you don't want, you can't trade it to another player, NO MONEY INVOLVED IN THAT,  all you can do is sell it for a fraction of what you grind for, basically a waste of your time. Then thiers runes completion which takes UP TO 48hrs to complete, why I have no clue, maybe they are using a sweat shop in China to do the work. Weapon forge can take an eternity,  again maybe this one is sent to India for completion, unless you buy instance item to complete forge, money grab basically. After 200 hrs, I have not randomized any items i want, thus spending my own cash, good marketing strategy. Bottom line, this is a causal game, repetitious game play with no real substance and indepth game play or STREATGY.

You see, i am here for the dragons. And boy there are some. You see, the game does its name justice, and because of that it forced me to be playing frantically a genre i've come to hate and have very few, unpleasant experiences with. The MOBA.\nFortunately, riding a flaming winged terror and hunting down and killing strangers is as rewarding as it sounds. There's more to it though. I mean there's a ton of weapons, a lot of dragons, and you can unlock everything eventually by playing.\nI would like to be able to unlock the single player campaign or the avatars but those remain to be seen. There are three arenas to play and those give the old run-and-hunt-and-avoid gameplay some diversity which is always good. The music also sets the mood, but some Rhapsody of fire would go perfectly with it.\nTo close, i would recomend Dragons and Titans. I would recomend it, because it was all i had hoped it would be and some more, i would recommend it because of dragons, which are always a wonderful theme if used correctly and of the tones of fun i had with it so far.\nA last word would go to the pieces of fluff that seem to surround everything. Great job on that, and it really sets the mood.","October 14, 2014","true","57.5"," 50 of 76 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","50","76","3","3"

More like Play to win!\n\nPersonally I think Dragons and Titans is a lovely little MOBA. I agree that it can't really compare to games like Dota and League of Legends, but the potential is certainly there.\n\nThe most common complaints I've seen in reviews are that the game would be Pay to Win and that the controls are clunky. One review even stated you can't attack and fly at the same time.\n\nI find these arguments unfounded. All dragons are quite balanced so buying more with money hardly gives you an advantage. The tutorial gives you the crystals(the in game currency) to buy a dragon pack and a weapons pack, both containing 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons respectively. Through playing PVP or the single player campaign you can earn more crystals. I've had pvp games in which I earned about 300 crystals and you need 2500 for a weapons pack and 5000 for a dragons pack.\n\nFurther more there are a bunch of free to play dragons and weapons to choose from in PVP battles. These dragons and weapons rotate every other week between all the dragons and weapons available.\n\nAs for the keybinding, I will admit that its hard to get used to at first, but it's hardly clunky. Once you get the feel for it you'll be twisting and turning and breathing whatever your dragons breathing down on your foes. Flying and attacking at the same time is easy to do, some dragons even have homing attacks that will find your target no matter which direction you're facing.\n\nThere's 3 pvp maps with different game modes and the levels are well designed. Overall the PVP element is the best part of the game as it should be, but the single player campaign is a nice add on.\n\nThe single player campaign allows you to unlock dragons. Now I've seen a complaint about that in one of the reviews that you would need to clear 150 levels before unlocking the dragon. In truth you only need to play through every level once to unlock the dragon. But I agree that the difficulty is really high even when played in recruit mode. You'll die a lot, get frustrated a lot and if you're anything like me you'll just give up on it and go '♥♥♥♥ it I'm sticking to pvp'\n\nBut the thing I really like about this game is that you can endlessly combine weapons and dragons. Meaning that you could face off against a dragon with a weapon that shoots arrows one time and then be faced with that same dragon with the ability to drop mines and teleport the next time you face it. It also means that you can choose your own style of play.\n\nFurther more, the more you play a dragon or weapon, the more experience is awarded to them, allowing them to advance ranks and become faster and more powerfull. So really, the more you play the more powerful your dragons and weapons get and the more likely you are to win!\n\nAnd if that isn't reason enough to give it a try. There's one argument that is sure to at least get me playing\n\nIts a Dragon MobA!","March 13, 2014","true","48.8"," 182 of 313 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","182","313","0","13"

The abundance of great looking dragons and various weapons provides for many unique playstyles and really keeps the game interesting. I also personally love the way the items work in this game compared to other MOBAs in that you don't need to constantly return to the base to upgrade or purchase new items; item selection is done before the match begins. This allows for much less downtime and smooths the learning curve quite a bit. My only complaint with Dragons and Titans is that targeting can be annoying and very difficult to control. Some dragons also seem overpowered.. but that is to be expected and overall, I was satisfied with the level of balance between the dragons that I saw. All in all, it's a great free MOBA and you should definitely check it out!","November 22, 2014","true","3.5"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","30","45","4","0"

Great Concept, But executed terribly.\nThe character models may look iffy and well, as most people said ugly, look past that and you see a decent game.\n\nI also see some people talking about how this game is P2W (pay to win). But speaking from personal experience, it doesnt have to be. I know a bunch of top players who didnt pay a single cent.\n\nAlso did i mention how the developers are just lazy?\nThere was a glitch i believe that happened during February 29th 2016, Where all the dragons were avalaible as the free rotation. You couldn't upgrade dragons you had or sell them during that time. Guess when did the developers found out about it and fixed it?\n\nAbout a month later.\n\nYeah, this game is great, and i love it. But developers put some goddamm effort to it for god's sake.\n\nBut the true thing that makes this game terrible is the community.\nSalty af brazilian/spanish/russian mofo spamming chat.\nAfk idiots.\nRage quitters.\nPeople with horrible internet.\nTake you're pick.\n\nBut all in all, its an enjoyable experience as long as you look past its terrible spots.\nShould you try it?

So just bread. bland right? yeah, first gold in this game is not used for a awesome item store where hundreads of possible set-ups can happpen. Its use to feed a titan. that runs straight down middle lane and gets killed unless you and your team destoryed those towers and got to the enemy base and destoryed most of the towers there. So gold is useless\n\nAlso the way you get dragons is, get this, Luck. no you can't buy a champion you want, you have to hope to get it! Making you spend money, on things you don't need. OR you can buy the character pack for way more then its worth and get the characters that come out in that year, Funny that this game came out during the last quarter of the year.\n\nThis game is just bland, just go and get League or Smite and have a much better time\n\nI give it a Slice of bread/10","November 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","40","68","10","0"

I love the take on the genre, and I know others complain about the controls, but frankly, I found them to be a welcome change rather than click click click!\nWhy is this game called Dragons and Titans?\nYou're a dragon lord, who rides dragons into battle. Now, why this is cool is you get a dragon with it's own unique abilities, and your rider can use a helpful weapon, so rather than filling inventory with objects and potions you're using abilities you specify as you progress. Once you reach enemy base, you find YOUR Titan is trapped there, and once you break the cage, you free them.\n\nNow for the negatives I noticed.\nIf you are just trying to practice to get a feel for the game, you will want to go and do the prologue and the acts. That's fine and dandy, but the learning curve is harsh even on Easy (because yeah, when I'm new, I'm going to hit Easy, k?) So you will find yourself frustrated time and time again with going through the entire thing after losing 4 lives (4 total, you get 3 hearts, and once you die after that, you have to start over).\n\nThe biggest, most horrendously awful thing about this game:\nSometimes, those acts bug out. Mobs will not come on que as they should to progress, leaving you looking around frustrated until you decide to quit. The good news here is that if you quit "the match" (again, this is an act, not playing with others) you will be able to try it again and then the enemes spawn accordingly.\n\nI don't know about you, but that seems almost game breaking to have to QUIT just to play the damn thing. I'm genuinely hoping this is addressed and repaired.\n\nAside from that, I do recommend this game, it's fun, the music is fantastic, and you feel like you're getting somewhere (when things aren't wonky).\n===Edit===\nAlso, some people are complaining that this is a pay to win game. As of 3/15/2014 this game actually gives you freebies for doing tutorials and stuff. Free crystals to buy a pack of dragons and weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OldSol/recommended/263500/","OldSol","Baralong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OldSol/","854 products in account","The whole MOBA concept as we know it now is highly overrated as it's seriously flawed by a number of issues, such as too long matches, repetitive game play with same builds, and community harassment. I've played DOTA and LOL pretty extensively but eventually left both. As for DaT it has addressed a number of key issues of the concept while adding a nice twist to it. The game plays differently unlike any MOBA you've played before, but the new control system seems to work pretty nice since you cannot lose your character in the middle of the fight, which often happens with inexperienced players in other MOBAs, designers have put a lot of thought and imagination in the dragons and the main map feels better that a regular "three lanes" map. The matches are usually 10-15 minutes long, so even if you're stuck with a bad team, it doesn't hurt you all that much, hence no harassment. The flaw with repetitive builds was fixed with weapons that are chosen before the match: they give you two abilities along with the two provided by your dragon. This gives you an imaginable number of variants that will keep you from getting bored for a long time\n\nAll in all, this game won't replace DOTA2 or LoL but will have a consistent player base that will grow over time. As for those claiming it to be "P2W", those players don't understand the whole concept of this model. DaT is a free to play title since no other player will get an advantage over you that you will not be able to get eventually, it does require some grind, but when you enjoy the game you don't really notice it. The only flaw I've come across - the game needs some polishing, but I believe it will get there eventually.\n\n9/10","March 15, 2014","true","66.7"," 43 of 79 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","43","79","0","0"

In addition to the cool lore and novelty of a moba in which you fly on a dragon's back, there are several key features that I think are innovative and make this game different from the rest of the pack:\n\n* Pressing spacebar lets you move backwards but still face forward, which makes for some interesting mechanics in outmanuevering your opponents.  Breathing fire on your opponent while backpedaling is also just fun!\n* The typical 4 abilities of most MOBAs are split - you get 2 from your dragon and 2 from your weapon.  This means you can create a huge number of combinations of abilities, flexibility which is really cool especially once you unlock a lot of dragons and weapons.  In other words, the same dragon can be played in vastly different ways depending on weapon choice.\n* The matches are typically fast, like 10-20 minutes, which is nice - I don't have to dedicate as much time to drop in and play a game here and there.\n* There are no in-match items to buy.  I love this becuase I don't have to memorize a huge inventory to play the game (or spend time sitting there agonizing over my item choice).  I can just concentrate on the game itself.\n* There is much less focus on killing minions, and much more focus on fighting the other players dragons.\n\nThe art is beautiful but a bit rough around the edges, and the interface is serviceable but could be a bit more intuitive.\n\nAt its core, Dragons and Titans is a great game that does key things differently from the MOBA crowd.  It fits great for me as a game I can drop in and play here and there without having to read tomes to catch up on what I missed or be screamed at for being a newb every moment when I play again and forget item builds...\n\nIt may not draw you in with its tutorial, but give it a chance to shine and it does not disappoint.","March 12, 2014","true","5.8"," 43 of 79 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","43","79","0","8"

With that out of the way, this game just is not very good. Its graphics are meh, though they certainly do the job, sound assets are pretty horrid, the voice acting terrible, the controls rather clunky, and the abilities very dull. It also feels very unpolished, with several bugs, a poorly designed UI, and an options menu so poor that it does not even include a sound slider. This, coupled with the terribly loud voices, forced me to take my headphones off while they talked.\n\nMy overall impression of the game is that of lost potential. It was made to play in a browser, and that is obvious in its design. One could certainly make an argument for it when it was on facebook, as it is of much higher quality then most other games there, but here on steam, well... even the dragons cannot save this one.","March 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

And besides any possible reason, if one just do not like a thing or a game, should just move on and go to find a new one, not be so destructive against one, it's unuseful and give just bad repercussions, and there is no needed of that.\nThe game is good and enjoyable, but it need more players! and when people come here to see the reviews and see all this negative votes are are discouraged and do not give it a try even if it's a Free to Play !!\nThe game need more good reviews, I think that ANY player that like Dragons and Titans, should tell others that, and not only in the chat, but write a positive review here and suggest it to other people! And I'm here to do it!\nThere is a part of pay to win too but it's almost insignificant, because if you like the game and enjoy to play as a DRAGON RIDER you'll gain things easy and with time, the beautiful aspect of this game besides the fact that you can chat and play with others, do pvp (players against other players) is that there are many dragons! And you can collect them and try them during the time, same for the weapons! that are many and different, this aspect make the game to have also a strategy side, it's not just about to throw your dragon against the enemy, but you have to learn each ability and potential, and also collaborate with others players and make a plan. You can also play easy against the computer in single player and with others too making co-op\nThe game may seems repetitive or boring, but the fact is that every game have a line, its history and structure, each in its own way it is structured with certain bases, and the rest comes from the actions that one does and how he lives it, as it acts. And this one make no exceptions, and it works following a precise line.\nPersonally I use a lot my imagination too, and I just love to see dragons, to play them and see the animations during the battles!!\nSo let's give it a try!! it deserve it :)\nand share it Dragons Lords !!!","June 3, 2014","true","386.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","3"

I refuse to be a wallet warrior and pay to level. D&T has a nice per year subscription model that gives you access to all of the current and future dragons and weapons on first tier for the year. Additionally buying the annual pass will increase your Gem and XP rewards. This game will allow you to play properly for free. There is nothing you can buy that you cannot get for free, however it will take a bit longer without the reward multiplier from the Titan Pass. Very fun and addictive. I would rate this 4 out of 5.

It's pretty fun, in a simplistic sort of way, which I like. And it has good microtransaction policies, which is to say there are none. Which I like. There is only one thing purchasable in this game (aside from the in-game currency), which is a sort of season pass, and, honestly, it's very humbly priced and a good deal ($20 for all the content made thus far, the future content they make for the next year, and 4x money). If you like the game, buying that is definitely worth considering, and it's still not pay to win, for the developers seem adamantly against that sort of thing.\n\nThere is a good variety of dragons too, and it doesn't overwhelm you with the sheer amount like Dota 2 does. In this game, you play as the dragons (well, a guy riding them) and must protect the titans for the fate of the world. A lot more clear-cut than whatever story Dota 2 happens to have. Like, why the ♥♥♥♥ is a building called an ancient? An ancient is a really old living being, and those "ancients" are not living beings from what I can tell. They are buildings. And that word is mostly an adjective. Mostly. And on that note, there is a dragon that looks like a xenomorph!\n\nBut anyway, it could use some extra polish with the UI presentation, but it's not unsightly. Matches are quite short, which you may or may not like, but I think it is a good thing, personally. You can also really customize your abilities and strategy, since your choice of dragon nets you two abilities, and your choice of weapon nets you two different abilities. So you can mix and match. It also has a good tutorial, so I'd definitely say this a good introduction to the MOBA genre.","September 20, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Dragon, weapon and spell combinations offer plenty of play style options. Solo and co-op play as well as ranked battles.\n\nCons: Rune system leaves a little too much to chance. Forces some social game aspects into the mix with Battle Marks. Only one map.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game. However, I do recommend to try it out. It's free after all.","March 14, 2014","true","4.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Games usually take between 10-20 minutes so its easy to do a few matches.\n\nAs for shop items, Dragons and weapons are easily buyable with ingame money (Crystals) which are not to hard to farm up, or real money for a quick boost. Dragons come in packs of 3 random ones, but you can buy specific ones for real money. Vanity items such as skins and avatars are bought with real money.\n\nApon starting a game you will choose one dragon and one weapon, all dragons have a general boost to character health and mana, as well as gold collection. Your dragon selection will modify your first 2 abilities as well as general stats such as speed, attack power, as well as attacks. The weapon you choose provides your last 2 attacks and each weapon is highly varied in which attacks it offers as well as utilities. Some weapon offer additional attacks, while others are passive buffs and still others boost in movement.  You also have 2 spells avalible to use.\n\nDragons and Titans offers several game modes including a single player adventure mode which allows you to earn special rewards. All of the Pvp game modes involve freeing your titan from the enemies, but each mode involves somewhat different methods to go through. Gold is avalible to collect and return in all game modes. Gold offers experience as well as in some game modes provides additional benefits.\n\nMoba involves traveling through a wide and open map with various areas to explore. Unlike standard mobas this one does not have specific lanes, or a "Jungle" to explore. Collecting gold here and returning it to the hoards here will summon a chaos titan who is a powerful boss creature that heals allies and shreds towers. Aid your titan to help it push to the heart of your enemies base. Apon summoning a titan, all progress towards your enemies titan is lost so gather gold often to ensure you're the one with the advantage.\n\nControl points has 5 control points that when captured slowly weaken the enemies titan cage shields. Gold here just offers experience and no added benefits. Once a control point is captured, you can teleport to it from the hoard as well as function as a gold drop off.\n\nAram is an all random mode that is just one quick fast paced lane where all dragons are randomly selected for the user while weapons can still be chosen freely. Gold is automatically dropped off and when the bar fills fully it will fire a set of 3 balistae to deal massive damage to anything in the path, This damage is enough to oneshot most dragons.\n\nOver all Dragons and titans is a nice fast paced moba that is still in active development. It stands differently to League of Legends as well as Dota 2, and I highly recommend it as a way to get people into mobas in general.","March 25, 2014","true","2.4"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

The game may need a good re-skinning. The overall basics and dynamics of the game as well as the controls are almost perfect with the exeption of a few dragons which I had difficult getting to work right (I.E the dragon that rushes forward but can't really attack) the music is good and the PVP game selection is great which is nice to say in a MOBA game because I like to get right into the action.\n\nI have faith in Dragons and Titans and so should you because there's nothing more kick-♥♥♥ than flying on a dragon and pwning other people flying on other dragons in an arena.

So you don't need to buy weapon. But that dosn't mean you need to stop buying  dragon packs. Because in this game. There are ways of making your favored combo stronger.\n\nBUT this involved getting to know every dragon. So dragon packs are the only way to do this. You combine 3 of the same dragons to increase its teir. A higher teired dragon has more health and reduced cooldown for abilities. There is also more health regen. Likewise. Weapons themselves can be paired with any dragon. Allowing versitility of the play style of over 27 dragons and weapons to make combinations with, and a growing list of weapons and dragons monthly.\n\nTitans pass gives you all the content you would get from microtransactions for a solid year.\n\nSo any dragon or weapon to be released is yours. But as mentioned. Your farming quest is not over when you buy Titans pass.\n\nBecause you still need to farm Mastery, another way to maximize your dragon. By playing your dragon more, the dragon itself gains xp going up in mastery rank with 5 teirs. First teir is basic, Second teir is bronze theird is silver fourth is gold and 5th is platnium.\nWith each mastery upgrade to your favored dragon it gains more health and becomes faster and stronger.\n\nBut don't let that fool you into thinking its an automatic win. Because combos and team mate support is the basic structure of this game.\n\nWith good combos, and good team support. You have a better chance of winning. And with titan pass. You get to start with your favored combos early. And believe me there are over 70 combos currently to chose from. How?\n\nBecause of runes and weapons forge. That is why.\n\nNot only do weapons have their own play style coupled with dragons. But there are 30 ranks which you the player earn.\n\nYou buy runes packs of 3 to give your dragon those extra stats you need to make your combo you want TO WORK. THAT'S RIGHT. 2 runes activate every time you level. So you need to pick wisely what your combo will be. Survivability? Damage? Support? Tank? What will you play?\nThere is so much to chose from. In any other MOBA you would have to shell out hundreds of dollars to get the oppertunity you get here for 20$. And even if you don't pay. You could easily achieve such status in a month of playtime.\n\nThey give you 3 dragons every 15 days as long as you log in everyday and claim the daily reward. 1 basic dragon one t2 and on the 15th day a random t3.\n\nIt's insainity what happens during the games now. With people shelling out their best combos games get hectic. WHen you think you can charge in solo is usually the time you should backup cuz flames and bolts are flying all over the place. Learning manuverability is extremely important in this game.\n\nand besides all those nice things. Skins. Yes skins. and avatars. If you buy titan pass you get any skin and avatar made for the next year.\n\n\nBest of all you get to keep everything you earn in this game, or buy with titan pass. You keep all the dragons weapons except the gem bonus for a year. You would need to buy titan pass again after the year is over.\n\nAnd a year LOL come on.... 12 months for 20 bucks for crap that would cost you hundreds ( Who in their right mind would pay that much for any microtransactions on a moba?!?) This game isn't trying to rob you folks.\n\nThis is probably the only customer friendly moba out there, They literally catter to our whims in forums.\nSo we could use more devs to catter to our whims if you decide to buy this thing.\n\nI wrote this review because the people who rip on this game are savage at filling the steam reviews with garbage.\n","December 4, 2014","true","940.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","3"

I actually played it back when it was still just on Facebook and on the website and I have to say I like it a lot more now with all the new features and gameplay and gameplay modes. The campaign mode is okay but I would like to see it a little less cashshop based but hey, it's a free-to-play game so who am I to complain, right? Well I just feel as though if I am going to pay for something I want to choose to do it, not be forced to do it.\n\nThe graphics are great and compliment the tone and style of the game very well, although I do think some minor adjustments could be made to the camera angles. The game may need a good re-skinning. The overall basics and dynamics of the game as well as the controls are almost perfect with the exeption of a few dragons which I had difficult getting to work right (I.E the dragon that rushes forward but can't really attack) the music is good and the PVP game selection is great which is nice to say in a MOBA game because I like to get right into the action.\n\nI have faith in Dragons and Titans and so should you because there's nothing more kick-♥♥♥ than flying on a dragon and pwning other people flying on other dragons in an arena.

Отличная, потому что своя, ни откуда не содраная, что я порой замечаю в некоторых играх сего жанра. Отличная, потому что принесла мне много новых впечетлений, и по-моему не только мне. Одним словом у неё довольно много плюсво:\n+ Тут есть драконы, много драконов! Все любят драконов!\n+ Именно в этой игре я первый раз столкнулся с non-target системой боя в данном жанре.\n+ Ты можешь донатить сколько твоей душонке угодно, но это никак не повлеяет на твою архизашибенность в этой игре. Донат тут помогает быстраее получить новых дракончиков и цацки, которые ты тягаешь в своих ручонках, он служат как дополнительные способности.\n+ Есть несколько режимов игры, и ни одни не похож на режимы из тех MOBA игр в которые я играл, за исключением Battle или Ballist alley, у меня с памятью плоховато.\n+ Неплохо сделана и сюжетная линия со связаными с ней челенджами!\n+ Интуитивное управление, понятно с первых минут игры.\n+ Приятная графика, нет, не как в кукурузисе или даенг лайте, а как должна быть в игре про драконов.\nНо в любой игре можно найти минусы:\n- Меня совсем не порадовало то, что в пати можно взять только одного человека.\n- Игра периодически зависает, и не на время, а на совсем, но оживает после её ребута.\n- Моя мятежноя душонка сильно взбунтовалась, когда я понял, что драконов нельзя покупать по одному. И если в начале   игры не возмутило, т.к. я был рад любому дракону, то когда я понял, принцип действия всех дракош, наступила печаль.\n- Порой, кажется, что накопить на новую пачку дракош невозможно.\n- Русский перевод не очень корректен, так сказать, но радует уже и то, что он есть.\nВ общем и целом игра хороша. Моя оценка 8/10.\n\nP.S. Вложить деньги в игру стоит, если не для удавлетворения драконьих потребностей, то для поддержки разработчиков, они вам игру бесплатно предоставили, как ни как.","February 3, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You pick a dragon of your choice, being different from each other and depending on its element, will give you two unique abilities - Q and R. Q is your main attack, it cost little mana and normally has a small cooldown, W is your secondary attack, usually if your dragon has an escape or damage reduction ability, its situated here.\n\nNow for the weapon, you get to pick an item of your choice to wield into battle, giving you the other two abilities, your E and R. Depending on what type of build you wish to play, these items will give different skills. Example is a mace that gives massive mana regen as a passive, your E, while the R is a dmg ability. Some items are strickly support, some are healing, some are damage and some are a mix of both. This allows you to play the same dragon with different weapons to create completely new builds and playstyles.\n\nThere are no items in this game, the gold you collect from killing enemy players and minions is stored on your person and requires you to return back to base and dump the gold in a pile. This then gives you experience depending on how much gold you had stored away.\n\nThree different gamemodes, ARAM, normal MOBA with three lanes and a zone capture gametype.\n\nYou begin the game with 3 random dragons and 3 random weapons, so if you don't get what you want, you will need to play a bunch of games for crystals to buy the desired items or pay real money for bundles.\n\nThe objective of both the ARAM and normal 3 lane MOBA is to destroy the turrets linked to a statue, then destroy the statue to deactivate a forcefield that weakens your dragon and slows down his speed. Do this several times until you reach your titan and release it from its prison, (attack the main objective, like the nexus in LoL) and the game is over.\n\nI play League of Legends a lot of the time, so that satiates all my MOBA needs, but I do recommend trying it out, its free and pretty fun if your willing to get the hang of it.\n\nPersonal Rating: 3/5","April 22, 2014","true","2.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

So you don't need to buy weapon. But that dosn't mean you need to stop buying  dragon packs. Because in this game. There are ways of making your favored combo stronger.\n\nBUT this involved getting to know every dragon. So dragon packs are the only way to do this. You combine 3 of the same dragons to increase its teir. A higher teired dragon has more health and reduced cooldown for abilities. There is also more health regen. Likewise. Weapons themselves can be paired with any dragon. Allowing versitility of the play style of over 27 dragons and weapons to make combinations with, and a growing list of weapons and dragons monthly.\n\nTitans pass gives you all the content you would get from microtransactions for a solid year.\n\nSo any dragon or weapon to be released is yours. But as mentioned. Your farming quest is not over when you buy Titans pass.\n\nBecause you still need to farm Mastery, another way to maximize your dragon. By playing your dragon more, the dragon itself gains xp going up in mastery rank with 5 teirs. First teir is basic, Second teir is bronze theird is silver fourth is gold and 5th is platnium.\nWith each mastery upgrade to your favored dragon it gains more health and becomes faster and stronger.\n\nBut don't let that fool you into thinking its an automatic win. Because combos and team mate support is the basic structure of this game.\n\nWith good combos, and good team support. You have a better chance of winning. And with titan pass. You get to start with your favored combos early. And believe me there are over 70 combos currently to chose from. How?\n\nBecause of runes and weapons forge. That is why.\n\nNot only do weapons have their own play style coupled with dragons. But there are 30 ranks which you the player earn.\n\nYou buy runes packs of 3 to give your dragon those extra stats you need to make your combo you want TO WORK. THAT'S RIGHT. 2 runes activate every time you level. So you need to pick wisely what your combo will be. Survivability? Damage? Support? Tank? What will you play?\nThere is so much to chose from. In any other MOBA you would have to shell out hundreds of dollars to get the oppertunity you get here for 20$. And even if you don't pay. You could easily achieve such status in a month of playtime.\n\nThey give you 3 dragons every 15 days as long as you log in everyday and claim the daily reward. 1 basic dragon one t2 and on the 15th day a random t3.\n\nIt's insainity what happens during the games now. With people shelling out their best combos games get hectic. WHen you think you can charge in solo is usually the time you should backup cuz flames and bolts are flying all over the place. Learning manuverability is extremely important in this game.\n\nand besides all those nice things. Skins. Yes skins. and avatars. If you buy titan pass you get any skin and avatar made for the next year.\n\n\nBest of all you get to keep everything you earn in this game, or buy with titan pass. You keep all the dragons weapons except the gem bonus for a year. You would need to buy titan pass again after the year is over.\n\nAnd a year LOL come on.... 12 months for 20 bucks for crap that would cost you hundreds ( Who in their right mind would pay that much for any microtransactions on a moba?!?) This game isn't trying to rob you folks.\n\nThis is probably the only customer friendly moba out there, They literally catter to our whims in forums.\nSo we could use more devs to catter to our whims if you decide to buy this thing.\n\nI wrote this review because the people who rip on this game are savage at filling the steam reviews with garbage.\n","December 4, 2014","true","940.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","3"

Each random "pack" of dragons (which is only three may I add) costs 5000 in-game money and you need more than one to get the highest teir dragon... Storyline missions and battles only give you around 20-60 each. Don't think you can complete tutorial objectives to speed this up as you start out either, how about a 50 reward for a task that requires you spend 150.\n\nSo you either want to pay or you're in for the hard slog for that shiny gold dragon you set your eyes on.\n\nThis game also doesn't have much to do when it comes to the matches in multiplayer and from what I've seen there is only one map per game-mode, making it rather boring after a while. The tutorial is lacking... the options are even more lacking... i.e. prety much non-existent, and I can see why it makes some people think facebook game... I also came to the realization that this game isn't technically free to play at all and that's a misleading claim to draw you in. The DLC for this is literally the game and theres only two parts of DLC so far, which may I just say you will not want. Each DLC gives you 10 relatively short missions and you have to complete each mission 15 times over with different requirements to unlock the best prize. That isn't replayability, it's just a SLOG. No prize is worth the aggrevation of dragging yourself through the same 10 scenarios 15 times over! So this game is not only mingy, but misleading, very short on content and is money-intensive.\n\nI'm still playing it, but it's not getting a thumbs up from me.","April 22, 2014","false","574.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Баланс игры не был даже поправлен, и вряд ли будет - разработчики теперь просто "пихают" туда мини-аддоны (+1 оружие, дракон и т.п.) и всё. Ждите перепродажи игры с её полной перекройкой.Первые ласточки - теперь уже невозможно выбрать карту для сражения.\nНо хоть НАКОНЕЦ-ТО добавили античиты и чуть убрали доминацию тач-падов.\n\nИтак игра формата Доты на драконах - правда с несколькими плюсами: - поправляю - теперь эти плюсы работают только для ко-оп мачта\n1) Намного быстрее - матч не больше 15 минут\n2) При использовании дракона и оружия мастерство растёт - но опыт оружия ничего не даёт, а вот здоровье и скорость дракона растёт.\n3) Вы всегда получите 2 ед. ресурса за игру для прокачки (ковки) оружия - если соберете их (используйте радар)\n4) Постоянные мини-достижения за которые вы премируетесь небольшой суммой кристаллов - сыграть 3 раза подряд в мачт (неважно в одиночной или мульти) к примеру\nВердикт - надеюсь игра останется на этом уровне "бесплатности", но жадность людей штука коварная...Имеет смысл если вы очень любите коллекционировать - дракончики бесподобны.\n\n\nI, hypostasial, dislike games free-to-play - experience shows that when game earn "a lot of money" delopers often selling it as franchise or will make gameplay impossible without donates - but this day this game can be played with no donate.\nBalance even wasn't "attempted to be fixed" and i had a big doubt that it will be - now developers just add "new content" (+1 weapon, dragon e.t.c.). Will wait for franchise soon with full change of game model i think.Now you can't pick game map. However they AT LAST added anti-cheats and fixed touch-pad superiority.\n\nSo,.. we have a Dota-style on dragons - but with few features: - fixing - now it's all working for co-op only\n1) Fast - match no more 15 minutes\n2) Mastery of weapons and dragon will increase with every game - no boosts for weapon, but dragon get more health and speed\n3) You always get 2 points of resourse that needed to forge weapon - if you manage to collect it on map (use radar map)\n4) Permanently repeated mini-in-game achievments that give you a bonus small pack of crystals - like to complete 3 matches and no matter in single- or multi-mode\n\nVerdict - I hope that this game will continiue that type of "free", but human's greed is very treacherous vice...This game will be interest if you like collecteables - dragons are unmatched in that.","March 30, 2014","false","492.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though I only have a few hours of gameplay to boast, I still think that I know enough to say that this game is worth your time. The system of dragon/weapon is easy to understand, the movement is simple, the matches are complex enough to be interesting but not complex to the point of overwhelming, and the act system offers more challenges than you normally find in an MOBA, along with the Titan Pass which offers you a complete collection of every item in the game for the low, low price of $19.99 (or $9.99 if you're getting it on a sale as I did.) To top it all off, the download is only a bit over 100MB.\n\nThe only issues I really have with the game are that it's a bit grindier if you don't get the Titan Pass, and- mentioning the TP again- it seems that you are unable to play the acts beyond Act 1 without unlocking them with the TP. It's not much of an issue though, because the TP is only $19.99 and it's only necessary to purchase it once- no subscriptions and no extra DLC packages.","December 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I played this game on facebook and I must say that Wyrmbyte has improved Dragons and Titans.","March 18, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The action is much faster paced and a lot more fun. If you didn't like LOL and DOTA try this instead. If you like those two... this may still be for you.\n\nThere's a combination of strategy and skill needed to win each match. Protect your stuff, gather gold , and free your titan!\nHIGHLY recomended.","March 17, 2014","true","30.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However it also has its cons.\n\nPros\n- Tons of Dragons you can play as, with just as much weapons to use.\n- Single Player and Co-op mode for those who don't want to deal with PVP\n- Good storyline that is not long and obnoxious.\n\nCons\n\n- Unable to select map and team\n- In Single player, the map is always MOBA\n- Crystal rewards are too little for players without the TITAN PASS\n\nIt is a very fun game, and as a big dragon fan, I adore all of the varying dragon styles. If you have the free time, I recommend playing this game.\n\nHowever, make sure it doesn't crash or close before entering a multiplayer map. Mine closed as the timer was counting down and now I am unable to play it.\n\nOther than that, no real problems with this game.\n","February 16, 2015","true","85.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It no longer requires any skill at all to play which is painfully obvious after playing one match after another with 1-3 of your 4 teammates where always going afk, and pulling out a win albeit unlikely is still possible.\n\nBy reducing the competitiveness of PvP to the extreme that they have, and not only with auto-aim but with matchmaking as well they made this feel like a "grade school level" type of moba where even basic levels of tactics, strategy, and intelligence are obsolete as Teamplay and individual skills no longer exists.\n\nThe developers of this game boasts that this is a fast pace game and in fact it once was, today however the number of users using 1 hit kill hacks or speedhacks has made the community who do still play legit feel unmotivated during gameplay which is likely why there are now so many afkers on both sides in every match. While this can still be a fun game to play especially when both team are actually competing at their best, this however is becoming a rare sight.\n\nTo give you some prospective, out of 30 matches I played today only 6 of them where interesting or engaging battles with all 10 players participating the others where mediocre 1 sided bouts often lasting under 60 seconds due to large amounts of afk'ing going on right from the start of the match, and at lest 4 of them had 1 or more hackers in it.\n\nIn short the game itself is very fun and recommended,  it's the community's lack of interest or motivation to participate in the matches they chose to join that is in my opinion dragging this game down. And I believe that is ultimately cause by a horrible lack of competitiveness that the developers have now brought to the game.\n\nWith that said I wouldn't recommend this game to all the competitive players of a moba genre, though I would recommend it to the more casual players,  first timers, and  perhaps the younger crowd of players just looking for a good time","February 18, 2015","true","73.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I am level 27 and have 86 in game hours.\n\nThat said this is a very unique game.\n\nIt is very well balanced. It's never happens that some rich kid that spent a ton of money in game comes up with some superweapon and annihilates everyone. The games are rank based so if your a lvl 2 noob the youll play level 1-5 players  who are also noobs.\n\nThe number of weapon - dragon combinations are staggering. with over 30 wepons and 30 dragons that can be combined in any way you have millons of combinatons. And the viarances on the playing style on each is so different you will never exaust   the posibilites. And the balance between the different weapon am dragon types is amazing.\n\nIf you were expecting graphics likw in a multimilon dollar game like bioshock, well, you'll be dissapointed of course. This game is free. No money needed. In fact, paying money in game only gives you different options. It doesn't give you more powerfull options. Paying money makes absoultely no difference in pvp games.\n\nAs far as as free to play goes, this game is excelent. Allowing players to spend money without unbalancing the pvp games.\n\nIf you want a free to play moba, this is it.","April 7, 2014","true","341.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I do love the dragon ranks... but it would have been enough with just the graphical coolness of higher rank dragons... Removing stats on diffrent mastery ranks would be really smart...\n\n-The lore and the dialogs feels like are written by a 5 year old... some of the dialog is so bad and some of the missions feel so stupid that I some times started to wonder why I even tested this game at all...\nThere are mobs in the act 1 missions that are so annoying... like some ghosts that are protecting some crypts you need to destroy... They all just fly towards you and push you out of position and you take damage without the monsters having any animation at all... almost like you thought it was made by an indie game company without any animators... or any interested programmers to actually make a decent mob script...\n\n-Every time you complete an act you get an dragon... The main problem with that is that the act is so long and the amount of gems (that you can use for unlocking more dragons) is so low... you rather feel like playing lol or any other type of moba game because you progress a lot faster in those games.. But, yeah you can also get mastery on the dragon by doing ALL the challanges on every mission in every act! That's 15 reruns of each of the missions you actually would'nt want to play in the first place! 15!!!!!!\n\n-there is no way to do practice games vs bots to try out dragons. I know it's a free rotation every week but yeah. If you want a player to waste 5 euro on one dragon you better let him have a taste of what he is gonna buy or else the player will find something else to waste his money on... and that won't be anything related to this game... unless he buys shyvanna from lol... because she is a dragon thingie... same with Ao in smite... or whatever that chinese dragon's name is...\n\n\nI felt that these things needed to be highlighted in the review because these are pretty annoying and game/mood breaking things that I have noticed so far in the game and it's the first impression a new player meet in this game.\n\n\nGood things about the game.\n-The movement system is quite functional. easy to move around and holding space makes you fly backwards while you can use your skills in the direction you are pointing... It may give a good feeling in pvp.\n\n-Game looks ok/good graphical. Of course there could be some major improvements in the graphics... but I liked it...\n\n-There are tons of interesting and cool looking dragons... gives you the interest of wanting to try everyone of them... To bad there is'nt a 20 dragon bundle pack of rank 2 dragons or whatever...\n\n-The way you get to chose your two first skills by the dragon type and the two other remaining skills by chosing items is actually really well done. I liked it a lot... To bad I will use my time playing smite instead untill they manage to do some major changes in how their greedy minds works...\n\n-I am pretty certain that if you play this game for a month or two... all the negative things I wrote won't really be an issue as you will have unlocked a few dragons just by gems and dices that the game will be worthwhile to game full time. That and the horrible campaign will be long gone memories that you would never have to touch with your mind ever the f... again....","April 12, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The concept of thte game is very simpe and yet, very entertaining. One of the things that was not appreciated, on my part at least, is that you cannot complete the story without purchasing a titan pass. The game is still very fun and I highly recomend it to anyone who enjoys these types of games.","July 29, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

I won't say the game is perfect because it's not and I won't say the game is complete because with this type of game you don't finish you continue to grow.\n\nThere is a great selection of dragons and weapons to choose from.  You have the traditional moba archtypes of bruiser, support, tank etc.  The types of dragons you can play with is varied and makes the lore interesting.  You have your elementals, traditional European and Oriental style dragons, Golems/machines and more.\n\nGood or bad right now when you join the PVP you are taken to one of three maps: ARAM (All random all mid), Control points, and lastly the more traditional attack the base map.\n\nThe Community is largely supportive but due to the currently small player base the match making system puts mismatched skill levels together.  More detrimental is the systems will stack the teams with 3 or 4 high ranking players on one team.\n\nThe introductory levels to the game are well thought out and get you quickly into the action and show you where everything is located.  If you forget or haven't come across something yet the community is ready to help answer questions.  Always improving and moving in the direction from good to great.  I hope you give it a whirl and find it as enjoyable as I have.\n\nSeadrake","November 1, 2014","true","169.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The last bit of fun at this game is totally ruined by leavers and BOTs that makes really every game like a 2v3, 3v1 etc.","April 21, 2014","false","26.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played a season and a half, last season I was ranked somewhere in the top 50.\n\nTo begin with, this game has epic potential, I discovered it by chance via fb apps and after many hours and a terrible kdr (kill death ratio) , I grew to love it. The mechanics, the community and the competitive spirit. Making my way up the ranks I watched in awe at how good the pro players were and worked at getting a decent, well thought out rune set and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the multitude of dragons and weapons available. The negative reviews here were likely written by people who failed to grasp, that this, like most moba's, has a learning curve and that you need to adapt to get any joy from the game. How many of us kicked off Dota2 or LoL and mastered controls and gameplay immediately?\n\nLast season the game suffered immense balance issues with the release of a terribly OP'd dragon and weapon. This was fixed, somewhat at the start of season 4 and a great many dragons were improved.\n\nYou may at this point ask yourself why I don't recommend the game. The truth is, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a competitive moba experience, I don't recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenge. Those aspects no longer exist in the DnT universe thanks to the fantastic work the devs did with the controls.\n\nThe game now gives you the option of using "legacy" controls, that don't provide auto-aim or strafing and the new controls which do. They claim it's to make the game easier and even out the playing field. They believe this ease of play will attract new players. It isn't and I doubt it will. What it has caused is the current boycott of pvp matches and micro-transactions. if you have a look at their fb page you'll be greeted with tons of negative comments from the once loyal community, including those who stuck with this game since open beta.\n\nTo summarize, pvp is a mess, stay away from it.\n\nGet This Game IF:\n\nYou enjoy ease of play akin to the My Little Pony collection.\nYou have no interest in moba or pvp.\nYou own the directors cut of Eragon.\nYou're bored out of your mind and you'd like to login on days like this to read the excellent lore.\n\nAvoid like a Justin Bieber concert If:\n\nYou love a challenge.\nYou have better things to do, like watching paint dry.\nHave an interest in Esports.","April 16, 2014","false","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you don't get the dragon or weapon you want, then oh well, you'll have to go spend some money on it. Quite literally you have to pay for almost everything in the game. After beating the first long string of levels and unlocking the Noxwing, you have to pay some money to unlock the nest stupid long string of levels. It's also annoying that you have to rebuild your perks back up every single time you start a new level. Seriously, I play one level and max out my perks, then go to the next level and they're all gone again and I get slaughtered in about five seconds because of that. It also has numerous glitches that make it so you have to restart whatever level or challenge you're trying to do.","June 2, 2014","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each dragon only has two attacks, and almost all of them have a standard breath attack. So really dragons only have one attack that is different from another dragon. The way they tried to fix this, was with weapons. Equipping a weapon will give your dragon two more attacks depending on the weapon you equipped. The problem is, this doesn't make things more unique, it makes them more stale.\n\nSay you and another dragon have the same weapon equipped. Well now you and that dragon only have one unique move between each other, and he's a completely different dragon. This is made even worse by the fact that there is no item shop in game. Dragons scale with levels, thats it. So while you might do good damage to an enemy DPS, theres nothing you can do to help you damage against a Tank, or if you need more HP to survive, theres no way to get it.\n\nSpeaking of "no way to get it", thats what I have to tell you bout a dragon you might want to buy. You see, you don't just buy the one you want, oh no, you have to get lucky and play whats basically a slot machine and hope you get lucky. Oh you got the one you want you say? Well guess what, dragons actually have different levels outside of the game that make them stronger. So while you may have gotten that awesome Gemtalon I, he's nowhere near as strong or awesome as Gemtalon III.\n\nIts a watered down moba, aiming to cash in on the popularity of dragons by locking them all behind a slot machine and hoping you spend a bunch of money to get one, before you realize the game isn't deep enough to warrant spending money.","May 3, 2015","false","24.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

Some examples of OP unplayable combos:\n50% of available dragons + Truth's charge (Any map)\nVenomtail + Sparrowthorn (Any map)\nVenomtail + Winterfloe (Any map)\nRimrock + Sparrowthorn (Any map)\nLunaveil + Sphere of wudeng (Ballistae Alley, but OP on any map)\nGoldenclaw + chillblade (Any map)\nMagmascale + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA, but OP on any map)\nAutobot + chillblade (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA)\nSwiftwing + Unity mark (Chaos Unleashed / MOBA)\nDarkOne + chill blade (Any map)\nDreadnaught + Rodar (Ballistae Alley)\nGravelurker + Truth's charge (Nether gate)\nSo skill really makes no difference in this game. Use any of the above combos to get lots of kills. Kills translate to higher ranking and more crystals, so you can buy more dragons. You can combine dragons to make more powerful dragons so you can get more kills, so continues the cycle. Some of you reading below will say I am a bad player complaining because I don not have the dragons listed below. Trust me, I have 10+ highest level (T4) dragons including 5 of the OP combos mentioned below. As a principle I refuse to use OP combos. So most of the time I am either getting killed or just defending against OP combos (using a defensive combo - see below).\n\nAs I mentioned, the above weapon combos are unplayable against, which means you have a 90% chance of losing against them. Only way to counter the Truth's charge weapon is to use the Chillblade weapon. So you will see lots of 'so called pros' running around with those combos. The only other way you can keep yourself from being killed every 1-2 minutes is to use a Tanglewing dragon + Rainmaker combo (my defensive combo).\n\nThe moderators and devs do not care about fixing the game and in fact are the people who use the OP combos. So if you are a new player, you are only helping them increase their ranking. What can you say about people whos only sense of importance is getting higher ranking using an OP combo on an online game... ;-)\n\nThis game allows duos (where two players can play together on same team). This just makes a broken game even more impossible to win. So two already good players will duo with OP combos making the odds of winning impossible. So you can bring complementary combos (e.g. two combos that almost slow enemy to a halt, combos that give unlimited health + mana, etc) So by the end of the game you will see they have killed like 15+ times each.\n\nI have rarely seen mods on here who are sensible. The only qualification for being a mod on this game is to support the game no matter how broken it is and to of course prove it is not broken by using an OP combo. So that entails using the OP combo to show its broken and of course to keep telling players that nerfs and balances are coming. Trust me, they are not. 3 seasons ago, the DarkOne + Truth's charge was OP and we were told it was nerfed. Guess what, it still is OP and impossible to play against.\n\nThe game has 5 vs 5 PVP games mostly where you can use a preselected dragon + weapon combo. However it is so badly broken that it allows more than one player to use the same combo. So it is not unusual to see all 5 players using the same dragon or combo. So you will see games where you opposite team has 5 Dreadnaughts + Rodar's sceptre combo. That dragon is basically has the highest health and one of the highest damages in this game and can heal other dragons. Rodar's sceptre weapon increases your dragon's damage. So you know playing that game has like a 0.001% chance of winning. Hell, even if you have two Dreadnaughts in your team or enemy team the game becomes unbalanced since the 2 of those dragons will just outheal any damage you take or inflict.\n\nUnlike other games, you can not pick what dragons or weapons you want to buy. 5000 in game crystals get you 3 random dragons out of 30+ possible dragons. 2500 crystals get you 3 random weapons out of 25+ possible weasopns. You do not know what dragon you will get and if you get duplicates you are stuck with them. You can sell or use duplicate dragons to create higher level dragons, but given most dragons except the OP ones are useless, you are just wasting your time. So you can grind for hours and let yourself be killed hundreds of times by OP combos in the hope that you can get enough crystals to get better dragons. But after all that effort, you do not control which dragon or weapon u get.\nDespite all the above, if you still want to go ahead and try the game, my advice is that you try it for free. Do not waste any of your money on Titan's pass. Yes, they will say you get 4 times more crystals per game. Yes, they will say you will get access to all dragons and weapons but you already know you only ever need one of the 2 OP weapons and one of the above mentioned OP dragons. Better yet, keep making multiple accounts to get dragons + weapons. Since each new account gets 3 free dragons and weapons, you might get lucky with an account and get one of the OP combos above. The when u want to use that OP combo switch to that account to play, then create another account to try and get another OP combo... :-)\n\nI hope this review helps you understand what you are getting into for this game and what you will get in return for your money. My advice is simple - do not invest your money or time in this game. Try any of the other games that this game tried to copy very badly - Leage of Legends, DOTA2, plenty others... At least there you will supporting a community that really cares.","December 27, 2015","false","065.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each dragon only has two attacks, and almost all of them have a standard breath attack. So really dragons only have one attack that is different from another dragon. The way they tried to fix this, was with weapons. Equipping a weapon will give your dragon two more attacks depending on the weapon you equipped. The problem is, this doesn't make things more unique, it makes them more stale.\n\nSay you and another dragon have the same weapon equipped. Well now you and that dragon only have one unique move between each other, and he's a completely different dragon. This is made even worse by the fact that there is no item shop in game. Dragons scale with levels, thats it. So while you might do good damage to an enemy DPS, theres nothing you can do to help you damage against a Tank, or if you need more HP to survive, theres no way to get it.\n\nSpeaking of "no way to get it", thats what I have to tell you bout a dragon you might want to buy. You see, you don't just buy the one you want, oh no, you have to get lucky and play whats basically a slot machine and hope you get lucky. Oh you got the one you want you say? Well guess what, dragons actually have different levels outside of the game that make them stronger. So while you may have gotten that awesome Gemtalon I, he's nowhere near as strong or awesome as Gemtalon III.\n\nIts a watered down moba, aiming to cash in on the popularity of dragons by locking them all behind a slot machine and hoping you spend a bunch of money to get one, before you realize the game isn't deep enough to warrant spending money.","May 3, 2015","false","24.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

This is the game breaker for me. Too many times have i had a definate kill then all of a sudden a bird would fly by and my targeting would jsut switch and let teh enemy dragon get away.\n\nSecond, there are alot of balacing/Tech issues with the game.  The Server lags tremendously. too many times do you hit a skill button and it does nothing, in match making it puts you in with other players that are way higher developed than you.  For Example, when the more you play a particular weapon or dragon, the higher rank you get with it. it goes through the typic progression of no rank -> bronze -> silver -> gold -> diamond.  when you rank your dragon up it moves faster and gets more health and the weapons get shorter cool downs on the skills it gives you.  this is a huge advantage in games as either they can jsut out run you and get away or chase you down with you having no hope of escaping.\n\nThrid, is how oyu upgrade your dragons.  they go from I - IV and they get bonuses each time they upgrade.  you upgrade by getting 3 of a particular rank. you get dragons either by random chance by using crystals or you can buy the rank 1 for 2.99.  if you have a dragon you really like and want to get it to rank IV you either have to get really luckky with the random eggs OR you can by it for 81$ US.  Also as you lvl up you can start using Runes and to get runes you have to buy them with either crystals or using real money and even if you use real money the runes you get are totally random.  this is basically a pay to win game and if I am going to use real money i want a definate choice on what I spend my money on, not a random chance.\n\nLastly is the game type selection.  Instead of letting you choose the game type you want to play, the map is voted on and then for the next 30 min you HAVE to play that map.\n\n\nThis game is a huge let down because it has to the potential to be a great game, not only on the PC but console platforms too.  The game play is fun, but incredibly fustrating with all the issues it has that I mentioned above.  If they made the tweaks/Fixes to the issues i stated above I would definately recommend this game, but as it stands now I can NOT in good conscience recommend this game.","February 15","false","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And besides any possible reason, if one just do not like a thing or a game, should just move on and go to find a new one, not be so destructive against one, it's unuseful and give just bad repercussions, and there is no needed of that.\nThe game is good and enjoyable, but it need more players! and when people come here to see the reviews and see all this negative votes are are discouraged and do not give it a try even if it's a Free to Play !!\nThe game need more good reviews, I think that ANY player that like Dragons and Titans, should tell others that, and not only in the chat, but write a positive review here and suggest it to other people! And I'm here to do it!\nThere is a part of pay to win too but it's almost insignificant, because if you like the game and enjoy to play as a DRAGON RIDER you'll gain things easy and with time, the beautiful aspect of this game besides the fact that you can chat and play with others, do pvp (players against other players) is that there are many dragons! And you can collect them and try them during the time, same for the weapons! that are many and different, this aspect make the game to have also a strategy side, it's not just about to throw your dragon against the enemy, but you have to learn each ability and potential, and also collaborate with others players and make a plan. You can also play easy against the computer in single player and with others too making co-op\nThe game may seems repetitive or boring, but the fact is that every game have a line, its history and structure, each in its own way it is structured with certain bases, and the rest comes from the actions that one does and how he lives it, as it acts. And this one make no exceptions, and it works following a precise line.\nPersonally I use a lot my imagination too, and I just love to see dragons, to play them and see the animations during the battles!!\nSo let's give it a try!! it deserve it :)\nand share it Dragons Lords !!!","December 24, 2015","true","729.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

There are no no microtransactions in here unless its to buy a dragon which you really want, or an avatar which does nothing for gameplay. By the Dragon Pack, you can get any dragon in the game, but only 3, so it is fair. Play it before you judge it.

These games are just poorly made duplicates, with terrible encentives like Dragons and Titans. "WOW!" It has dragons (really cool bc dragons are beast) and titans (theyre also really cool divine people) and yeah sounds cool. Actually, does it  sound cool or is it just lame? The gameplay is filthy, it is also a bit P2W. There also isnt much strategy at all. Ill list them.\n\n- NO ♥♥♥♥ING ITEMS!!!!!! I mean, what the actual ♥♥♥♥.\n- 4 spells on each dragon, and about 15 dragons maybe. However, the Q is always a normal attack, usually fire breath. Sometimes a beam of light or something. So. really u have 3 spells now. they also have no strategy, normally theyre all dmg spells and basically all you do is spam them all on the enemy and hope for a kill.\n- Also, if you are a good player, and get fed heaps, it still wont mean that u can just fly around the map and burn everyone in 1 second. No, instead you are still weak as p!ss beacuse of the fact THAT THERE ARE NO ITEMS!!!!\n\nBasically, the game is absolute sh!t\n","October 7, 2015","false","2.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Your dragon has only 1 active skill! Your dragon's basic attacks have passive effects, 1 active ability and a passive with increases hp/mana/speed increase. Then you have equipable weapons which provide 2 other skills, so a moba with characters that have no ultimates. Shame on them. These weapons have synergy with certain dragons but you can only get dragons and weapons from random chests or eggs, so if you get the wrong one you lose some of your weapon/dragons potential. The amount of people that play this game is less than 1k, but you still find matches, just don't expect to be with people your level. There are bugs everywhere, but all games have them.  This game is pretty grindy to get crystals beacuse the end game rewards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you buy a pass.\n\nOnce you finesh the turtorial there is an ad stating NO mirco transactions NO pay to win and N0 ingame currency. Then after that ad there is another ad stating  BUY Titan Pass $20. This unlocks all content and everything that arrives in the game for 1 year and multiplies your rewards from matches by 4 (which you really need) and you also need this to complete the entire Single player campaign which reawards powerful dragons. F**King HYPOCRITS. So don't trust anything they say unless your gut says otherwise.\n\nAnd Yes theres more! The moving/aiming system is truely terrible, either be able to move in combat easy but have a locked target which Prioritises creeps and is annoying to change target or be able to target freely but be kinda usless in a fight beacuse you won't know how to strafe or fly backwards. There is no volume options to be found at the moment,  so either have the music loud and turn down your speaker volume or turn off the music all together. Supports do more damage than any other class... :0 And you'll be constintly thinking WHY WON'T HE F**King die because he'll have like 0 hp and your breathing fire up his ♥♥♥. There is no "kill announcer" So you have to press tab everytime to see if you got a kill. "Hmmm did i get a kill, no the FLAMING TOWER AND CREEPS GOT IT AND I DIDN'T GET CREDIT FOR IT!!! "An ally has diconnected" This game has freaking ARAM but no ultimate abilties for the dragons.....WTF. I know your not ment to regen in ARAM but least league of legends supplys potions, but in this you have to kill a dragon to get a potion or get lucky and a creep will drop one. In this ARAM there are these freaking ballistea that will nearly 1 hit you. So if you die and then respawn with a squishy dragon and blink/glide in front of your titan you die again. Now you got to wait another 40 seconds to repawn.\n\nThis is a cool game that has potential but i can't see this game in a postive aspect until major development is done.","September 26, 2014","false","21.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Game is unbalanced as hell, and bug ridden. Every update introduce new unbalanced items and new bugs. Old bugs drag on for years and the devs pay little attention to the quality. The game started on a good concept but was ruined by the developers due to ignorance and incompetence.\n\nThere were 3 maps in the game, 2 of which were rubbish and nobody used to play maps other than the chaos/moba map. Instead of improving the other maps, they would force players to play random maps so the un-performing maps would be played. In addition, the 3 maps play differently, and the dragon/weapon selection would perform very differently depending on the map. This means no matter how much effort you put into this game, the outcome of a match is randomized, depending on which map it puts you into. This gives you an idea of the kind of people they are.\n\nThe dragon and weapon selection is made before entering a game, and before you see any of your teammates or their selections. This means the player cannot choose combos that compliment the teammates. For a moba game this is horrible as players can never find a balanced team. Getting into a game with all support units against all attackers means a waste of 5-20 minutes of time.\n\nThe game had a skill shot pvp system where players had to aim their shots. To dumb it down in a failed attempt to attract players, it was chcanged to auto-aim. So instead of maneuvering and finding an opening to shoot the opponent, players now hold down the mouse button and sit idle until someone dies or escapes. The weapons/dragons that are harder to hit but hits harder, are now auto-aimed just like the easier to hit pee shooters. They were left un-balanced after auto aim was implemented 1-2 years ago. Very little attention was paid to balance the gameplay, as a matter of fact, that there are only about a quarter of the dragons/weapons that provide competitive performance. The rest create useless combos that cause teammates to hate you.\n\nThe game is plagued with hackers and lag bugs. Hackers would speed hack to win. They are reported by various over a year and no action would be taken. As a matter of fact, we would write support/report emails and would not hear answers for months, or ever in most cases. The lag bugs cause problem in gameplay where players take damage from the position they were in 1-2 seconds ago. Thus from your own computer, you'd think you are out of fire range but would still be taking damage. Furthermore, players are harmed by all kinds of invisble fireball, dragon breath that the server decided not to display.\n\nIt is not bad to try out the game to taste the concept of a lighter version of moba. But the game is far from good and the devs are less than competent to bring it up to standard.","January 1, 2015","false","246.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fou_Lou/recommended/263500/","Fou_Lou","Fou Lou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fou_Lou/","365 products in account","Ok whre to start. This Game is quite different from the usual Dotalike games. Its faster and round are shorter with usally more kills.\n\nThe movement system is one of the biggest differences. There is no klick to move to location. Instead the dragon moves forward by either pressing shift or right mouse button. And it is always facing the mouse coursor. Space is used to move the dragon backwarts. There is no sideways movement.\n\nMost skills are skillshot fiering in a specific pattern from your dragon. For example dragon btreah usally fires out of the fron (duh)\n\nIt less complex than other titles because it doesnt have items to buy in a match as you collect gold. Instead your skills will be determined by dragon and weapon choice for a total of 4 skills (two from each) and 2 additional spells like it it done in lol.\n\nThere is a huge selection of Dragons (about 30) and weapons (about the same amount) all of which play somewhat differently. You get 3 random dragons and weapons permanently as part of the tutorial. Other than that you have the usual rotation of free dragons and weapons.\n\nThe forced tutorial is one of the worst parts of the games. You have to go through serveral singleplayer mission + one match against the AI (a quite short one, just explaining the dota like mechanics) if you want to have full access to the multiplayer part. This should take about 45 minutes of gameplay and could be a letdown for some people.\n\nThe game is somewhat pay to win. You can pay for dragons  and weapons(randoms or specific ones) and only radom weapons ad dragons can be bought in ingame currency. Dragons can be upgraded by using 3 Tier1  or tier 2 dragons of the same type. They get some slight bonuses for it. Like 8% less mana cost and 4% more speed. Something about that line. It is achiveable by just playing but it will take quite a long time and you have to be lucky to get the right random dragons. Buying a tier 3 dragon costs about. 45€\n\nThere is a forging system which make weapons a bit stronger (something like 5% more damage, less cooldown, less mana cost) which can be payed for to get it as lot quicker.\n\nAnd there is a rune system. which you can buy runes for with real money. (only random) Of couse tier2 and tier3 runes are available for non paying players too but they take a long times to craft it seems. (about 3 days for one tier 3 rune and one day for a tier 2 rune). Sadly i cannot asses how strong tier 3 runes are in comparison to tier 2 and 1. Here could be the part where the real pay to win could lie.\n\nIn total i would reccoment the game though. Its free and has dragons and it seems quite balanced and knowing the game is more important than bought 20% performance. You have to endure the tutorial though. Which isnt actually that bad.","March 14, 2014","true","18.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Not usually being your MOBA fanboy i didn't think i should try DRAGONS and TITANS for it almost completely offers the same type of gameplay as LoL, Dota and Airmech. Besides it doesn't look that much more attractive to the eye than the formers but hell that's a F2P and it only requires 1 Gb worth of free disk space to install ..\n\nTo my own utter surprise i actually ended up gaining some esteem at least for this game . . the graphics are decent, the dragon designs are fun and nice to look at, the game plays quite fast/smooth and the upgrade system seems to be rather well built. Not an award winner here but yet it's free and won't consume all your disk space. On top of that a campaign mode implying unlockable rewards all over appears in addation to the usual 5 vs 5 rumbles of various kinds all the mobas have become famous for.\n\nQuite recommandable so specially if you have only a basic computer to run your games.","March 15, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The previous problem of it being pay to win seems to be largely fixed, since there is nothing other than cosmetic items that can't be obtained through simple hard work and chance. Even so, even with only three dragons, I'm finding that the game is still fun and has yet to lose any of its playability. The list of different dragons and weapons is long, and each combination makes the experience unique. No dragon seems to be better than another, as each one has its own individual characteristics, and thereforesome are better for certain roles than others.\n\nI recommend the game, and think it genuinely is fun. The developers do seem to listen to the players, and have adjusted the game to not have any exclusivity. Dragons and Titans obviously is not at the level of such games as League and Dota, so it should not be compared to them. However, as far as mobas go, it's a pretty great game to play. At the very least, you should give it a try.","March 15, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

You also get 2 spells to use on long cooldowns.\nWith the standard controls you hold Right click to move, and leftclick to attack with your primary ability. You can use Q W for your dragon abilities, E R for your weapon, and D F for your extra spells.\n\nIf you pay, you can get things earlier than others, stronger dragons, upgrades, etc, but you can earn these through playtime anyway.

Shortly after the tutorial it will pitch a Titan Pass to you. Buying the Titan Pass will unlock all the dragons, weapons, skins, and avatars (all unlockable by simply playing the game). That being said, this game is in no way a pay to win game. The difference between winning and loosing in PVP depends upon your tactics as well as the tactics of your teammates. But if PVP isnt your style then you can join with others to battle some BOTS in a much more lenient, comfortable setting. There are other game modes also, so the game stays interesting.\n\nAll in all im giving this game 9.5/10. Very well made and original. The selection of dragons alone is impressive and this game has more to offer than just that.","February 24, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first starting playing I found it annoying that I was always playing against Tier 3  players w/ Platinum weapons/dragons.. so that's why I recommend the Elite Starter Pack, that way you get 7 dragon/weapon packs. Then you have more options when playing the campaign aswell.  On a side note, I finished Act 4 and didn't get a Autodrake...so hopefully when i go thru the harder difficulties i'll get the tier 2 & 3 dragons.\n\nFound it kinda interesting that they have you take 3 tier 1 dragons to make a tier 2 dragon, and again 3 tier 2 dragons to get a tier 3. So it takes 9 dragons of the same type to get one tier 3. I seem to be able to buy a 3-pack of dragon eggs almost every week as long as you use the Epic war marks on your First win of the day match to get the most bang for your buck. The trick to farming Crystals is paying attn. to the current Quest and switching between PvP and Single-player modes to grind the quest out... (This was easier before the new random map queue system)\n\nHate when the Collossus gets stuck on the MOBA map.\n\nOnce a few more bugs are fixed and some more DLC comes out I think this game will be great! I'm just sayin that cuz i <3 dragons and need a break from LoL every once in a while..\n","September 2, 2014","true","136.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plus skins were a way to show 'Hey, I REALLY like this dragon guys' and to show that through getting a skin JUST for that dragon.

Though I HAVE to admit it DOES get boring after awhile, but the moment you get close to finishing forging your weapon, or close to buying 3 more dragon eggs, or even close to ranking up one of your weapons is when it gets fun. The misc. missions are fun along with the Runes Master feature and the Daily Prizes feature that help entice you to come back and play again. Though, it would be nice if they added a new map, but the game is fun in all ways, for me Single Player and Co-Op are not as challenging as the PvP, but in PvP expect to find a few players whom don't seem to be damaged by your attacks, I think they're hackers, but it could just be their dragon.","December 11, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though this game is by no means boring to play. The is a great satisfaction from gaining new dragons and weapons while also trying to increase mastery of each dragon and weapon. This game offers single player, co-op, and PvP for all player to play as they wish but the best fun is PvP obviously. I hrecommend this game if you are looking for a time killer but want to still have fun.\n\n\nAbove is my original review for this game. Now since they updated the game it sucks big time. Everything cn be purchased with real money so all those hours i spent plaing to forge my weapons 100% is now meaningless. buying dragons and getting random ones doesnt matter since any one can now have a high chance of winning. The effort put into getting stronger weapons and dragons is lost since this is now literally pay to win. it was better when you were actually better because you worked hard for it. I dont recommend this game to anyone anymore, unless they change it back to be a hard grind for power.","January 10, 2015","false","66.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've clocked in my fair share of Draconic combat, and thus far, I've genuinely enjoyed myself. There are most certainly aspects of it that are less than enjoyable, such as certain dragons feeling unstoppable, but in truth, every dragon can be beaten, but it's a matter of how well you play your own Dragon, and work with your teammates.\n\nFor a free title, the game has quite a massive selection of unique Dragons and weapons to choose from, though they are unlocked via random bundle packs that are purchased via in-game currency, called Gems. 3 dragons per hatching pack, 3 weapons per weapon pack. It certainly adds an air of eagerness to earn more Gems to try and unlock more dragons, as well as trying to get lucky to obtain a weapon you may have your eye on. The controls take a short bit of getting used to, but once you're used to them, they're surprisingly smooth, and let you maneuver your way through the skys fluently, while breathing various elements at your enemies, to deter them, as well as throwing out interesting techniques, unique to each dragon.\n\nIs this game perfect? Definitely not. Is this game fun? Most certainly. Is it worth the asking price of 0 dollars? It got me to buy a founder pack, so hell yes it is. It frankly is a game worth trying, before passing judgement, and I don't regret any of the time I've spent in it so far.","June 26, 2014","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And by that, I mean, a LOT.\n\nFirst of all, let's begin with the tutorial. It's one of the worst training levels I've ever seen. You will also get bored of it really quickly.\nThen, I'd like to get into the controls: it's sometimes unclear, and some of the moves have two or more alternative functions aswell, meaning, that we may perform a specific attack without intention. Also, it's a mouse-cursor-following control, which is perfectly fine for games such as Diablo, Space Hack, Magicka or Path of Exile. For this game, I'd be more happy, if I got keyboard-controlling option.\nThe other thing is the characters/abilities. Basically, we have 3 dragons to select (you have to buy the others by real money, but I'll tell more about it later), that has only 2-2 abilities. Then, we have a selectable item, which will provide us 2 more. For a game like this, it feels too few. I know, Awesomenauts also has 2-2 abilities for the characters, but it is still much more fun, and it doesn't feel like if it would need more. Also, as I said before, because of the controls, we may activate an ability by accident.\nThe difficulty: (I'm going to talk about the botmatches) Well, the tutorial isn't really helpful, and the bots can ♥♥♥♥ you very quickly, and then win the moba gamemode. To compare with another game, Dota 2 is also hard, but it doesn't feel that bad.\nThe gameplay: It feels empty and blank. You will get bored in really short time.\nThe largest fatal flaw: One thing, that the game is pay to win. But it really got carried away with it. This is not just "Pay to Win", but "Pay to Do Everything" or "Pay to Breathe". I mean, that you have to buy characters/items for real-money, if you just want to finish a single "quest". And the reward just doesn't worth it. You will feel, that you just wasted your time (and money). If it's "F2P", then players shouldn't be limited down this much. Maybe if we would pay for some exclusive things/quests, I'd say, "OK, let it be, I will still have fun with the rest of the game", but this is like a cruel joke. If you handycap the F2P players that much, then make the game "Pay to Play" each month, and much less players will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nSumma summarum: Dragons and Titans is a huge disappointment. It is a pity, because it COULD have the potential to be a great game. Unfortunately, they didn't make it.","May 1, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to play them through the fun of the story. I love to find great games that have  lores to read (I've read all the lores for my fav dragons and they have incredible creativity, nice job there devs.)\nI want this game to have more styles of a moba like for example dota2 in every match you can't have to of the same heroes and having an entire round filled with direbones or something like that just is wierd.  Otherwise great job with making the game not entirely pay to play as you could sell TF2/ other game items on the community market and get money to buy a dragon skin or something like that. You could also get free avatars by playing the game from a long time ago, what I am meaning to say is that I installed this game a year ago, played it then forgot it for a few months got back and now I have water and fire elementals and gorglot. So not entirely payto play.\nEven fans of dota might like it if you prefered playing Jakiro or winter wyvern. Once again this is a great game what I ask the devs to do is make acts free as I want to progress the story in my own will. One time my little brother saw me play this game and wanted it too. I smiled at that as it would be fun to play with him as we are friends on steam and can invite eachother to our battles. A little while before he got the game it was his birthday and he got an X-box controler. When he played the game he was frustrated with the controls and so I suggested plugging the controller. It worked like a charm he had so much fun pleying with me and I did with him so anyone frustrated with the controls try plugging up your X-box controller up.

Got through the tutorial and decided that I really didn't want to venture into the rest of the game. Was an interesting concept none the less, just not something that I found appealing to my personal tastes.","December 9, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And by that, I mean, a LOT.\n\nFirst of all, let's begin with the tutorial. It's one of the worst training levels I've ever seen. You will also get bored of it really quickly.\nThen, I'd like to get into the controls: it's sometimes unclear, and some of the moves have two or more alternative functions aswell, meaning, that we may perform a specific attack without intention. Also, it's a mouse-cursor-following control, which is perfectly fine for games such as Diablo, Space Hack, Magicka or Path of Exile. For this game, I'd be more happy, if I got keyboard-controlling option.\nThe other thing is the characters/abilities. Basically, we have 3 dragons to select (you have to buy the others by real money, but I'll tell more about it later), that has only 2-2 abilities. Then, we have a selectable item, which will provide us 2 more. For a game like this, it feels too few. I know, Awesomenauts also has 2-2 abilities for the characters, but it is still much more fun, and it doesn't feel like if it would need more. Also, as I said before, because of the controls, we may activate an ability by accident.\nThe difficulty: (I'm going to talk about the botmatches) Well, the tutorial isn't really helpful, and the bots can ♥♥♥♥ you very quickly, and then win the moba gamemode. To compare with another game, Dota 2 is also hard, but it doesn't feel that bad.\nThe gameplay: It feels empty and blank. You will get bored in really short time.\nThe largest fatal flaw: One thing, that the game is pay to win. But it really got carried away with it. This is not just "Pay to Win", but "Pay to Do Everything" or "Pay to Breathe". I mean, that you have to buy characters/items for real-money, if you just want to finish a single "quest". And the reward just doesn't worth it. You will feel, that you just wasted your time (and money). If it's "F2P", then players shouldn't be limited down this much. Maybe if we would pay for some exclusive things/quests, I'd say, "OK, let it be, I will still have fun with the rest of the game", but this is like a cruel joke. If you handycap the F2P players that much, then make the game "Pay to Play" each month, and much less players will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nSumma summarum: Dragons and Titans is a huge disappointment. It is a pity, because it COULD have the potential to be a great game. Unfortunately, they didn't make it.","May 1, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe this is a good game for people new to MOBA gaming. It could act as a gateway for casuals to turn into hard core players. I, for one, enjoy this game a lot. I haven't played much multiplayer (I'm hoping to get to that) but in single player, the rounds are pretty short (Chaos Unleashed takes about 20 minutes I believe or somewhat off). Others may find that a negative aspect of the game but for people like me who play this at school, I don't have an hour or more of uninterrupted school time to play just one match. I wouldn't have wanted to play an hour much either if I had the time.\n\nThe only major issue is that I feel like the game is pushing you to buy a Titan's Pass. You can only do Act 1 (a dissapointment since I wanted to finish the rest to get all the cool dragons they offered). After each match, you gain a painstakenly small amount of Runes which is fustrating because Dragon eggs are 5,000 and weapons are 2,500. About the eggs and weapons, you can only buy cases of three and have to rely on pure chance and luck to get that weapon/dragon you're looking for after countless hours spent just saving enough to get them in the first place. That problem just pushes you EVEN FURTHER to get a Titan's Pass. If only they made it a little bit more easier to earn stuff then I'd be content.\nThe next issue I'd like to address about this game is the Options menu. It's not very advanced. (It's an improvement from the Kong website.) You can't adjust the loudness of the sounds and music. Either you keep it or disable it all together.","November 12, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Giant titans and dragons everywhere. But once you play it, the game is not so satisfying. The PvP matchmaking makes no sense, since you can be matched with players far beyond or below your level, that is just unfair to me, since in this game the longer you play, the stronger you get (as most games thought). The target system is what made my blood boil the most: i can't find out how to switch target at will, being stuck with the "stop attacking to change target" strategy. I also did not like so much the gamemode choice : if you want to play PvP in an unpopular map, you'll have to wait eons for the whole community to pick it, since you can't even choose it at your will.If you want to play a specific map that is not currently being used by the community, you have to play single player, which means just you and AI.","October 2, 2015","false","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
