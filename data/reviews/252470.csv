"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbitres/recommended/252470/","arbitres","Ulris Ventis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbitres/","211 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI felt the need to expand the review, since there was a lot of complaining going on all over the place, from people that have barely played through a tutorial but presenting themselves as able to properly judge the game. There is also a lot of complaining that it's not SPAZ 1.5.\n\nIf you've played SPAZ 1, this part is for you, otherwise you can skip it entirely:\n1. All resource collecting is done on strategic map now, without pointless grind and a waste of time. There is also no limit on resources you can carry, which is great news.\nHaving to watch how ships mine for ten minutes straight was a chore of SPAZ 1 and I never liked it even 1 bit.\nAll that resource micromanagement never added to the game, since after you've lost a battle or it was hard and led to loss of resources, game STOPPED and you would spend next half an hour collecting resources.\n2. Skill trees are gone and replaced with three random skills per level.\nSome will say, that skill trees in SPAZ1 were great, when they were actually not.\nYou had to upgrade a skill to be able to use better tech, and once you knew a cookie cutter build you could easily blast through the game, or got gimped for a looong time if you didn't. Because of this you could never upgrade everything or try everything in one play (and that is an extremely long time). Game could actually punish you for trying wrong and it did.\nSkills in SPAZ 2 are extremely helpful and relevant to the player actually making you stronger, and unpredictable pattern doesn't allow a winning level up in each gameplay. With new content, there can be more skills added leading to more variety, without the need to lock them to a path.\n3. Blueprints are gone. Finally, for the best.\nThat was another grinding aspect in SPAZ 1.\nThere were barely two viable strategies: blow up the station (if you can, huh) to get all blueprints inside, or spend goons to impove relationship and then REZ to buy it (and then get back grinding goons/REZ back).\nWith ship blueprints, you had to destroy a ship a number of times to get all parts of blueprint to unlock that ship. Incredible chore, cause you either had to be lucky, or repeat a mission to get those blueprints.\nIn SPAZ 2 an ingame economy and leveling up gets you better and bigger parts. You protect transporters in order to get better tech, and upgrade bases. And of course you loot enemies for it as well, even on the battlefield, which is great.\n4. Combat is deeper however you disagree with it. Instead of basically an energy regeneration for everything in the game, you now have separate sources to manage.\nEnergy battery can protect your shields from getting down with a boost under heavy fire until enemy need to reload.\nBoost engines allow you to ram through the enemy or get further away.\nEnergy battery allows you to keep firing and once depleted you have to reload, which also makes it impossible to boost up shields or regenerate them if they are gone.\nAsteroids protects you from heavy bombs and enemy fire, while can also be used with a tractor beam to damage the enemy. There are powerups on the field, REZ "balls" that might spawn some zombies and barrels to blow up.\nBattle wagon mode allows to pass weapon controls to AI, which is incredibly useful against small strike crafts, but it uses battery ineffectively which leads to more reloads and decreases survival chances.\n5. Mothership is not smaller ships from previous game, those are still here and they're recognizable.\n\nHow can one describe SPAZ 2?\nHave you played Mount and Blade? Good, cause the idea behind strategical map, factions, captains and other stuff is basically the same.\nEconomy is real, bases produce stuff, ships transfer stuff, captains trade and fight, zombies infect, bandits mess up. Diplomacy allows for alliances, friendship, bounties and so on. You can even share parts and resources if you need to.\nYou can start a proper faction and take over eventually, but it's NOT easy even one bit since there are lots of threats that needs your attention.\nIn combat you manage a number of ship resources to increase performance, and survive as long as possible until you catch an enemy on reload phase when they are most vulnerable, strip off their shields and ram them to death. :) You won't see it in low level fights, but then it gets important.\nShip building is difficult, since parts are hard to find and there's always more you want to install than you can with different strategy involved. In 7 hours I have barely seen any tech at all with 16 level. You can't slap random crap on a ship and win, nope, only in the tutorial.\nThere is nothing in the game that MAKES you waste time on routine stuff anymore and it's awesome!\nYou can attach to you ship a torn apart enemy part on the battlefield any time, or reattach something you've lost yourself. You can even throw it in the enemy with a tractor beam.\n\nThe game is incredible already, since it has solid well planned foundation and it can only get even better in time with the help of developers and mods. I mentioned it before, that there is only one feature needed - LARGER battles with more ships involved. That is one thing I want to see, something like 10-15 motherships in one intense battle.\n\nFor the 18$ it's one of the best purchases I've made, besides the.. M&B.\n\n*Some small fixes..","May 18","true","22.2"," 138 of 167 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","138","167","3","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/youmadbro/recommended/252470/","youmadbro","Ramsis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/youmadbro/","527 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOkay so what can be said about SPAZ 2...\n\nTl;DR: SPAZ 2 is worth every penny. Holy crap it's fun and awesome for anyone looking for a neat new take on a great series.\n\nThe game is great in every area as far as I'm concerned, and I was a huge SPAZ fan from the start. Sadly this account doesn't reflect the years of college that I was playing the game during my down time but trust me when I say I've got plenty of hours invested.\n\nHere's a quick warning:  THE GAMEPLAY IS NOTHING LIKE SPAZ 1\n\nTake it or leave it, it's not SPAZ in any format except some concepts and characters you'll remember. You aren't flying around constantly trying to scavenge REZ so you can have a surplus for purchases, you don't fly one vessel or another and have a hearty upgrade system that allows for full blown customization/focus, and you can't BS spam support-craft every time one of them blows up.\n\nOkay so there, that's my big warning. If you want SPAZ 1 in your SPAZ 2 you're a touch out of luck. The game is still perfect and worth your money, it's just don't come in here expecting SPAZ 1 because you won't find it. I consider this game the successful sequel that used SPAZ as a stepping stone.\n\nSo you start off pretty straight forward, welcome to sometime in the future after SPAZ 1's story. You are now floating on a tactical battlemap with a crap ton of other motherships floating around doing whatevery they want. Unlike SPAZ you aren't the only player getting stuff done, the AI is also going from point to point, harvesting resources you probably want, picking fights left and right, and just causing some general issues in the grand scheme.\n\nMothership. You don't have this giant beast of a ship from the first one, you start off in a crappy clunker that can be upgraded/fixed on the fly. I'm not even joking, the whole gimmick for motherships is everything snaps off and can be attached to random ports on your ship. Got a wing piece that shoots saw-blades? Welp just going to clip off my other wing that's in the way and snap that bad boy on!\n\nEconomy is something this game has. Want to buy something? Hope you have the scrap (the new rez in terms of currency), want to get from point A to point B on the map? Girl I hope you had luck stockpiling a small bit of REZ because REZ is a huge pain in the butt to harvest enough but oh jeez it's so worth it! Goons are back as well, but they really don't impact too much. I often found myself floating with a surplus of Goons and that's not good for your REZ usage but after a while you either stop caring or get half of them killed doing ship repairs.\n\nSo, as one can tell by my hours right out the gate, I was a tester for SPAZ 2. The devs have been incredibly understanding and willing to work around the advice I had given on gameplay and it opened the door for a lot of great additions or changes to gameplay. Try to keep this in mind, if you have an idea or want to push for some fixes be civil and post about it in the community forum here on Steam. They check and they pay attention. I'm not paid to say any of this, they are just some really great guys who want everyone to be happy for the most part.\n\nThat's my review right there folks. You love SPAZ like me so you're eyeballin' SPAZ 2 after a long wait or you're new to the game at which point I'm recommending you play the first SPAZ and try to pick up a copy of SPAZ 2 after you beat it. There is some story that's good to know but you won't get the right footing story wise if you start solely with SPAZ 2.\n\n\n\nSome advice for players:\n\n1: Build your ship length wise. Believe it or not building more DAKKA (firepower) is important over all things. DPS is key!\n2: Sell everything you don't particularly need. Trust me, you'll get way more crap than you'll need parts wise and it'll slow you down!\n3: If you're playing as a pirate make sure you understand your ship's limits in combat.\n4: THIS GAME IS A BROADSIDE BATTLER. One side of your ship should be missiles or support, the other side cannons!\n5: Does the enemy have a sexy weapon you want? Carve it off their ship! Your weapons can damage individual components on ships now and they blow off if they take too much damage!\n6: Yes, you can literally scrap pieces off enemy ships, even when in combat!\n7: Don't be a ♥♥♥♥ if you can't handle fighting. If you mess with someone too much they may bounty you, then you're getting stalked by like 20 AI stronger than you. Be careful!\n8: Save Scumming is okay! Sometimes you'll get into fights where you're boned from the start, luckily the game seems to save before every conflict.\n\nThat's about all I can offer. The game, as I said, is amazing and I recommend picking up a copy or two if you've got a buddy! MinMax is still a two man team after all these years and they put a whole mess of love and effort into this title. I know the wait has been rough for a lot of us and I totally cried after the delay was announced, but it's here and it is an amazing title.\n\n","May 17","true","22.2"," 181 of 231 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","181","231","8","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarkreinsil/recommended/252470/","Aarkreinsil","Aarki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarkreinsil/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played through the campaign and several sandbox games, once without zombies, once with zombies after 60 minutes and once with zombies right from the start. Now after finishing the game again on expert difficulty I kinda feel like I've seen everything, and present my verdict.\nEven though I'm giving a thumbs down now, I've seen what they did with SPAZ 1, the big bounty hunter update, the deployable turrets, all the neat little tweaks and the holiday events, so I'm hoping that SPAZ 2 will see an equally bright future. While I got quite a few hours of experimentation out of it, and while it certainly isn't a bad game, I can't really recommend it in it's current state. Will add some updates to this in bold letters.\n\n\nPros:\n-The combat is nice. While not exactly the same as in SPAZ 1, the tractor beam and reload mechanics, as well as the ramming and breaking parts off of enemy vessels make it possible to utilize your skill and still win against objectively stronger enemies.\n\n-The faction system and starbase ownership make for a neat little minigame and provide some emergent gameplay, too. People come to shop for resources and new parts, every faction has it's own economy and by conquering new territory you get access to better and bigger ship parts, too.\n\n-The bounty and relationship system are pretty nice, they provide a good way of controlling the AI captains and allow you to play the game strategically without having to do everything yourself. Then again not everyone might like playing just with little white triangles, numbers and dots on a starmap. Still, it allows you to put your excess money to good use.\n\n\n-Zombies as a whole can get rather terrifying if you have them around right from the start. As they absorb more captains and territories, they put more and more pressure on the rest of the galaxy and the player, making for a quite unique challenge compared to the first game where nothing really happened unless you progressed through the story.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Customization options are rather low. There seems to be little to no reason to pick anything but shields. Other than for aesthetic reasons, there is no point in building a mothership that is not L-shaped. If you just maximise the number of exposed faces on your cores, you get a lot more bang for your buck.\nStrike craft aren't customizable at all and don't even tell you how much damage they do, they don't have any shields, they are little more than fodder whereas your other ships in SPAZ 1 were much more important.\n\n-Until you get your own faction going, it's all pretty grindy. Joining another faction has little to no benefits except for other faction members sometimes coming to your aid, and getting marginally better deals at their stations. Having your own space station while being member of a faction is almost useless since your income gets taxed heavily.\n\n-SPAZ 1 was player-centric and player-driven. The entire map and game revolved around the player and thusly you could pick your own pace with the game, while also having a pretty usual difficulty curve.\nIn this game here you start as a lowly peasant among hundreds of other captains, and just like in Mount&Blade you are facing an inverted difficulty curve. At first you're weak and poor with everything and everyone being stronger than you. The game world doesn't wait for you, everyone gets even stronger, factions build strength, the zombies are coming and you have to keep up somehow. Once you hit that magical threshold of having your own faction and being stronger than most of the other captains, you can then suddenly faceroll everything.\n\n-The zombies have one downside, though. It's basically just the alpha vs you. Only the zombie leader captures new territories, builds new bases, and most of all, he seems to cheat as he wins every encounter. As soon as you're stronger than him, the zombies are pretty much done for, though. The zombified captains are little more than wild animals, in that they just linger around and look for resources and easy battle opportunities, but they're usually rather weak in comparison and don't actively engage in any conquest activities. As soon as you kill the alpha base, all of the zombies just plop into dust and revert back to their normal captain form.\n\n-There are no side-quests or little missions that you can undertake, except for arena battles. But given that arena battles have you play in a borrowed ship, and that they give rather small rewards, they feel more like a grind than a fun activity. Waiting around for a timer to run down while you harvest resources from the starmap isn't that thrilling either, and you're constantly competing for resources with those 200 other captains and countless bandit squads. If one of them beats you to a node, tough luck but you've gotta wait for it to replenish and wasted your time even trying to get there first. <-Devs want to add mission/event stuff!\n\n-No boarding combat, no cloaking system, goons don't feel like crew but like just another scrap metal resource now. No one gets sucked into space from hull breaches anymore, and you don't get to pull all that lovely rez into your cargohold once you blow up a station or enemy. It's all just numbers now, and feels a little less pirate-y that way. <-Starmap cloaking will be added\n\n\n-Unlike in SPAZ 1, where I've undertaken hard but rewarding little excursions, then have been completely wiped and hid in a corner to mine rez and rebuild, in SPAZ 2 it's really not worth the effort to stick around if the odds are against you. Since you lose all of your ship parts upon being blasted to bits, it makes rebuilding your stuff an impossible chore. Even if you had millions of scrap to spare, you just wouldn't find the same parts in all that RNG-shop-hell again, without waiting around for hours in front of a shop.\nIn SPAZ 1 you kept your ship configuration and just had to rebuild it with rez, so you could always join an unwinnable battle, pick some EXP and blueprint parts from it in a pirate-y fashion and then get whooped.\nEven if you lost all your ships, you'd usually still have made some overall progress and could use the opportunity to tweak your loadout. The same can't be said for SPAZ 2, where it's pretty much all or nothing. <- There will be a part catalog to quickly find what you're looking for\n\n-Research/lvling is just a randomized "Pick 30% more shields/armor or health" thing. Most of the time you don't even get the choices that you need or want, and it can leave you crippled until you suddenly hit that magical RNG roll and get +30% weapon power that enables you to steamroll everything.\n\n\n-You won't get to see all the neat crazy weapons and big, beautiful ship parts until one of the factions/your faction has basically conquered half of the map. You only get the better/exotic weapons (mass drivers, fighter bays, etc.) if a starbase is connected to several others that have certain specializations. So for example one type of map sector gives you better engines. You have to capture 4 of those sectors and connect them to one another with starbases in order to get the biggest engines for your faction specialization. Good luck trying to do that with all of the other factions, the zombies and ever increasing starbase build costs. Once you're at the point where you can conquer enough sectors to unlock all the parts, you'll probably not need them anymore.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo all in all, if you loved SPAZ 1 and if you love some of the more strategically oriented Mount & Blade -like game mechanics, give this a try. If you're looking for a tactical, arcade-style game a la SPAZ 1 or Rebel Galaxy, look elsewhere.\nOr better yet, just watch the developer streams and videos and decide whether or not you like what you see.","May 23","false","45.9"," 123 of 151 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","123","151","0","17"

While there are some faults with this game, I can easily overlook them for how cheap it is, and how much time I believe I'll be getting out of it. (As a rule of thumb, you should always cut 1/4 the hours of someones gametime out, they can gain time being tabbed out or just accidently leaving the game up.)\n\nPros:\n• Star Map is fantastic, it reminds me of Mount and Blade Warband. There are people everywhere with their own motivations,\n• Combat is really neat, but is different from SPAZ 1. Its more broadside pirate-like combat now. Also, being able to ram your way out of a bad situation feels amazing. Your ship parts are VERY important.\n• Built in option for hardcore players to reset via lore-friendly means. Many people like punishment, and this allows that.\n• Game looks very nice, especially when a multi-party battler takes place.\n\nCons:\n• The default controls feel really bad to a lot of people. However that can be fixed: Options > Gameplay > Relative Controls.\n• You can easily outrun high-load missiles, but some NPC's like to just sit inside them and die (Gravity, Zombies, ect.)\n• Ship building can become tiring, especially when you want to replace parts deep in your ship, especially sub-cores.\n• Weapon and Armour Systems can be hard to understand.\n• Strike Craft can feel very useless sometimes.\n• Goon farms are useless later-game unless you can manage to get one to fill completely (getting the 100% bouns) Instead of scavenging for goons, I have to chase bandits because they usually give twice as many goons.\n• As far as I can tell, bandits don't have different ships. I know they're using junk, but at least add some cores and additional junk to their ships.","May 19","true","26.1"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","48","59","0","0"

That's not to say that the core of what made the first game a blast to play isn't there, you'll still be spending many hours blasting away ships of all kinds with a very large pool of weapon choices and traversing a vast map.\n\nOne of the major changes is the world map. Now you are no longer stuck in gated off zones but instead are part of a huge living map where every action you take can have consequences with close neighbours or even across the entire map. Every single ship captain has their own agendas and memories of what you and each other have done throughout the game, some will like you, some will be your nemesis depending on what you can do for them or they for you. Best way I could sum it up even though its still different  would be that the world map feels like mount & blade in space, with lasers. Make and break alliances, work for existing faction or set up a territory and faction all your own.\n\nAnother major change was the move to 3d. On the surface it feels like a huge shift from what Spaz 1 felt like and of course looked like but after a few minutes of familiarizing yourself with the game and the new 3rd person view during combat, the spirit of spaz's hectic fire fights shines through (the devs did leave in a top down camera views for the old school fans). I love the new look with its vibrant colours and ship part styles that, depending on how they are fit together, can give a look of new off the lot or cobbled together to survive. Another huge benefit to the move to 3d is the ship building portion. Each part of the ship has its own stats and effects and its up to the player to build both what they would think works well and to what parts you currently have access to. Want a ship with guns for days? Build it. Want a ship that can turn on a dime? Build it. Not feeling the build you got going right now and want to tune it? No problem, just hop into your ship build menu from the overworld map and rip off parts and socket new ones on.\n\nIf your looking for hours of fun blasting your way through a galaxy that can hate you and love you, looking for that perfect combination of parts to tune your ship into the type of death machine you want to pilot around, I thoroughly recommend this game.","May 17","true","52.6"," 79 of 116 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","79","116","0","4"

Only two days after this games release, much of what really frustrated me about this game has already been hotfixed. That which no longer applies to the current state of SPAZ 2 will remain, but be obfuscated.\n\nStrong Points:\n+The galactic map (where >=50% of game time is spent) is graphically simplistic, stylized, and clean.\nIt’s basically Mount and Blade: Warband, but in space and graphically pleasing.\n\n+Hilarious dialogue and characters\n\n+Both combat perspectives (top down and 3rd person) work well with this game\n\n+In depth weapon configuration\nEither automate all of your weaponry, or categorize your weapons into subsets to truly minmax your offensive capabilities.\n\n+Ship customization/modularity\nWithout a doubt the strongest component of this game. Build a slender corvette with many side cannons, a flat-headed cruiser with an unnecessary amount of engines, or whatever awkward mess you feel like.\n\n\nWeak Points:\n-Leveling upgrades are dull.\n+20% HP, +15% armour, +25% recharge rate, etc.\n\n-Arranging parts in the ship builder is a task for the 7th circle of hell.\nShip complexity correlates with how much hair you have left to pull out while trying to make components click where you want them to.\n\n-Engagements are very unpredictable.\nFrom my experience, when you attack a target you rarely proceed to 1v1 that opponent. You rather 1v3 against his allies, 2v2 with your ally versus him and his ally, or 3v1 him down with your allies. It loosely depends on proximity to allies, but often times allies have flown to my aid from off-screen or ignored my situation when they were right beside the battle. Selecting a wingman helps, but wingmen get distracted easily and still won’t 100% reliably follow you into battle.\n\n\nStylistic Choices I Dislike:\n-Ships always look like block-components banded together with small struts.\nWhile this makes sense in the beginning, when you are literally gluing garbage together, it feels wrong to have an advanced mothership look so cheap and flimsy.\n\n-Enemy HP, Shield, and Armour bars offer very little information.\nThey are the same between very weak and very strong forces. The bars could have ticks that demark certain values (as in League of Legends or DoTA). It would also make sense to colour code them so they aren’t all the same red mass to keep track of.\n\n\nMitigated Issues:\n-Resource management was nightmare-inducing.\nEarly game: you need a lot of scrap, and it is slow to acquire.\n\nMid game: your star base takes care of any scrap needs, but because of your larger ship, excess goons will rapidly deplete your rez stores. You only ever want around your maximum capacity of goons, but you must constantly spend time working to avoid excess.\n\nLate game: when zombies pollute the entire galaxy, all it takes for your crew to be completely decimated is your shields to drop while fighting an infected enemy. You lose many goons to the slightest infection, and the only consistent method to restock them is pitifully slow.\n\nThe easy solution: make goons and rez consistently purchasable at every station.\n\n-Ship infections were too unforgiving.\nGoons die not only in the cleaning process, but also because of the infection’s very presence. If you don’t always carry at or above your max crew capacity, the crew won’t be strong enough to clean a serious infection away. You also won’t be able to save up a large enough force over time, since any amount you find will immediately be killed. In other words, it’s game over in the most excruciating way.\n\nEDIT1: Although you can remove infected parts from your ship to stop the infection from spreading, this tactic only works if your initial infection was minor enough to isolate. In my experience, many ship parts can become infected in one unfavourable incident. The problems are that you can only clean parts while they are attached to your ship, and cleaning parts demands a tremendous cost of crew.\nIf an infection gets out of hand, it’s such a hassle to deal with that I would rather reload a save file than go through the tedium of putting a brand new, far weaker vessel together, scrounging around for enough goons to use as a blood sacrifice for my old infected rare parts, and eventually reconstructing my powerful ship from the ground up.\nThe mechanic would be far less frustrating if:\n1) Fewer goons evaporate in the cleaning process.\n2) You are allowed to pay scrap at star bases to have parts cleaned at no crew expense.\n3) The infection takes longer to spread from part to part, and can only infect so much of your ship in a single battle.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIn case it wasn’t already obvious, this game is definitely not a sequel to SPAZ 1 in terms of gameplay. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as SPAZ 2 has a lot of interesting and unique gameplay of its own to offer.\n\nInitially I would recommend SPAZ 2 only to those who are head over heels about space battles and ship customization, but the devs have already mitigated what were the most frustrating aspects of the game. The game still has some problems and annoyances, but now it is by all means an enjoyable game with a hard-working and responsive dev team to boot.

But it's early access so thats to be expected.\n\nThere's quite a bit of potential but people coming to this game having played the original SPAZ will be very disappointed. It's its own game by its own right but if you enjoyed features from SPAZ such as the things listed below, don't come into SPAZ 2 looking for them.\n\n-Missions: Gone, outside of the main campaign missions the old system based missions and quests aren't there anymore. No more random jobs listed on the system map. So how do you make money you ask? There are random nodes strewn about the galaxy map that you have to “ransack” for resources. This hurts your relations with the various owners of these nodes, but that’s about as similar as this game will get to its predecessor. Instead of the fun options you had previously, which often involved blowing things up owned by people because other people offered to pay you, now the game feels like it can be played entirely from the galaxy map. You’ll find yourself more annoyed than anything to enter combat.\n\n-Combat: The fast passed combat from the previous game has been replaced with slower, smaller scale (Fights are often 1v1 but sometimes up to 3v3) engagements that feel like they take ages to end. The typical fight is just the two ships firing volleys into each other until someone’s shields go down and then that person dies. Strike craft feel nearly useless half the time, unless their equipped with mini-gun weapons, which allow them to kill every missile in the entire instance until they are killed.\n\n-The Blueprint System: This one hurt the most. No longer are you able to reverse engineer other ships and then make them from your stored resources. Now you either buy parts outright (and then have to lug around, which you're penalized for) or snag them from the wrecks of ships you've destroyed or happened upon. While the system is functional it is very frustrating to be unable to use the games new ship creation mechanic to its full potential, as you have to have the parts readily or else you cannot modifying your vessel. This feels like a very odd decision by the devs. They had a very, very good system in the previous game. And this isn’t nostalgia talking. The blueprint system not only added a very fun incentive for combat but it rewarded you in way where you knew exactly what you were getting. The blueprint method allowed you very open ended and free customization of not only your fleet but even the modules equipped on the ships that make up your fleet.  Now, if I want to acquire parts for a vessel I have to buy them, haul them around, clutter up my inventory and then likely sell them when something better comes along, or I just tire of the chore.\n\n-Customization: In the previous game, you could have various weapon loadouts and various fleet compositions that you could modify and adjust to adapt to situations. Even on the fly. This is no longer the case. Now, if you find your missile based combat preference is being countered by a single strike craft shooting down your missiles at an alarming rate (missile rate of fire is so slow jesus), you're only choice is to run. You cannot refit your ships mid battle anymore. Another issue that hampers your creativity is the way parts go together. Noses can only face forward, wings sideways, and engines downwards. This limits ship design heavily. And each of these parts has a weapon attached to them. Which you cannot change. This compounded with the above issues of being unable to make your own parts means half the time you’ll be unsatisfied with your current loadout. With no way to change it as quickly as you would like. You can’t really make a ship specialized without very high effort low reward methods. Needing to stockpile potentially good ship parts for later on feels off. Like this shouldn’t be happening both lore wise and gameplay wise either.\n\nIn conclusion, this game has potential. But as of now there are just too many small annoyances with the game that will chip away at your will to put up with them until you find yourself loading saves and quitting more than actually enjoying the game. Hopefully the devs delay the release and make some changes. Because I can’t and won’t recommend this game until some things are improved or overhauled into fun mechanics, which were readily present in the original.\n\nHere's to hope.","May 20","false","11.2"," 93 of 144 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","93","144","0","22"

Fly around the galaxy, turning your star jalopy into a functioning battleship and surviving in a collapsed economy suffering from the loss of magical zombie poop on which it relies. The controls are responisve and fluid, the art direction is wonderful, and for the most part everything is well optimized. I had to turn down the resolution a bit, but my laptop is teetering on the edge of mid-grade and doing this let me keep all the graphical options turned up.\n\nThe actual gameplay is a bit hard to sum up without quoting the store page- Minmax summed it up pretty well and so far I don't believe they've lied about any aspect. zip around the galaxy at ludicrous speeds via the star map, ransacking people farms and harvesting Rez while trying to stay a step ahead of whoever you've angered lately. That is, until you get bigger guns of course. Once a battle occurs, the game shifts to direct control and hands you your mothership and whatever escort craft are currently licking your boots. It's similar to the ship combat in Assassin's Creed 4, but in space, and with far greater variety of options. It's a bit overwhelming at first, and you'll likely be tempted to turn on Battle Wagon mode and focus on maneuvers and damage control, but once you get the hang of it you'll be switching weapon groups on the fly while using your tractor beam to beat the enemy to death with their own wreckage.\n\nRemember how I said the devs are probably crazy? Yeah, SPAZ 2 is full of black comedy and whimsical stupidity. There's lore and fluff nuggets that grant oft-hilarious tidbits of info along with supplies and EXP; my personal favorite being the one comparing the warp drive mechanism to a donkey being led with a carrot. Dropping out of warp is, of course, de-donkeying. It may sound stupid, and it is, but it had me laughing the first time I heard it.\n\nDon't be discouraged by the Early Access label; so far I've had no bugs at all and the only thing there telling me this is early access is a little bit of missing polish and all the voice-acting being computer generated. SPAZ 2 deserves your love and hard drive space, and unlike most EA releases appears to be in very late beta.","May 17","true","6.0"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","0"

Which is also the reason why my recommendation is a no.\n\nWith the game being released into Early Access I was overjoyed; had been waiting for this since the game was announced. SPAZ 1 was, at least from my point of view, one of the best games in its genre, it had everything I could ask for. RPG-elements, a nice story, good controls and so on. It reminded me of a super-upgraded Swarm (the video game from 1998, man how I loved it) with a better story and gameplay, buying SPAZ 2 was a no-brainer for me.\nFire up the warp-drives, dust off the Space-Zombie eating cannons and put on that cologne for Elza--let's rock this joint!\n\nOh boy...how that joy was shortlived.\n\nTl;drPros:\n+ The story is well done, the dialogue is what makes SPAZ\n+ Galaxy-map is simple and intuitive\n+ Activity (pirates, factions etc.) in the galaxy is fun\n+ Learning curve seems low\n\nCons:\n- Ship customization is lacking\n- Battles and controls need improvement\n- 3D hasn't been able to take SPAZ 2 over its predecessor\n\n\nWell that's that, read on if you'd like to hear more of my opinion.\n\n---\n\nIn generalI was truly missing the game features which made SPAZ such a great game. For example, the whole concept of having a mothership somewhere which warped smaller ships to specific warp-beacons is gone...just gone. Instead you know directly control the mothership while the smaller ships have been demoted to buzzing-space flies which are flying around the mothership as a distraction for enemies.\n\nThe way you navigate has been overhauled and changed to a semi-realtime system where you fly around on a galaxy-map. Engaging in events such as raids will switch back to the view where you control the mothership (or one of the smaller ships). Overall navigation is refreshing and fun, but beware that it might not appeal to you if you're expecting something like SPAZ 1.\n\nCombat and ship controls are really lacking, a 'decent' score at best. Ship controls are sloppy and need improvement, but aren't game-breaking. Combat on the other hand actually is, at least for me. Where in SPAZ 1 I had some sort of awareness of my weapon loadout, in SPAZ 2 I had no idea what I was pumping out of my ship. Sure I could see the weapon's stats, but the descriptions of the weapons aren't all that helpful.\nBattles now feature an option called 'Battle wagon mode' to let the AI fire turrets. The AI respects weapon groups, which is a neat feature.\n\nPersonally I'd loved to see the battle system unchanged from SPAZ 1, but it isn't necessarily a bad battle system. Battles do feel a little...boring when compared to SPAZ 1 or other games in this genre.\n\nDissapointed in the new way of customizing your ship. For me misses the mark by focussing on 'how' (physically attaching ship parts like 'lego') you do it rather then giving you a good feel of 'what' you're going to fly around with. Might be appealing to some, for me definitely a game-breaker.\n\nOverall SPAZ 2 feels like it has a broad focus of game elements, but none really appealing. A lot of reviewers say that this is an absolutely MUST-HAVE if you like and love SPAZ 1, but I beg to differ. To be really honest...I like SPAZ 1 way better and this feels like a serious step backwards. Feels like kicking the devs when they're on the ground (please, no hard feelings), but hiding the truth is worse.\n\n---\n\nFirst up, customizing your shipYour ship essentially consists of 'parts' attached to 'cores'. While this is nothing new, you have to physically attach the cores and parts together like building blocks using some sort of tractor beam. The concept is fun and original, but I couldn't find the added value next to just using a list to select where the parts (or coreS) should go. Some people may like it; I for one think it's fun the first few times, but quickly becomes a annoying chore. Moreover, the controls aren't intuitive and I was struggling to attach the nose of my ship. Might just be my inability to use the tractor beam, but the judge is still out on that one.\n\nTried to love it, but failed sadly. Score: 'bad, could be better'\n\nFrom customizing to controllingControlling your ship is...meh. You'll get where you want to go, but ship handling could definitely be improved. Where 'forward' was the direction of your reticule in SPAZ 1, the same could be said in SPAZ 2. Most of the time I had no 'feeling' as of which direction to press regarding the position of the reticule. Flying is kind-of horizontal, which should be easy to adjust to. But somehow I couldn't grasp the controls that well.\nDon't really know how the controls could be improved, but I'm sure they can.\n\nSloppy to decent controls. Might be inexperience, but then again...I'm an experienced gamer. Score: 'so-so'\n\nEntering the SPAZ-galaxyNavigating around in the galaxy now is a semi-realtime experience. No one moves, except when you do. You no longer travel from system to system but navigate in an ever connected galaxy as an entity. You're sharing this galaxy with a lot of other entities which come in the form of starbases, gathering-points, other ships and so on. Interacting with these enteties is well done and easy to get into.\nThreat assessment could be a bit better though. As a level 14 threat I had trouble with a level 9 threat, something I wouldn't expect. In SPAZ 1 I would've absolutely gone loco on such a level difference, but no way sir not in SPAZ 2.\n\nAll together I think it's a good and refreshing way of navigating around, but I prefer the system to system navigation. Also threat levels could be misleading. Score: 'okay'\n\nBattles, now in 3D! But...While 3D is graphically superior to 2D most of the time, I find that 2D games aren't always inferior in the ways of gameplay. The same can be applied to battles in SPAZ 2 and battles in SPAZ 1. Even though the switch to 3D has been made, the battles are lacking.\nYou can have multiple smaller ships under your command just like SPAZ 1, but next to the mothership, none of the ships can be customized. The smaller ships, now called 'Strikecraft', are just there to take the heat off the mothership, which they do pretty well. They also dish out some much needed punishment of their own.\nWhile going through battles I found myself playing with just the mothership, really had no reason to plas as one of the smaller ships. You might find a valid reason such as hunting a hostile which is faster then the mothership. But since you can also make Strikecraft attack a chosen target, the same reason becomes invalid however.\nDamaging other ships is easy to see when switching on the damage numbers in the options, but I was missing some sort of HUD when locking into other ships. Didn't notice the 'HP-bar' of other ships until my 6th battle or so.\n\nGravely dissapointed in the battles. While some may like it, this was definitely the game-destroyer for me. Score: 'you've been warned, consider watching YouTube'\n\nSadly, already exiting the SPAZ-galaxy as of nowThe game isn't particulary bad, but feels lacking when compared to its predecessor. The whole SPAZ feeling is absent, everything I loved from SPAZ 1 is literally nowhere to be found. This might have been what the devs want, but this also means that you should think twice if you're expecting a reboot of SPAZ 1.","May 17","false","1.4"," 151 of 251 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","151","251","4","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soulianis1/recommended/252470/","Soulianis1","Soulianis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soulianis1/","201 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile SPAZ 2 is quite a bit different from SPAZ it is absolutely an improvement.\n\nGraphics\nIt would honestly be difficult not to make an improvement over SPAZ in this area. The game still has a unique visual style but with more 3d and more camera options. Backgrounds are very similar while weapons and ships are more detailed. Simply put I like the way the game looks. If your expecting something amazing or top of the line you need to see a doctor. A $20 indie game isn't the place to look.\n\nControls\nI have been using the default which is camera relative. I have had no issue using this control scheme but it can be counter-intuitive. There is an option for the more standard ship relative controls. Since you primarily control your mother ship and it can get to be very big it can be a bit sluggish. However, simply using the engine boost correctly takes care of most issues.\n\nGameplay\nI like the living universe idea but I do wish it was a bit more living. The game is designed so that while you are not moving on the galaxy map nothing else is moving. It is nice since I can get up whenever without it being a problem but I have also had to basically fly around in circles for no reason while waiting for conditions to be right. For example, you can select a fellow captain in your faction to be your wingman and he/she will fly to you and follow you so that you have help in more difficult battles. Since they don't move while you are not moving I have had to just fly around so that they will move to me.\n\nBattles are rather quick in this game but not as quick as in SPAZ. Originally you could boost your ship up so much relative to the enemies that it wasn't really a battle at all. The biggest problem in SPAZ was combat becoming meaningless since the enemy did not stand a chance. In SPAZ 2 it is a much more even playing field since you don't have the option of taking a specific weapon type and boosting it beyond the levels of sanity. In my experience so far it seems like ramming the enemy is the best way to win and it is very amusing to ram off parts of the enemy ship. There is also a fun feature in that you can use your tractor beam to throw stuff at the bad guys. There are always explosive barrels or astroids around that you can use.\n\nSpeaking of the wingman ability. I found it frustrating that having one didn't mean that he would actually make it into the battle. When you start a battle enemies will come to help each other and your allies will come to help you. This is great except that there is a four captain limit. So if you try to pick on one guy and two of his friends are faster than your friends you get to have fun fighting 3v1.\n\nMenus/UI\nFor the most part I have no complaints. However, on the galaxy map it can be hard to click on the right thing when there are a bunch of ships piled on top of each other. While playing the campaign there are constant interruptions that always seem to happen right when I am trying to click something.\n\nShip building\nI think it's and interesting feature but you are very limited in what you can do and be effective. Turrets can't shoot through your own ship so building a box and putting wings/engines/whatever inside is a terrible idea as they won't be able to shoot most of the time. It seems to me that the best options are either a nearly straight vertical line or a horizontal line. Though really having a ship that is all engines and noses may not be the best bet.\n\nThe ship building thing can be difficult to work with. I had constant problems with parts attaching in the wrong places and sometimes not wanting to attach unless I turned off the tractor beam and grabbed it again. I also managed to get parts stuck under the ship many times so I would have to leave the ship builder and reopen it. I was just throwing things around to be fair.\n\nOverall there are some QOL changes that will probably be made while the game is in early access but overall it is a rather good game.","May 18","true","36.1"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","39","56","0","0"

However, the dev has stated that this game is essentially finished except for bug fixes, which is why it is in Early Access.  To combat the mass flood of individuals who reviewed this game positively in the short period that they've played it, I will give an accurate assessment of the negatives that I experienced in the short amount of time that I've played it.\n\nFirst, Bad ship controls:  The ship controls in SPAZ were very good.  You could easily assess where your ship was going to go based on the buttons you pushed.  Of course, heavier ships would take longer to speed up and slow down and turn due to the inertia caused by their mass.  However, they still moved based on the player's key strokes.  In SPAZ2... nowhere near as responsive.  In fact, I found the Movement in 3rd person mode more responsive than top-down mode (same mode as in SPAZ).  However, even in 3rd person mode, the ship was nowhere near as responsive as even the largest ships in SPAZ.  This ruined the game for me.\n\nEDIT:  Based on the devs, this issue is due to relative controls being on by default.  From what I read, the "non relative" control scheme is more fluid like SPAZ's control scheme.  I cannot confirm nor deny if it is more fluid like SPAZ's control scheme as I did not get a chance to try out that control scheme as I didn't know it even existed before I got my refund.  If only they had put this option choice at the start of the game (like the voice option), or put it in the tutorial, or just turned "relative" controls off by default then my first issue might not have been an issue.  However, they did not, and that's why it is still an issue.  If it is true, and they can fix issues 2 & 3 before exiting Early Access, then I might buy SPAZ2 again.\n\nSecond, Threat assessment is borked compared to the player:  Basically, if I'm facing a target that has Threat 4 and I am Threat 6, then I should be able to beat that target fairly easily.  Nope, not even close.  In SPAZ that usually wasn't a major issue as you could estimate chance of success based on threat level of an area vs the player's level.  But, I found that not to be the case with SPAZ2.  However, my two encounters may have been because of the terrible ship responsiveness I listed in my first issue.\n\nThird, Bad controls when building the mothership:  Just as the title says, the controls when building the mothership are just, plain terrible.  Unresponsive, doesn't stick half the time, and you can't even tell which slot it stuck to half the time on larger ships with multiple cores.  That system seriously needs to be tweaked.\n\nFourth, This is not in the same genre as SPAZ:  I understand that this was a design decision by the devs, and many people like the change.  I do not however and other potential buyers may not as well.\n\nSPAZ was an arcade space shooter.  It had tech trees that you placed research points into that you gained per level.  It allowed differentiation and builds per playthrough.  There was numbers and icons in combat that showed how close your or your oponent's ship was to blowing up.\n\nSPAZ2 is an X-2 Lite space simulator with shooty combat thrown in.  The main focus of this game is not on the combat but on living in a simulation of sectors of space.  It has a generic tech tree of +%'s in dmg, shields, armor, hull, etc...  There is no real differentiation between weapon types in this game at all.  And, the only indication of a ship's health is shield and health bars.\n\nAgain, if the first three issues were actually fixed at the time of this game's launch (again, "early access" is essentially so they can fix bugs) then I could've overlooked issue four.  However, people need to know the truth.","May 17","false","0.9"," 305 of 526 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","305","526","8","24"

I've put a few hours into Spaz 2 since release and it just doesn't hold my attention like the original did (100+ hours) so I've had to quit playing for now.  I think this is primarily due to spending the majority of your game time on the star map (boring) rather than zooming around in your ship the majority of the time like in Spaz 1.  Many of the elements that made Spaz 1 exciting and fun to play (to me) are absent in the sequel.\n\nFlying around in your ship and blowing stuff up (even the grindy aspects like harvesting asteroids) was still fun to do.  You were in your ship flying around 90% of the time and had relatively minimal interaction with the other GUIs like the star map.  This allows the player to bond with their ship(s) and made it much more enjoyable to see your tiny ship and fleet grow over the course of the game.  Spaz 2 is the opposite, where you spend maybe 20-30% of your time flying around shooting stuf in a clunky environment, and the other 70% interacting with an interface.\n\nI've always felt that game sequels should be 1/3 old, 1/3 improved, and 1/3 new.  Spaz 2 skews that formula and presents an entirely different game vastly different from its predecessor.  The simulation on the star map is now the main feature, and zooming around in your ship(s) feels like a tacked on accessory.  To that end, I feel the game may appeal to those who like simulation games over those who prefered the more action oriented original.\n\nDespite the impressively hard work that's been put into the game, I can't recommend the title since I don't find it a fun game anymore due to the above reasons.  Here's to hoping there's a major overhaul by the time the game exits early access.\n\n","May 19","false","14.7"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","65","105","0","1"

It is clear that the game is not perfect (YET) but is IS NOT supposed to be  SPAZ 1. Also, besides being on early access, just as SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 will be heavily driven by the community.\n\nSo I make a public appeal: If you happened to not check out the developer's demo video of the game that came up before the EA launch and was caught off guard when you realized the game was very different from SPAZ 1, then please, ask for a refund and/or remove your thumbs down.\n\nThis is very important to them because, although they are only two, as I said, the game was always community-driven and the first one had even great mods in which the developers had given a lot of support to the modders. That's why I see a good future for this game.\n\nThe rating should be a balance between the development team, the effort and the game. In the end, all that we paid for was a game that could give us enough hours of fun to pay its price. If you paid for for a Modern SPAZ 1 then it is completely your fault. So, please, don't hurt the development team just because you wanted another game. SPAZ 1 is still out there and very moddable.\n\n----\n\nI really liked the game and I'm still willing to put way more hours into it. What makes me going forward is the ship customization and the will to improve yourself (gunpower, shape, variety, factions etc) which every grind-like game provides. It may not provide this grinding method in the best possible way yet but there is a long road ahead for the developers and the supportive community.\n\nRegarding the future multiplayer, I still hope that it will turn out to have a differently balanced COOP as well instead of just PVP duels.\n\nRegarding the camera and controls: If you want the camera and controls from SPAZ 1 you can actually almost have it by disabling "relative controls" in the gameplay options and using the top-down camera ("C" key by default). The difference is that you can't strafe with your ship (maybe not yet).\n\nThe other SPAZ-1-FREE reviews explained a lot about the detailed features, pros and cons which I mostly agree with all of them so I won't repeat myself as I don't have much time right now, I really just wanted to point out that appeal.","May 18","true","45.9"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","6"

Whenever i want to buy a game before looking up how fun that game is i look up system requirements first and since i have so little informations about rigs i cant decide whether i can run that game or not. People could buy and try the game themselves since there is a thing called refund if it doesnt work properly but some people are lazy to do that so here it goes..\n\nmy rig or one might say "my toaster" is;\n\n- asus laptop\n\n- geforce 610m\n\n- i5 3230m / 2.6 ghz - 2.6 ghz\n\n- 6 gb ram\n\nAs you can see my graphic card is bad. Like not bad but mega bad. My cpu is also bad but considering how bad is my graphic card its not that bad, its kinda meh. And 6 gb ram is not the worst but its not so good either.\n\nSo i can play the game with minimum 35 fps, maximum 50 fps, generally around 38-40 fps by using medium graphic setting and on top that with advanced graphic setting like antialiasing, bloom, detailed textures etc.\n\nNote that, i can lower the graphic settings more in order to gain 20-30 fps boost without losing so much beaitiful graphics.

They can match their rig with mine and see the difference.\n\nOther than that, my english is not so good as you already can see, so i'm not gonna type an actual review. All i can say is, game has a mount & blade feeling in it at some points.

Connect the dots.\n\nThis game may be Early Access, but it is more complete than a lot of "finished" games these days. It's been in development for almost four years. It could easily be called "done" right now, and a larger studio would probably do exactly that.\n\nBut this game is made by two guys, who are active and responsive in the discussion forums, and there have been a half-dozen hotfix updates in the last 50 hours. I grudgingly quit the game to get some sleep late this morning, and when I woke up four hours later there was a new update. They take this seriously. They care about their work, they care about the game, they care about their ART.\n\nWhich is why, just like fans of an insanely popular band, everybody seems to be complaining about this game. It is not another album just like their last one. Just like Marilyn Manson released "Holy Wood" and it wasn't enough like "Mechanical Animals" which wasn't enough like "Antichrist Superstar," or Cradle of Filth released "Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder" which wasn't enough like "Thornography" which wasn't enough like "Cruelty and the Beast."\n\nThing is, all six of those albums changed a corner of the world forever. (Manson has PROBABLY changed a bigger corner of it than Cradle.) And so, too, does SPAZ 2.\n\nMake no mistake: the original SPAZ is a very, very different game. If you want more of that, SPAZ 2 is not where you should look for it, because literally everything is different. And it IS an Early Access game, so there are known issues with things like (at present) the pacing and difficulty and tutorials. "The game really opens up about five hours in," as one of the developers noted, but there is the problem of getting through your first five hours and then there is the problem of the game being... well... outrageously difficult, sometimes. But this is already getting better - by the time you read this, it will be even better.\n\nAnd oh, what a game it is.\n\nYou can tell from the moment you start: it is GORGEOUS. Even if your graphics card is a potato (well, not really, an actual potato doesn't have the right drivers) you'll be able to trade framerate for appearance and the game will merrily chug along at 2fps so you can look at it and say "ooh, pretty." Then you can go into graphics options, jack everything down to the bottom, and your framerate will kick right up to 60 so you can actually play.\n\nMost importantly, IT WILL NOT MAKE YOU RESTART. You can alter all the settings and keep right on going. Plus, in the main menu, there's a big old space battle being rendered as the attract loop, which totally responds to these settings on the fly... so you can see the results immediately, in a common situation where they matter.\n\nThis is, in short, the main menu of a game done so right... it makes every other game look wrong.\n\nWhich is pretty much the core theme of the whole game, but since it is so different from everything else, it will take several hours to get used to it. The jury was still out for me until I had about twelve hours of playtime. I trusted the devs. I saw the potential. But I was not getting the "holy crap, this is AWESOME" vibe from it yet.\n\nAs you can probably guess, I have totally gotten that vibe now.\n\nYou start out with a space battle, and then spend twenty minutes racing through a tutorial on basic ship operations, which you will find was incredibly important and you really should have paid attention because sweet mother of crap in a hat is this game complex.\n\nSo you'll either go into the "Tutorials" part of the interface and review it, provided you paid enough attention to know where that is, or you'll start over and slow down. Then you'll learn that the tutorial only covers about half the interface because there is an awful lot of it and the tutorial was already way too long. (They're working on this. The community is trying to help. They're actually listening. It will get a lot better.)\n\nThe core gameplay basically works like this. You are interacting with a dynamic world on a semi-static map. The regions of space are prearranged and in the same place with the same names every game, but resources are placed randomly within it. And then there are 200 other AI captains on the map.\n\nThe machinations of these captains in their attempt to start and grow five political factions will make every single game entirely different. It's ALL emergent. It's all personalities and connections and networks and a far more detailed economy than any game like this has a right to have.\n\nThat's the "Space" part. Then you get to the "Pirates" part, where some of the captains don't like you and will try to extort money and resources from you. There's a grace period of about five levels where everyone leaves you alone, but then all bets are off and you'll learn just what complete ♥♥♥♥♥ other people can be.\n\nAnd then you'll eventually get to the "Zombies" part, which I won't spoil for you because it's supposed to be surprising and make you go "wtf." Suffice to say the infection starts spreading, and you have to get ahead of it. This is not easy right now, and like most community-involved games it will probably end up being "terribly difficult unless you know this secret that makes it unbelievably easy" in the end.\n\nThe key thing to remember about this game is that between "complex emergent political systems" and "beautiful intricate space combat," the game is pretty much as simple as it can be... but no simpler. There is no "intermediate" stuff. You will have a hill to climb over, and the view from the top is nothing special. But on the other side of the hill, when you get to the "advanced" gameplay, everything is just amazeballs.\n\nOnce you understand combat and the world map enough to know what you're doing, you'll probably feel like the game should be more fun than it is. But you're just getting started. Keep pushing forward.\n\nAs a rough guide, right now, level 13 will be the bane of your existence. (They actually tell you this in the intro, kind of.) The first ten levels will be fine. The next couple will be okay. And then you'll start to sigh mightily about how "grindy" the game is. But once you hit level 20, everything will click - as long as you didn't rush there. Remember that first twenty minutes of tutorial you skipped because it was boring?  Same thing. It's not boring. You need to know this. You need to do this.\n\nAnd when you've finished the campaign... there's sandbox mode. The entire campaign storyline is basically a twelve-hour tutorial for sandbox mode, which is the REAL game. But if you tried to play it from the beginning, you would be so incredibly lost.\n\nPut all of this together, and it's like Minmax have been standing over my shoulder conspiring to make the exact game I personally wished someone would make. Which is more or less what they did with the original SPAZ, too. I just want a different, more complex game now. And this is it.\n\nIf you just want more SPAZ, play more SPAZ. This is better. A lot better. It's like the difference between Grand Theft Auto 2 and GTA III. Quantum leap. Not the same game. Whole new systems. Whole new ideas.\n\nChanged the world.","May 19","true","271.5"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","23","34","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dagnart/recommended/252470/","dagnart","dagnart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dagnart/","311 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a great game at this price point.  If it were $40 I wouldn't recommend it, but it's definitely worth $20.  It's not a AAA title.  It's not a 2d version of the X series.  It's not SPAZ 1.  It's its own thing, and that's not bad, but it does take some getting used to if you come in expecting something familiar.  Beyond a weird sense of humor and a similar setting, the games have little in common.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to pick up and play.  This is almost a con, because parts of the game almost play themselves (the tutorial makes an odd joke about this regarding the combat).  Still, I like not having to worry about complex stats or ship builds.  I can build a specialized rig if I want to, or I can just slap on the best parts I happen to have around.  I'm also terrible at aiming shooters and could never use the cannons in SPAZ 1, so I'm glad those are more automated.\n- The AI captains are well implemented.  The system could be deeper, but it's as deep as it needs to be for what it is.  The player still feels like a special case that has different rules, but it's not too bad.\n- The graphics look like a case of glow-sticks broke open and spilled all over space.  In this case, it works.  It's very easy to tell which ships are hostile and which are friendly.  Too often in space shooters it becomes difficult to tell what's going on when things get clumped up.  Not so here.\n- The AI does a pretty good job of navigating around in combat.  Ships with long-range weapons will keep their distance.  Ships with short-range weapons will do hit-and-run attacks.  AI captains that are outnumbered will try to escape.\n\nCons: This list is longer, but it's mostly more specific, fiddly stuff that I expect (or at least hope) will get fixed before release.\n- It's kinda crashy right now.  It's EA, so that's to be expected.  Hopefully that gets better on release.\n- I wish I had more ability to interact with the AI captains beyond shooting them.  For instance, I can't harvest from AI resource nodes without losing reputation, but they will fly up and harvest from mine and my only choice is to attack them, also causing reputation loss.  It would be nice if the reputation loss were at least context-sensitive so that if they wrong me first they don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me for doing something about it.\n- Some of the elements on the map and on the status screens are unexplained.  I have no idea what any of that stuff on the station information screen means.  I can get lots of data about AI captains, but it's not presented in a way that is useful at all - just long lists of events that read more like debug logs than a UI elements.\n- There isn't a wide variety of parts, or at least it doesn't seem to matter what the differences are.  Sometimes the differences are just confusing.  What's the difference between a laser on the top of the wing and a laser of the side of the wing?  They are called different things and have different icons, but is the only difference the location?\n- The beginning of the game is rough.  I got real tired of trying to grind out enough scrap to buy parts on bandits while the entire rest of the universe seemed to have no problem instantly jumping to 30+ threat while I was stuck at 15.","May 20","true","7.8"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

I was skipping half of my life lately because of this game, i didn`t say i regret it but the game truly feels different from SPAZ 1.\nSo you will get everything just from this pros and cons:\n\n+New galactic system and moving via it is more interesting and developers put more details in it;\n+You can build your ship from a scratch and design everything yourself;\n+Plot. I dont finish the game yet, but it will blow away spaz 1 fans for sure! just love it\n+Atmosphere. The great SPAZ atmosphere is still here and it is even better. Although allmost all the dialogs are syntecized with computer voice(just because of the Early Access).\n+Game is pretty polished for the EA. For all my playthrough game crashed one time because of driver failures(And it`s got fixed on the next day after) . And it is with full campaign which is wow for EA.\n+Galaxy is reacting on your every move and you reacting to it too. You saw how some freebooter steals your scrap or rez field - blow the little shait to pieces!\n+Price. As allways devs dont have any delussions about the price and its very fare!\n\n-Combat system. I enjoyed spaz 1 dynamic combat system much more that spaz 2. All this thing with design and new weapons and how they work and damage is only now starting to reveal its secrets to me(only when i got to the late game,although it is allready very painfull and costly to change all the ship =( )\n-Look of the "support ships" and your ship in generally. So all th ships that you knew is just support ships for your mothership, and i totally disagree with what they do to them...in spaz 1 when you getting your first TUG it looks tremendious. And what about when you see Hook or battleship class ship for the first time! Here? Well it looks like a tetris box titles. Dissapointed.\n-And from the previous one you get this - the look of your mothership and its controlls. Mothership dont look "cool" or "beatifull" in any way. i guess thats what you can get from post-apocalyptic world where everything is made from scrap, but still... and i understand that this is no common class ship - its MOTHERSHIP, but the controlls of it is something confusing...\n-Battles are no more that big, there is only 4 "players" that can be in battle which is 4 motherships + all the support ships. Yes sometimes its more then enough, but sometimes that feels castrated.\n\n+\- Grinding. Oh yes its still here, though it is a little easier to grind but harder to get good details when you go to the higher tier.\n+\- They removed and added a lot of things. Removed assault shuttles which is sad, but added a lot of things like badass flying shurikens,which is mauling and ripping enemy ship apart!\n\nSo thats it. Maybe i add something that comes to mind later, but for now its like this...There is still a lot to do, like add some game start options and else and yes the game feels different from the first one, but i still want to support the devs because i just like their work. They do a lot of innovations to spaz and not everyone going to like it of course. I hope and know it will get better as time goes!\n\nBuy the game, try for yourself. its still pretty good for common indi that you can get for 10$.

You don't just 'jump in space go-cart and shoot everyone' because their faction willl dislike you. They may come back for revenge. you may end up with a bounty on your head. you might get yourself blown up and have to start again rebuilding your ship!\nSeriously! Who else has that?

I really didn't think I'd like it after watching the EA lets plays and was actually nervous that I'd have wasted money... but I wanted to try it to see if I could learn to love it and oh dear fragging gawd do !!\n\nI have my ship rigged with cannons on the one side and missiles on the other so I can cut shield off, then skin their components off with a single sweep!\nI joined a faction and managed to single-handedly over-take a quarter of the galaxy with them!\n\nI may have p!ssed a few people off... judging by the size of the bounty they put on me... but when one of the hopeful hunters appeared, a total stranger turned up to help! I was so happy that I had to send them a little money just to make sure they stayed on my side in the future!\n\nStation taxation, fuel consumption, crew-size, weapon power-cost, damage ratios, damage types, weapon placements and firing arcs, ship design, part scructure, diplomacy, warfare, ingergalactic infection, bounty hunting, resource management...\nAll these things were so daunting to me... but I'm doing them all second-nature because this game makes it simple to understand!\nIt's a wall of terrifying information... but once you do it one at a time, you're actually doing it as if you were meant to do it!\n\nThe campaign has been described as a great big tutorial. Ease you into the features one by one... I have to say, I'm looking foward to completing it just so that I can do a sandbox and see where that goes!\nThis game is wonderful... truly wonderful and as such, it plays like a dream from all angles!\nEven my biggest complaints are petty and inconciquential as the rest of the game has so much to do!\n\nThis game is in early access as it stands (I will update this review as things unfold) and I have not seen this level of Developer presence on the steam forums before!\n\nRemember, Minimax is a tiny company! But this game is the kind of thing I expect to see from the heavy-hitters!

Her artwork is gorgeous and her sense of humour is wonderful!\nCurse you minimax for making the woman of my dreams XD\n\nI have often said that 'programmers make bad games' (there's a long explanation I'll spare you'\nYou get people who think like programmers and people who think like gamers. Those who expect you to be able to understand XML and PHP because they do are pretty annoying when they make a game because you have to know what they do just to play it...\nGamers make good games (again, more explanation you're getting out of...

It's not SPAZ 1, if you want SPAZ 1, go play SPAZ 1.  If you look at SPAZ 2 with open eyes, it's a different game, with different mechanics.  If you want to move house, get a big van, if you want to drive fast on a race track, get a sports car.  If you just want SPAZ 1.5, just get SPAZ 1 with some mods.\n\nSPAZ 2 is still in early release, but the dev's are working solidly to fix bugs, they've released 4 hot fixes in the last 24 hours I think.  I'm half expecting their families to go on strike, they'll not have seen them in months!\n\nThe game: You're in charge of a space ship, and some nasty zombies (the Z part of SPAZ), want to spoil your day.

It's probably fun if you're looking for a third-person-view spaceship battle game, but if you were hoping for the chance to construct your own custom fleets and specialize your tech in any direction other than "level up for +15% weapon damage, OR +20% shields!", then you should give this one a pass.","May 17","false","2.2"," 80 of 142 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","80","142","3","6"

The lore, the descriptions, the funny conversations and the great art, and also the hilarious voices. I do feel however that some of the detail that went into the ships in SPAZ 1 went a bit lost in their translation to 3D (here you can use them as strike craft/large fighters for your mothership during fights), but it's not too big of a problem.\n\nThe combat is fun. Since you're controlling a mothership now instead of strike craft, turning and flying around is a lot slower and requires more thinking ahead. You can obviously get your hands on better parts if you want to improve this. I do wish they will add more traditional top-down controls, where A/D rotates the ship and W/S thrust/brake the ship, right now instead of behaving like that it simply thrusts into the respective direction which is sometimes a bit hard to use when you have something specific in mind (such as ramming a ship). Some of the weapon effects look a bit questionable (machine gun fire looks like a beam).\n\nEDIT: The relative control mode in the gameplay options will make A/D turn your ship and W/S throttle your thrust, just as I wanted above!\n\nThe whole captain thing is awesome and seems to add a lot of dynamic to the universe. Some pesky high level captain out there keeps running into me and demanding me to surrender goods, so after the second encounter I decided to put a hefty bounty on him and he told me "thanks for nothing", made me chuckle. Another time I engaged in a fight I could not possibly win, but then suddenly some captain joined me while some other captain joined the other guy as well, it turned into a pretty grand fight we eventually ended up winning. It doesn't come without its flaws though, one example is where you join other captains in fighting bandits: the bandits are usually destroyed before you even get to them, but you still receive positive relations with that captain for doing nothing at all.\n\nI also think that the solution to grinding (by just making resource collection happen "instantly" on the starmap) is great. I do feel that the galaxy is a bit small though compared to how big it could be in SPAZ 1, but maybe this was a necessity due to the way things are simulated (it's really a living and breathing universe), contrary to SPAZ 1 where things basically only happened from sector to sector, it does however somewhat reduce the exploration aspect of the game.\n\nThe arena challenges at star bases are also still very fun to do, I do however feel that their SPAZ 1 counterparts were more varied and balanced. Here the balance is a bit of a hit-or-miss, sometimes when going one tier up in the ladder it suddenly becomes impossible to beat compared to the previous one, so you will have to level up a bit and try again later. I think the potential in SPAZ 2 for more strategic/fun challenges is definitely there, but it's not being put to full use from the ones I tried so far.\n\nI have mixed feelings about ship assembly. Don't know whether it will change later in the game, but it is rather really hard to make your ship look good because you often end up buying a mix of different types of parts from different factions. In terms of expansion you also just have two choices: either make your ship longer, or make it wider. Doing anything fancy will be inefficient because you will lose potential mounts for equipment (ideally you get two additional ones for every sub-core you attach, so a line is best, next up is a cross).\n\nEDIT: It seems that getting a lot of scrap becomes easier later on, so getting the right parts becomes much easier in turn as well for making the ship look cool.\n\nThe interfaces look very good and polished, especially the lore section is just awesome. The trade menu is very nice, but the part -stats aren't really obvious on first sight and I'm still not sure how I can easily compare differences from my former parts with newer parts (it does seem to show this for strike craft though in their menu). Fortunatly there's also a legend that tells you what icon means what, I just think however that this could still improve, for instance by giving DPS an own icon instead of putting it in the title and other little changes.\n\nThere are probably many more things to tell about the game, but best is to try it for yourself, however don't expect exact the same gameplay as in SPAZ 1 because it is definitely different.

Comparing things, for example, is nigh impossible without memorising a myriad of stats on two items.\nIt also does feel a bit grindy from time to time, so more ways to get experience (like quests with some stories behind them) would be very welcome. Not that there's nothing to do, it's just those things start to feel a bit too familiar really quick. And it does takes some time to get to building your own empire.\n\nAll in all, it's a really good game: it's different enough from SPAZ1, it offers some new cool mechanics, it's bug-free (literally encountered zero bugs during my playtime) and once you get to the empire building part - it starts to get really fun.\n\nWatch more in-depth first impressions in the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/O-amY2FM2Gc","May 17","true","7.3"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","2"

If that's all you care about then this probably isn't what you want.\n\nSPAZ2 is an evolution of the game play in the first one and makes several critical changes.  In this one you are the mothership, a highly configurable mothership, with a variety of ARPG-esq loot.  The combinations are pretty staggering and I've only really played with one type of setup in my first game.  This modular system is great if you enjoy building and configuring your own ship, while upgrading with new/better loot found throughout.\n\nThe combat initially seems smaller, but once you've got a full complement of strikecraft while fighting several other captains simultaneously the battles get quite hectic.  You can play a few bouts staying away from the enemy with sniper cannons and drone fighters, but later on I was a laser and cannon junkie.  I especially liked taking their shields down and then ramming their engines to rip them off the ship.  The AI is decent here and I lost quite a few confrontations when they decided to gang-up on me when my shields dropped.\n\nThe story mode has the same flow as the first one.  You start out a nobody captain fighting bandits to get enough resources and experience to advance.  Later on you're part of a faction, fighting their enemies, and making a few of your own that will likely last the duration of the game (assuming they aren't zombified later).  The final part has you running your own faction, while recruiting captains you've made friends with over the course of your game.  That's when you get to take on the zombies or they take on you depending on how it goes.\n\nMy only real complaints are that the tutorial seems to go on forever.  You can't really do or see much of the game while constrained to just the first 10 levels so if you don't persevere the game might seem rather boring.  I also leveled up passed 40 in my story game, which meant I was capped on the number of sub-cores I could get, but this was probably just me wanting to supplement some drone parts along with my lasers/cannons.  Finally, replacing inner sub-cores with better loot later in the game is mildly annoying having to remove all the parts and then reconnect them piece by piece.\n\nOverall I find it quite enjoyable.  Now on to sandbox mode...","May 24","true","33.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Between then and today I have been working full time, working out occasionally, eating, trying to pay some attention to my SO, and a whole lot of not sleeping. I think it is fair to say I like this game.\n\nOn the Devs:\nI found a bug where I lost my Star Base after a defensive fight when I didn’t lose the battle. I submitted that to the forums. Within a few minutes I had a response confirming that was a bug and not an angrymaking “feature”. I submitted the bug following one of the 2!!! devs instructions. I got a near immediate email response stating that he was working to reproduce it and had a few follow-up questions. I answered those questions. 15 minutes pass and I get an email stating that it was definitely a bug and outlined what they needed to do to fix it, then he asked what I wanted to do about my save game. I suggest he load my character up with in game currency, a bounty like those given to the people who identify flaws for Google or FB get. He agreed and another 10 minutes later I had an updated save file in my inbox.\n“Wealthy.sav”\nOpen up the game and my new save game has 50k scrap on it. I go on about my merry, and richer way, two hours later I download the newest patch which notes a fix for my bug.\n\n10/10 would support these devs again. Thanks for the great customer service!!\n\nOn the Game:\nI really like this game. I played around 90 hours on SPAZ 1 and since that joyous time have been waiting with baited breath for SPAZ 2. I have been on the MinMax forums and following, with relish, the developer notes for SPAZ 2. So I had a fair idea of what I was getting into. Forewarned is forearmed so to speak. And I absolutely love the way the game feels. I was worried initially how the 3D aspect of things would work but I love the complexity it adds to the game. RAMMING SPEED, ENGAGE!\n\nThere are definitely things I would like changed (or perhaps I just need to find them) in this game, for example:\n•	I feel like there isn’t a big enough of a drive for other factions and unaligned Captains to not pillage your resource nodes in your territory.\n•	I would really like to be able to call for help when/if I get jumped by a sadistic strong captain when I am weak.\n•	I think captains, after getting murdered, get back to near full strength really quickly. Though maybe the threat measurement is just off because of their level?\n•	I think that there should be some stratification of captain ship layouts, IDK if I haven’t just seen this yet, but I don’t think all captains should just use as many cores as possible. I think it would be really cool if some captains could have different battle behaviors and for example, go for few core, highly agile, highly upgraded ships as opposed to big hulking monsters.\n•	Economic indicators / more clear explanation on how trade lanes work ~ like how the focus of the Star Bases you build (shields, armor, etc.) impact the part that the Star Base is good at generating.\n\nI would like to note that all of the above suggestions are mostly nitpicks. I don’t have a single issue with how the game plays because this is a solid goshdarn game! I don’t even know if all my requests need to be requested. I have only gotten 24 hours in! I guess my only real gripe is that this game suffers very much from the same issue that Civilization suffers from: the notorious “just one more turn/thing”. My place of employ probably doesn’t appreciate the contribution my sleep-addled self delivers quite as much.\n\nTL:DR\nGet SPAZ 2. Live SPAZ 2. Love SPAZ 2.

Watch the video's and see if it appeals to you otherwise you may be disappointed.\n\nWhile it is an early access release, the single player portion is largely finished except for some placeholder voice overs. Balance refinements are also likely. The game is fully playable though, you won't get half way through and be stuck waiting for more content to be made.\n\nThe game is a mix of strategy and third person battles. The strategic gameplay occurs on a map where you gather resources, engage enemies, trade, join a faction or build your own and tax traders who use your starbases. The AI consists of 200 individual captains that can do everything you do including getting annoyed and placing bounties on you that other neutral or enemy captains will try to collect.\n\nThe battles occur in an arena and are semi-3d. The capital ships all move in a plane but can tilt so weapons mounted on one side can fire across the other while at the same time exposing your weak internals to enemy fire. Ships are made up of parts that can be destroyed or broken off by shooting or ramming. Damaged parts can be picked up and attached to your own ship during battle. The battles are deceptively complex. They appear simple at first but as the game progresses you need to develop new strategies to deal with more difficult threats.\n\n","May 17","true","45.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

Procedural generation and AI captains who have their own relationships with everyone else make the experience unexpected and offers a wealth of emergent gameplay.\n\nThis is not SPAZ as we knew it, but an entirely different animal. While the general framework of its predecessor is still there, nearly every aspect of the game has been refined.\n\nThe basic framework is still there. You collect resources and gradually gather in strength. You choose your friends and enemies (although, at times, the enemies choose you). You explore the universe with the returning zany cast and try to be ready for when the zombies happen.\n\nThe collection of resources happens at nodes. You compete for them with dozens of other captains, and later on, with other factions. Gathering from a node that belongs to another faction gradually makes them more hostile against you, and you need to balance your need for fuel, scrap metal and crew against the imminent threat of being blasted with hot laser fire. Fuel especially (to my knowledge) can't be acquired in large quantities anywhere else but the nodes, which makes your survival dependant on repeatedly stomping on people's feet.\n\nNothing happens in a vacuum. In SPAZ 1, the warp gates created isolated systems that had no idea what happened in a neighboring system. You could loot and pillage to your heart's content with no repercussions as long as you could deal with the forces at hand. In SPAZ 2, all the systems are connected and you can freely move between them. You, and dozens of other captains. They can be allies or enemies, depending on what they see you doing. Some of them are a lot stronger than you. If you ♥♥♥♥ them off, they will start hunting you down and demanding painful tributes. Paying it will improve your relations by a bit, but usually not enough to make it a viable way of making them stop pestering you. You need to manage your relationships and immediate needs for resources carefully.\n\nThe factions quickly fill the map with their outposts, and when border friction happens enough, they go to war. You need to assess which faction to throw your lot in based on their relative strengths - one might be weaker, but offer different options in technology. One might be stronger, but you happen to be on the kill-on-sight list of a dozen of their captains. You can also alter the odds by giving out bounties on strategic targets, but resources are at a premium. If you're enough of a jerk, expect said bounties to target you.\n\nThe humor and the vibes are still there. The game has lore nodes that mainly focus on the events of SPAZ 1. Truth to be told, I skipped most of the lore sections and dialogue of the previous game. What I've seen will likely be pretty hit-or-miss for most people, but there are some downright hilarious sections of dialogue - all set against the self-awarely grim portrayal of mankind's potential bleak future. There is an interesting, overlaying thought experiment concerning how people act when dangerous, groundbreaking technologies or resources are discovered.\n\nCombat gameplay has changed to be almost unrecognizable. While SPAZ 1 brought to mind twin-stick shooters and arcadey gameplay, SPAZ 2 gives you a big customizable vessel that - at it's worst - handles like a whale. This makes the combat more about maneuvering and blasting frontsides at opportune moments. You can target your weapons quite accurately, and if you focus on an enemy hardpoint, you can blow it off. Seeing what the enemy is using and what's causing you trouble, then getting rid of it with well-aimed volleys of cannon and laser fire, is immensely gratifying. Of course, the enemy can do the same to you. It's a singular feeling to be feeling victorious right up until the moment your engine block flies off and you scramble to grab it back with a tractor beam. It can be hectic, especially with a lot of strike craft buzzing around, but it's a more measured and a slower experience that fans of the first game might be expecting.\n\nAll in all, I can't say enough to recommend this game. It's relatively cheap for the amount of content it offers, even in state of early access. Oh - and they're talking about versus multiplayer. So there's that. It's not in the game right now, and the developers have asked you not to buy the game for multiplayer until the feature is fully realized. But keep an eye out.","May 18","true","8.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cracatoa/recommended/252470/","cracatoa","cracatoa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cracatoa/","463 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have nearly 7.5 hours into SPAZ 2 now, and the initial excitement of being back into the SPAZ universe has worn off...no, it has sadly died off almost entirely.  Luckily, I can still install and play SPAZ and enjoy something truly unique, challenging, and fun.\n\nSo, here comes my breakdown:\n\nGraphicsI have no problem with the graphics.  They aren't stellar, but I look for gameplay much more than graphics.  The ships are pretty bland, particle effects and models are reused (or at least very similarly duplicated) throughout the game, and the map is pretty basic.\n\nControlsOnce you get it out of the default "Relative Control" setting, the controls are fine.  Why they chose to set the default to something so awful is beyond me, but it is in Early Access.  Hopefully they'll get that fixed.\n\nMechanicsThere are 2 categories here:  Sector Simulaiton and Flight/Combat Simulation.\n\nSector simulation is fine, and actually the most interesting component of the game.  Having allies, enemies, neutrals, bandits and zombies contribute to the dynamic of the Sector Map is great.  Trade and resource gathering seems alive on the surface, but there really isn't anything to it other than the graphical representation of ships going back and forth.  There are no real commodities other than Goons and Rez, and those are essentials to flying your ship and act more like a staple.\n\nThe Flight/Combat Simulation portion of the game is awful.  The worst parts of Star Control are poorly meshed with Independence War.  There are a hodge podge of preset weapon groups (which are changeable through the options menu), but the game flatout tells you that the Battle Wagon (automated targetting and shooting by the AI) mode is the preferred and most efficient method.  With no good range indicators for each weapon, it is best to leave the computer to handling the weapons system.  Combat turns into endlessly flying around into position and watching things explode, broken up time-to-time with the need to "boost" your shields to mitigate damage.  Other than the shield boosting, the interactivity of the Combat Simulation is barely more intriguing than a Cow Clicker.\n\nContent and ReplayabilityThe Sector Map is relatively small compared to the prior entry from MinMax Games.  Aside from laying out your ship differently, the options for weapons and components are severely limited and many of them feel utterly unnecessary.  That is perhaps just a balancing issue and can be resolved before the game is fully released.\n\nStabilityI've had no issues whatsoever with stability.\n\nContinuity from PredecessorNearly non-existent.  Beyond the lore and theme, the game is a completely different game.  They are cashing in on the name, which is fine.  If only the game was fun beyond nostalgia.\n\nConclusionReinstall SPAZ and enjoy a great and unique space sim experience, and then lament over what could have been.\n\nThe devs have posted a few positive comments about making some changes and adding content.  Based on how wonderful they were with SPAZ, I believe them.  I think that my review of this game will change a good bit once it leaves EA, and I am hoping that will be in the positive direction.","May 18","false","7.3"," 40 of 70 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","40","70","2","4"

I've edited the review to reflect this.\n\nedit 2: I've been told its "completely different" from spaz 1, I disagree. Make of it as you will.\n\nSPAZ 2 takes the idea's of SPAZ 1 and builds on them, with an improved interface and a cool over-world "space map". If you liked the ship building and fighting SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 takes that and brings it to the next level with a fully modular ship-building system. Gone are the hardpoints and hull types... In is a fully custom shipbuilding.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fna-9fmMyYE\n\nText:\n\nSPAZ 2 comes into Early Access as a pretty solid core experience, though the multiplayer is still completely missing and the game has a ton of work left (especially in the sound department and voice).\n\nWhere the game shines is the core ship-building and ship-combat action, and when I say the "core" I do mean that, there is a lot of stuff left to build on like more modules, more interaction in the combat with the environment and stuff like that, but what is there, is damn good.\n\nWhere the game lacks though is explaining itself and providing a sandbox experience for the player.

It is my humble opinion that SPAZ 2 has done just a tad too much of the latter. I have 140 hours in the first SPAZ game, and what I was looking for here was new story, new enemies, more ship hulls, and maybe some multiplayer.\n\nBut instead I just got some kind of.. weird.. glowy.. 3D thing. The magic is just all gone.\n\nControls seem flimsy and unresponsive, like I'm flying an empty cardboard box. They changed the combat to be all broadside combat, but there really was no reason for them to change that. SPAZ 1 combat was excellent. The camera is super not great. The new "over-the-shoulder" camera seems pretty unpopular in the community, and completely unnecessary. When using "classic" camera mode (aka. top-down camera), it's impossible to see anything. I have no idea where my ship ends and the blackness of space begins. Wingmen wander away too far and don't respond quickly enough to enemies.\n\nThe list goes on. But for the purposes of this review, all that really matters is that this isn't SPAZ 1. Maybe you're okay with that, and if so, go ahead and give it a shot, but I'm not. I wanted more SPAZ 1, and not only are there more differences here than similarities, but the things they've changed just feel.. hollow.\n\nI wanted to like it, but I just can't - not the way it is now, and unfortunately I think they've spent too much time going in the wrong direction to be able to salvage it, at least enough for me to get into it.\n\nSorry devs, I really am.","May 18","false","0.7"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","33","58","0","1"

I HAVE NOT PLAYED ENOUGH CAMPAIGN AND LEARNED ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM SANDBOX.\n\nThis will be my first review after waiting 2 years for this game to come out. Possibly the most important thing is: DO NOT COMPARE THIS TO THE FIRST ONE. That will be a death sentence.\n\nThe game takes a few pieces of the first and molds them into something completely different in this game. If you want to somewhat compare it of something, it has some similarities to Mount and Blade. Mostly due to factions and recruiting captains and such.\n\nA lot of people will give the game ♥♥♥♥ for its slower pace and the big change it made, but I think it's for the better, but that's just another opinion. At first, I hated this game for the first few hours because it felt so different, but then things changed bit by bit over time once I started to understand more and learn about a whole new game.\n\nI will first list what I find to be problems that should probably be fixed soon, then I will list pros.\n\nFirst:  I feel like the early access in this game is more than just for multiplayer purposes. There are a few things that I feel need to be changed, one of the biggest issues being the extreme lack of REZ in the later stages of the game. REZ is used to have your ship move faster. There are 3 available movement options ranging from slow to fast. Slow usually takes up 0 REZ, but later takes a little bit due to heavy amounts of goons and weight. Normal takes a low amount of REZ, while fast can consume 3x as much REZ (If not that exact amount). I only played the campaign for about 2 hours, so I can't say if it lacks as much, but it is a big problem in sandbox for the time I've played it. Your ship ends up consuming much more REZ than you can find and you'll often find yourself sitting around watching your ship slowly move to areas.\n\nSecond:  Ramming in the later stages. (Didn't know about it early on so not sure if it's good there) When you build up a tanky enough ship, you can just ram the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of people. This is super fun, but absolutely annihilates hulls. It's not so effective on shields, but when you have your shield up and ram an unshielded target, you can quite literally 1 shot them depending. You can also ram starbases to destroy them quickly, which is somewhat annoying but I like the mechanic a lot.\n\nThird:  The AI are stupid. Now I don't mean when you're in a battle; they just do what they can to fight you and I don't find it to be an issue. But the AI on the starmap; they are stupid. After building up a base of my own and recruiting my own captains it showed over time that they don't exactly have the smartest mind of their own. This is mostly because they're one dimensional as they will see someone from their team being attacked, and quite literally every single one of them will rush to their aid, but when the battlefield is full, they'll go about their usual business. OR they will all rush to another target that's being attacked, and the cycle continues. This is mostly an issue when you have a somewhat bigger faction of your own.\n\nFourth:  The choices you can tell your captains to do. These are extremely limited. You have Set Wingman, which will have them follow you around all game if you like no matter what you do, and that's it. You can't tell them to raid a starbase or attack/distract their leader, only to follow you or stop following you. You are also limited to 1 person following you at a time. Which is a good thing, because if you were running around with 2 allies at a time, you would probably win every single fight.\n\nThere are a few other minor things that I don't think are really worth mentioning, so on to the positives. These will be a bit more quick than the my semi-detailed cons.\n\nPros:\n-Variety of parts is great and making your ship while figuring out how you can optimize or make it interesting is fantastic.\n-I only played normal and it seemed well balanced for most of the game (until I just got way ahead of everyone), so I can only imagine what the harder mode is like.\n-Ability to start from scratch when you die for the hardcore and masochist players out there.\n-Very good "takes time to do things" system. Want to salvage things from the enemy you just killed? It will take some time and you may be attacked by someone that doesn't like you. Want to ransack a REZ deposit in a faction's territory? It will take some time and you'll probably die to the areas owner!\n-The zombies are fun, but can be overwhelming if you're not prepared for them.\n-You are meant to struggle, take risks, and hope for the best in the early game. Not taking risks will slow your progression heavily. I enjoy this concept although you CAN abuse auto save and quick save to try and get the best outcome.\n-Trading is great. Everything will be more expensive in places that don't like you, and things will be cheaper for people that do like you. Equipment will be much cheaper when you buy it from your own faction or the faction you create.\n-Also on trading: Replacing parts of the same slot requirement will replace that part automatically, as long as you sell that part with it. Example: I want a subcore system to be replaced but it's in the very freakin middle of my ship and I'll have to tear my ship apart to add the new one. Not at all! As long as you select the subcore you want to buy and the one you want to replace, it will replace it once you trade.\n\nMy overall impression of this game for the hours I've played it is probably an 8/10. Definitely recommend it as an overall game, but if you're here to re-live your SPAZ 1 life, don't bother.","May 20","true","22.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","1"

I was expecting more of SPAZ 1, but this is a vastly different game. It's a solid game, but there are a few things minmax really need to work on. I'll try to distill the essence of the game and give a few recommendations.\n\nThis is vastly different from SPAZ 1 in that it focuses on empire-building. This game feels more like M&B Warband in space (M&B is one of my all-time favorite games). You can build your own empire, cultivate relations with every single captain in the game, capture systems, wage war, upgrade your stations, form alliances etc.\n\nHow else does it differ from SPAZ 1? You only ever fly a single ship - the mothership. Gone are the unlocks and the feeling of major progression; instead we have a modular mothership. The modularity is fun, but the actual implementation of ship-modification is very tedious.\nShips from SPAZ make a comeback - the gimp, right hook etc are in the game as "strike craft". This NEEDS to be fleshed out more, they play a role, but lack almost all tactical value. IMO choice of strikecraft should be as varied and important as choice of weapons.\nUpgrades are virtually gone. No more min-maxing your loadout. You get an extra strikecraft here, +20% armor there, +15% reload speed down the road etc. This also MUST be fleshed out. Speaking of leveling - late game is incredibly unbalanced. Once you can start taking out stations or major captains your level skyrockets. 2-3 fights/level.\n\n"These things all seem like complaints". Well, yes. They made SPAZ 1 great, and they are... lackluster right now. However, SPAZ 2's empire building, diplomacy, abstracted strategy, graphics, and gameplay are nice and fun. Just don't expect more of SPAZ 1.\n\nFor MinMax I have a few recommendations:\n1) Please flesh out the upgrade system - make player upgrades great again. Maybe add faction or meaningful station upgrades?\n2) Give strike craft more versatility. Different hangar sizes, modifications to loadout, obvious difference in behaviour are sorely needed.\n3) PLEASE revamp the mothership rebuilding interface. It's fun and novel the first 4-5 times but once youwant to try something other than a straight line and find out it didn't work as expected it's HELL to rebuild a 25+ part ship.\n4) Allow players to have bigger battles and more wingmen. There's only so much you can do to upgrade your threat, and if I have a faction with 20 stations I want a bodyguard who'll be able to stomp regular captains.","May 20","true","13.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The combat is fun, but it's very repetitive. All three games played exactly the same. It's not so much a game as a demo of a game. There are no interesting choices. Once you learn the game, every move is obvious, and it's always the same move.\n\nI enjoy the game and recommend it, but not by much. Almost the entire reason I'm recommending it is because once you get used to the combat, it is fun. But this game is very unfinished. It needs a ton of work.\n\nIt's not anywhere near as good a game as SPAZ1. This is mostly because everything that made SPAZ1 fun is gone, including the intuitive and fast combat, the easy inventory system with blueprints, choosing your own skills to specialize in, and having lots of interesting missions.\n\nIn SPAZ2, we have a horrible and sloppy inventory system that feels far more like work than fun. The blueprint system from SPAZ1 was perfect. This one is terrible. If you've ever found yourself hating inventory management in an RPG, you'll hate this one even more. And now we have random perks to choose from rather than the ability to customize our skills.\n\nThe heaviest blow to this game though, by far, is the lack of interesting missions. Everything is combat. That's it. The combat is fun, but it gets repetitive doing the exact same thing over and over with no change, especially since we now have only one ship design, not several like we had in SPAZ1. There are no more missions about finding cargo, no more protecting other ships in escort quests, no more cloaking to sneak around a combat map for stealth quests, no more speed quests. Everything is just combat.\n\nGAME START: First of all, turn off relative controls in gameplay options for a smoother experience. In SPAZ1, you jumped right into the action from the start. In SPAZ2, the beginning is far too slow and lacks direction. Hopefully the devs will fix this. But once you get past the early stages of the game, everything speeds up and gets more fun.\n\nDo arena battels! At first, I was just exploring the map, which was boring because there are no real missions to do. Once I realized that I could go to every base and start doing arena battles for resources, it got more fun and got my ship up to par with the others. It also taught me how combat works.\n\nCOMBAT: It takes a lot more time and/or firepower to take out one ship in SPAZ2 than it did in SPAZ1. Positioning and targeting are far more important now. Every piece of the ship is destroyable. If you focus on the engines, for example, you can cripple their movement abilities as well as whatever weapons they have mounted there. You can target the parts of their ship that are causing you problems.\n\nThe ship building screen could be better. A static ship building screen would have been more efficient. As it is, you have to move the pieces around the screen with a gravity beam, which makes it more tedious than it needs to be. Also, you actually have to manage inventory, which is a huge step backwards from how it was done in SPAZ1 with blueprints / schematics. I found myself having to spend a ridiculous amount of time just selling or getting rid of extra parts I'd acquired.\n\nThat being said, the ability to create a fully customized ship is awesome! No longer are there default chasis like there were in SPAZ1. Now you design your ship from scratch. It can have any shape, and every piece matters. Each part affects the ship's speed and movement capabilities, the weaponry, armor, shielding, and so on.\n\nCompared to SPAZ1, the map and scope of the game both feel very small. I'm hoping for a lot more content. SPAZ2 is a good game, and it'll be even better if we can get some more content.\n\nMy first game on normal difficulty took around 23 hours. It was fun. I'll probably try a sandbox game next. There's a lot of potential for replayability, especially with sandbox mode and upcoming multiplayer.\n\nWhat this game needs more than anything else is for the devs to recognize that this game needs a lot of work and put that work into it. There's a lot of potential here, but it's really not a complete game, especially not for this price point. Right now, it's a $10 game selling for $20. If the devs leave it mostly like it is, it will always be a mediocre product. If they see all of the complaints from their fans and work to make this game more like the first one, then this could be a truly great game.","May 19","true","60.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

SPAZ 2 was, in my mind, the same as SPAZ 1 just 3d environments and MP... and then it released.\n\nIt's nothing close to the old school, top down shooter, build-a-badass-fleet and explore type game. Maybe that's my fault for expecting it to be. What it is now is a heavily focused 3rd person space shooter with boring ship building mechanics, story and overall gameplay.\n\nThe new star map is tiny and some of the features that were touted are rather uneventful (interacting with 200 captians) and frankly, just boring. Ship augmentation is a frustrating process with no way to see overall health, armor, DPS and other statistics when you get a new item piece. If your item gets blown off in combat... might as well leave it because it's overly frustrating and hard to get it attached again. The story is rather predictable and ultimately forgettable and extremely short - I'd guess most people will beat it in about 10 hours and that's only because you have to grind to 30.\n\nI can go on and on why I dislike this title greatly and will just continue to play SPAZ instead. I support the developers and don't regret my purchase. I want them to be successful in what they do contrary to what I believe is a bad game compared to the original.

Ship controls are slow and clunky, many mechanics (like weapon line of sight and mounting) go completely unexplained, weapon charge, range, and reload times are invisible to the player, and - most bafflingly of all - the game includes a "battle wagon" mode that is inarguably superior to ever manually aiming yourself, with 100% accuracy and innate knowledge of all optimal weapon ranges. I simply can't understand why this mode exists except to compensate for wildly inadequate manual-firing UI.\n\nAs things are now, the game has its fun moments once you begin to work things out, but it's never better than clunky at best, and massively lacks the feeling of a -world- or satisfying combat that spaz1 had.

In spaz 1 you had premade ship hulls and added weapons and gadgets to them. The ships looked cool and interesting. In spaz 2 you randomly duct tape garbage and scrap together and call it a space ship. Since all the parts have their own health and armor the enemy can just shoot them off your ship and after the battle you have to reassemble your ship again (waste of time and not fun to do). I would rather have premade ship hulls again with one global healthbar.

Doing away with the limitations of the ancient game engine, it is now fully 3D, though the battles take place in a plane. The backstory from SPAZ is all inside SPAZ 2 in the form of lore messages which can be collected, to bring up new players up to speed with  the new game.\n\nThe game has even more modular ships thanthe original, and some of the mechanics were changed. It is a different game, with a different engine, but it is relatable to the original and has cool mechanics.\n\nKudos to develppers for a non-cheating AI and in-game economy, which is a hard feat to pull off! 200 real captains doing the same stuff as you, making the game real.\n\nBeing in early access, the devs are polishing the places players are stumbling the most, and expanding the game with more things to do.\n\nSo far the single-player experience is good, and I can't wait to see the next updates+features!\n\nSpace.\nPirates.\nAnd.\nZombies.\n\n\n","May 25","true","39.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Since the game's release, the developers went dark to work on a sequel. Now with Space Pirates and Zombies 2, the developers are expanding on everything in the game and the early access version has a lot to like at the moment.\n\nAlone in the Void:\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies 2 (or SPAZ 2 for the rest of this post) continues the story from the last game. After stopping the zombie attack, humanity is now left fractured in the void with the precious resource REZ now in short supply. You play as the heroes from the last game that are now stuck wandering around trying to fight the infection wherever it might show up.\n\nAs before, the universe remains persistent as various ships, factions and bandits are fighting for control of the area. In the last game, you had complete control over how you built your mother ship out and SPAZ 2 takes that a lot further.\n\nThis time, your ship is completely modular; allowing you to remove and add pieces as you see fit. How it works is that sub cores allow you to grow out your ship; different parts can only be fitted in certain directions, for instance, engines can only be slotted from the bottom part of a sub core. As you add in more parts, the combined total of stats from everything will determine your ship's statistics and threat level, which is a measure of your abilities.\n\nBecause your ship is modular, it also means that you can shoot pieces off of enemies or lose your own during combat. Later in, you'll find super-sized pieces that require more slots to fit and gives a whole new meaning to the term "inventory tetras."\n\nAs you level up, you'll unlock the ability to equip more cores and in turn grow your ship and make it more powerful. The different modules come in different rarities and qualities that can be either found or bought at the various space stations.\n\nYou can also hire strike fighters to join you in combat; switching between your ships or letting them do their own thing.\n\nIn SPAZ 1, there was a sense of an emergent universe that moved without the player, and SPAZ 2 takes that even further.\n\nMaking Friends and Enemies:\n\nIn SPAZ 2, the void itself is made up of multiple factions and neutral captains trying to make a living. At the start of the game, you are free to explore at your leisure while the factions and other people make do. Factions and their captains will remember everything that you do and that will influence how they respond. Steal other captains' scavenge or fight factions and they will come to hate you and track you down; be good and help others and you may get backup during battles.\n\nAs the game goes on, you'll be able to join a faction, start recruiting people and try to carve out your own little slice of the Void. Different factions specialize in different ship modules; giving you a chance of acquiring higher quality pieces from them. The spaceports will most likely grow, change hands or be destroyed over the course of a play; not of course mentioning when the titular zombies make an appearance.\n\nOnce the zombies attack, the meta-game changes, as you try to create your faction and unite everyone else against the zombie attacks. Thanks to random places and the relationships of the captains, SPAZ 2's overall play can change with each new game.\n\nSPAZ 2 is definitely an example of a sequel going big with its design changes, and even at this point in early access there's a lot to like. With that said, there are some issues to talk about.\n\nPutting it All Together:\n\nFrom a design point of view, SPAZ 2 is already quite far along for an early access game; especially considering that they're expecting at least a year to stay in EA. With that said, there are some issues starting with the UI side of things. There are a lot of numbers and icons that could do with better explanations for the player. Information such as what impacts reload time, comparing two different modules, what's going on in the Void etc.\n\nI would like to see more variety in terms of designing your mother ship; perhaps sub cores that have different positions and more weapons beyond just the modifiers from the various factions. Weapons right now are set in the game, with the chance of having random bonuses to certain stats based on rarity; I really hope we see more variety as the game goes through early access.\n\nMoving modules around in a 3D space can be a bit cumbersome. They have added in a remove all option which helps, but it still can be a lengthy process to figure out how to build your ship or even what's a good design. I honestly have no idea what parts are better than others and have simply been going by the star measurement for rarity; not a good sign in a loot driven game. Your threat level is a good rating of how strong you are, but the game gives you no idea of how to improve it other than to just keep piling weapons on.\n\nAs with the first game, SPAZ 2's early game can be a bit of a grind. You're going to be very weak and find that most captains can push you around. Until you can get to about threat level 20, your options are going to be quite limited. I found it was easier to simply get killed and reload the save, rather than fight a higher threat ship or pay out a bribe to keep them from attacking. Until you get yourself situated in the mid-game, the grinding for the needed resources and experience can be a bit frustrating.\n\nIn the first SPAZ, I felt that the game bogged down a bit too much once the zombie infection began, and the same can be said of SPAZ 2.\n\nOnce you start the actual fighting of the zombies, the grind rears its head once again. You'll need tons of scrap in order to upgrade your ports to the point where they can handle attacks and lots of experience in order to improve your ship so that it can stand toe-to-toe with the enemy.\n\nYou'll find that player skill can only go so far, and there isn't much you can do against a ship who is higher than you in level by yourself.\n\nThere is also further grind built into dealing with the zombie faction. Every time a zombie kills a captain, that captain joins the zombie faction; making them harder to deal with over time. The problem is that there is no way to reverse this trend; in my game, I was constantly harassed by an ever growing number of zombies and couldn't do anything about it or leave my area to do anything else. At this point, my suggestion would be to allow for more control or guidance of the AI; such as telling them to help you with attacks or team up against the zombies.\n\nFixing Up:\n\nSpace Pirates and Zombies 2 definitely shows dedication from the developers and features across the board improvements and changes from the original game. Most of the game design at this point is already fantastic; there just needs to be more polish and fine tuning to get everything firing on all cylinders. If the developers can clean up the UI and keep growing the game with more content and mechanics, this could be one very amazing game to play when it's finally done.\n\nFor more on Space Pirates and Zombies 2, you can watch my playlist of it on the Game-Wisdom YouTube Channel.\n\nFor more reviews, spotlights and weekly podcasts, check out Game-Wisdom[Game-wisdom.com], where we examine the art and science of games.","May 19","true","21.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I am a huge SPAZ fan and was anticipating the release of the second installment. I was more excited for this game than i was for many others. And, as a fan of the original, i unfortunately have to say that i am very dissapointed by how the game is.\n\nAnd yes, i am aware that the game is still in Early Access, however the quarrels i have with this game is at the very basics of gameplay. Something that is defining to what this game is about. And unfortunately if you were looking forward to a successor to SPAZ, you are wrong here.\n\nSPAZ 2 does so much different, that i would have named the game something entirely different.\n\nSPAZ 2 is now more of a rogue like space shooter that controls and plays very clunky. The whole economy is different, the playstyle is different and the way your ships work is entirely different, too.\n\nSPAZ 2 has a "proceduarly generated world", which just means that the placing of the objects in the world to interact with is different every playthrough. The map, however, always stays the same. It is very limited. You also build your ship from modules now. And if they get destroyed, well, you just have to buy another one then. Or use junk-parts which are just what the name suggests. JUNK. So you have to grind alot of currency (Scrap) to always have a decently equipped ship, which just sucks. Your ship looks different every time, so if you want a particular design you want to go with, you will need to spend alot of time just searching for the parts in different space stations.\n\nAll in all, i am sure that some people may have fun with the game. However, if you were into SPAZ and expect SPAZ 2 to be anything like SPAZ, then you should prepare yourself to be sorely disappointed. So, I myself cannot recommend SPAZ 2.","May 18","false","14.6"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","36","68","0","0"

I frigging loved SPAZ one... but as it turns out this game is totally different.\n\nI loved the first SPAZ. Hunting and collecting for all the different ships and equipment parts.\nDifferent ships were all unique, but what was better, you could arm them for so many tactics. I liked to make missile ships from my wingmen to stay safe. I liked to make cloaked mega laser ships from my main ships that could do a lot of damage, but still had engine speep to bail out of bad situation. This kinda customization is gone. Best part of the game was collecting different ship types, parts (weapon, shield and support), and experience to unlock the skills to use them.\n\nThere is still collecting in the game but just for mothership parts. Now you customize your mothership, from parts you loot and shop, but all your other ships are tiny, boring cannonfodder that serve no other purpose, other than to distract the enemy.\n\nMothership customization is kinda cool. You build your own ship from blocks, with each block having its own stats and own weapon (unless its core-part = hull). Every part have many different stats, but basicly they give little boost to the motherships stats like speed, turn speed, and armor.\nThere are basicly 5 kinds of parts:\n1) Core aka The hull that gives the ship its shape.\n2) , 3) , 4), 5) = Nose, Tail, Right wind, and Left wing. They are all the same but connect to different side of the core part... nose goes to front... You can guess the rest.\nWhy this sucks, is that every part is the same. Every F-ing part  is the same. Every part have the same stats, with a little difference to the numbers. Example Nose and Tail parts have 6 stats with one difference... Nose has "shields 3", but Tail has "shields 2, but engine 1".\n\nBy this point you still think: "but that sounds cool". And it kinda is... kinda.\nUntil you hear that every part has random weapon!!\nBut then you think "Whats wrong with that then?"\nWell... The weapons are random and you can't change anything.\n\nWhat that means: You play the whole game using random weapons, Using random parts, with a  lot of different stats that you can't tell the difference. Your mothership is ugly the whole time.\n\nYou can use your imagination, to make your mothership, perform and look, quite many things. Actually in every starbase there is "arena" where you can challenge yourself, using premade motherships, and test yourself with different kinds of ships. For me it worked well to show me what kind of weapons I liked. But in the end it was all the same.\n\nBut I'm now professional reviewer so let me make shorter points. This is compared to SPAZ one.\n\nGame is 1/4 size of SPAZ 1 or smaller, but it is hard to compare because this is more alive.\n200 hundred unique ships/captains move there constantly, But they don' respect no border. And I mean constantly\n\n\nPROS:\n- Ramming and individual part damage.\n\nCONS:\n- No different, unique, interesting ships.\n-- Mothership is spawn of vomit that you find.\n-- Strikefleet. They were all tiny. Died. Made zero difference, other that cannonfodder. Totally ♥♥♥♥ed up feature. In SPAZ one, you actually desing them... They were awesome.\n- Every ship part is the same. Random weapon + some stats.\n- Every part has same stats. Minor value difference, but still every part is the same.\n- Regions control sucks. It is chaos out there.\n-- No border control. You can't tell other people to stay  out of your territory.\n-- If they raid you... You can't in game terms be diplomatically upset... You can only destroy their raid party and then they are mad at you. Makes sense (they are mad =yes, but that was your only choise = no)... you were friends and they robbed you.... but it was wrong to attack the robbers... and stuff.\n- Diplomacy is basicly enemy/friend. But it is individually between different captains (200 of em) not just factions.\n\nIn short:\nYou make ugly ship. You and it has random stats and weapons. But because you are pro those weapons make you good at everything (although, no theme, or style). Then you win... Boring.\n","May 27","false","15.5"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","2"

The game died twice within 17H Gameplay and for a early access game that is really neat, best part is that none of the data was lost and the game starts up fast even without a SSD.\nSo this ain't bugging me.\n\nThe combat is really epic, at first you start out trying to get the hang of the game and be friendly to everyone cause you are just a small time cruiser. Attacking bandits or ganging up on bandits with others to increase the chance of survival. Good part, the one you fought along with remembers you and might just aid you in your next battle. As well as everyone around you, despite what you done, either likes or dislikes you then. But weirdly enough nobody minds you killing other spaceships as long as they are in no faction.\n\nThe more you carry with you, the slower you are! But i dont mind cause i run on Eco-Mode. Slow but barely and rez gets used along the way. Besides the battles come to me, and there was one time when it really paid off carrying all that parts with me. There were 3 Captains ganging up on me, and i kept losing the battle but i kept loading the autosave.  After each battle i switched some parts trying another strategy and build to ensure my victory. After 3 Loses i finally build an decent build that can take on any ship as long as i play it safe (more like beserker though XD)\n\nOnce you took down their shield and you still got yours, its time to go full throttle and take him on! Keep going  to separate target from the group and drive it into some asteroids or space waste as you keep shooting it.\nJust when its about to go down, Brake and make a run for it as you give it the final strike cause you dont want to keep hugging the space ship when its about to explode right'?\n\nIt's a epic new kind of SPAZ, its different, yes, but who says it needs to be exactly the same as spaz 1'? If you love spaz one you go play that.\n\nIts early access and the devs keep working on it and its up to you how it changes, if you have ideas, post em up. If you things you dislike share it with them. They are a really great team and while the developement might be running slow, its getting there!\n\nIon SRM are great for taking out their shields from afar , you can then dash in and get that lethal strike on it. Explosive warheads are also very nice! The Cannons and the impact from hitting it with your ship will do the trick really.\n\nSeeing your enemy go down and explode is highly satisfying!\nIf you still don't know if you should get it, take a look at their 50min+ gameplay or watch some lets plays if there are some. Or just dive right into it and get a taste yourself.\ni Personally love the game :D","May 20","true","27.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I did not play SPAZ 1 and this is not a comparison review.\n\nThe over the top map style, then combat "encounter" is akin to mount and blade (which i have over 1500 hours that steam recoreded. more after)\n\nThe modules can be a PAIN at times but quick ways around rebuilding a ship is to trade the part you are replacing with the new one in the same transaction. the game will swap pieces out without you having to dismantle your ship. (youll know what I mean when you play)\n\nI read reviews saying there is no diference with weapons you use. this is FALSE. I was only able to succeed in endgame by utilizing specific weapon combos. There is veriety and more is coming according to devs.\n\nThere is MUCH more hours that i can put into this game, but work and real life is demanding ATM. I will log plenty more when i have time because this game is absolutely worth it.\n\nI bought SPAZ 2 at 14.99 -10% for into price. With that being said, i would easily pay 24.99 in early access.

It still has the same feel, same characters.  The ships you flew before are now part of your strike craft (fleet) and you can build a custom mothership (which is not your base anymore, but your main attack ship) out of modules.\n\nThe combat has moved to 3D..ish.  I myself like the style of the new combat.  You can go top down though I find it a bit short ranged right now.  You can go into a third person view that allowes you to move around and fight the other ships.  There is no up or down, all ships are on the same level...almost like if you were fighting on the ground.  I actually like this as most fully spherical 3D space shooters just make it difficult for me to keep track of other craft I'm shooting at.\n\nThey have added a strategy element to it as well.  There are tons of NPC factions that you can befriend....or just destroy.  You can join a factoin then build your own starbase as well.  It also looks like there will be multiplayer, thought it is not in game yet.\n\nAlready very playable for an early access game.\n\nMy one dislike is that the modular ship building system is very annoying right now.  You "tractor" which is like magnetic your parts to your ship...and they always seem to go flying about and not stick where I want them.  I hope this system will be altered to be a bit more user friendly.  This still won't stop me from playing even if it stays this way as it is only a small part of the game.\n\nI know this game will be finished and continue to be upgraded as the devs have done a great job with the original and are already working on the items the community are talking about in the early access.","May 19","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My library has more than a few in it, and *most* of those have turned out disappointing. There is a huge disparity between different games when it comes to what early access means. Some games give you a half functional tech demo, some give you a highly polished experience that just needs some QA testing.\n\nThis game falls into the latter category. Right now, today, this game is good. If this was the final version, I would be happy with what I bought.\n\nSome notes:\nThis is NOT a direct sequel to SPAZ 1 with upgraded bells and whistles, there are significant design changes revolving around combat and the 'overworld'\nWhether a change is good or not comes down to personal preference, but for the most part the changes were well executed.\nThe overworld is dynamic and interesting, but initially seems a bit 1 dimensional.

The developers are only a 2 man team, but they are very responsive to feedback from the community and they have a history of long term support established with SPAZ 1.

Although your meticulously constructed mothership is piloted into battle and can be manually controlled (like all ships), the smaller ships are now "strike craft" that function like expendable equipment. They cannot be customized and cannot be replaced if destroyed.

How I've missed my SPAZ, let me count the ways. The gameplay is very reminiscent of SPAZ of days past, while bringing several new elements to the table:\n\n+Choice of scalable 3rd person or top down views (They're both fun to use, and each has its use.)\n+200 different NPC captains with personal agendas.\n+NPCs remember your past transgressions, as well as kindnesses, and react accordingly in real time.\n+Fully fluid ship building. You are only limited by the available "Cores" in Campaign Mode.\n+Interactive Loot (You have to play it to understand....imagine a mace made of loot. (Or an asteroid, for that matter.)\n+On the fly ship repair (to a point), and destructible (and lootable/equippable on the fly) enemy ship components.\n\nWhile I love the game, there are a few things that bug me:\n\n-Repetitive battles sequences.\n-Lack of NPC depth. I don't feel attached to any of them.\n-Different factions don't feel different. They only have different names. They don't act differently, or have any kind of faction specific agendas.\n-Lack of Side Quests/Lore.\n-Only one real "Boss Fight"\n\nWhile I enjoyed the story, I feel somehow shorted on the content of said story. Original SPAZ made us love off-color NPCs. I see the descendants of those NPCs, but I don't feel that they've been fleshed out properly, nor allowed us the personal "quest" interaction to make those NPCs a part of the gameplay, other than a witty one-liner here and there. I miss the story that gave us the NPCs. While this game is full of action, it does, sadly, lack in depth.\n\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a space shooter, sarcastic humor, or someone that enjoys the game of "Risk".","June 3","true","59.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You get a more hands on approach for the ships at the cost of the old strategic system. However the non combat interactions such as factions, starbase building, and ship managing more than make up for this change. There is a campagin mode and sandbox mode that allows you to get a handle of the game. I have not tried the multiplayer yet. It is also my understanding that this will be an offline mode only feature.\n\nIn terms of current state plyability I would say this is pretty good and only going to get better. No earth sharttering glitches yet and the developers have been very responsive on hot fixes and talking with the community.\n\nFinal verdict: Its an evolving game but damn good for an early release.

The setting, some sound effects and the overall sense of humour is the same, but the gameplay is completely different but that's not necessarily a bad thing. That is unless you're looking for a direct sequel with improved features: I'd guess a few people have been negatively reviewing SPAZ2 because of this. Admittedly it maybe shouldn't have been named SPAZ2 as it plays more like a spinoff rather than a sequel but I honestly prefer SPAZ2 over SPAZ1.\n\nSPAZ2 plays like an arcadey spaceship shooter with sandbox, trading, scavenging and some exploring aspects. It's a little grindy but I personally don't mind that. The story continues on from SPAZ1, but to be honest I didn't care much for the lore. Loved the sandbox mode though but the galaxy map could be a bit bigger, otherwise an adjusting slider like in SPAZ1 could hopefully be added in a future patch, as it seems a bit claustrophobic in late-game.\n\nDecent eye candy especially considering how small the dev team is and it's very satisfying to see lasers, missiles and assorted explodey things fly through space, resulting in enemies exploding into little bits which is one of the main draws of spaceship combat for me. Some of those little bits floating through space being salvageable is also a nice touch. Being able to use (destructable) space debris tactically is even better.\n\nShip construction can be a little bit fiddly but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. Loot is determined mostly through RNG so it can be frustrating at times but stations with a greater threat number tend to have much larger inventories to browse from, which is mentioned but could be easily missed.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed SPAZ2 much more than SPAZ1. If you're going to try it, judge it based on its own merits even though the name suggests it should be a direct sequel.","June 2","true","36.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I love how its a completely new game with some of the first's elements in it. The story and lore has been done very well and I've found myself laughing out loud many times. The game is quirky and fun. However it can be a bit overwhelming at first especially if you expected the same mechanics as the first. The currency is done very well and the game has a sort of mount and blade feel to it which is very nice.\n\nGoons need to be made a bit more important though. Late game they come en masse and waste precious res only to be sold to the starbase you're about to destroy. Not my precious resssss. lol. Voice acting is still missing and there are a few tiny tweaks and additions left to really complete the game. I bought the game and I hope that you will too instead of pirating it (ironically). Once I got it i played non-stop ignoring the meaningless life that lies outside of SPAZ 2. I conquered the entire galaxy with a threat level 208 ship. 9/10 on account that its still in alpha.\n\nMuch greatness.\nVery sweetness.\nWow.","May 30","true","48.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Still haven't gone very far in the story due to a few nagging issues.\n\nThe Good - Responsive controls\n- Deep mechanics\n- Always something going on\n- UPDATE: Amazing turnaround. Devs are actively fixing these things. This game is NOT dead in the water just because it hit EA.\n\nThe Neutral - Same SPAZ humor/tone. I personally love it, but it's not for everyone.\n\nThe Bad - Minmax dropped the ball on a few design elements which I'm hoping are an early access gripe and not a real one.\n- As it is currently, the Reputation system is arcane and misleading at best, and downright broken at worst. Characters that are friendly (50 personal rep, 20 faction rep) will gladly ignore the fact you just got double-teamed by a faction you both hate. At the same time, the game stresses that "every captain remembers everything", while not actually holding grudges or acting according to events.\n- Plenty of early access unpolished bits. No key prompts on the fail-gates leading to a trip to the input screen during a firefight. HORRIBLE conveyance on things like goon requirements and how progression of a starbase works.\n- Battlewagon mode is buggy as all hell. About 3 hours in I started "Wagon-dancing" by hitting the battlewagon key to have it issue orders to strike craft and missile systems, then immediately overriding it to manual-fire weapons according to their cooldowns. The reason I started doing this was primarily a sense of frustration with its targeting priorities. Lock onto a ship and the gun turrets totally ignore it in favor of a different ship that happens to be just outside of your firing angle, which is blows your cooldowns trying ineffectually to hit (I know WHY it does it: The thing I want to hit isn't quite in range, so it goes for something that WAS in range at the moment I locked on, but it's too slow to realize that the thing isn't even on that side of my ship anymore)\n\nThe Ugly - Unclear choice of aesthetics. SPAZ2 is at its heart an exploration and growth game, so why does my ship look equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 12 hours in as it did when I was scrounging for junk? There is already a 0-5 star quality system for parts in place, use it to determine how "closely" a piece sticks to the ship or something. 0 star and junk parts? Float those suckers next to the ship like they are currently. 5 star? Break out a blend tool and stick that component ON the ship. It doesn't have to look amazing. It just has to look like I'm not using scrapyard material.\n- Certain voice assets are VERY out of place and/or disturbing. Random bandits will scream "PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME TAKE MY MEDICINE NO PLEASE", seemingly without provocation. Coming from games like Borderlands, disturbed bandit characters and their meatbicycles usually don't bother me in the least, but this is just...upsetting. Some of the lines here just feel raw and uncomfortable, not based on a particular headspace or characterization. Wearing my flesh as a suit? Works for me. Paint your ship with my blood? Great! Complaining that your hands look like balloons? Sure! It's like the airlock humor in SPAZ. Why add this other line that is nothing like the rest, is very emotionally voice-acted, and has no bearing whatsoever on the game or the bandits as characters?\n\nAll-in-all, a beautiful and playable early access that FEELS like development was stalled to throw a ton of polish on it so it would catch people's eyes during early access. You can tell that there aren't any broken underlying systems here though...just unfinished ones. Early Access done right.","May 20","true","14.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

If you love hunting for ship parts and customization, you'll have a blast. I easily spent half my game time just trying different ship combinations to see what works best. Definitely grindy, but so was the first SPAZ.\n\nThe combat is more compelling than the original as well. Controlling a single ship definitely feels better, especially since in the first game it could get very expensive to have the AI pilot bigger ships.\n\n\n\nIt has problems that I don't want to gloss over, however.\n\n- The captain relations mechanics are a bit too simplistic for my tastes. People don't like you if you break or steal their stuff. People like it when you save them or give them money. If they don't like you enough, they attack on sight. It doesn't really get more complicated than that. Perhaps my biggest disappointment.\n\n- The ship building, while good overall, allows some weird behavior like allowing engines to unload their exhaust directly into another part without consequence. Weapons on the left side can shoot across to the right when you're turning, which feels too forgiving. Circle an enemy, and your broadsides on both sides can fire at it. Takes a lot of the typical strategy in broadside combat out.\n\n- Some features that were promised don't seem to be in here. The "stealth past the zombies" system doesn't exist at all. Infections in structures are all or nothing, so you can't cleanse a station without destroying it entirely. The captain AI, while functionable, delegates captain behavior to very simple patrols.\n\n- The story is pretty simplisitic, in fact more so than the original (far from a novel as well)\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I do recommend this game.

You have a whole bunch of ships ("captains") flying around a rather small area and you each have "threat" values that pretty much determine if you will win an encounter. You increase your threat mostly by killing other captains to gain experience which unlocks more modules for your ship.\n\nThere is more to the game but not much.\n\nThe economy works through stealing from resource nodes (which can't be locked or defended when you own them) and then trading those resources for ship modules at stations (1 station per 52 sectors devided between 7 factions). You also lose resources as you move depending on the speed at which you move and its not forgiving at higher threat levels.\n\nFor combat, when a captain attacks another captain or a station a fight is initiated and for a period of time other captains can join the fight up to 4 captains. Fights never have more than 4 captains which generally makes every battle you, your wingman (who you pick from the captains in your faaction), your target and either another enemy or an ally depending on whos territory the fight is taking place in generally\n\nThe combat itself is entertaining enough though the game is in need of ballancing. Theres a rock paper sizors system to weapon damage (effectiveness against shields, armour and health) and some other tricks and gimmiks such as ramming and flinging objects at your enemies which is fun but its a bit limited as your tractor beam is only able to move small objects at a decent speed and your weapons do not fire while you use the beam.\n\nThere are plenty of weapons available though all seem to just be from SPAZ 1 which is dissapointing.\n\nThe UI definitly needs work in places; for instance if you want to bribe multiple captains from faction X you will need to open the faction menu -> click through the factions untill you get to the right one -> scroll the list of captains -> click the captains name -> click the bribe button -> select what you want to bribe with -> hit the confirmation button then repeat the entire process again for another captain.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is the active turn system where time only moves when you are performing an action. You cant scroll the map while you move, you cant opt. to stay still and let time continue to save fuel while you assess the map. The only time the camera is not locked on you while you move is if you are viewing a capatain in which case the half of the screen not taken up by the captain menu is zoomed in on the captain.\n\n\nHopefully the game will improve through EA but alot of what I find issue with seems like core parts of the game that are unlikely to change. I hope at least enough extra features are added to offset this but I doubt it.","May 19","false","14.9"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Obviously you can change the camera to overhead, but it likes to toggle back and forth anyways at the start of each skirmish, and the controls feel lethargic compared to the arcadey-but-responsive original. Plus motherships look rather bleh, and more effort could have been spent elsewhere. SPAZ 1 also gave you a little dopamine drip as you sucked up resources like a vacuum. Here in SPAZ 2, theyre just arbitrary numbers and you dont get the same satisfaction in collecting them.\n\nThe inventory/store menus also feel like they could be presented much better. Its tiresome comparing stats on things that you continuously have to remind yourself on what type of component they are, and then re-look at the stats, and then re-remember the component type, and then just say "eff it. This one has a bunch of stars and costs alot so its probably better".\n\nAs others have said, shields inherently make the most sense to bolster over anything else. You dont have to invest anything in their repair...\n\nStrike ships or w/e are necessary in the least thrilling way possible. Theyre just there to draw flak away from you, and thats generally it.\n\nPROS\n\nThe 4x half of the game is really interesting, despite some grindy resource collection.

If anything it reminds me of a very, very poorly done Civ2 clone. I wanted to like it, but the veritable litany of dysfunctional aspects, I think, has turned me so off to it as a product I'm remiss to give it another go when it's considered "finished".\n\nI genuinely don't have anything positive to say about the game other than acknowledging the budget level graphics are delivered with all the flair you could ask for to make them appealing, ie "there are a lot of bright colors".\n\nEverything else is terrible. Building starbases requires you to be lv12, which takes a minute, so the first 30 minutes to an hour (or well more) all you're doing is chasing down pirates and assaulting lower level captains; all of whom level faster than you. Whether it's you or the AI, someone eventually opens up a faction (it's always the AI), you can join one of the main ones if the AI beat you and start your own later, the latter I don't suggest because that makes the already dysfunctional social dynamic even worse... More on that later.\n\nShip building is outright stupid, you level slowly, very slowly, especially compared to the AI, so this "modular" business is flat out bull****. if you fall behind in the level race, you'll NEVER be able to build a ship as large and imposing as the front line runners; because the number of connective modules you can use to expand your ship is controlled by your level. There's no such thing as a "brimming to the bank corvette class gunship ship" in this game, you spend your early levels building centipedes, and your later levels building fatter centipedes so you can incorporate fatter heads and podexes onto them. It's really very, very stupid. I can't reiterate that enough times, it's stupid.\n\nLater game, everything that is wrong really shines, you can obliterate another captain back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back and every time they come back (which is within seconds) they've gone up a level (or five) and have a MASSIVE ship with top tier parts all over it. I continued to win these battles until I was just being gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by threat level 90 dyads back-to-back-to-back-to-back-ad-nauseum. It didn't just get old, it got boring. And the amount of work you have to put into developing an alliance with another faction is beyond tedious; especially given that no matter what you do, even a faction you're on great terms with, will start to try to take over your territory. It's strange to have captains you've come to like, who have super positive affects with you (friend levels maxed out) start attacking you. Especially when they do it after you've given them THOUSANDS of salvage worth of materials and let them pillage your resources unmolested because "sometimes friendship is about ignoring the other person's faults". Right?\n\nSPAZ wasn't a 4x space game, SPAZ2 thinks it might want to be, but it isn't smart enough to get there. And it never will be. They'd have to scrap this PoS and start over to fix all the problems with it. Why they tossed a good design to make a subpar product I don't know, but I wish they hadn't done it.\n\nThe thing about this game... The most irritating thing... you want to like it, and for a $20 game, it's pretty, not to mention it hails from a phenomenal predecessor, but really, it's like if Einstein had a slightly more attractive than him son who was an f'ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Riding on Daddy's coattails might get him into college, Daddy's fame and Junior's good looks might get him some high quality tail in the beginning, but in then end, he's not what his dad was, he's just boring and useless.\n\nSave your $20 dollars, and don't let any of these idiots on steam steer you wrong. It's amazing to me how often a bad game gets all these bandwagon white knight types defending it, even though they don't like the damned game either. Just because the people that made this are a small entity doesn't excuse the game for being garbage, and only by letting them know "this sucks, guys, sorry, but it really does" are they going to realize they need to do something different.\n\nDon't let SPAZ as a franchise die from loving fanboism. Just admit this game blows goats, and possibly donkeys as well, MAYBE even a transvestite elephant on it's coke weekends... Because only through admitting it has a problem, can we start the healing process.","June 2","false","6.3"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","3"

SPAZ 2 is fun and has the potential to be great as SPAZ, but isn't quite there yet. As it is Early Access and the devs are super responsive... I easily expect it to be an epic game by finish.\n\nThe combat feels more like naval combat, recognizing where important components are and destroying them is hugely important in close fights which is cool, but don't feel as fast paced as SPAZ.\n\nControlling an empire is a cool concept.\n\nNegatives/bugs I'll be posting in the discussion instead of here since early access is to help the devs build a better game.","May 19","true","29.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But this game forces you to improvise. You don't get the luxery of picking your battles. More powerful ships will hunt you down. You have to get clever, make choices you didnt think would work.\n\nAn example, spoiler free. I was faced with two higher level enemy ships. I did not have the time or resources to run away, and in my hurry to escape I accidently destroyed my only way out. I was left with two options. Reload, or fight. I chose to fight, and decided to try ramming.\n\nI have then since used this tactic and built my ships around the ability to ram. I have won many battles that left me outgunned and outnumbered, because I chose to ram the enemy into asteroids and explosives. The downside is I spend a lot in fixing my ship.\n\nI think the ability to customize your ship to suit your tactics is the best part of this game. Taking the story mode is sugguested heavily, since they don't hand hold, but they will teach you important aspects of the game as they become relevant. I am very rarely seeing an event and wondering why since everything was explained carefully.\n\nI have waited for years for this game since I loved playing the first one. I am sad to say, that I will not be playing the first game anymore. There is no aspect of the first game that I miss because this second one either exceeds what it did before or enhanced it.

This is not a direct sequel so you wont be getting SPAZ 1.5. However ive played through the entire game and the flavor of playing a spaz game is still there. The characters still hit the nail on the head as well as the setting.\n\nSome people come off with the impression that all the ships look like garbage. Yes they do, because of the state the galaxy is in lorewise. Everyone is scavenging parts they can because there is not anymore unlimited amounts of rez like in the time period of the first game. I personally also enjoy ramming ships and seeing parts get torn off when i hit them. I once sheared off 5 wing parts in one charge and i recorded it and watched it again as it felt so epic.\n\nSome also dislike the relative ship controls(they actually are relative to the camera) which make your ship turn to try to go forward in whatever direction youre holding. If you do not like it then there is an option to turn that off and use controls relative to the ship instead.(similar to spaz 1)\n\nSome people complain about getting ganked by other captains so they have to give up cargo to survive, of course youre going to get harassed if youre a low level lone wolf, its a savage galaxy and they have no qualms about harassing a little guy. I solved it by joining a faction and fighting instead of surrendering. You will most likely get a battle partner from your faction to help out.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game but beware some people think the early game of the campaign is slow. They just dont know how exploit those around them appropriately, you can definitely get up and running quickly.","May 19","true","41.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Risotis/recommended/252470/","Risotis","Risotis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Risotis/","191 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR: This game is a bit of a mixed bag. There are things I like, and things I don't like. I have enjoyed my overall experience thus far, and can safely recommend this game.\n\nSPAZ. Probably my favorite top-down, space based, humorous, strategic, infuriating game. Certainly not without its problems, but this isn't a review for SPAZ. This is about SPAZ 2.\n\nIf you're expecting another SPAZ, but with more content, you're going to be disappointed. SPAZ 2 is more of an evolution than a sequel. Some things they do better than the first, some not so much. The single player is feature complete as far as I'm aware, and the EA period is for bugfixing, and adding an arena-style multiplayer. So yes, the game is absolutely playable as it stands, and I've encountered minimal bugs in my play time. The devs have been very quick to patch what bugs have been reported.\n\n\n\nPros:\n+Living galaxy. In SPAZ each sector was its own ecosystem, and nothing you did outside of that sector made a difference in that one. In SPAZ 2, almost every action you make will have some effect on the galaxy, big or small.\n\n+Modular ships. This part is not all sunshine and roses though, we'll touch on that later.\n\n+Choice between the 3rd person camera added to the game, or the traditional top-down SPAZ camera.\n\n+Multiple factions to play with or fight against, and player factions.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Editing your mothership. This is by far my biggest complaint about the game. To remove or replace a core block, you must remove any other block that is touching it. This means if you find an upgrade to the middle part of your ship, you have to tear half of your ship apart one part at a time, replace the part, and put it all back together. MinMax has somewhat alleviated this by automatically swapping a part you purchase with a similar part you are selling. So if you select your old core in the shop, and the new one and click buy, it will automatically equip the new one in that slot. You can not do this however on parts you find out in the open.\n\n-Slow ship movement and control. Your mothership is big. Cool. No matter how you build it though, it will always turn like a brick, and move like one.\n\n-No strategic overview. While you can use the top-down view from the first game, you do not have the same control over your strike craft. Simply "Focus this target", "Go to this location" and "follow me". You can not divide your ships and drones (if you have them), since they follow the same commands.\n\n\n\nPro/cons:\n+-Gone are the days of mining asteroids for rez. You simply go to a resource node, and click collect now. They are not random, and regenerate at the same rate over time. I personally enjoyed mining for rez, but this is very convenient.\n\n+-Feels like Mount&Blade in space. The developers have said that M&B is one of their inspirations for the game, so if you like that, you'll probably like this game.\n\n+-Currently all the story-based voices are spoken by a TTS program. MinMax has said they will hire voice actors to voice everything, but for now that is not so. Chatter between units is currently voiced.\n\n\n\nDon't go into this game expecting SPAZ 1.5. I've had a blast playing SPAZ 2. I hope they make it easier to edit your Mothership, but that's not a dealbreaker for me.","May 18","true","22.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's different than SPAZ 1 no doubt about it and a little of the gameplay has shifted a bit from the arcade style to minor management sim. This isn't a bad thing as the way it is accomplished adds so much more replayability and customization. I won't lie though until getting about half way through the campaign it seemed a little tidious as there were so many new features/differences and they were not all unlocked until 3/4 of the way through the campaign. Once your aware of all the features though it really opens the horizons and I love it so. The campaign is short and while I wouldn't usually recommend an early access title they have done it right. So please if SPAZ 1 was fun for you and you like a small bit more sim management please give it a heartfelt try.","May 18","true","32.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Then last night I ended up playing for almost 10 hours straight. I just couldnt stop!!!\n\nOnce you get past that initial hump the game opens up amazinly.  You start to understand all the different weapons and what they do, and you can actually afford to make the ship you want rather than just a hunk of random junk.\n\nYou also start to learn how affect the galaxy around you. All those other captains remember everything that they have seen. So you can make friends and enemies with your actions. They all have traits that make them better or worse friends.  For example Loyal guys will stay in your faction and are harder to take away from other factions. You have cowards that retreat more often, or Selfless Captains that love to help everyone.  You can start recruiting them into your faction and building starbases.  There is a lot of info on the factions and the captains, but its hard to go through right now. Hopefully they will make the UI a little easier to navigate.\n\n","May 19","true","20.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is much better than the first game, with a modular ship system that can be broken apart and tractor-beamed in battle, and makes for many differnt ship strategies. The 200 hundered independant and factional captains each have many persistant characteristics such as their invetory, relationship, level, threat level, tactics, ship build, etc...\n\nThere is some tweaking to do, but it more complete than many released games.

The ship building is boring.  There's no collecting ship blueprints or really any big ships or benefits to look forward to.  The game just wants me to grind grind grind.  All the upgrades are done in small increments (like adding a core module onto your ship of 12 cores), or upgrading a 3 star wing to a 4 star wing.  None of it feels consequential.

This is an early access review.  I'll update it once the game comes out or changes significantly.\n\nIf you're anything like me you spent 100+ hours in the original SPAZ.  You loved the combat, the ship customization, and applying those with tactics in real battles.  It was a nice place to experiment with ships as you were constantly finding blueprints from your downed enemies.  The creators have said they didn't want to create a direct sequel in terms of gameplay.  And they haven't.\n\nLet me give you the positives first.\n+ Game looks great.  They've clearly spent a lot of time on this.\n+ Controller support.\n+ New galaxy map has potential.\n+ You can create your own ships.  The interface for doing so is a little clunky.  It'll probably get better.\n+ You can create your own faction.\n+ Weapon attacks look really cool.\n+ AI captains who rememebr things.\n+ physics seem more polished.  You can ram ships and it sort of feels right when you knock off a piece you had a direct impact on.\n+ Not incredibly buggy.  Never crashed for me, never found anything broken.\n\n\nNegatives:\n- The tractor beam that you manually control.  We can only hope they come to their senses and change this back to automatic.   The sad thing is there's tons of useless things to tractor beam.   Like rocks and explosive containers.  The game doesn't have that same explosion of loot from enemies the original had in terms of data, goons, and rez.  Now it's almost all done outside of battle.   But he few things the tractor beam is used for-- my god.  Just wait until you see the annoyance of having parts of your ship knocked off and trying to tractor beam them back on during combat.   You're better off just reloading the game and figuring out a way to win without losing shields.\n- I hate the new loot system.  Getting random parts with random weapons.   It's one step foward and two steps back.  You're going to love creating your own ships, you're just going to be sad that no matter how much effort you put into it they always look kinda ugly unless you get incredibly lucky or want to sacrifice combat ability for looks.   They went away from the system where you can place weapons into hardened points on the ship.  I would have loved to see that here with the random parts that have random stats -- hardened points to place weapons you scavange or find.\n-  Battles are more chaotic.  Feels less strategic and more dumbed down.  Hard to figure out the weapons the enemy has or where you should target to disable them.   This is partially because there's no ship designs you can recognise.  Just heaps of random weapons.\n-  The escort ships (many straight from SPAZ1) are underwhelming and a chore.  They explode easily, you can't really customize them, and the enemy escorts can be a major time sink and annoyance without adding much challenge.\n-  Arena is overpowered.  I personally don't like arena, never did.  But maybe you like arena, but it's too rewarding and one of the only things you can do without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ different factions off.  So you just end up flying from sector to sector getting free resources and xp.   You probably can get your first 20 out of 40 levels just doing this.  Maybe more.\n-  The focus on creating your own faction falls flat.  Really grindy, impossible to figure out what your AI allies will do.   For example, if you attack an enemy with your allies around they may help, or they may ignore you and it results in a 1v3 unwinnable fight.   There's no way to marshall them -- and it all ends up being rather pointless.  Remember mass effect 3 and gather allies throughout the game to increase your faction strength?  Yeah, about as pointless.\n\nEarly access quirks:\n+- Voice acting isn't done yet.\n+- Balance on weapons is really bad.\n+- AI needs a lot of work.\n+- Economic model needs tuning.\n\nAll in all, this is the product of a lot of time and love.  I have no doubt the creators will keep going and polish this up.  I'm happy to have supported them especially given the hundreds of hours of enjoyment from their first installment.   Unfortunately, due to their responses to critisism so far I have no expectation that they are going to budge on many of the controversial aspects of their changes from SPAZ1.   For that reason, I can't recommend this game at this time.  It simply for me was a bit of a chore  to play and a disappointing culmination of waiting half a decade for another installment.\n","May 23","false","19.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Maybe i only misread the dev-blog's, in that and the talk about the new game, i had understand it to be near the first one but improved with more features that would be fun.\n\nThe sad in my view, they put in a handful of good features as in many games a few really bad features but now the really bad, they ripped old features out that the game lost its soul an appealing for me. :( I tried ~80Minutes to have fun with the game but only what i saw is the sadly void that remaind where the old good features had their places bevor they got thrown out.\n\nSo the rest in short, i hope they fix it if its still possible.

SPAZ 2 has so far received very mixed reviews, though if you take a look you will find the majority of those are criticisms comparing the game to SPAZ 1.\n\nI think that this is unfair as the game is not really a sequel, but rather a new vision from the developers.  If you are expecting the same style of gameplay as SPAZ 1 you may come away disappointed, however for anyone willing to try something new this is a game that I believe is considerably better.\n\nWarning - this is a lengthy review, please feel free to jump to the pros/cons and conclusion at the end!\n\nThe star of the show is the dynamic galaxy, that revolves around the factions and the 200 AI captains that inhabit it.  These captains have the same abilities as the player, though all have there own personal goals and agenda.  They will join and leave factions, fight, trade, and become infected with the dreaded zombie virus.\n\nAll captains have opinions of all other captains including yourself, and your interactions with them develop during the game.  You will likely join a faction yourself, and get pulled into one of the wars over territory, helping them to expand or even assisting them in establishing or upgrading star bases.  Later in the game you will have the ability to begin your own faction, allowing you to amass support in the struggle against the zombie infection.\n\nAh yes, the zombies. Starting from one 'Zombie Alpha', their spread across the galaxy infecting captains gradually increases, until their exponential growth becomes a serious threat.  Captains that are infected will remain as zombies and re-spawn on death, so it is quite possible to get to the point where humanity is overwhelmed.  I think this threat provides a much needed fear to the zombies and a sense of urgency in the game (which I felt SPAZ 1 was lacking), though I do feel the difficulty of the game might be off-putting to new players. Of course, this is early access so there may be adjustments made here before release.\n\nA potential downfall to the game at present may be the combat system.  Unlike SPAZ 1 you typically control the mothership rather then smaller craft.  The option is there to control the small ships, but as the motherships are the focus of the fight the tendency is to control them personally.  Because a fight will only contain a maximum of four motherships, this can leave fights seeming slightly smaller then SPAZ 1 despite there technically being far more ships involved when you include the smaller craft.  The action (for me at least) tends to involve heading for the enemy and blasting all your weapons into them, however for those more strategic players there is the option to be more tactful and control weapon groups, combat styles and of course customize your mothership.\n\nThe customization involves using modular components to build your ship, featuring engines, noses, and wings for speed, shields (I think?) and manoeuvrability respectively. Each component also has a weapon, which come in many varieties for different purposes ranging from shotguns to mini black-hole generators.  These are connected to core modules which form the centre of your ship, and you can increase the number of these as you level up.  This provides a lot of different ship options and numerous play-styles.\n\nAll modules are obtained from star bases or from other ships, built by the different factions in the game. This means certain factions will specialise in certain items, and you may have to hunt around to find the best weapons.  The downside to the system is that ships will often end up looking blocky and messy as you piece on any modules you can find.  Additionally, the ship builder can be cumbersome to use and for example if you want to replace a core you have to remove the modules attached to it. Again this is something that will likely be improved during early access.\n\nFinally, I will just note that the visuals in SPAZ 2 are amazing, and it is truly incredible that the entire game has been put together by just two people over the span of several years.  Please note that voice acting is not currently implemented in the game and it uses synthetic voices.  This is due to be changed before full release and there is of course an option to disable them.\n\nPros:\n- Highly engaging star map, with very dynamic gameplay that will vary on every play-through\n- The 200 captains are fun to interact with, and are where the game truly shines\n- Customizable ships and other strategic options makes numerous play-styles possible\n- Beautiful presentation, and humourful text\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive combat that can grow old\n- Despite the excellent tutorial, it is easy to miss points\n- Ship builder could use some improvement\n\nConclusion:\nSPAZ 2 is a highly ambitious game, and in particular the dynamic galaxy set-up provides large amounts of re-playability. It's system of an overworld map and battles with warring factions e.t.c. have been compared to Mount & Blade, or the excellent Space Rangers 2.  To anyone who likes those games, or is interested in trying something new, I strongly recommend giving this game a go!  At only $20, this is a no-brainer.  For anyone just looking for an improved SPAZ 1, I advise having a look at the many Lets Plays of the game and judging whether you would enjoy it based on those\nplaythroughs.\n\nMy many thanks to the developers for their hard work making this game!!","May 20","true","12.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Lots of loot and ship customization. Basic skill system. Nice AI faction / captain rep system. The battles feel huge and epic with lots of explosions/effects and by far my favourite part of the game. You can break parts off by shooting / ramming the other ship.\n\nGreat value for the price. This is more a beta than a early access game. The game feels complete, but there is still some bugs that needs to be sorted out.\n\n10/10 - Epic capital ship style battles\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONSI have 105 hours of playing SPAZ 1. First off this is nothing like the first one. Sure you can switch to the classic top down view. But the feel of the game is completely different. At first I was a bit disappointed, but I trust MinMax and gave this game a chance.\n\nMy trust was not misplaced as I really enjoy this challenging game. For me this game is 'n bit more difficult than the first. But I think it has to do with different play styles.\n\nSHIP HANDLING AND BATTLESFor me the first one was more top down arcade type of action like Star Control. This game's combat pace is a bit slower but in a big capital class ship battle good way. Think big ships on the ocean trying to out maneuver each other. Plus the close and personal view makes the battles look amazing.\n\nThe ship battles truly feels like something out of a star wars/star trek/battlestar galactica space opera battle. Huge capital ships putting down the hurt and smaller ships trying to do some critical damage or harass.\n\nIf a ship’s shields are down you can ram them to damage and even break of parts like the engines, nose or weapons. Or target them manually and shoot them off.\n\nNot only should you pay attention to your ships shields, but at your capacitor energy levels. It it is drained you need time to eject the spent one and load a new one. In this reloading window the ship is very vulnerable. You can’t shoot and your shields won’t recharge, but the same counts for the enemy.\n\nSHIP DESIGN / CUSTOMIZATION Depending on your ship design you can create a long ship with a lot of broadside weapons or a shorter ship with a wider backend for more engines and speed or a wider front end for more nose pieces for more shields or any other combination you can think of. Like an upside down L-shaped ship, which worked great for me in the campaign.\n\nIt will causes less sleep and productivity because you will keep on thinking about ways to improve your ship design throughout your days and nights.\n\nRESOURCE AND LOOT GATHERING The painful grinding of mining and resource collection from the first have been replaced by nodes/POIs where you can quickly farm some on the galaxy map. There is still some grinding and I have yet to play a game without some grinding. The ship components is random generated and you have to fly around and search for the correct parts a lot! But I don’t really mind that, it's like doing a thousand rifts / bounties in Diablo 3 to get the loot you need.\n\nSKILL SYSTEMUnfortunately the skill system is dumbed down or simplified a lot from the first one. I would have liked to be able to specialize in laser weapons or drones for example. But there is a few nice skills to choose between like weapon/shield boosts, trading price inc, scavenging.\n\nDIPLOMACY AND FACTION SYSTEMI really like the diplomacy or faction system. Especially the in depth detail of the AI captains. You can see why they like/don’t like you and what you did to them. In my first sandbox game I made too many captains angry and I was swarmed with bounties to the point that I just started a new game as it was to painful to keep getting killed. So you need to think about what you are doing and to whom. You can also bribe captains to increase their opinion of you. Or just put a bounty on that one captain that stands in your way :D\n\nEARLY GAMEYou start the game very very weak and need to scavenge / exploit (help strong ship against weaker ships) / do arena battles (low risk) / destroy a small raiding party of a rival faction / pick up lore POIs. The start can be a bit hard and tricky, but it forces you to explore the map and interact with the other captains.\n\nMID GAMEIt is more about leveling up so you can use more core pieces to increase your ship size.\nYou can either join a faction and help them get stronger or create your own faction or a bit of both. Also more collecting resources and improved ship pieces.\n\nLATE GAME / ZOMBIESDepending on where the zombies start you need to carefully plan how you are going to stop them. If they kill one of the 200 AI captains in the game they are permanently converted to their side even your own faction members.\n\nCAMPAIGN / STORYThe campaign feels more like a tutorial or preparation for the sandbox mode which is the way the game was meant to be played. So don’t expect a deep and compelling story like homeworld or KOTOR for example. There are some good bits of lore and references to the previous game.","May 23","true","23.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/recommended/252470/","Insignus","Insignus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/","520 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary: SPAZ 2 is an early access 3D space combat shooter with RTS elements from MinMax games. It has a strong open-world orientation, interesting combat and customization mechanics, good narrative support from quirky and entertaining original characters, and a responsive development team.\nKey innovations over the original SPAZ include player factions, competitive NPC captains, more customizable ships, a better resource mechanic, and 3D graphics. As of this review, it has been out for a week and a half.\n\nPROS\n- Open World Environment\n- Solid gameplay\n- Strong Early Access demonstration of key concepts and core mechanics\n- Unique and quirky main characters\n- Good Graphics, with strong explosion, beam, and particle effects.\n- Rewards Lateral thinking (You can win by tractor-throwing rocks and debris at people)\n- Customizable to individual play-styles\n- Narratively Original Zombies\n- Responsive Developers\n\nCONS\n- Not the 1 to 2 Sequel die-hard fans of SPAZ were expecting.\n- Currently lacks multiplayer support (Planned and apparently designed)\n- Some issues with game balance (Progress appears to be ongoing)\n- Temporary Voice Acting (Computer synthesized, yet oddly hilarious).\n\nPrice: $19.99 USD\n\nRecommendation: If you like space combat games with an open world bent, are a fan of the original SPAZ, or just like saving the universe from zombies, I’d recommend you buy this game. At the very least, check out the gameplay videos on the store page.\n\nLong Review: Do you like shooting things in space? Do you like fighting hordes of zombies that were previously your friends and/or enemies? Do you like open-world adventures that let you design your own solutions to a problem? If you answered yes to any two of those questions, SPAZ 2 is a game you should try.\n\nSo what is it? Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is a third-person space combat shooter from Minmax games, a small, two man indie dev studio that brought us the original SPAZ.  For those of you who haven’t played it, SPAZ was a top-down 2d shooter that saw the player zipping around the galaxy, building up their mothership in order to face down a zombie threat.\n\nSPAZ 2 is a totally new game, now in 3D, and using a new modular ship system that allows players to assemble (And re-assemble on the fly) their own custom mothership from a variety of parts. The part selection for Early Access is already pretty good, and given how this studio approached the original game, we can only expect additional weapons, parts, and zany components to be added over time.\n\nThe core innovative change for SPAZ 2, and what provides the most depth in its gameplay, is its faction system. The game starts with 200 Non-player captains, people who have their own fleets, interests, goals, and personality traits. They’re also after the same resources that you are – meaning they are competing with you to power up and expand their arsenals. They level up, add components, and get in fights just like you do. They will also join factions, which compete with each other to expand their empires and control more of the game map.\nThis is where you come in. Players can create their own factions, and rally (Or bribe) captains to their cause, enabling you to square off with other factions to control even more resources and territory. You can choose to either go for an all out war by beefing up your captains, or you can focus on building alliances and playing diplomatically, by paying other people to wreck up your opponents.\n\nThe open-world nature of the game is what contributes the most to its fun factor – there are a couple of different ways to solve problems, which you can adapt to your playstyle. The mothership customization mechanic is one of the best examples of this. Each ship has a number of slots for core modules, determined by your character level. You then attach parts to those modules, each of which has a different type of weapon on it. Bigger modules mount bigger, better weapons, so as you get more cores, your ship gets more dangerous and unique. Having problems with a particular faction’s preference for heavy shields? Chop off a wing or a nose and add more beam weapons, ion bombs, or shield sapping missiles. Getting hassled by people welding on too much armor? Toss some cannons on there and start cutting components off the enemy, or melt their armor off with volumetric acid clouds!\n\nYou heard me right. You can steal components from your enemies. If you notice a particular captain has that one module you’ve been after for a while, fight him, focus fire on it, and make it yours! Just remember that there are only 200 other people for you to interact with, and that they all know each other, and they’ll all remember what you did. Running around wrecking people up might make you the biggest, baddest ship on the block the fastest, but it’ll make it harder to build up your faction if you’re reckless. This is just one example of something I made:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688282152\n\nI personally found this game to be pretty fun, but I do have to note the criticism that many fans of the original SPAZ have raised. In particular, you’ll note that some other reviews are often negative in this regard. It is true that SPAZ 2 is not a direct, carbon copy sequel of SPAZ.  I should note, however, that the original SPAZ, when first released, did not have many of the defining features it has now, features which many people felt made the game a truly unique and engaging experience. The Developers took the extra time to add those features, and listened to the community over a few years before SPAZ became what it is today.\n\nFinally, I also have say this is one of the most complete and least crash-prone Early Access games I’ve ever played, especially from such a small studio. The campaign mode is complete, and a majority of the promised features have been demonstrated. That said, the game did have a rocky start with some tuning and balance issues, but the Devs do appear to be responsive to concerns raised by the community.\n\nOverall, I’d give this game an 8.7/10, with a caveat that it is an Early Access game, and that there are very promising signs and clear opportunities for the game to expand and grow. I definitely recommend that you buy this game, or at least check out the demo videos on the store page.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful!","May 23","true","49.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Has a possibility of co-op in the future (they say the reason for no co-op is cause of how the map works. Easy fix.. Simultaneous turns), but still doesn't feel like SPAZ. Could have just updated the graphics of the old game, added multiplayer, maybe added a little more content and it would have been the next best thing ever...\nIf they added multiplayer I doubt my friends and I that loved SPAZ so much would even bother anyways.\n\nFeels more like I'm playing Windward in space than SPAZ.

There's no longer strafing however wtf does it matter anyways since you can't dodge anything anyways (correction: Dev said you can evade one thing when I asked.) ?\n\nIf you like flying in circles then this game is for you.

Part of this might be because they don't have much of an oomph to them. The lag of feedback and numbers in combat doesn't help.\n- Max 4 ships can fight eachother. This makes combat fairly unepic and if 3 captains gang up on a 4th, it is impossible for anyone to help the 4th captain.\n- No more missions or special events except for a few in the campaign. You either fight a few strikecraft (raid), other motherships (not as epic as it sounds like) or a starbase.\n- Said motherships look terrible with the way parts are stuck together.\n- You can focus individual parts to force the enemy mothership to eject it and then get it as loot. This sounds great, but rarely happens outside of arena (where you don't get the part), either due to the enemy running from you and because of the spawn distance you won't get much of a chance to damage them or your allies just blow them up before you can "dismantle" them.\n\nI can't recommend SPAZ 2 as a sequal or as a game unless you really wan't more of the story and lore.

If you want to play an upgraded version of SPAZ 1 you should absolutely not get this game.\n\nYou know how you really loved SPAZ?  It was a pretty cool game.  Top down, interesting mechanics, a bit same'y combat (yet fun as hell,) interesting research projects to outfit your ships, different tech, running over people before they become your crew and hearing them splat on your hull, easy tactile control of what you wish to do, fast paced combat, ect., ect.  Remember that?\n\nAwesome.  Now replace all of that.  All of it.\n\nResearch?  Nope!\n\nVaratibility of outfitting your ship?  Actually yes, but it is combersome, and the tiles feel like badly made erector sets so I find myself staring blank eyed as I load one side of my ship with missles and the other with all the crap that will obliterate my enemy.\n\nCombat? The combat is a hell of a lot slower (or at least feels like a snales pace.)  It's not about doding bullets while at the same time blasting away at the enemy.  Nope.  This game is now about positioning.  Basically a great tactic is to slam your ship right into their rear end and proceed to use your high powered nose blasting weapons to obliterate the opposing ship.  Granted this may change, but I'm not playing a game where if I can keep putting a bunch of little asteroids (that are all over the place so I have to also time my shot.)  The battle maps feel almost all the same and there isn't enough terrain to maneuver through considering your ships move sooooooooo slow.\n\nWhat bugs me most about this is that it's removed all the skill that I loved about SPAZ 1.  Have a small ship you want to pilot instead of the mother ship and a hell of a lot of skill piloting it?  You will still lose.  Period.  SPAZ you could overcome this, but in SPAZ 2 just strap yourself into the bone room and feel the penetration.\n\nDiplomacy?  Just as clunky.\n\nI get that this is early release.  But as the game is right now?  Woof.... because I really can't see it changing so dramatically to become what I loved about SPAZ 1.","May 17","false","2.5"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","26","51","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowCluster/recommended/252470/","ShadowCluster","ShadowCluster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowCluster/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, I'll write a review since I already played a lot of this game.\n\nQ1) Is it worth it?\nDepending on your own value you put on 20 dollars and your own time, I'd say if you enjoyed SPAZ, you may enjoy this.\n\nQ2) But it isn't the same as SPAZ.\nIt is its own game as a sequel to SPAZ. I personally found SPAZ's progression system to break really easily as you go through different layers of map, and most of the progression being number checks and your own ability to pilot the ship.\nThe world map and relative time helps in keeping the world both vibrant in activity and not stressing you on making quick decisions. Each activity you plan to do limits what else you can do, but that is the nature of a spacial strategy game.\n\n\nNow onto my own impressions of the game.\n\nProgression\nI am several qualms with the progression system, so here are my thoughts.\n- Too Combat Focused. To level up outside of combat, you need to explore (miniscule amount) or collect lore. This leads to situations where 3 back-to-back battles will naturally leave you far ahead compared to if you took your time not aggravating everyone.\n- Too reliant on perks for power ups. This leads into another issue I have; a lot of the perks are way too powerful. The +X% Damage will power up your ship a lot and the jump in statistics doesn't help in the way of strategy. You either need to pass a skill check or kite your way to victory.\nAll in all, the flow of the game is generally the same. You can do things differently, but there is always an optimal route to things.\n\nShips Building\nEarly on, you are scraping anything you can find and using it, which fits the theme well.\nLater on, you sell of most of your junk.\nThe ship building is less than optimal, where the best ships are not the prettiest. You see straight-line monstrosities and L, Z and U shapes on the board. There is no incentive (as of this review) to box in cores instead of spacing them out for slots.\nThe parts themselves are not particularly unique, and will likely disappoint you if you are looking for a good loot simulator.\n\nCharacter Building\nThe interactions, though seemingly lively, is very linear. Most of the captains act the same way, and their traits are not very indicative of their actions either. If they like you, they will help you. If they don't, they may attack you.\nHowever, you grow some attachment to some characters if they saved your ♥♥♥ a few times early on. This also brings up some interesting interactions across games, and if you encounter them as a zombie.\n\nBattle System\nGood, but very 2 Dimensional (AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY)\nA lot of the progression comes from 'take down shields', 'kill them'.\n'Destroy annoying strike ships', 'get away from that fail gate', 'kite til they die' and 'ohgodgetawayfromme' are also some actions you may take.\nIt is interesting some manuevers you can do and the ramming system is also satisfying, but generally you either kite since they are stronger than you, or go straight up to them and auto-win.\nIt would be interesting if enemies could dump armor like in SPAZ to speed up, but that is a small nitpick. I'd say it is enjoyable but repetitive, and in some cases, slow.\n\nResource Management\nNot very interactive. Scrap is used for everything, Rez is a secondary currency that is used for moving faster (when you git gud, you will never run out), and goons can be picked up through fights. The latter two however, are generally gotten through fights. This may force players away from other activities to seek battle with their mortal enemies for the 10th time.\nThe mark-up percentage should be displayed with the trade window; not sure why it isn't.\n\nOverall\nA good adventure and strategy/management game set in space. The latter part could use more work, but for an EA it is definitely playable. I'd say pick this up if you have the time, as the team will most likely fix a lot of the current problems before release later on.\n\n\n\nStory Time:\nI battled with an alpha after my 3rd playthrough on Default Sandbox, and he was threat 80-ish with two other zombies around level 40 and 50. I was threat 63 myself with an engine and pulsar centric-build, with ion missiles to take down shields from afar. As the battle started, I went to the weakest ship (the one without strike ships) and boosted into him. His shields went down from the ion missiles, so as I rammed it, about one third of his hull went down. I kept boosting despite no damage, as there was an asteroid behind him. As the collision happened, he took another chunk of damage, before the damage of him stopping/me still going also registered, giving me a clean kill within the first 30 seconds of the battle. It went from a long 3v1 to a shorter 2v1 with kiting. The insanely fast kill made my day.\n\nI also like doing this if another enemy ship is behind them, since they will also take ramming damage if they collide with other friendly ships. So, ramming ships into other ships works.\n\nMoral: Ramming off parts works. Ramming ships into other things also works.","May 22","true","43.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Compared to SPAZ 1, they've done away with the hundreds of star systems and mindless grind of unlocking all the gateways. Instead you have your overhead view of the galaxy where you fly to your destinations in real time with all the other 200 captains and raiders. You collect/steal resources from nodes from here. The best places to raid are other captains but this comes with greater risk and a history of behavior. The biggest problem with this is that some captains start with a much higher level and easily crush you if provoked.\n\nThe real game play is the spacial combat. The typical shield/armor/hull composition returns with the typical laser/cannon/missile counters but feels very generic at the early levels. A neat new mechanic is that you can blow pieces off enemy ships and weaken them in real time but I find that by the time this starts to happen they're already sure to die. It looks cool too.\nWhat's particularly horrible is the random infestation chance where zombies invade your battles and become more threatening than you and your opponent could handle combined but there's plenty of hotfixes coming to deal with balance issues and bugs in the early access.\n\nYou can even start your own colony and recruit other captains but it's terribly grindy and maybe even necessary later in the game. What the game is really missing are random missions popping up. The system works well to contain itself but could use some chaos to liven it up.\n\nThe best and worst part of the game is the ship design. It's left entirely in your own hands to create your own mothership and equip it with the weapons you want to use. And every AI captain does this as well offering an array of unique ships to combat. The problem however lies in finding the pieces with the right weapons on them. Flying from base to base hoping they have what you want or need can be frustating when you constantly turn up nothing.\n\nThe game definitely lacks some polish where many features that exist could easily have more meat on them but there's a lot of potential that shouldn't be too difficult to add later on.\n\nThe worst part of this game has to be the current level-up system. It's nice that you can increase your overall ship size but you can pick one out of three randomly generated upgrades which can impare your intended play style. This is one feature I'd love to see reworked.\nThere's also the missing mass of tiny jetisoned goons and rez to collect in battles.\n\n","May 22","true","32.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

They must not have read anything about it or watched any videos for the last 4 years.\n\nThis is a sequel, many sequels differ from the original through game play, but keep the lore and even transition characters through games.\n\n"Sequels" that do not change gameplay but add "more guns" "more characters" "more armor" "improved graphics" are in fact add-ons that masquerade as sequels (you can charge more for sequals). The quickest way to identify these "cash grabs" is by examining when they are released. If it's close to one game a year, that is a pretty good indication that they shorted the development time and passed those savings onto you, in the form of bad or worse story, game length, character, ect.\n\nSadly, these are all many younger gamers know and it seems they look forward to it.","May 19","true","36.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I personally found SPAZ's progression system to break really easily as you go through different layers of map, and most of the progression being number checks and your own ability to pilot the ship.\nThe world map and relative time helps in keeping the world both vibrant in activity and not stressing you on making quick decisions. Each activity you plan to do limits what else you can do, but that is the nature of a spacial strategy game.\n\n\nNow onto my own impressions of the game.\n\nProgression\nI am several qualms with the progression system, so here are my thoughts.\n- Too Combat Focused. To level up outside of combat, you need to explore (miniscule amount) or collect lore. This leads to situations where 3 back-to-back battles will naturally leave you far ahead compared to if you took your time not aggravating everyone.\n- Too reliant on perks for power ups. This leads into another issue I have; a lot of the perks are way too powerful. The +X% Damage will power up your ship a lot and the jump in statistics doesn't help in the way of strategy. You either need to pass a skill check or kite your way to victory.\nAll in all, the flow of the game is generally the same. You can do things differently, but there is always an optimal route to things.\n\nShips Building\nEarly on, you are scraping anything you can find and using it, which fits the theme well.\nLater on, you sell of most of your junk.\nThe ship building is less than optimal, where the best ships are not the prettiest. You see straight-line monstrosities and L, Z and U shapes on the board. There is no incentive (as of this review) to box in cores instead of spacing them out for slots.\nThe parts themselves are not particularly unique, and will likely disappoint you if you are looking for a good loot simulator.\n\nCharacter Building\nThe interactions, though seemingly lively, is very linear. Most of the captains act the same way, and their traits are not very indicative of their actions either. If they like you, they will help you. If they don't, they may attack you.\nHowever, you grow some attachment to some characters if they saved your ♥♥♥ a few times early on. This also brings up some interesting interactions across games, and if you encounter them as a zombie.\n\nBattle System\nGood, but very 2 Dimensional (AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY)\nA lot of the progression comes from 'take down shields', 'kill them'.\n'Destroy annoying strike ships', 'get away from that fail gate', 'kite til they die' and 'ohgodgetawayfromme' are also some actions you may take.\nIt is interesting some manuevers you can do and the ramming system is also satisfying, but generally you either kite since they are stronger than you, or go straight up to them and auto-win.\nIt would be interesting if enemies could dump armor like in SPAZ to speed up, but that is a small nitpick. I'd say it is enjoyable but repetitive, and in some cases, slow.\n\nResource Management\nNot very interactive. Scrap is used for everything, Rez is a secondary currency that is used for moving faster (when you git gud, you will never run out), and goons can be picked up through fights. The latter two however, are generally gotten through fights. This may force players away from other activities to seek battle with their mortal enemies for the 10th time.\nThe mark-up percentage should be displayed with the trade window; not sure why it isn't.\n\nOverall\nA good adventure and strategy/management game set in space. The latter part could use more work, but for an EA it is definitely playable. I'd say pick this up if you have the time, as the team will most likely fix a lot of the current problems before release later on.\n\n\n\nStory Time:\nI battled with an alpha after my 3rd playthrough on Default Sandbox, and he was threat 80-ish with two other zombies around level 40 and 50. I was threat 63 myself with an engine and pulsar centric-build, with ion missiles to take down shields from afar. As the battle started, I went to the weakest ship (the one without strike ships) and boosted into him. His shields went down from the ion missiles, so as I rammed it, about one third of his hull went down. I kept boosting despite no damage, as there was an asteroid behind him. As the collision happened, he took another chunk of damage, before the damage of him stopping/me still going also registered, giving me a clean kill within the first 30 seconds of the battle. It went from a long 3v1 to a shorter 2v1 with kiting. The insanely fast kill made my day.\n\nI also like doing this if another enemy ship is behind them, since they will also take ramming damage if they collide with other friendly ships. So, ramming ships into other ships works.\n\nMoral: Ramming off parts works. Ramming ships into other things also works.","May 22","true","43.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Compared to SPAZ 1, they've done away with the hundreds of star systems and mindless grind of unlocking all the gateways. Instead you have your overhead view of the galaxy where you fly to your destinations in real time with all the other 200 captains and raiders. You collect/steal resources from nodes from here. The best places to raid are other captains but this comes with greater risk and a history of behavior. The biggest problem with this is that some captains start with a much higher level and easily crush you if provoked.\n\nThe real game play is the spacial combat. The typical shield/armor/hull composition returns with the typical laser/cannon/missile counters but feels very generic at the early levels. A neat new mechanic is that you can blow pieces off enemy ships and weaken them in real time but I find that by the time this starts to happen they're already sure to die. It looks cool too.\nWhat's particularly horrible is the random infestation chance where zombies invade your battles and become more threatening than you and your opponent could handle combined but there's plenty of hotfixes coming to deal with balance issues and bugs in the early access.\n\nYou can even start your own colony and recruit other captains but it's terribly grindy and maybe even necessary later in the game. What the game is really missing are random missions popping up. The system works well to contain itself but could use some chaos to liven it up.\n\nThe best and worst part of the game is the ship design. It's left entirely in your own hands to create your own mothership and equip it with the weapons you want to use. And every AI captain does this as well offering an array of unique ships to combat. The problem however lies in finding the pieces with the right weapons on them. Flying from base to base hoping they have what you want or need can be frustating when you constantly turn up nothing.\n\nThe game definitely lacks some polish where many features that exist could easily have more meat on them but there's a lot of potential that shouldn't be too difficult to add later on.\n\nThe worst part of this game has to be the current level-up system. It's nice that you can increase your overall ship size but you can pick one out of three randomly generated upgrades which can impare your intended play style. This is one feature I'd love to see reworked.\nThere's also the missing mass of tiny jetisoned goons and rez to collect in battles.\n\n","May 22","true","32.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Pirates! Zombies! Numerals!\n\nWhile some people seem to be upset that SPaZ 2 isn't the same game as SPaZ 1, I am not one of them. I enjoyed SPaZ 1, but this new game is a lot of fun in its own right. A good shorthand to highlight the difference between the two games is that the original SPaZ played a lot like the old Star Control games, while SPaZ 2 feels much more like Mount and Blade in space.\n\nMy experience with the game is almost entirely in the Sandbox mode, but that sandbox has been a lot of fun to play around in. The ship customization is surprisingly robust. At a glance it seems incredibly simplistic: just snap blocks together and build your LEGO-style spaceship. After building and rebuilding your ship a few times you will definitely start considering just how to arrange your core blocks to get just one more engine, or just one more gun.\n\nSPaZ 2 is not a hardcore space simulator. It's space is 2.5D, like Rogue Galaxy or Starship Gemini. It's colourful, doesn't take itself very seriously; and like Mount and Blade it is a game that you can play for 10 minutes to fight a single battle, or sink hours at a time into your grand campaign to unite the star captains of the galaxy against the zombie menace.\n\nI do not regret buying this in the slightest.","May 24","true","25.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Screw that, I thought, and decided to battle it out only to find at the last moment one of his buddies joined the fight as well.\n\nI may have been outgunned and outclassed, but my ship was fast and I could out manuever them. The battlefield was full of debris like explosive barrels that I could use my tractor beam to fling at them while my reactor core was reloading and weapons were offline.\n\nAfter a long and white knuckle battle I managed to blow up my attacker's faction buddy, but only at a cost to my own ship. Power was fluctuating in the habitat modules, two of my four engines were scorched and  barely operational and I was missing a thruster wing. While my nemesis was reloading his core and his weapons were offline, I moved in hoping to strike a decisive blow, only to realize I'd made a mistake.\n\nI'd managed to get his shields down and land a few shots on his own engines, but by that time his weapons were online and my own shields were reduced to a mere sliver from the full broadside attack that followed. There was no way I'd be able to escape, as damaged as my ship was the next volley would probably be the end of me. So I did what any good captain would do in that situation: maximum power to shields and use every last bit of juice left in the engines for RAMMING SPEED!\n\nThe nose of my ship plowed through his engines in a fiery crash, sheering them away and sending parts flying in all directions. To my amazement I had survived and severely crippled my enemy, giving me the chance to follow up with a wave of attacks on his ship's now exposed and vulnerable core. He didn't last long after that, and in addition to the satisfaction of watching his ship explode, I had the pleasure of picking through the ruins for working ship modules to replace the ones I'd lost, using the tractor beam to attach them.\n\nTL;DR - This game is about as good of an early release as you can hope for. For such a small developer, the production values are impressive, and I love the idea of cobbling to gether a battle worthy ship out of random parts. Definitely a worthy sequel to its predecessor.","May 25","true","166.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a great mix of action-y space battles, blowing up other ships and looting their wrecks, and open sandbox exploration.\n\nThe ship construction is one of the most unique set of mechanics I've seen, and it's a lot of fun to play around with ship layouts and loadouts - especially once you start getting your hands on bigger and better modules.\n\nThe open-world portion of the game is really free-flowing, encouraging exploration and movement right away, and there's lots of stuff to discover and use as you go.\n\nThe story and world-building are as interesting (and delightfully quirky) as in the first game, and finding all the Lore entries quickly becomes a rewarding task on its own merit.\n\nThere's minimal grinding or travelling in loops for resource collection and progression - the story does a good job of giving guidance through the early stages of play, and just exploring drove progression.  I never felt like I needed to hang around a small starter area or avoid engaging with the larger game.\n\nAll in all, if you like sandboxes and spaceships, this game is definitely worth your time!","May 24","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Basically, all you do is fight with your mothership.  All the hangar bays where you could pick out hulls and gear up the ships? Gone.  Completely.  Now additional ships are "strike fighters", throwaway ships that have no shields, cannot be modified in any way, and are basically meat to absorb a couple hits.\n\nThat's assuming you actually find combat -- 90% of your gametime will be spent looking at a very minimal, sparse, boring overmap where you click on nodes to collect resources.  Really.\n\nI rarely ever review games, but this is a rare exception: This game is not good.  The game is absolutely nothing like SPAZ 1.  It is nearly devoid of content. The campaign could probably be completed in an hour or two.

For people coming here because they loved the first game unfortulately there is literally no reason to play this.\n\nI'm sorry. I wanted to like this, but I just can't.

When you died in the first one you had to go and gather resources, goons, levels, and build back up so you could try again. In this one you just fly back to your base and grab what it has gathered for you. So there is no risk when you try to progres and there are no walls to break through like the first one had.\n~ Second: Short... the game is very short. I beat the campaign on the hardest dificulty in about 4 hours... where the first one took me the whole weekend ~about 30 hours~ to beat on the hardest dificulty.\n~Third: the ship building, the customization for your mothership that you bring into battle with you was a cool idea but ultimatly I found that the only style of ships that where worth building are the "L" shaped or a "C" shape to get the most bang for your buck and it seems like they cap out on size. I would try and change this by amking guns mount on to the top and or bottom of every ship like guns that require 3 spaces in an L shape or 4 in a square... make it look like tetrece and have the guns on the side of the ship be more for frosting and the ones on the top and bottom more for the body of the cake...\n~ Fourth: everything becomes really easy to kill really fast to the pont that it becomes a dull repetive motion with no real reward for doing it. In the first one they had events that poped up all the time like the metorite ~I loved that one~\n\n\nALL IN ALL: I gave this game a 6 because it's just pritty to play for a few hours then move on back to your main game to mostlikly never come back to this one again... because with steam every gamer has several hundred games in there library and over 35% of them have never been touched... But I did LVOE how the bad guy dies in the end =D that was hands down the best part of the game and made the 4 hours in the campaign worth it.","May 28","false","33.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suggestive/recommended/252470/","suggestive","Snuggly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suggestive/","38 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis has been one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had.\n\nLet me explain: This game is difficult, extremely difficult, many times more than SPAZ 1. However it gets to a point where the game becomes unplayable, even on lowest difficulty setting.\nThere comes a point in the story where you have to form your own faction, then the game turns into space diplomacy the game, something I was not expecting to happen. So what happens then? You have to start building bases all over this huge galaxy map, however if you are not very good at macro managing an entire faction of dudes then you will be completely S.O.L at this point\nYou can dump resources into a star base, it takes a TON of resources, a LOT of grinding to get enough to not only build it, but to then fund the star base’s strength to maximum, however at the point in the game I am at that doesn’t matter because you will just lose said star base the moment you move away from it. My maximum, threat level 70 star base dies within seconds of building it. It has gotten to the point where the game is no longer fun, as it just becomes “Run around the galaxy trying to get scrap so you can build bases.” Some factions if you step on their toes for SIMPLY EXCISTING will non-stop harass the ♥♥♥♥ out of your bases to the point you get pushed back to your capital, and then lose that.\nNow if you are how I am, and were dumping all you had to growing your strength to fight THE ZOMBIES then you are now in this situation that I am in:\n1) My own ship is now too weak to fight any other ship in the game.\n2) You have no resources to make yourself stronger to kill a base somewhere to make a capital base.\n3) Everyone else in the galaxy hates you to the point that you cannot ally with anyone, everyone hates each other, and now the zombies are taking over the map.\n\nThe devs themselves have said there is no ultimate “failure state” but you know what? That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The state I am is unrecoverable, and that some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.\n\nThe worst part about all this, the game springs this extra difficulty maco management crap many hours into the game so I have no ability to refund. I would have never bought this game if I knew this was going to happen.\n\nHeree is a copy-paste from a thread I started about this game, it says a lot more than this review:\n\nAfter 19 hours, becoming over level 100, and skipping an over 100 hour grind via salty, salty means I have beaten the game.\n\nI will not spoil it. This isn't about the ending, that I hated, it is about something much more.\n\nThis was the most hellish 19 hours of grinding and struggling in my entire video game life, doing the same thing over and over, getting crapped on continously in an uphill never ending battle only to give up and turn to the dark side myself because I realized 80 more hours of the same would have broken me.\n\nIf I can take anything from this experience you have given me dev it is this; for just under 18 dollars as of writing this, you have made me feel true dispair, anguish, and true defeat. I have never felt so defeated by a game in all my life, not even games so hard I simply cannot beat them. I held on and beat this game though, because I really like SPAZ 1, and I think you guys are a great dev team. I am not sure if your goal was to make people feel true disguest and such terrible, terrible negative feelings. Ya know what though? Because you made me feel these things, these horrible things, I have now come to enjoy life a little more. A tiny amount of pain caused to me by this game has given a tiny bit more pleasure in my life. One truly cannot know what pleasure is, without pain right?\n\nI am sorry for all the grief I have caused you in these forms, I made a lot of posts that were filled with the grand distress you've made me feel over the corse of these rocky 19 hours. I even tried to refund the game when I found out it turns into resource management the game! Value told me no, so I pressed on. I'm super glad I got nothing but 5 star rated parts and over level 100 or that boss rush ending would have made me make another salty post in these very forms!\n\nSome feedback:\n\nIn case your goal was NOT to do the things I said above, perhaps these could be some changes:\n\nNot everyone playing your game will get it. I never got what weapons to use, what combos were good, I never understood any of it. You need to put better tutorials in, or something. Hell maybe have one of those pop ups you can click on to the left of the screen explain "HEY YOUR SHIP WEAPON CHOICES ARE KINDA GARBAGE" This is a running theme. Many, many things could have been explained better.\n\nPlease put in a table that lists what upgrades you get, and at what levels, as well as a table showing what upgrades I picked. If this is already in the game, soz I never found it as it was never told to me. I had to just remember what I picked to evenly level my ship out, which I did, I think. Then past level 45 all I was 3-5% upgrades..? Kinda lame. I think you guys said you were working on this. Also more cores, but you're working on that too.\n\nThe zombies are too much, they really, really are even after all these patches. Again, lots of players are GARBAGE at your game either because we're crap at games or your game doesn't teach enough. Again, cap the zombies at a much lower number, by the end of my game almost everyone was a zombie, that is too much to deal with, without cheating.\n\nCap how many system can be taken by the zombies. I should have screen shoot the map when it was 70% zombie.\n\n100 hours of grind to beat the game. No. I am serious about this, my projections kicked back about a 100 hours to get what I needed to beat the game based off my exp, money, and follower gain per hour. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ no. 20 hours is honestly too much.\n\nIf you change ONE THING change thisYou need a FASTER way to give people money and stuff, a give all members X amount button, or in the very least not have to click through menus again. I had to click on every single caption and bribe them up with cash over and over and over. Think about this, if I have 1 million bux, and I need to bribe EVERY PERSON IN EVERY FACTION, I have to, for one person mind you; click on faction button - > click on the scroll button X number of times for whever - > Click on the person - > then click tribute - > how much I wanna give - > then OKAY! Based off how many people were in each tribe I had to click over 5,625 times when you could have given players who grind ♥♥♥♥ out and cheat the ability to GIVE ALL. I wasted over an hour on this alone.\n\nAnyway, thank you for you time reading this if you do read it post a "Sorry Snuggly" in the comments below. Or not, see if I care you 18ish dollar swindlers! I'll see you in hell as we play SPAZ 143 The Computer is the TRUE VIRUS ALL ALONG where you have to grind for 141 BILLION YEARS to beat the first act of the game!","May 19","false","19.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","2"

This would be OK if it was not incredibly tedious with actually rather few interesting options available early on.\n\nMuch of the game seems to be gated behind one grind after another. This was actually also kinda the case in SPAZ1 - but it was far more fun.\n\nFun is where this game falls apart. Combat isn't fun. In general you will either steamroll your enemies or fail miserably. Early on the vast majority of the combat is gated away from you because you start out with a junk heap and vast majority of enemies will wreck you - so you are stuck grinding for crap gear or joining in fights where 2 AI are engaged to "help".\n\nShip upgrades are very minor, very very expensive and tedious to do. The ship designer is incredibly tedious to use - I have no idea what they were thinking. You need to pull parts off piece by piece to replace anything. You can use the trade window to try to upgrade parts but it's not at all intuitive.\n\nThe "world" itself isnt' very interesting - yes there are factions, yes you can join them - but why? What makes them special? What are the differences? None of that really matters.\n\nThis isn't a 'bad' game, but it doesn't stand out anymore. There are better games than this in everything it does:\nYou want a cap ship combat game with a story? Starpoint Gemni 2 is better.\nYou want a space ship centric 4X?  Beyond SOL is better - and has coop.\nYou want a game where you upgrade a fleet and has great combat? Battlefleet Gothic is much better.\n\nSPAZ2 had a few things going for it, the open world, customization and originally the promise of coop.\n\nCoop is gone and the other aspects just aren't very good - so what it comes down to is this: SPAZ2 isn't a bad game but if you have a few hours to play a game, there are no real reasons to pick this one over the other offerings.","May 18","false","2.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

Each base gets a stock pile that you can collect later which makes this a better way to earn money than just doing arena.\n\n\n\nI have been waiting for this game for years and now that it is here I am disappointed. Please note that at the time this is written I have played around 16 hours and I am far enough in the story to start building bases.\n\n------------I would buy this game if you like to watch videos as you play a game------------\n\n------------My key points------------\n\n------Which brings me to the WORSTE part of this game, your ship. You spend all this money building a powerful ship… only to spend most of your time in arena flying a made-for-this-arena-ship. MOST OF THE COMBAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN SOMEONE ELSES SHIP!\n---Which brings me to the SECOND THING I HATE THE MOST about this game. It is a grind. No, you don’t get it, every single part of this game is a massive grind. You want that new ship part? Grind arena. You want to join a faction and by want I mean have to as there is no other way to progress the story? Grind arena. You want to build a base for some random faction you were forced to join(to progress the story)? Grind arena. But I like to play grindy games! Cool, so do I, please return to my first “worst part of this game.”\n\n------------My key points------------\n\nWhat is good about this game?\n\n-The graphics and sounds are great\n-The combat is solid and fun\n---Although the combat can be automated you need to choose targets on a ship and shoot pieces off the ship to get the most out of combat.\n---Although I have not done this it seems like you could build a missile ship that stays away and hammers at enemies or a close combat ship that drives right in and rips them apart. I go for a mix.\n-The interface, all of them from the HUD to the star map, is perfect.\n\nThe bad about this game.\n\n-This is another game that technically has “many ways to make money” but the truth is that one way is far better than any other to the point that doing anything else is a waste of time.\n---The Arena is the best way I have found to make money. In about 10 minutes I can blow through all the arena missions at a major base and have over 1k in “money.” But even this way of making money has its limits because once you beat a match playing it again gives around 25% of what you got the first time.\n------Which brings me to the WORSTE part of this game, your ship. You spend all this money building a powerful ship… only to spend most of your time in arena flying a made-for-this-arena-ship. MOST OF THE COMBAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN SOMEONE ELSES SHIP!\n-Money… There are three, THREE, types of money in the game. Sure they want to tell you that “REZ” is fuel for your ship and “goons” are needed to operate your ship but I sell them all the time. REZ is easy enough to come by that I don’t keep more than 50 on me. I keep just enough goons to stay above what I “need.”\n---Which brings me to the SECOND THING I HATE THE MOST about this game. It is a grind. No, you don’t get it, every single part of this game is a massive grind. You want that new ship part? Grind arena. You want to join a faction and by want I mean have to as there is no other way to progress the story? Grind arena. You want to build a base for some random faction you were forced to join? Grind arena. But I like to play grindy games! Cool, so do I, please return to my first “worst part of this game.”\n-The writing in this game is just as bad as the last game. I don’t have a problem with how the old game was written and this one is very similar it’s just… not engaging this time around.\n-I am only 16 hours in and I just built my first base... correction I just built the first base for the faction I was forced to join. I don’t have a base that earns me anything. I am not the leader of anything… At one point, about the time I stopped reading the story text, the “main character” points out that she saved the GALAXY from destruction and nobody knows or cares who she is.\n---I find it very poor writing that the team that saved the galaxy and has spent the last X number of years hunting down and killing left over bad guys is so broke their ship is made out of junk parts. It would have been much better if this game had started with the last mission to eradicate the zombie plague forever only to get our assess kicked and lose the moderately powerful ship we had.","May 22","false","29.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

But of course, being early access there are some big issues that could use rectifying.\n\nPROS\n1) The new camera view works really well and adds to immersion.\n2) The sandbox mode has a lot of customization which adds to re-playability.\n3) Personally I find the visuals very pleasing.\n4) The Arena fights give a lot of hands on combat training of the various systems without text heavy tutorials (though some more information would probably be helpful for those who never played the original).\n5) The ship building has a ton of customization to suit your combat play-style.\n\nCONS\nIt isn't as much better than the original SPAZ as I had hoped.  Luckily the creators are awesome, and will hopefully fix at least some of the following issues...\n\n1) Ship Building\n\nA scarcity of the best ship components makes it so you can go through a whole playthrough without ever being able to make the ship you want. A return of the blueprint system in order to make at least the base version of parts (such as the mass driver) would go a long way to making ship customization more satisfactory.\n\nAlso, the base building blocks of the ship  (the cores) never get a size upgrade. This limits how much you can customize the shape of your ship, with only a few basic designs being efficient enough to bother with.\n\nAnd finally, the mechanic by which you build your ships is cumbersome, with no ability to save multiple iterations, and no ability to easily swap parts of different size classes when they are positioned inside the ship (missile bays surrounded by core pieces).\n\n2) The 200 Captains\n\nEnemy captains appear to have no fear. If you build a base in a quadrant, captains who do not like you will come in and attack your transports and allies and steal your resources. This I expected. However, I did not expect that when your threat level out classes them by a large margin and you have destroyed their ship multiple times, they will keeping coming back for more. I found myself in a loop multiple times where I would destroy an enemy captains ship, then while harvesting the wreckage another captain would show up and attack. Then when I defeated and harvested that captains wreckage the first captain would show back up and attack. I would destroy him and harvest and the cycle would continue. Having the option to set an execution warrant within your own territory, making the escape pods of captains defeated within your quadrants targetable for destruction, would solve this problem in a most satisfying way. Having these captains die permanently and either never be replaced, or be replaced by new level one captains would add greatly to the gameplay, especially in sandbox mode.\n\nThe captain AI has almost no fear of the zombie outbreak. I often see transport ships and low threat level captains brazenly try to cross zombie territory unescorted. Factions with territory near the outbreak don't make any attempts at securing alliances with other neighboring factions. This does not lend itself to the atmosphere of a galaxy besieged by a deadly advanced zombie plague.\n\n3) Galactic Travel\n\nIn multiple playthroughs there were several quadrants that I never explored. Not because I didn't want to, but because of the prohibitive amount of game time and rez that it takes to move your ship from one side of the galaxy to the other. A personal gate system usable only by your ship which granted say... two gates at level twenty and an additional gate at every ten levels after that, would allow some much needed ease of travel. It is hard enough finding the parts you want in neighboring factions. Far away faction's parts are often a lost cause.\n\nIn the end game there does not seem to be any balance of goons and excess parts which allows for low rez high speed travel. I know the ship is much heavier by then, but still, finally building a super ship and not being able to afford flying it anywhere, is not cool.\n\n\n4) Wars Between Factions\n\nWar. War, never changes. Seriously. They are all the same. A text box pops up on screen notifying a player of a faction war, some ships fight, some raids are placed, some territory is lost. Then it ends. Over and over. The wars ought to be epic in scale, with battles between an unlimited number of ships, huge amounts of rez expended, vast swaths of territory lost, and a clear victor. Or maybe two losers if they expend enough resources.\n\nThere are no advanced war mechanics, which would make declaring war a worthwhile and fun activity. Such as setting up stationary or semi-stationary weapon platforms along territories and surrounding bases. The ability to select multiple faction captains to join in large scale strategic raids against these weapon platforms and bases. The ability to force surrender from quadrants in order to cheaply expand territory. The ability to subjugate or destroy captured captains of opposing factions.\n\n\n5) Miscellaneous\n\nLooting the wreckage of ships shouldn't take the same amount of game time as the entire space battle that created that wreckage.\n\nThe player has nearly no control over the actions and policies of captains they give quadrants to.\n\nThere are no missions outside the main campaign, and hardly any in the campaign. Even just some awesome pirate bounty quests would go a long way.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE MERCENARIES?!? At least lest us hire unaligned captains for wars or something.\n\nAnd perhaps about +9000 on the RPG elements. That's all. Just over 9000.","May 22","true","31.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

I just finished the campaign and in comparison SPAZ I was an epic game, this one sadly is not what i expected, it did the first couple of hours, but after that, i knew it will be a "rinse and repeat" kinda campaign. As a game developer myself one thing that i learned, is that when try to innovate you take 1/3 of what worked in your previous games and keep it for the next ones (Spaz1 progression, ore mining, missions, etc), 1/3 of the actual "next gen" feel and 1/3 of your wild innovation you envisioned, and then make the game. Of course if you don't stick to the plan a lot of things go sideways. I will be sincere, i was expecting this game for 3 years, and got a monumental dissapoinment, but i will still recommend it to my friends, because i love the franchise.

Would definitely recommend for fans of light hearted space exploration, resourcing, and combat type games.

I'm a long-winded sonuvabïtch!\n\nLet me start off by saying that this game is QUITE different from SPAZ 1, or as I prefer to call it these days, SPAZ(ABH). The gameplay, graphics, sound, hell, even weapon balances are completely altered. One of the most notable differences is the complete absence of skills. Instead, they've opted for giving you a selection of (presumably random) perks to pick from every time you level up.\n\nI both like and dislike this method, especially if it's random. If it's random, then that may make the game more interesting in the long run, especially when replaying it, but it also makes it a lot more difficult to get a balanced or specialized build going. It's a double-edged ion torpedo, really.\n\nHowever, the absence of skills and the use of perks instead lets you focus on the attributes of the perks, instead of being FORCED to waste, YES WASTE, skill points in a worthless tech tree, JUST to be able to equip a decent turret. YES, I'M LOOKING AT YOU, TURRET TECH TREE IN SPAZ 1. YOU WERE UTTERLY USELESS, AND A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOUR MOTHER!\n\nAnyway... back on topic. As is almost an absolute requirement for a proper sequel, the graphics have been updated, and lemme tell yas, they may have been charming and quite easy on the eyes in SPAZ 1, but HOLY FREAKIN' MOTHER OF A TURDBURGER, they look amazing in SPAZ 2! The change from 2D to full 3D (even though you still move along a 2D plane, SOMEHOW) has brought with it a slew of interesting backdrops, texture updates for ships, and a variety of excellently rendered doodads to litter the battlefield.\n\nThe sound has become a LOT better as well; as anyone who used The Carrier with full missile armaments and weapons on it in SPAZ 1 knows, the sound effects were not great. Not ear-bleedingly bad, but just... meh, in lack of a better word. Now, the sound is a lot more pleasing.\n\nOne of the features I was most excited about with SPAZ 2 was the new shipbuilding system, and my god, I never, absolutely NEVER, thought you could make it any simpler than the system in Pixel Pirates. But apparently, those glorious nutters at MinMax not only tried, but gracefully succeeded! It may not be as fun as I thought it'd be, but hey, it serves its purpose! And it really does give you a hard lesson in humility and the importance of balance, too. With great ship weight comes great responsibility. Or in this case, a great demand for rez!\n\nSee, rez has become less of a "be-all-end-all" resource in SPAZ 2, as it's now used primarily as engine fuel for your ship. Sure, it's also used to synthezise food for your crew, but that's an extremely minor expenditure compared to the new "rez drive" that the game's larger ships use. So naturally, a ship with a greater weight/mass, i.e. one with a great deal of modules attached to it, will expend a LOT more rez when traveling around. This makes the game interesting, without making it downright unfair, unlike certain OTHER games with fuel systems... *cough* Convoy *cough*\n\nCrew has also become a much more interesting factor in SPAZ 2, as they're now absolutely CRUCIAL to your survival, rather than a mere number that determines your hull repair speed, like they were in SPAZ 1. See, if you don't maintain a large enough crew for a big ship, you'll steadily suffer damage due to poor maintenance, overworked crew members, or whatever else may apply. They no longer just repair your ship. They're literally keeping it intact, and figuratively acting as the glue for your main vessel.\n\nLast but not least, the much-boasted-of feature of having a "dynamic universe". I can't complain about it being dynamic, because it really actually is, with every other captain in the galaxy/sector having their own personalities, political affiliations, goals, dreams, secret racist opinions... well, maybe it's not THAT complex, but they do have their own personality traits which alters the way they act in response to various events. Some approve of do-gooders who help the weak, others find such behaviour to be a despicable waste of firepower.\n\nIt also helps that they remember what happens. See, what AI in games often lacks is a cohesive MEMORY. They may react realistically to an event AS IT HAPPENS, but they'll forget all about it the moment it's over. If you attack somebody, everyone in the vicinity will witness this AND remember it. Some will like you for it, some will hate you, and some might not even care. But it makes the galaxy a lot more living.\n\nHowever, one thing I'm NOT totally okay with is the SIZE of the game world! See, I'm one spoiled motherfûcker when it comes to space games, having been brought up with classics such as Elite 2 and Freelancer, in which you really DID have incredibly vast amounts of space to explore. In SPAZ 2, I feel there's just a lack of space, and especially exploration, as every sub-sector only needs to be glanced at for less than a nano-second while casually speeding through it at hyperspeed, in order to map out the ENTIRE AREA.\n\nI'm not exactly thrilled about THAT. And the INCREDIBLY small scale (or at least what FEELS like a small scale) of the game world in and of itself leads to all of it feeling dreadfully same-y after just a few hours of playing. Maybe the world will somehow become "bigger" later in the game, or maybe the devs will release an expansion pack or even just DLC that'll make it less cramped and more spacious, but unless either of those things happen, I feel the game completely misses the absolutely most CRITICAL point of having a space-based setting: HUGE SCALE!\n\nAll in all though, SPAZ 2 is absolutely great. Not perfect, not by a long shot, but I can safely say that it's extended my list of games worthy of buying in Early Access to now include FOUR titles. And in case you're ESPECIALLY dumb: YES, THAT MEANS SPAZ 2 IS WORTH BUYING FOR THE FULL PRICE WHILE IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS, YOU UNDER-EVOLVED EXCUSE FOR A PRIMATE! 8.1/10","May 31","true","12.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

That is not SPAZ I used to play 4 years ago. I did not follow much on news about this game not to spoil my first impression of it when it is released. I waited this game too long.  My steam account was even created just to get this game when it is released.\nThere is a bit of disappointment for now but I think just because this game has different style then previous. The rest is great. Gameplay is fun. Replayability is infinite.\nI would not put an x of 10 points score here because it is in early access now. I would just say that you need to get this if you liked SPAZ.\nFor me this game now lacks only technology research ability for your faction, huge (I mean really huge, devastating, BADABUM) weapons that were on motherships in SPAZ 1... and that is all. The rest is SPAZ!\nI would probably keep both game and will play both SPAZ 1 and SPAZ 2 because those are so different and still are SO MUCH FUN!","May 19","true","25.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You are just a single particle of water in the flow of an enormous lake. As the game progresses, you start to make a name for yourself, slowly gaining strength and getting better and better equipment (thanks to those bandits which you decided to farm). Soon, you start to look at... bigger prey. As a result, you start munching on the little ships. one day, you decide, unintentionally, to ♥♥♥♥ off the entirety of a faction which will hunt you down. Luckily, they have an enemy, so you stay by them and work under their protection. You start to build a bond with them, and eventually you become an active member in the group. Now you're cooking with gas. Left and right, you fight and win battles with allies by your side. you gain equipment, scrap, and levels like crazy. Eventually, it's time to start something new. With confidence, you say goodbye to your faction, making your own faction in a place that you meaned to occupy for a long time. immediatly, people join your cause, and you make allies from your protector and enemies with your nemesis. More things can happen than you can normally see, but you enjoy it. Suddenly, you're one of the most powerful in the galaxy. you can even win fights of two against you. You can destroy entire factions if they get in your way, and give endless scrap to anyone you care for. This all began, with a lone, junk ship, and a vigilent heart.\n\n9/10. would do that all over again.","May 23","true","13.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I cannot blame anyone for being skeptical of these titles, sometimes they're finished, sometimes they're not.  This title is not finished.  There are many quality of life improvements and ways to break the eventual monotony of the game yet to be implemented.  Completion was estimated to happen between 6 and 12 months from now. That said, the original Spaz was a very enjoyable game, and development did not stop when it was released.\n\nIs this game as complete as the SPAZ and its expansion? No. Were the changes in design justifiable and/or good? Absolutely.\n\nThese games are created by a small team of dedicated geniuses, and are truly labors of love.  The community engagement and work demonstrated by this team is staggering.  This was a part of my decision to buy and support.  A lot of this community has been following the dev log on this for 3 years. This is as unusual as the feedback and consideration and involvement on part of the devs that allows for it.  While this is ultimately their product, in many ways it feels like a product of the fans.\n\nI in no way regret my purchase, if you want to witness its development and be a part of the conversation, I recommend it. Is there fun to be had in its current state? Absolutely. Does the game have problems? Absolutely. If you want a complete title, give it some time, but do not take it off your wishlist.

Though within that time you are basically playing the entire thing. However the excuses I see for their "No" vote is completely stupid. Such as "They havn't said anything about the future." Unlike most games they actually released a good version for their release and one that I personally don't feel needs additions. Now there are also people who have 56 hours when the game has not been released within the last 24 hours, but maybe they were testers.\n\nThis is a stratagy game, and there are a lot of things I still don't know about it, learning things here and there. Now the game itself is different from the initial game, by a huge margine. The game is still awesome but don't expect this to be a carbon copy of Spaz. What I would say is if you enjoyed spaz, and don't know if you want to try something different then what it was, maybe watch it on twitch... or use the steam refund if you really don't enjoy it. I found it pretty addicting.\n\nNow something people should know ahead of time is that multiplayer is not currently avaliable. I have not seen any information as to why, but the single player was what we had on Spaz, and we all loved it.So just get the game and enjoy playing it for the value it has. Not to mention that its not as expensive as a triple A title, like the garbage battlefront. This is 20 dollars for a really decent game that has the same kind of gameplay as mount and blade almost. Not as large scale, but you will see the similarities.\n\nTo be honest I personally have not experianced any bug what so ever. The game has good graphics, runs smoothly, has lots of auto saves. I have only had one crash which was right after it saved, maybe because it saved it crashed. I am unsure.\n\nI really don't want to go into a lot of detail about what the game has to offer because I want people to experiance it and enjoy it without me saying anything. And honestly if you want to check it over before you buy it, then go on twitch or youtube and watch it, stop reading reviews and look to see if its something you want to play.\n\nLook forward to seeing you all in multiplayer.

This gives no end of entertainment.\n\n| Things I feel neutral about: |\n\n~ You have to smack yourself in the face with powerups, if you don't feel like wasting energy mid fight. This amuses me.\n\n| Cons in relation to the original game: |\n\n- The movement system is beyond clunky, holy hell, it gets to the point where sometimes, for no reason, you just lose the ability to move forward mid combat, despite still having your engine and not sustaining serious damage\n\n- The building system for the mothership is clunky and frustrating, in no way even a pale shadow of the original's modification system. Want to remove a part from the middle of your ship? Tough. You have to bend over and remove every part attached to it, sweetie. Want to remove a part at all? Better hope the physics don't glitch out and just leave the part where it is so it snaps right back on. Want a specific part? Well, I'd like world peace, but we don't always get what we want. You get to just beg and hope that you get the part you need from the grace of RNGesus. While this does afford a certain sense of jury rigging, which fits the story, it really isn't as fun as getting what you need.\n\n- Faction relations. Want to ally with a faction so you can focus on the things that matter, such as anything other than senseless bickering and violence? Tough ♥♥♥♥, cupcake, you get to feed endless thousands of credits and countless good deeds into the maw of an unfeeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. Some AI captains will just hate you, and this would be okay. Hell, it makes perfect sense given the story. If you could actually permanently kill a captain. There's no sense of permanence.\n\n- You can't actually kill any other captain. The only tangible effect you can have is possibly maneuver them to kill themselves with a zombie-captain, which will infect them, and now you have a totally different problem. It wouldn't even be a problem that you can't kill a captain if they had to restart from scratch, but no, they get their ship right back from warranty or some nonsense. Your options, on the other hand, for getting killed is; 1: Save Scum, or 2: Throw away literally hours of progress in the interest of not save scumming.\n\n- Ganking from mean AI captains. Some captains don't like you. Some captains will chase you down across the galaxy with ships an order of magnitude more powerful components, repeatedly attempting to fight you. This would be fine, right? Nope, the game gives other captains who don't like you the opportunity to join in on the fun. Up to three. Your only option is to savescum, which can lead you into the unfortunate situation where your only recent saves leave you mere light years from the angry captains. I got out of three such situations by running really hard and scraping them off on bandits.\n\n- Totally useless "strike craft," which are differentiated from "fighters" by being slower, easier to hit, and only marginally better weaponry. Once your strike craft are gone, it seems that you can pull in reinforcements, but it doesn't seem very clear how many exactly. I find myself very often without a single strike craft to help out, while the AI stations that you can attack seem to have the ability to respawn them at will.\n\n- Runs really poorly when bigger battles really get going with horrendous orgies of particle effects. I've dropped down to well below 30 fps, despite the game not using more than half of the graphics card and CPU. Not sure if this has to do with Unity (the engine the game is made in) or the dev, but speaking as an amateur developer using Unity myself, this doesn't seem acceptable.\n\n\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to like this game. The dev tried their level best to innovate from the original game. But sadly, sometimes the wheel is round for a reason, and sometimes physically simulated EVERYTHING isn't done in most games for a reason.\n","May 21","false","10.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You no longer need to spend 30 min mining its all done on the star map wich feels like a game in its self. The combat is so fun! My favorite moment was when i was up aganst a much stronger ship than i, i knew i could not stand up to it head on so i started thinking outside the box. i used my tractor beam to fling a stack of acid barrels at the enemy and used my gravity bomb/missile. his health bar only moved slightly and i was so woried i was going to get my butt handed to me, but when the smoke cleared i saw that the acid melted all oh his parts off! He was nothing but a core so i just shot him while he could do nothing but sit there and take it!

Especially for a 2-man dev like Minmax.\n\nWhile on the outside the game looks fast, flashy and colorful, there is so much more "under the hood". The background sim with the 200 captains, the factions, relations, economy, its all well thought out.\n\nBuilding your own ship is interesting and offers a lot of different play styles. From longrange missileboat, carrier or closecombat laser/cannon boats, everything is possible.\n\nThe combat is tactical, can become really hard when you picked the wrong enemies. Disabling shields, punch through the armor and dismantling the enemy ship part by part is great fun.\n\nI won't spoil the campaign, the texts are hilarious/fun to read, the computer voices make me giggle, the boss fights are great (especially the final one).\n\nI'm looking forward on how SPAZ 2 evolves.

Ship parts.  I really, really wish there were a way to just swap out a single part from the ship builder screen.  I just read that you can essentially accomplish this during the "Trade" funtion with bases by trading out the part you want to swap, but it would be nice if you could just swap two cores with each other during the ship building screen without having to remove all the attached parts.\n\n2.  Ship builds.  Would it be possible to add the ability to 'remember' a certain number of previous ship builds, or at least core layouts?  There were times I would have been tempted to try out a part for a fight or two, but it wasn't worth rebuilding the entire mothership to give the part a try.  If I could quickly swap between core layouts, it might mitigate that.\n\n3.  Infections.  Late in the game, those get pretty viscious.  There were quite a few fights that I just had to restart after getting hit with a zombie bomb right after shields dropped.  I was toting around 3x as many goons as I was 'supposed' to, and my crew could still barely stay ahead of the infection.  Along the same lines, it would be nice if the 'infection repair' option from the main map could work faster.  Most of the time, once my ship got infected I could not complete an 'infection repair' without getting attacked by other zombie ships while trying to clear the infection out.  It led to eventul death with no possible escape.  That or an option to clear the infection out while you're in a fight, maybe take a hit to weapon fire/shield recharge rates, or have some kind of "infection killing" boost you could fire off to give your goons a short advantage?\n\n4. Death penalty.  The death penalty for players is harsh.  The death penalty for computer players seems to consist of the time it takes their escape pod to reach the nearest starbase, at which point they're back out there and ready to go.  It would be nice if they could at least require some sort of real time to rebuild in game.  Towards the end, if there are enough zombie captains, they'd basically have a stream of their captain's escape pods heading to the nearest base, while another stream of recently recovered captains were heading back out to fight me again.\n\n5.  Battles:  Not sure if it would be possible, but it would be nice if the battle fields could get a bit larger, both in how many participants there are, and the actual size of the battle field.  Everyone starts closely enough together at the beginning that in a full battle, everyone is clashing within 10 seconds or less.  If things were spread a bit further apart, it might make a clear target who's left alone, or an ally that you're going to have to rush to help before they get crushed.  I also was disappointed to find that many of the battles I wanted to join were already full, with multiple ships from the other side taking out my ally, but I know if I could have joined in they'd have a chance.  Not sure if it would work, but maybe reserve a spot for the human player in battles to always join in?\n\nOverall, the game was a lot of fun.  It's a fun space strategy/shooter.  Probably the most impressive Early Release I've ever played.","May 23","true","51.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People will rage about how they threw it's best stuff out the window (fleet building). However, it's still chock full of the usual silly charm of weird people and awkward conversations. That said this doesn't make it "Spaz 2". It's more like Spaz feat. Captain Forever, because ship building and combat is the meat of the game.\n\nYou now control only one ship, constantly upgrading it block by block in a cpt. forever style. The map is no longer nodes but a big circle sliced into sectors. Combat is a hit or miss. Viewpoint can be the good ol' top down or the new pseudo 3D. Ship Controls are still wonky AF with the AI throwing out all your bombs and missiles once in range. (It's since been patched and only starts firing if you "left click" while AI handles your other weapons). 200 or so Captains now inhabit the universe and are unkillable. They'll learn to love or hate your guts depending on how you treat them.\n\nThe lore is better than last time, with more written, explorable items in the world. Zombies are the main plot of the game and pirates not so much. (Everybody takes stuff without asking,even friendly factions and ships, so I guess that's sort of piracy? I do beat up anyone who touches my resources in my face, but they're numerous and will be back in a spiffy.)\n\nBandits are permanently level 6 and are screwed by everyone all over the galaxy. The player can freely milk relationship points by "aiding" in their destruction by showing up for a minute before they are destroyed. Battles have a maximum of 4 ships, this makes for a lot of luck factor when you try to take a stronghold. Will 2 enemies or 2 allies come? Luckily the auto save is pretty smart and does it before every fight.\n\nIt is an indie game, albeit a very polished one it still has some bugs and mishaps. I did crash to desktop once or twice. Given how cheap this game is I can easily overlook these things.

The eventual state of SPAZ 1 was awesome, and well polished. However, the current state of SPAZ 2 is neither. If the dev is only lookng for bug reports, then this is underwhelming and I would strongly encourage people to skip this title.\n\nIn particular, the map UI is clearly a placeholder. The icons used for ships and the general polish over the map view is exceptionally poor given how much time you spend watching your little triangle move slowly across the map.  If the map view was not such a large piece of time, the difference in polish between map and ship view wouldn't be so glaring.\n\nProgression is also pretty bad. Eventual Zombie strength is chosen at game creation, and in no way dynamic. The climax of the game seems to work around the idea that the Zombies will win unless aliances can be forged or the humans can essentially achieve a domination victory in the non-zombie space so they can finally focus on the zombies. There isn't much wiggle room, so you have to hope the human pilots have progressed far enough that once the zombie infestation starts, it will be possible to continue growing strong enough to attack the main zombie.\n\nThe universe scale is pretty sad. It seemed chosen to keep it presentable in the screen without zooming too far out. It's only a minute to zoom from one side to the other. There is no distance between factions, which is great for driving conflict but effectively turns SPAZ 2 into only the last two X in a 4X game. Just allowing a more gradual ramp-up over a larger number of sectors would go a long way to allowing multi-phased progression.","May 18","true","42.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Some things are more convenient, others are questionable. For example, time moves only when you act, but scavenging/building takes so much time that by the end you end up losing 1 or 2 sectors just by the time you pick up what you earned.\n\nSpeaking of sectors, the map is way smaller, which isn't really a problem, unless you're into that 1000 systems crap. There is a lack of notification as of now, so you don't really know when one of your bases is getting attacked, but I'm sure this will be changed in the future.\n\nThe bigger lettdown are the weapons at the moment. A lack of variety isn't unexpected, however the acquisition of weapons is extremely hit and miss. See, every faction have their own parts, but they all do the same thing. Example being the Red guys have lasers that look like wardrobes, while the blue guys made them look like a science experiment. However, the chances of you finding the right part AND the right shape are very low, so at the end of the game you;re simply forced into flying around the verse looking for that weapon, or simply idleing around your capitol waiting to be restocked. If not, you risk having your ship look like a franeknstein monster of asymetrical stuff. Sure, it owns in combat, but you gotta look good doin it amirite?\n\nCombat is way slower by the way. I dig the ability to let the AI shoot while all you have to do is pilot. It also relieves control automatically for you to shoot particular targets like engines and such. All in all a very well thought out addition, though the ease of use of it does make it kind of boring. It's a pity you have to select weapon groups to fire instead of having different buttons mapped to let's say missle fire. This usually leads to a "just let the ai manage firing patterns" solution, which while effective is undoubtadely boring.\n\nSpeaking of capitols, it's pretty cool that you can make your own faction, but some things I can't understand. For instace, you can own all the bases and suffer penalties, or delegate them to other captians, which frankly do a much better job of maintaining the place anyway. When 2 adjasent zones are owned by you, they form a supply line. Now you would naturally think that you'd have access to all the weapons throughout your empire in your capitol right? Nope. I honestly don't even think these supply lines do anything at all, aside from reseting the stock ever minute or so.\n\nAnyway, that's all.","May 22","true","26.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

While 2 looks a lot nicer in everyway, I found it to be disappointing in comparison to the original.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Because SPAZ 2 is still enjoyable, just not as much as the original, which was a lot of fun.\n\nPros of SPAZ 2:\n\n-Looks awesome.\n-Battles are more fun to take part in, more tactics involved.\n-Changing your ship on-the-fly, if there are bits floating around.\n-Story is ok. Meh. It's funny. To be honest the storyline was never a big thing for me in this or the first, it's ok though.\n\nCons of SPAZ 2 (I havn't done sandbox mode yet, so some of these may be my lack of knowledge of the game):\n\n-Rez. Flying around eats rez, a lot of rez (may be the amount of stuff in my inventory?) which makes traveling around quite a pain, as you're reduced to slow speed most of the time.\n-Inventory system. While being able to change on-the-fly is good, it should be a damn sight easier and pain free when you are doing it out of combat. While your parts are sort of nicely organised, it quickly becomes a pain if you collect too many.\n-Simplicity. Ok, this may be a comparision to the original, but it's my feeling. In the original you could have a number of random timed events you could take part in, not so here, in the original you built up from a small ship to a massive one, not here (ok, you start off with less cores, but when you consider you started in somthing smaller than your current strike craft, the size difference is not that much.) In the original you had to plan where you spent skills, so you would buy weapons etc to become highly specialsed in your ships, here, it doesn't really matter.\n-Items. It becomes quite a pain later in the game trying to find the ship parts you want, my base at a threat level of 70+ and a major trade hub never got better than 2 star stuff, and rarely any good, which ment I would have to travel everywhere to find the good stuff.\n-Zombies. Yeah, not really dangerous once I actually started fighting them (good planning partly), but it became a pain trying to wipe them out. They would respawn quicker than kill them all, and my guys weren't all that bothered defending their stations.\n-Needs more than 4 mother ships in battle. Seriously, late game, big battles would be so much better. You lose a lot of tactics as you either have to kite because you are out numbered, charge in when you outnumber them, or can charge right in when even, as they aren't much of a threat =/\n\nAll in all an enjoyable game, which is certainly on track to being an excellent sequel (in large part as the devs are active in the discussion), but as of yet, has some way to go. But it's early access, which gives me hope!","May 20","true","21.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People will rage about how they threw it's best stuff out the window (fleet building). However, it's still chock full of the usual silly charm of weird people and awkward conversations. That said this doesn't make it "Spaz 2". It's more like Spaz feat. Captain Forever, because ship building and combat is the meat of the game.\n\nYou now control only one ship, constantly upgrading it block by block in a cpt. forever style. The map is no longer nodes but a big circle sliced into sectors. Combat is a hit or miss. Viewpoint can be the good ol' top down or the new pseudo 3D. Ship Controls are still wonky AF with the AI throwing out all your bombs and missiles once in range. (It's since been patched and only starts firing if you "left click" while AI handles your other weapons). 200 or so Captains now inhabit the universe and are unkillable. They'll learn to love or hate your guts depending on how you treat them.\n\nThe lore is better than last time, with more written, explorable items in the world. Zombies are the main plot of the game and pirates not so much. (Everybody takes stuff without asking,even friendly factions and ships, so I guess that's sort of piracy? I do beat up anyone who touches my resources in my face, but they're numerous and will be back in a spiffy.)\n\nBandits are permanently level 6 and are screwed by everyone all over the galaxy. The player can freely milk relationship points by "aiding" in their destruction by showing up for a minute before they are destroyed. Battles have a maximum of 4 ships, this makes for a lot of luck factor when you try to take a stronghold. Will 2 enemies or 2 allies come? Luckily the auto save is pretty smart and does it before every fight.\n\nIt is an indie game, albeit a very polished one it still has some bugs and mishaps. I did crash to desktop once or twice. Given how cheap this game is I can easily overlook these things. Overall a very enjoyable game with decent replayability. 8.5/10.","May 19","true","14.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So if you do get SPAZ 2, try not to *puts on sunglasses and alahu akbars into the sun* SPAZ OUT.  AWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, I’m done.\n\nSo far most, if not all my hours played of SPAZ2 have been offline as I have no internet access so like a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have to go jack someone else’s (usually friends.  True story).  At the time of this review, I should mention that I have not played the first SPAZ but had an interest in it.  Thus it seems pretty strange I have the sequel but never played the original.  Having no bias for the first game, here’s my review.\n\n[GRAPHICS]\n\nGraphically this game is GORGEOUS.  Most of the game is traversed in a top-down, 2D format as you trek across the galaxy, or at least a small portion of space, which is huge.  Massively huge.  Infinitely huge.  But when you do get to play the game in third person (or top down like the first one, according to screenshots) the game is brilliant.  It’s like TRON, Black Ice, and the biggest star in the visible curve of space all had a threesome and out popped the graphics engine the game runs on.  The beauty is mostly in the lighting and the cool glowy things that bring you back to your days wondering what the hell all the blinky things in Star Trek were before you realized they were probably just gummy candies smushed on top of super-heated light bulbs.  The ship models are wonderful and it’s nice to see a game that has visible polygons for once.  I like my games that look like games and not some kind of life simulation with dinosaurs and mutated looking humans.  All the pilot’s pictures are all hand-drawn and remind me of old 90’s games that had a similar art style.  It feels very reminiscent of those kind of games and it brings me back.\n\n[SOUND/MUSIC]\n\nThe captain chatter gets a little old but this is an rpg we’re talking about.  However, the soundtrack gets pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome sometimes with all of its swells and massive musical numbers.  Despite that the soundtrack repeats, I love it.  It feels very open and like you’re traversing space, trying to survive like it’s the 1800s.  You have the pirates or freelance captains, all the fighting factions and zombies.  I suppose this game isn’t called “Space Pirates and Zombies 2” for nothing.  The engine and weapon sounds are nice enough to listen to but not necessarily bad.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\nThe gameplay plays a lot like the 2004 re-make of Sid Meier’s pirates, it really does.  After getting settled into the 2D/3D views of SPAZ2, I felt quite at home with how the game played.  You essentially do the same things and can do the same things, only in space and you can customize your ship any freaking way you like.\n\nSpeaking of customization – ever wanted a ship that was a giant straight line?  Do that.  Ever wanted to make a ship that looked like an S finger ♥♥♥♥ed an 8-bit video game?  Yes, you can do that.  Ever wanted a ship that had no discernable shape but was nothing but weapons?  Do that.  It’s all up to you, pal.  Or in case you’re so inclined, just make your ship look like a giant running shoe and you’ll be all set.\n\nThe actual combat in SPAZ2 is interesting but it isn’t terrible.  For me, I’m a crossbred gamer between “arcade” space games of various titles and “simulator” space games like Elite: Dangerous.  The flying around in your little battle zone like fight club is fluid.  But you can only fly sideways or rotate just slightly, kind of driving a car, only in space.  It would be nice to be able to control the pitch of your ship as well and pull off some pretty slick moves.  If it gets added later, that’s cool.  I find it’s not that big of a hit to my review of the game but it is something that I’ve gotten accustomed to in my measly 21 years of playing video games.\n\nTrading; every faction and every captain in space can be traded with, killed, fought, etc. and each faction has a certain specialty and they’ll trade primarily in those kinds of parts.  For example: one faction might be really into engines, so you’ll find mostly engine parts; others might be super into wings.  On top of trading and parts, there is an economy (kind of) that loves to rip you off if you’re not careful with where you buy from.  It’s like the fight between Target and Walmart.  “Well, Target has a really good t-shirt I like, but Walmart’s is cheaper…”, only the miles between the Target and Walmart to one space station to the next is astronomically different.\n\nThe last little bit is faction reputation.  I know a lot of gamers have played games that involve faction reputation.  Off the top of my head, Fallout NV and Fallout 4 are two that I think of immediately.  Are there factions?  Yes.  But do all of them mesh like a world that’s constantly changing?  No.  SPAZ2 tries to emulate warring factions whose reputations with each other change damn near on a dime.  What you do with each faction can change how which factions feels about you.  If you steal or kill a pilot controlling a certain faction’s space station, some will feel good about you, others will not.  If you want to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that kills on sight, well you’re kind of screwed – pilots can be a threat and if you challenge someone that’s tougher than you, I hope your engines are faster than theirs are.\n\nA thing I was recently unaware of was bounties.  ♥♥♥♥ off enough captains, you can have a bounty set on your head and people will come after you.  You better hope you have more Rez than they do in order to outrun them otherwise you’re pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.  Not only that, but you can set bounties to have other captains do your dirty work, or even vice versa.  I haven’t successfully completed any bounties because I currently have half the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy after my ♥♥♥ … god damn Sun worshipers.\n\n\n\nToo long; didn’t read…\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics are very pretty.  Lots of lights and things to look at\n+Hand-drawn captain portraits\n+ gameplay is fun if you try not to be biased from the original SPAZ gameplay\n+ DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOUUUU ARE A PIRATEEEEE\n+ ♥♥♥♥ up everyone’s day – then get ♥♥♥♥ed yourself\n+ Economy that changes\n+ If you’re nice to a faction and join them, other captains will come help you out.  Yay friendship!\n+ YOHO FLIBBERDYGY BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE\n\nCons:\n- Starting out can be difficult but this isn’t a huge con for me.  You gotta really work hard for your ship and your crew.  Steal ♥♥♥♥ from everyone if you have to.\n- If you don’t read the tutorials, have fun figuring ♥♥♥♥ out!\n- Firing your weapons when most of them are automatic can be a little confusing; again, not a huge loss or con\n\n10/10: Would condone piracy again.

Yes, there are bugs. But that's the point of early access; to get rid of said bugs.\n\nNow, on to the good stuff. I played the heck out of SPAZ 1. I loved that game. This game is definitely very different, but still feels a little like SPAZ 1 in some of the combat. However, "different" doesn't mean "bad". This game is very fun too. The combat is a lot of fun, and you can play it with the camera either in a 3rd person perspective or in a top-down mode, the latter of which makes the game feel more like the first one. The weapons are nice, and what they sometimes like in impact is made up for with the tractor beam. Your mothership comes equiped with a tractor beam that can be used in the top-down camera, and you use it to assemble your ship (more on that later), to grab shield or energy pickups, or as a makeshift weapon. Trust me, it feels really good to slam asteroids or explosive barrels into enemy ships and watch parts fly off as they're damaged. You could instead make Worf proud and ram them, which can be effective if aimed correctly.\n\nA major aspect of the game is the ship building. At the begining of the game, you get a small mothership built out of junk parts. As the game progresses, you can find, buy, or steal new ship parts to replace the old ones. As you level up, you can attach more parts and larger parts. Since you're constantly finding new parts with which to build, your ship is constanly evolving and changing. You may find a wing you really like, but you don't have enough room to attach it; you'll have to detach a different piece to make room, or you could try altering the shape of your ship to see if you can find a different layout that will work. While fighting enemy motherships in combat, these parts can take damage, and will eventually detach. You can re-attach them using the tractor beam, or leave them behind. This goes both ways, though, as you can also break off parts of enemy ships. You can even salvage them in the heat of battle, swapping out a wing on your ship for one you just blew off the enemy ship that has better weapons and kill them with it.\n\nThere's also the "world" map. If you've ever played Mount and Blade, it's very similar to how that works. Each sector has a spot to build a starbase at, and either you (once you get the ability to build them) or one of the factions can claim it. There are resource nodes scattered around, and once a sector is claimed, the starbase there will send out transports to harvest them or any salvage left over from battles that happened. These transports can be raided, and the starbase can be destroyed, freeing up the sector for another faction. Right now, my biggest issues are in the world map, with pilots of my faction not patrolling very well, while pilots from the faction I'm at war with keep making bee-lines for starbases and destroying them before I can build up defenses.\n\nOver all, it's a very fun game, epecially considering it's not even done yet. It was made by just 2 people over 3 and 1/2 years, and they've done a very good job. It's not exactly like SPAZ 1, but it's still a lot of fun to play, and I can't wait to see what's added in the future, or once modders start doing their own magic.","May 21","true","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ship parts.  I really, really wish there were a way to just swap out a single part from the ship builder screen.  I just read that you can essentially accomplish this during the "Trade" funtion with bases by trading out the part you want to swap, but it would be nice if you could just swap two cores with each other during the ship building screen without having to remove all the attached parts.\n\n2.  Ship builds.  Would it be possible to add the ability to 'remember' a certain number of previous ship builds, or at least core layouts?  There were times I would have been tempted to try out a part for a fight or two, but it wasn't worth rebuilding the entire mothership to give the part a try.  If I could quickly swap between core layouts, it might mitigate that.\n\n3.  Infections.  Late in the game, those get pretty viscious.  There were quite a few fights that I just had to restart after getting hit with a zombie bomb right after shields dropped.  I was toting around 3x as many goons as I was 'supposed' to, and my crew could still barely stay ahead of the infection.  Along the same lines, it would be nice if the 'infection repair' option from the main map could work faster.  Most of the time, once my ship got infected I could not complete an 'infection repair' without getting attacked by other zombie ships while trying to clear the infection out.  It led to eventul death with no possible escape.  That or an option to clear the infection out while you're in a fight, maybe take a hit to weapon fire/shield recharge rates, or have some kind of "infection killing" boost you could fire off to give your goons a short advantage?\n\n4. Death penalty.  The death penalty for players is harsh.  The death penalty for computer players seems to consist of the time it takes their escape pod to reach the nearest starbase, at which point they're back out there and ready to go.  It would be nice if they could at least require some sort of real time to rebuild in game.  Towards the end, if there are enough zombie captains, they'd basically have a stream of their captain's escape pods heading to the nearest base, while another stream of recently recovered captains were heading back out to fight me again.\n\n5.  Battles:  Not sure if it would be possible, but it would be nice if the battle fields could get a bit larger, both in how many participants there are, and the actual size of the battle field.  Everyone starts closely enough together at the beginning that in a full battle, everyone is clashing within 10 seconds or less.  If things were spread a bit further apart, it might make a clear target who's left alone, or an ally that you're going to have to rush to help before they get crushed.  I also was disappointed to find that many of the battles I wanted to join were already full, with multiple ships from the other side taking out my ally, but I know if I could have joined in they'd have a chance.  Not sure if it would work, but maybe reserve a spot for the human player in battles to always join in?\n\nOverall, the game was a lot of fun.  It's a fun space strategy/shooter.  Probably the most impressive Early Release I've ever played.","May 23","true","51.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes, there are bugs. But that's the point of early access; to get rid of said bugs.\n\nNow, on to the good stuff. I played the heck out of SPAZ 1. I loved that game. This game is definitely very different, but still feels a little like SPAZ 1 in some of the combat. However, "different" doesn't mean "bad". This game is very fun too. The combat is a lot of fun, and you can play it with the camera either in a 3rd person perspective or in a top-down mode, the latter of which makes the game feel more like the first one. The weapons are nice, and what they sometimes like in impact is made up for with the tractor beam. Your mothership comes equiped with a tractor beam that can be used in the top-down camera, and you use it to assemble your ship (more on that later), to grab shield or energy pickups, or as a makeshift weapon. Trust me, it feels really good to slam asteroids or explosive barrels into enemy ships and watch parts fly off as they're damaged. You could instead make Worf proud and ram them, which can be effective if aimed correctly.\n\nA major aspect of the game is the ship building. At the begining of the game, you get a small mothership built out of junk parts. As the game progresses, you can find, buy, or steal new ship parts to replace the old ones. As you level up, you can attach more parts and larger parts. Since you're constantly finding new parts with which to build, your ship is constanly evolving and changing. You may find a wing you really like, but you don't have enough room to attach it; you'll have to detach a different piece to make room, or you could try altering the shape of your ship to see if you can find a different layout that will work. While fighting enemy motherships in combat, these parts can take damage, and will eventually detach. You can re-attach them using the tractor beam, or leave them behind. This goes both ways, though, as you can also break off parts of enemy ships. You can even salvage them in the heat of battle, swapping out a wing on your ship for one you just blew off the enemy ship that has better weapons and kill them with it.\n\nThere's also the "world" map. If you've ever played Mount and Blade, it's very similar to how that works. Each sector has a spot to build a starbase at, and either you (once you get the ability to build them) or one of the factions can claim it. There are resource nodes scattered around, and once a sector is claimed, the starbase there will send out transports to harvest them or any salvage left over from battles that happened. These transports can be raided, and the starbase can be destroyed, freeing up the sector for another faction. Right now, my biggest issues are in the world map, with pilots of my faction not patrolling very well, while pilots from the faction I'm at war with keep making bee-lines for starbases and destroying them before I can build up defenses.\n\nOver all, it's a very fun game, epecially considering it's not even done yet. It was made by just 2 people over 3 and 1/2 years, and they've done a very good job. It's not exactly like SPAZ 1, but it's still a lot of fun to play, and I can't wait to see what's added in the future, or once modders start doing their own magic.","May 21","true","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People expected something yet they got something else, or they don't like the way it turned out, or it looked good and then it wasn't as good as it looked.  I get it, but I for one am loving this game.  Is it VERY different from the first game? Yes, yes it is, the 3D view, the Starmap mechanics are closer to Mount and Blade than they are to the original SPAZ.  If you're looking for SPAZ, then you might want to go play the original SPAZ, because you really won't find much of it here.  HOWEVER, if you're looking for a new take on the game, from the starmap to the ship building to the combat then keep reading\n\nLike I said, the Starmap mechanics are actually rather similar to Mount and Blade.  You travel around a world map and fly up to events and do them from the map.  The only time you go to the 3D view is when you get into combat, and some parts of the story that don't require combat.\n\nThe combat is actually a bit closer to the game Rebel Galaxy (also an awesome game, in my opinion) rather then the original SPAZ.  I like it a lot, but you might not if you didn't enjoy Rebel Galaxy or you like the faster paced fighter craft style combat of the first game.\n\nShip Building! Oh the ship building in SPAZ 2 is GREAT!  You actually fly your mothership this time, and you build it module by module.   You can actually define the shape and look of your craft using different parts like structural core parts, wing parts, weapon parts and noses, each offer their own weapons and stat boosts.\n\nMy one major gripe with the game has been the UI.  It feels a bit...Odd.  It's not bad persay. but it takes some getting used to.  If you have any trouble with it, ask in the forums, the devs are more than happy to help, and other players have been awfully friendly.\n\nI haven't finished the story yet, so I can't comment on how good it is just yet.  What I've played, I've enjoyed, that's all I'll say about that\n\nTL;DR section\n\nPros\nShip Building is fun and fresh\nCombat is slowed down, but it feels powerful and exciting\n3D environments for combat look gorgeous\nStarmap is a neat way to interact with the world; Similar to Mount and Blade\n\nCons\nUI is a bit clunky and takes some getting used to.\nProblems with the UI means that the difficulty can be quite high before you get used to the game.\n\nThings I can't comment on\nThe Story\nSandbox Mode","May 20","true","44.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So if you do get SPAZ 2, try not to *puts on sunglasses and alahu akbars into the sun* SPAZ OUT.  AWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, I’m done.\n\nSo far most, if not all my hours played of SPAZ2 have been offline as I have no internet access so like a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have to go jack someone else’s (usually friends.  True story).  At the time of this review, I should mention that I have not played the first SPAZ but had an interest in it.  Thus it seems pretty strange I have the sequel but never played the original.  Having no bias for the first game, here’s my review.\n\n[GRAPHICS]\n\nGraphically this game is GORGEOUS.  Most of the game is traversed in a top-down, 2D format as you trek across the galaxy, or at least a small portion of space, which is huge.  Massively huge.  Infinitely huge.  But when you do get to play the game in third person (or top down like the first one, according to screenshots) the game is brilliant.  It’s like TRON, Black Ice, and the biggest star in the visible curve of space all had a threesome and out popped the graphics engine the game runs on.  The beauty is mostly in the lighting and the cool glowy things that bring you back to your days wondering what the hell all the blinky things in Star Trek were before you realized they were probably just gummy candies smushed on top of super-heated light bulbs.  The ship models are wonderful and it’s nice to see a game that has visible polygons for once.  I like my games that look like games and not some kind of life simulation with dinosaurs and mutated looking humans.  All the pilot’s pictures are all hand-drawn and remind me of old 90’s games that had a similar art style.  It feels very reminiscent of those kind of games and it brings me back.\n\n[SOUND/MUSIC]\n\nThe captain chatter gets a little old but this is an rpg we’re talking about.  However, the soundtrack gets pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome sometimes with all of its swells and massive musical numbers.  Despite that the soundtrack repeats, I love it.  It feels very open and like you’re traversing space, trying to survive like it’s the 1800s.  You have the pirates or freelance captains, all the fighting factions and zombies.  I suppose this game isn’t called “Space Pirates and Zombies 2” for nothing.  The engine and weapon sounds are nice enough to listen to but not necessarily bad.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\nThe gameplay plays a lot like the 2004 re-make of Sid Meier’s pirates, it really does.  After getting settled into the 2D/3D views of SPAZ2, I felt quite at home with how the game played.  You essentially do the same things and can do the same things, only in space and you can customize your ship any freaking way you like.\n\nSpeaking of customization – ever wanted a ship that was a giant straight line?  Do that.  Ever wanted to make a ship that looked like an S finger ♥♥♥♥ed an 8-bit video game?  Yes, you can do that.  Ever wanted a ship that had no discernable shape but was nothing but weapons?  Do that.  It’s all up to you, pal.  Or in case you’re so inclined, just make your ship look like a giant running shoe and you’ll be all set.\n\nThe actual combat in SPAZ2 is interesting but it isn’t terrible.  For me, I’m a crossbred gamer between “arcade” space games of various titles and “simulator” space games like Elite: Dangerous.  The flying around in your little battle zone like fight club is fluid.  But you can only fly sideways or rotate just slightly, kind of driving a car, only in space.  It would be nice to be able to control the pitch of your ship as well and pull off some pretty slick moves.  If it gets added later, that’s cool.  I find it’s not that big of a hit to my review of the game but it is something that I’ve gotten accustomed to in my measly 21 years of playing video games.\n\nTrading; every faction and every captain in space can be traded with, killed, fought, etc. and each faction has a certain specialty and they’ll trade primarily in those kinds of parts.  For example: one faction might be really into engines, so you’ll find mostly engine parts; others might be super into wings.  On top of trading and parts, there is an economy (kind of) that loves to rip you off if you’re not careful with where you buy from.  It’s like the fight between Target and Walmart.  “Well, Target has a really good t-shirt I like, but Walmart’s is cheaper…”, only the miles between the Target and Walmart to one space station to the next is astronomically different.\n\nThe last little bit is faction reputation.  I know a lot of gamers have played games that involve faction reputation.  Off the top of my head, Fallout NV and Fallout 4 are two that I think of immediately.  Are there factions?  Yes.  But do all of them mesh like a world that’s constantly changing?  No.  SPAZ2 tries to emulate warring factions whose reputations with each other change damn near on a dime.  What you do with each faction can change how which factions feels about you.  If you steal or kill a pilot controlling a certain faction’s space station, some will feel good about you, others will not.  If you want to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that kills on sight, well you’re kind of screwed – pilots can be a threat and if you challenge someone that’s tougher than you, I hope your engines are faster than theirs are.\n\nA thing I was recently unaware of was bounties.  ♥♥♥♥ off enough captains, you can have a bounty set on your head and people will come after you.  You better hope you have more Rez than they do in order to outrun them otherwise you’re pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.  Not only that, but you can set bounties to have other captains do your dirty work, or even vice versa.  I haven’t successfully completed any bounties because I currently have half the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy after my ♥♥♥ … god damn Sun worshipers.\n\n\n\nToo long; didn’t read…\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics are very pretty.  Lots of lights and things to look at\n+Hand-drawn captain portraits\n+ gameplay is fun if you try not to be biased from the original SPAZ gameplay\n+ DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOUUUU ARE A PIRATEEEEE\n+ ♥♥♥♥ up everyone’s day – then get ♥♥♥♥ed yourself\n+ Economy that changes\n+ If you’re nice to a faction and join them, other captains will come help you out.  Yay friendship!\n+ YOHO FLIBBERDYGY BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE\n\nCons:\n- Starting out can be difficult but this isn’t a huge con for me.  You gotta really work hard for your ship and your crew.  Steal ♥♥♥♥ from everyone if you have to.\n- If you don’t read the tutorials, have fun figuring ♥♥♥♥ out!\n- Firing your weapons when most of them are automatic can be a little confusing; again, not a huge loss or con\n\n10/10: Would condone piracy again.

The game could use some tweaks to the tutorial and level progression, but core mechanics are fun and engaging.\n\nThe underlying economy (200 independent captains and factions) is impressive and creates interesting and emergent gameplay as NPCs and the player interact and build toward the ultimate conclusion.\n\nThe game would benefit from a manual, which is in work, since many of the icons and stats are poorly explained.  The implementation seems to be complete but sometimes the player is left a bit confused.\n\nThe only frustrating part of this current build is how the game handles NPC captain death.  If the player dies, the game is over, but if any of the NPC captains die, they are resurrected.  This is not a problem for neutral captains or even \"normal\" enemy captains, but this is particularly frustrating when dealing with zombie captains.  It is understandable to ensure a consistent 200 captains, however, when a zombie captain is defeated, they should be penalized in some way to reduce their threat level and potentially be placed on a timer before they can actively participate in the economy.  Without this change, I have found myself fighting the same zombies over and over again.","June 1","true","25.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is early access so it's definitely not perfect, but very fun for what it has. At any given time there is a lot going on and the game needs more clarity in terms of function of items, composition of ships, controls, actual damage output of various things, simpler way to check ship and part health (maybe a paused tactical view like the first one?), and better control of your faction (the bounty system is good but insufficient).\n\nHaving said all that, the core gameplay is here and it's fun. I wouldn't expect much more than that from Early Access. The game needs polish and the devs are very aware of this, considering how active they are and the great work they did with the original I have no doubt they are dedicated and will end up with an amazing game.\n\nI am enjoying it and wil continue to enjoy it while it goes through early access development.

It was quite a hellish ride since from that point, the game became quite monotonous. Liberate a sector, upgrade, warp out, defend... rinse and repeat until you meet the minimum requirements. This game (SPAZ 2) however starts off with that frustrating feature. But aside from the negativity, I enjoy myself playing both SPAZ and SPAZ 2.\n\nSPAZ 2 is well made and I can feel the dedication the devs put into this game, those 4 years they took really bear a great game which will be remembered for a very long time. The game has a unique feel to it to an extent that I, myself feels like being dragged by a graviton missile, disabling me from exiting the game. The environment is unbelievably amazing, it is a thousand percent improved from the original game, if only I can set the game itself to be my computer's screensaver... *sob*...\n\nThe battle system is great, it is engaging and there is no time that nothing is happening. I am really glad that there are fail gates which is a better substitute from an enemy moving to the very edge of the map/area which has happened a lot at the original SPAZ which will just force you to Mass Retreat rather then wasting time chasing a tiny hulled ship, but that is aside the point. I love the First Person Mode which has been added, it gives a whole new perspective into the game.\n\nThe ship customization is BADASS! MixMax games did really a very good job at this. Ohhh... I had wished that I can customize the ship by block on the first SPAZ and this game made that ♥♥♥♥ happen.\n\nStory-wise, just by reading the Lore, I consider this  game sold to me. It makes the game more depth and enticing. But let us not forget the story, the game itself has a well-written story. It feels like every chapter is the climax, there is no time that there is nothing happening.\n\nOh.... By the way.\nJust a friendly tip, If you are having a problem from Ships Escaping, I suggest you gaining initiative in heading out to the Fail Gate itself and block the Ship from escaping or if he/she/it (damn.. robots are "it" right?) is right infront of the gate. Go and RAAAAAAM!!!!! the sh*t out of it until the green (laser? wave?) thing is gone, but don't get too close to the gate or else you will lose you Strike Forces.\n\n","May 21","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the TINY starmap accompanied by the minimalist ship construction mechanics leaves me feeling like this game is a shallow representation of its forbear. The franchise has traded depth, length and complexity for graphics and polish.\n\nThe first step in addressing this would be introduce weapon hard points like the original to allow for a much higher level of customization. YES, we can swap ship cores and wings etc, but I feel this doesn't allow the diverse range of combinations SPAZ offered.\n\nIts a sequel, they have added many new features, the new ship combat being my favourite. But they have not included some of the best parts of the original. You don't need to make it look like a AAA title. Just make in faithful to its predecessor. You already had a strong fan base purely on that game alone.  I really can't help but feel they took this game in entirely the wrong direction.\n\nDo I still reccomend this game?

It is early access so it's definitely not perfect, but very fun for what it has. At any given time there is a lot going on and the game needs more clarity in terms of function of items, composition of ships, controls, actual damage output of various things, simpler way to check ship and part health (maybe a paused tactical view like the first one?), and better control of your faction (the bounty system is good but insufficient).\n\nHaving said all that, the core gameplay is here and it's fun.

This review may contain spoilers, no specifics just layout of the game stuff.\n\n-Campaign is very... loose. By that I mean that there are less then 10 missions and you simply have to strengthen yourself up for then go and fight. This means that you will be spending the bulk of your time picking on a faction or hunting unaffliated captains, bandits, or zombies. I'll definitely play through it again when the main dialogues have been voice-overed just to hear it.\n\n-Game itself is 3D; however play is still 2D. In other words, everything is on the same plane but you can look up or down. Being 3D doesn't contribute to combat much at all, the only things I've seen are wrecked ships sinking up/down and missiles/pods being intercepted somewhere above or below you. Asteroids are pretty annoying to fly into.\n\n-Ship construction is modular. You basically have to hope you get a wing/engine/nose with the weapon you want. For me that meant just getting into combat constantly and praying to god I got something with drones on it. Very different from having to acquire blueprints. Your ship is, as advertised, truly a collection of parts you've found.\n\n-You basically can't play with your shield down. WHAT I MEAN: Your shield dropping is the #1 way to frustrate you on this game. When your shield is down, the parts on your ship can be broken off, and from what I can tell likely never recoverable. What this meant for me was everytime I lost an important part (my nose drones), I just reloaded the most recent Autosave so I could keep the piece. There is seriously no reason to fight without a shield, and it honestly makes things monotonous. Starbases are a pain since they seem to have 12+ lasers on them so killing them is a game of patience instead of an incredible battle.\n\n-Rez consumption is very light at first, but quickly gets out of hand. If you always fly on the slowest mode you'll easily have too much of it. I finished my game with 5000 rez; I only used it to chase down ships since I knew I could just chase until I exhausted their reserves of rez.\n\nI'm sure I could comment on more but those are the main things. I would enjoy stealth missions again; the mission on SPAZ1 where you had to be cloaked and escort some ship or some hoo hah was very thrilling and frustrating but in a good way. That being said I don't think cloaking could really be implemented with the game how it is.\n\nI'm not sure I could recommend this game in it's current shape, I hope Minmax can take all the feedback they are receiving and polish it into something great! I'll play through again in a couple of months and maybe update this if I remember!","May 30","true","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have to say No for the time being, but I will not be seeking a refund and will give Minmax the benefit of the doubt.  Is Early Access just to fix bugs or will they listen to the community as they have in the past and try to improve upon what they have created?\n\nSPAZ 2 brings some fresh new ideas to the game and sounds familiar, but that is about where it ends.  This is not the same game as SPAZ and just because you loved that game like I did does not mean you will like this game.  So before you rush to give Minmax your money, keep that in mind.\n\nMy major complaint, which seems to be in line with other negative reviews, is the controls.  I found them unresponsive at best.  SPAZ gave you great control of your ship and I loved strafing around vessls while blowing them to bits.  In SPAZ 2, I found myself jamming the WSAD keys and nothing happening.  I would frustratingly sit still or be turning to the right when I was turning to the left, which makes combat, the best part of SPAZ 1, incredibly annoying in SPAZ 2.\nThis all said, this is in Early Access.  Maybe this is one of the "bugs" they are going to fix before releasing the game.  I don't know, but I love the idea of supporting a two man team that made one of my favourite games of recent memory.\n\nI do like the new Universe Map and how the have stream lined the collection of resources so that I am not flying around a lonely area shooting asteroids and collecting goons.  There are plenty of games where I can do that if I want.  However, my second largest complaint is tied into this and that is the dumbing down of the game.  The first SPAZ was RPGish and you had a good idea what the new parts and weapons you added did.  In SPAZ 2, when you level up you get a choice of 3 perks and the only numbers you see are the DPS for each weapon and the rock, papers, scissors for each, also known as Shields, Armour and Health.  So naturally you line up the pieces with the highest dps on your left or right side and you go into broadside mode like Rebel Galaxy.  Other then that, you kind of just have to guess how effective a weapon will actually be.\n\nCollecting Lore instead of Ship designs is less good, but I have not found many yet, so who knows.  Maybe that will become more interesting?\n\nThe story is entertaining, sort of.  And I am sure it will be better when they add the actual voices.  The first thing I did when I fired up the game was turn off the awful synth voices.  However I found the first SPAZ more amusing and this one almost seems more serious... some how.  Hard to do with Zombies in space, I know.\n\nIf/when they fix the controls and assuming they continue to support the game and add content like they did with SPAZ, which I have no reason to believe they will not, I will likely change my review at that time.","May 17","false","1.9"," 32 of 66 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","32","66","2","2"

All it does is slow the combat down. Whenever you have to reload you fly away.\nThe enemy stops shooting when you are out of range so its hard to "bait" him into reloading. I get that the shiled boost uses the same "power" as the weapons system, but I think no reload and another malus for boosting shields would add to better combat and flow. You have the choice of aiming for yourself or let the AI aim and shoot for you, both modes don't feel rewarding. The autoaim is too boring since you simply watch and fly your ship, aiming for yourself is too easy unless you really want to snipe that specific part... which so far isn't needed, maybe later in the game I hope.\n\ncontrols:\nThe steering of the ship feels a bit clunky, but they works I think with better parts and emphasis on engines you can make your ship respond better and fly faster. But ther is room for improvement here.\n\nShip customization:\nI really don't like the way the ship building is made. So far I have only seen 1x1 parts that you can arrange like boxes in a plane to build your ship (even when flying big ships in arena). I think it lacks diversity since I have also not seen plain "building" blocks that you could use for more interesting. Every core block has a connection on each side, so ship designs tend to be simple geometric forms like triangles, squares and rectangles or a slight mix. To be honest ships just look ugly.\nEvery weapon has its own range, but I have yet to see range indicators which would help.\n\nStarmap/Simulation:\nI kinda like the starmap and the opportunity it gives you to shape your own adventure but It lacks content or stuff to do.\nYou can either collect ressources/parts/trade or fight. So far its economy or combat. A bit of the usual faction/diplomacy is thrown in, but it all boils down to fighting to manipulate it. I wish there would be more exciting things, maybe random events, some kind of science tree or other actions like sabotaging, stealthing, spying, missions. So far I know you can occupy starbaes but you can't rally build stuff. It needs to be fleshed out more.\n\nSo far I can't recommend the game. For what it is and for what is was designed to be I think its not a bad game.\nIt just too rough around the edges and needs more work, fresh ideas. P\n\nPersonally the concept and underlying design decisions aren't as fun as I have imagined.\nI hope to see it grow into something bigger and will continue to watch it.\n\nWould rate it 5/10 so far","May 17","false","1.9"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","16","34","2","0"

It has had some teething problems but they are trivial things, like one option being default over another and it has continuing support, updates and love from it's developers. So much so it received not 1 but 5 updates during my first several hours playtime and they were not just bugfixes or hotpatches but suggested improvements from it's community.\n\nThings that confound and infuriate you had been fixed while I was playing, probably just because while they made it, it simply hadn't been thought of but once suggested it made utmost sense and went straight into game.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it has more factions, more depth, more parts and deserves to be played.

Hells yeah!\n\nThe only things that let the game down a bit are not really big things, just slightly frustrating little things.\n\nPro's\n\n-Decent sized galaxy map\n-Lots of lore to uncover as you open up new areas, good for new players.\n-Apart from a few small things (Part icon legend so you know whats what) the UI is well done.\n-Looks good\n-Can see alot of the style as first game just alot more 3D\n-Controls are intuitive, I prefered the control setting that made it play more like Rebel Galaxy personally but it feels good either way.\n-Decent story, will be alot better when the proper voice acting is in but very playable as is.\n\nCon's\n\n-Not easy to tell if a peice is an upgrade and to replace a bit deep inside your built ship you have to pull alot of it apart to get it in there, really need a part replace option and better ways to show stats on the ship peices.\n-If you upgrade one of your starbases to its max it still falls very easily to other captains, I seem to lose them quite oftem after building them to random ship captains\n-Miss the Blueprint/tech system from the original, while the new system (salvaged random parts) isnt really a con it just doesnt feel as fun as the original. Also to a lesser extent not having pre designed ships and now having to build them from random parts that dont really look all that good.\n-Too much neon in the ships imo, but thats just a personal taste thing, some people like it.\n\nAfter all that though I highly recommend SPAZ 2, while I still like the first one more, the second game is far from crap, its just diffrent.","June 2","true","25.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Because it doesnt feel like one! So i was looking at what to play, interested in space game and then i look at spaz 2 and remember spaz was 2d and i dont like 2d space games but then i looked at the pictures and i saw it was 3d and also had a nice map, when i checked the review comments i saw that someone saying that it plays like Mount and Blade campaign mode and he was right!!!\nFirst you start with a small ship, the more you level the more you can expand that ship and put better weapons and better blocks with more health, armor and shields. Second thing is that there are other factions and that you can create your own, you can hire captains, assign starbase or a sector to a loyal captain and raid neighboring sectors, it does feel like in mount and blade but in space, note i thought map was randomized but its not, your starting position is and also in sandbox mode you choose how big  factions are so it changes their positions as well.\nThe combat is so fun, you put whatever weapons you want, for an example,left side of ship vs shield, right side vs armor and front vs health or whatever combination you want, I am so glad i found this game, cannot believe it was release last week. Good job to the develops i like it a lot and i already played 2-3 days straight. The first time you start piloting your ship with w,a,s,d may feel clunky and bad because the ship doesnt turn where its nose looks but it turns where you, the camera looks at but besides that everything else is good, graphics are really nice, Although for the leveling part, in order to be able to create your own faction you have to be level 12, what i did was i went through the arenas of 10-15 starbases of other factions in order to level up to 12 instead of pirate hunting because they just dont give as that much of exp and are hard to find especially when everyone is chasing them.\nTo mention to the readers that in the menu there is a greyed out multiplayer button meaning that devs will implement multiplayer in the future!!!\nIf devs are reading this, good job, keep adding content and bug fixes, the main system feels good, although maybe give a possibility to choose different map sizes and have steam workshop plus randomized sector borders map!","May 22","true","41.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Get ready for the battle of your life.. Save progress often...\n\nThere has not been a 2d plane 3d design game of this magnitude in over a decade. Glad someone has finally captured the feel of the PC classics while adding more depth and story then games of this type in the past.\nTakes roughly 12-20 hours to beat depending if you hold off on starting the zombie onslaught. I found myself taking out a whole faction with an ally before venturing back to the main quest line and zombie apocalypse.\n\nFor a "Early access", the game is pretty much complete. Sadly, no multiplayer yet and voice acting of the characters is simply synthesize type to speech. Developer does have note when first starting that full voice acting will be added. Definitely a plus since the conversations are hilarious.\n\n\nWorth every $ the 2 main developer minimax is asking.\n\nNow here comes the fun part...\n\n\nBelow is a list of features I feel are needed to really make this game something people would play for several years.\n\nRadioactive Meat Please    Game should have more reasons to be in your ship and less playing around in the starmap.\n\nAI needs to actually use strength and weaknesses in battle or be handed special builds that match the captains taste. Battles tend to always end up with victorian era broadship swayfest with some missiles for extra touch. Why do we not have nimble ships capable of speed attacks or have a number count kinda low but if not careful could destroy you due to a exotic custom style builds? Also, AI seems pretty dumb to not try to avoid the Trireme ship ramming that pretty much decimates its ship in one hit.\n\nGame should promote your faction members harvesting or paying a tax etc. This would help eliminate some of that boring map work and give a real reason to get a good faction going.\n\nNeed more ships in the battle mode with faction member ships supportinge epic battles. The 4 ship maximum really makes things boring once you get a decent ship. If the game has a limit then definitely need spawnable motherships to help the battle continue.\n\nTaking a sector of the starmap should trigger a king of the hill mode where motherships spawn in the stop your starbase from being built. Maybe your job is to defend the starbase for  X amount of time? Couple  defense with some of the items mentioned above, I feel this would definitely add some depth to timing and placement of your starbase. If the fog of war is cleared, a warning should appear informing you a AI is attempting to build a starbase where you can go try to attack his facility.\n\nShould be able to get a wingmen without a "starbase". This may already exist but really not sure.\n\nThe Raid function needs serious re-vamp. I personally would like a way to "raid" where its a wave mode with increasing diffcult warp ins. Each wave would give you a reward and you could sneak some epic mothership build parts for lasting several rounds.\nAlso, this could be incorporated into a multiplayer function with rewards in the future.\n\nI feel the supplimental  ships you can buy do absolutely nothing outside of adding cannon fodder against enemies. Where are ships that can heal your mothership, maybe act as a small carrier for the micro fighters, or have some AI instincts to try to avoid the major enemy blasters?\n\nNeed a timer down survival mode somewhere in the game. This could promote members to build different type of ship builds for a given situation. I feel  all the ship variety of parts in game does not mean much if I have no real need to try to build special builds to take on special task. Another function that could be added to multiplayer with some rewards.","May 21","true","31.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I grabbed this game up on day one of course. The game has changed in feel from the first but what I really love is the overall humour in both of the games. The second game lacks a bit in length and possibly content but the developers are hard at work in bringing new and exciting content they tell us. The developers really are some of the best I have seen in gaming. They communicate often and show that they really care about the player base. That deserves my money in and of itself.

Even at the time i write this, which is during the early access beta stage, the game shows significant polish and is very enjoyable in both the campaign and sandbox mode.  Devs continue to add funtionality and refine things, and there is every reason to believe the game will just get better and better.\n\nShip combat is very reminiscent of broadside battling from Rebel Galaxy (also highly recommended) and should be a quick study mechanically for most people.  The combat can be as deep and strategic as you want it to be through micromanaging and min/maxing or as simple as steer and let the AI attack for you.\n\nNPC AI is a bit on the easy/dumb side, but hopefully that will be tweaked more as development progresses.\n\nVisit the official forums for more specifics on mechanics and gameplay, if you have particular itches that you want a game to scratch, but I honestly think anyone who likes spaceship combat, particularly where you are at the controls, will  enjoy playing this game.\n\nA warning for SPAZ1 players:  the game is now primarily a 3D 3rd person experience, although you can manually set the game to the top down perspective from SPAZ1.  There are gains and losses from this change.  Make sure to check twitch or youtube for gameplay videos if you think that change will be a big deal for you.  I do miss some of the charm of the top down, but in my book, the gains outweigh the losses.

It ended up being more of an overhaul than that, which at first was refreshing. Became tedious around the time I begane learning faction mechanics, but picked up again as I framiliarized myself with the basics. By the time the zombie outbreak started I was hooked.\n\nI'm hoping they extend the story a bit more, improve the UI (I'd like to see a mini profile box on ship hover), add procedural missions, and really flesh out both local and online multiplayer.","May 22","true","19.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'll update review as I get more experience at the game\n\nFun Factor\nSo far the gameplay is rock solid, very fun. I havent hit a annoying aspect yet. This is the most importent aspect of any game for me, I have limited time to play games and dont want to be screaming at the computer because the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I play for fun, SPAZ 2 is fun.\n\nSPAZyness\nWhile it's quite different to SPAZ 1 at a superficial level, once you start playing it still feels like SPAZ. It's hard to explain because the 3D graphics look so different, but this game is still SPAZ at it's heart. It's diffenitly passed the SPAZ feeling test.\n\nSpace Map\nThis is a fantastic improvement and seems to be the natural progression from SPAZ 1\n\nControls\nThe default controls did feel a little weird, but as suggested turning off relative controls made it feel much more natural and very easy to control the ships\n\nCombat\nThis has been the bigest difference so far, and appears to be much harder, but this could be due to be just not beign very good yet.\n\nShip Building\nInteresting so far, while handled quite differently to SPAZ 1 its still ok. I've read a lot of people saying the trackor beam thing is weird, but once you figure out you press the control key instead of the mouse click it dead easy. I'm going to reserve final judgement on this one until later in the game when I've got the cash to upgrade for real.","May 18","true","47.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You'll control a fully modifiable mothership made out of "core blocks", and parts that fit on them that always contain a weapon and some stats: rear part for example adds the most speed. This mothership will later be accompanied by "strike craft", smaller ai controlled ships doing their thing to help you.\n\nSo how does the game go? Well, first you get a scrappy ship. It's terrible, and your choice in weapons is inexistant until you get enough resources to buy some at a starbase. First you will just need to scrounge these resources from around the map until you can beat bandits. The bandits use nothing but scrap in their ships and killing them makes other ship captains happy. Although you COULD attack these other ship captains at this point already, the way fleeing from a battle currently works makes this a pretty bad choice.\n\nWhen you're done beating up bandits you will be able to build your own starbase(s) at some point, and be a part of a faction. This opens up an entirely different gameplay especially during faction wars: which is currently the fastest way to progress. Tons of battles with all kinds of ship captains from both factions battling eachother. And although it's fun joining in on this simulated large-scale conflict, there are two parts I currently dislike: battles are currently locked to 4 motherships at a time. That's regardless of 3-1 or 2-2, you simply get a "battle full" message, which I found dissatisfying. Furthermore, destroying a ship does not get rid of its captain, so you may end up repeatedly facing one captain, despite him/her being doomed to fail for battling with little more than scraps (since you blew up his/her old ship).\n\nIt's early access though, so some things will probably get tweaked here and there. Still, despite being early access you can already enjoy the full story mode and sandbox mode.\ntl;dr it's different from its predecessor, but I still enjoyed it. If you like beefing up a big spaceship while picking (real-time) fights and making friends with ai ship captains try it out.","May 19","true","51.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I started again on highest difficulty in sandbox mode and have been speed running that as fast as humanly possible. I am still on the hardest difficulty, and I have noticed a few things, the first being that the player stash is shared across game modes, which is nice because I can now stockpile all the rare parts, the second is that there is a cap on levels, not experience wise but the gains, putting 10 levels into weapon damage just to get the improvement of a single low level upgrade was annoying, and being limited to 15 cores was disapointing, i think i still have another 45 minutes until the zombies come and i will see if it changes after that but this war with the reds has been really give and take, very entertaining and with enough kiting i can barely take a 1 vs 3 now at 90 power, warheads, missiles and snipers, last thing i noticed, not sure if it is intentional or not, but the starbases extend outside of their shields making them really easy to kill, a couple volleys takes out an entire quadrant and by the time most of the weapons are disabled the shields can now melt away, i love the factions but i wish it was more dynamic with factions developing over time instead of the immediate 5, now back to farming snipers until the next tier of weapons starts showing up. . . maybe i should grab another warhead for my engines, last minute thought, multiplayer? would definately buy this for a couple friends if we could have only player made factions and the zombies... or maybe players as the zombie faction leader too","May 19","true","20.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

(Even at this early access stage)\n\nInstead of writing a long review, I'm going to list the pros and cons of my first sitting experience.\n\nPros:\n-The visuals are amazing, weapons, engines, background, textures and colors are stunning for a simple game like this.\n-Combat feels like a simulation, without all the fiddly bits that go with it.\n-The strategy or travel part of the game\nIs simple and takes the "grinding" out of things, while letting you progress.\n-Customization is astonishing. Not only do you choose how your ship looks, it also affects your movement, shields, armor, hull, how your weapons fire and the strategy you employ.\n-The amount of choices you can make to progress is vast.\n\n\nCons:\n-All the panels and icons can be confusing and overwhelming at the start, but easy to get used to.\n-Combat strategy is briefly mentioned but all the possibilities to take another ship down has to be gradually learned.\n-Information on all the weapons can tend to get a bit over whelming.\n\n\nApart from this I HIGLY recommend this game.

If so, go back to that game. This is a glitchy mess, with a completely stupid camera (that even if you try to change it never approaches the level of spaz 1. The controls for your ship, are also stupid. They do not work like spaz 1 and it was disorienting to keep having to change the button to make me head toward the enemy (not a good design decision), changing equipment on your ship is also annoying, you have to go to a seperate screen (where your ship leaves tactical view/inventory tab) and you have to use the gimmicky tractor beam to physically remove the pieces you no longer want and attach the ones you do (after you scroll over the random pieces to tell you which is the one you want). The  game doesn't properly explain what threat level means (threat level 20? is that super bad? Why? what level enemies should you be able to fight? The combat is also too far removed from SPAZ 1..it just doesn't feel right. For instance, only one of my  sub ships spawned..but couldnt' figure out how to get second one to spawn, it's hard to see the enemies because of the stupid camera angles, and the zoom feature is just dumb..you have to zoom in to shoot the enemies effectively, which gives you tunnel vision and you are getting shot from other directions and can't maneoevre.\n\nAnyways, in short. until they fix this mess, i am going to just play spaz 1 again. This game has a long way to go to reach that level...and frankly after 3 years, i expected a much better offering.\n\nshame on you min max, shame on you.\n\n","May 17","false","1.0"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

There's no special effects, There's no rare prefixes or suffixes.  There's no deep ship builds. Opportunity lost there. There's a DPS number on the weapons, but they're totally inaccurate. There's no way to compare parts. The parts often have 6 stats (and buffs to those stats) but you pretty much just have to trust that the higher the stars, with the weapon you want, the better.\n\nThere's a "fuel" mechanic which is super annoying.\n\nThe End Game\n\nThe end game involves the zombies taking over stations and captains, which in theory is really cool. In practice though, it's a giant grindy slog. You can stomp 3 zombies at a time, and they'll just escape and rebuild within a couple days. You don't seem to ever be able to knock them out or even effect their strength that much. I know if I am blown up and escape in a pod, I don't come back in exactly the same strength of ship.  The zombies do though!\n\nIf a NPC captain gets killed by a zombie, it comes back a zombie. I'm not certain that happens if they're in the combat with you when they die, but I suspect it does. I've had several combats where a too weak ally jumps in to "help" and I have to try my damndest to keep him away from the zombie captain that will near-instantly kill him and convert him.\n\nIf you attack and destroy a zombie station, you have to build a new station on it immediately, upgrade the hell out of it and then sit around and babysit it while the Zombie Alpha immediately comes over to reclaim it. If you're not big enough to take the zombie alpha, or if you don't get enough allies in the fight to help - too bad! Starbase and all money invested lost.\n\nTL;DR: So close, yet so far. Needs some design rethinking or it's a fail.","May 22","false","19.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

You've got your factions, your towns, your lords, your kings, your bandits, and all the interactions between them. Cut out army management, nuanced character development, companions, interactions beyond fighting & trading & alliances / wars, faction variety, and finally put a 4 ship limit on and lower the skill cap on battles and you have SPAZ 2. If you're looking for M&B or SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 will dissapoint you. SPAZ 2 is definitely less game than M&B, but what's in there is still quite enjoyable.\n\nThe writing is amazing and the campaign was a breeze, however IMO the game lacks replayability. It's an easy 10-20 hours of enjoyable content depending on how long it takes you to complete the campaign, and for 20$ that seems just about right. I'd give it a solid 7/10.","May 18","true","12.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But you know what? That's alright, because this is a good sequal that expands on the ideas of the first and goes in a new direction.\n\nThe first and most obvious change is the perspective. You are fighting in full 3D where you control the ship from a 3rd person view, (you can change it to the classic top down view with the press of a button).\n\nThe next big change is the Map. You now have free choice to move about the map instead of jumping from sector to sector. Time only goes by when you are moving or doing an action A-La Mount & Blade. The map is filled with sectors where a starbase can be built and captains flying around doing their own thing. Each of the 200 captains will have their own agenda and opinions of all the other captains.\n\nAnother new change is the ship building. You now control your mothership only which you can design by picking or buying peices, nose (front), core (center), wings (left and right), and Engines (the back). You build your ship using these parts which will have varying quality and will give different bonus' and weapons.\n\nAlong with new shipbuilding, you can also create your own faction and build your own starbases to gather resources for you along with getting captains to join your side in the firght against the zombies.\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game as a good followup to its predecessor.","May 19","true","59.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I have played both SPAZ 2 and SPAZ 1 and have been following the development of SPAZ 2 for around 2 years, so I already knew it was going to be different to the first one. I guess there's four major ways in which I can review this game:\n\nStory:\n\nPersonally I think the story is even funnier in SPAZ 2 than in SPAZ 1, I have laughed out loud at the storyline multiple times so far. The lore objects provide interesting background information and you get a reward as well. Great work from the developers with the story, and the computer voices actually make it even funnier.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nUnfortunately given the fact that I have a terrible computer (barely meeting the minimum system requirements) I can't really do this game justice graphically. Nonetheless, I was surprised by how good the graphics look even on low settings, unlike some games where low settings make your game look like Runescape (not that that's necessarily a bad thing, I used to be a Runescape player but for this sort of game it looks terrible). Obviously there are a few weird graphical effects but that's mostly due to me having to turn down the settings, when I started on the default settings the game lagged so I had no choice.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThere are two different aspects to this: the starmap and combat. The new starmap interface is great and although to a certain extent I miss mining rez asteroids and taking on comets and picking up escape pods from blown up ships in SPAZ 1, beyond a certain point particularly on the harder difficulties it got very grindy so I on balance prefer the new system. I would like the power ups that already appear in battles to also have the possibility of containing Goons, Rez, Scrap or perhaps ship parts to perhaps encourage some map exploration in the combat. The 200 AI captains really do make it feel like a living galaxy, at the moment I have a bounty on me and it really feels like the AI is out to kill me, whenever I go into hostile territory or harvest a resource I have to look out for people who might be hunting me. In addition, it is good that the other factions interact with each other, with the captains remembering everything that is done to them it feels like you have to consider major actions carefully and decide who you can afford to upset in order to appease someone else. I also like the ability to build your own starbases for a particular faction and use them to harvest resources. The parts system is quite good, though I miss the customisation of every ship from SPAZ 1, I think that your strike craft should be a certain size with maybe 1-3 cores but you can add your own parts to them. That would be my single biggest recommendation for this game if there are any future updates. The tractor beam system for changing parts is also a little annoying sometimes but to be honest it's not a major problem and several people have already posted guides to avoid/minimise the need to use it.\n\nOnto the actual combat, I think that the new 3d view looks great, and people who want the old style from SPAZ 1 have that option too. The combat itself I have mixed opinions on. The options for commanding the strike craft could do to be expanded upon (at the moment they are little more than go here, attack that, defend that ship over there). The idea of being able to aim at certain parts of enemies and watching their parts fly off is good, and there seems to be a greater variety of weapon types than in the first SPAZ. The new reload and boost system adds opportunities in combat to attack when your opponent has to reload, and makes you think carefully about which targets to prioritise.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the in-battle HUD is distinctly lacking. The distance to your target is in arbitrary units, and your shields and hull are just two bars along the bottom of the screen, with no indication of armour. There is also no in-combat indication of which of your weapons are in range, or the armour status of components on your opponent's ship, other than the visuals. As a bit of a statistics nerd, I would prefer to see a lot more in the way of hard numbers like the first game. I would also like to see the return of shield quadrants, as that used to be one of the main reasons to have a fast ship. Whilst in SPAZ 2 a fast ship is still useful for dodging and hit and run attacks, I don't understand why shield quadrants were removed as that made the game much more strategic.\n\nProgression:\n\nObviously this is subject to balancing changes and I can't comment across the full game as I haven't finished the campaign yet. I think that the game's difficulty and complexity is about right. I have not yet reached a situation where either my ship is so strong that combat becomes too easy or I have way too many resources, nor have I ever reached a point where I am grinding for hours and hours on end just to make some small progression through the game. I have never had to spend more than 2-3 hours to gather the resources and upgrades to progress, whereas SPAZ 1 sometimes required hours upon hours of exploration and searching for blueprints, which whilst fun at first quickly became boring. I have heard about a few complaints regarding the zombies in late-game, but as of the time of this review the developers are aware of the issues and I think there have been 4-5 balancing fixes so far just 3 days into early access.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you are a fan of space games: buy this now.\n\nIf you are a fan of SPAZ 1 who wants to see something quite significantly different but still based loosely on SPAZ 1: buy this now.\n\nIf you are a fan of SPAZ 1 who is expecting the sequel to be a new, improved version keeping most of the original ideas: watch some videos, read reviews and maybe wait a few months for a few changes before deciding whether to buy or not.\n\nTL;DR the TL;DR: if you have been following this game and like the direction of it buy now, if not wait, read and decide later.\n","May 20","true","15.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I spent 5 hours on this game grinding while all the other ships around me far out leveled me in no time at all. So all there is to do is raid various resources of your enemies once your part of a faction, and fight pirates. Because while I am threat level 16 with crap weapons the nearest non faction ships to fight are threat levels 24 and up which take you out in no time. Bandits are always threat level 6 so once you beat them its just a grind. Money, rez, and goons are a grind to get. The map is tiny compared to SPAZ1. Combat is clunky and unintuitive. The mothership pieces all look very generic, they are all the same between factions minus the difference in color.\n\nThis game is in early access but it also needs a lot of its core mechanics overhauled badly! I mean I could put more time into it but I already feel ive felt everything it has to offer minus grinding for 10 more hours to start fighting some other factions ships.\n\nOn a plus the story is interesting, so are the research tidbits. But unfortunately the fun just isnt there.","May 17","false","5.3"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

In my opinion a game should be judged on it's own merits not on a previous game. I think people are annoyed by feel of SPAZ2 rather than any actual bad gameplay, it's a great game.\n\nAlthough it feels different it is actually pretty similar, you have the starmap, you do things like improve your ship, trade and talk to captains. Time only passes when you move on the starmap (or in spaz1 it was measured by "Jumps") Then you pick a fight and you fight. There is a lot more to do in SPAZ2 than SPAZ1. I loved SPAZ1, it's one of my favourite games and I can see this game becoming one of my faves too, but I am not going to compare them in the way it seems quite a few people have done, that is not a review that is a comparison.","May 17","true","11.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

I enjoy the first SPAZ game, and I understand that this one is different.  However, it felt like a shell of a game.  In the first mission, I could control the ship fine in the standard view, but when in overhead view (when you press "C" to zoom out and see your ship from above) the controls seemed random.  Also, I was not sure what to do... I just flew around... and flew around... and flew around... but never encountered anything than a few barrels.  At another point in the game when it allows you to add modules to your ship and such between levels, I could not easily figure out how to pickup and drop the modules onto my ship (not intuative... I just clicked and dragged and click left and right and such until something happened).  When I realized that I was getting frustrated with the game, I decided to  return it and purchase it again later when/if it becomes more polished (and, when multiplayer works -- a key reason I wanted the game).  I can see a lot of potential in this game.","May 18","false","0.4"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

There just isn't very much to explore as a player.\n\n1) Tractor system\nThe devs were clearly very excited about and proud of their tractor system, but it feels gimmicky and awkward in each case.\n\nIn combat, using the tractor disables ship movement and weapons, and lets you fling objects at yourself, friendlies or enemies. It feels very odd given that no other ship can do this, and feels like an interruption of the tactical positioning/work I was doing before and after.\n\n2) Ship management,\nThe tractor system as ship building is just... bizarre. The screen doesn't present you any information relevant to making a decision (you must find and mouse over each floating piece of gear individually, and memorize those numbers), and involves a pool table physics system that is just frustrating and.... bizarre.\n\n3) Camera controls\nAnd again, the devs were clearly very excited about and proud of the fact that spaz2 is 3d, but they amount to 'cinematic mode' and are a crippled perspective for decision making.\n\n4) Game flow.\n\nUltimately the game boils down to 'make other captains like you to get powerful'.Any ship captains that you've ticked off will continuously drain your resources and distract you from your main goal.\n\nThere is no fear/respect concept. The more you attack other captains, the more stubbornly they'll come at you again and again - there is no killing them, there is no 'defeating' them. The only way to get a captain to stop attacking you, raiding you, and putting bounties on you or your friends is to get him to join you.\n\nSo while there are interesting mechanics for war/attacking/etc, they seem like game systems without a purpose. Why would I go to war with the captains? Any reputation damage I do I will have to fix later.","May 18","false","70.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buutt I have my fingers crossed for more weapon variants or armor :)\n\nThe core game is solid, there are some new "systems" in play like reloading that really adds depth to the game, especially when you try to break a really solid shield on a large ship or spacestation, you have to take advantage of that "reload" where the shields dont recharge.

I personally wanted direct 2D sequel with fixed mistakes, but devs should move forward and this move from 2D to 3D is the right way.\nSure, this game still have many troubles, but it's early access and devs carefully listening to fans to improve game as much as possible.\nSo, now to proper review: I divided it to big parts, at which I will compare SPAZ and SPAZ2.\n___\n- Graphics: 2D graphics were more refined. 3D looks better overall, but backgrounds and especially ship design looks bad now. I think bg is easy to fix, cause now some parts of it too much blurry, but design is what devs should look at asap. In mid-late ships become better and not looking like junk collection, and medium-large size parts really helping it, but it still looks worse then any SPAZ ship. I loved careful work on every, even smallest ship, so now, compared to old design, this looks really bad. I don't mind playing on new ships, because designing ships is cool feature too, and also can't see any way out of this situation, but devs should look up this problem. Overall effects is much better, so any part about graphics except ship design (ship parts aside designed really good still) and blurry background I love more in SPAZ2.\n-Ship building, module system: I really like new building system, which represented in block-by-block building, overall this is better to me than old "place in slot" system, but I don't like two things. First is generally fine, but I would love better decision - no compatibility about left-right wing thing. I mean, looking at realism, if port of wing is universal, you can just flip it. Second is what I was almost enraged about. I hate fact that weapon type is hardplugged in module type. I really don'like fact that I should not only seek for really rare 4-star part (for my stage of game, which is about 90-threat mothership and near 30 lvl), but also hope that that part will have this cannons and not rockets wgich I already have many, for ex. That problem leads to another one: amount of weapons is really small compared to SPAZ, but including more in game will result in even smaller chances of finding that precious 4-star part. I really, really hope devs will change it.\n- Social stuff (bases, relations, wars, etc.): This part is where SPAZ2 shines. I think many negative votes with playtime less than 1-2 hours would change to positive after realising such a great feature. I honestly love this and this is my favourite part of game. Being not just a usual captain with better mothership that other is nothing compared to ruling your own little empire. This is great at all sides, from building your base by yourself (I just can hope for block-by-block base building) and assigning captains to it (recruiting is also really fun, refreshing and entertaining) to raids, alliances and wars. I will not write much about it cause there is nothing to say really due to major superiority of this system compared to old "fly to another system, make friends and rivals, repeat". I hope devs come up with more great ideas like this.\n- Starmap, flights, scavenging: generally I like sector thing more, but map size is really small imo. Feeling of big map dissapeared, now I fell a bit pressed by borders. I was really surprised when realised thst this sector is not just a system, but all the playfield I can get. That was dissapointing, hope mapsize will increase. Thing that I can fly from one border to another in 2-3 minutes is sad. Resource thing is also what bother me. On one hand, system became more unified and generally easier to manage: you fly to point, you collect what lies on ground (either resources or loot left after fight) and that's it. Thing is, "faster one wins" system and no creativity in this is not good imo - generally about rez mining. I loved old mining part of game where you fly to mining station and try to pick anything left by it. I don't know if it's neccessary, but scavenging part lacks creativity. Also lore picking is simple, but not creative, wish something to change here also.\n- Last, but not least - fights: this is where I struggle most in picking what system better - SPAZ or SPAZ2. SPAZ fights feel smoother, especially with all that weapon types, but new addition like ramming with part breaking (I love this feature, ramming everyone eveytime), autoshoot system (this is really needed in 3D, thank you devs for including it) and escape gates - this is better than almost unstoppable retreat in SPAZ. Also big thumb up for option to fight in usual 2D (good move to 2D fans, but I personally do not use it). I will hold up my decision on what better and what worse for now, maybe add to review later.\nAlso look like there is too much text going on in campain, but it can be just me.","May 21","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spaz 2 is a good game but I can see it dying off rather quickly without mods and expansions. I have beaten the campaign and started a sandbox mode and beat it and felt NOTHING different besides the sliders to increase or decrease difficulty, which means more or less grinding, everyone loves grinding right? I have read what the developers are focusing on, balance and hopefully multiplayer, so theres nothing new coming out when they fully release the game, sad.. I can see sooo many more weapons and modules and strike craft to add to the game, with a game like this those possibilities are almost endless.\n\nALpha Release rating 6/10 because very low replayability, beat the game twice and you would have done everything. In a game designed to be replayed multiple times, this is not a good sign.\n\nVery impressive for a two person team, keep up the great work and I'll keep buying your games!!\nThis game is worth a look.","May 19","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
