"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/297490/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","Spy Chameleon - RGB Agent is stealthy in much the same way taking a sack full of hammers to the face is stealthy; while the perpetrator announces his assault beforehand with a vuvuzela blast.  That is to say, it's not stealthy at all.\n\nWow, that's a pretty rough opener for a supposed stealth game, eh?  But you'll notice I still gave this one a thumbs up.\n\nTo continue my metaphor, the stitching on the bag was just exquisite, the sound of the hammers crashing together was a tour de force, and the bits of my skull moved in ways that frankly astounded medical experts.  Fortunately, I am the kind of guy who can appreciate these things.  Though I'd have appreciated them more if they'd happened to somebody else.\n\nYou see, as the living, breathing reason banks feel compelled to keep their pens attached to chains, I think of myself as something of an expert on stealth games.  There's nothing I love more than stealth done right in video games.  But what is a stealth game and why doesn't Spy Chameleon qualify?\n\nWell, a stealth game has you move through an area, usually attempting to accomplish some objective (say, take everything not nailed down) and leave without being seen.  There's a danger of being caught and that requires some intelligence on the part of the challenges standing between you and your objectives.  For a game to be a stealth game, it needs reactive enemies, otherwise it's just an obstacle course.  And that's what Spy Chameleon is: a time trial, obstacle course, collect-a-thon game.\n\nYes, it has the trappings of stealth.  You play as the titular chameleon spy, you are told briefly that your goal is to steal a thing and shown a picture of the thing at the end of several levels, and the obstacles take the form of "enemies" with vision cones.  But everything moves in perfect clockwork without reaction to your presence.  Changing your color to "hide" is just another form of dodging a static obstacle.\n\nYou'll notice stealth is even a Steam user tag.  The devs themselves describe Spy Chameleon as: "a challenging arcade-puzzle game where the player needs to avoid being spotted thanks to the color-changing mechanisms of the main character."\n\nSo, yeah, Spy Chameleon fails as a stealth game.  But, now that that bone has been picked, if we judge it as an "arcade-puzzle game" or by my own moniker, "run-aroundy, collecty, obstacle torture time," then Spy Chameleon is an excellent example of its kind.  Personally, I couldn't stand playing it, since I don't much care for time trial obstacle courses that play to my OCD desires to collect all the bits.  But I have to admit, there's a Rube-Goldberg machine-like complexity to the levels and the timing required to solve them that makes them satisfying to complete.\n\nLike the sack of hammers, it's fundamentally solid in its design and its presentation is surprisingly nice.  Spy Chameleon's soundtrack makes up for the game's lack of true infiltration by seeping it's bassy post-modern jazz into that part of your brain designed for looping catchy tunes.  And thanks to the artists, my favorite part of the game was failing the levels (which is good because I failed a lot).\n\nEach failure shows you an image of the hazard that caught you: giant staring gold fish, trash-can robots spewing bold japanese writing, and the spy chameleon with a look of soul-wrenching embarassment for being caught about his naughty voyeuristic business.  The art assets manage to convey a ton of character, and - as you'd expect for a game called RGB Agent - it's all in bright eye-catching primaries.  Even the rather thematically dull environments: lab, office, storage rooms; are bright and good looking.\n\nIt's just a shame the art designer's theory seems to stop at the visuals.  The game looks like it has a ton of character.  Even the very premise that we're specifically playing a chameleon who is a spy is appealing.  But it never really goes anywhere with it.  There's no narrative to speak of.\n\nOh, you're told that you're trying to get a photo of some celebrity with their paramour or steal a work of art, but you just run 15 levels of obstacles and then see a picture of the thing you got.  I'm not necessarily asking for War and Peace, or even any dialogue or text, but it feels like an opportunity was missed to tie all the whimsical characters together into some sort of cohesive story.  That might have gotten me to love the game despite not enjoying the gameplay.\n\nAnd to better explain the gameplay:  You control the chameleon from a top down view and you navigate a room full of hazards: field-of-view cones attached to enemies that move in a set pattern.  If you touch a cone, you lose.  In addition to just dodging the cones as they move, you can stand against colored objects in the background and not be "seen."  Naturally, you've got the primary colors and the chameleon's natural green (i.e. 360 controller colors).  Along the way you collect flies and ladybugs strewn about the level for points and to unlock more levels.  You are, of course, challenged to beat a certain time.  There are a few variations to these basic mechanics: switches to open doors, movable obstacles to block vision cones, etc.  It is best to think about the levels as a puzzle, where the solution is where you move and finding the proper timing.\n\nThe game has a sort of phone-game sensibility to it.  You play a series of very short levels and get ranked at the end of them.  It's clearly not a mobile port.  It just has that arrangement.\n\nIt's mostly flawless in its implementation.  The only mechanical problem is that the chameleon's model obscures the parts of his body that are vulnerable to being seen.  Only the trunk of his body seems to trigger a failure and his bulbous head and tail make it hard to see the exact point you can safely stand.\n\nThat might seem a fussy complaint, but Spy Chameleon is a harsh time-trial collection hell.  The difference between you getting your lovely leaderboard/completionist cheese and a big fat shock for losers in this particular rat maze is literally measured in thousandths of a second. Well, okay, it is measured in that, but just getting through will probably require you to operate on the scale of hundredths of a second.\n\nNo big deal for you speed-run, obstacle course aficionados, I'm sure.\n\nThat does lead to my other complaint.  I found there's not really a good balance for the difficulty.  It's a minor complaint since the game includes an easier mode and you can even skip levels that are giving you trouble, but it still stands.  On the "normal" difficutly I found the game to be a really boring exercise in just going from point A to point B.  Like connect-the-dots in full, glorious 3D.\n\nOn hard, though, (which is the only difficulty that counts according to the game and its lusty achievements) I found the timing to be just outside of human reaction speed at points and my success was basically a matter of luck and treating my controller in a manner that would no doubt have it taken away from me by the authorities if they only knew.\n\nAnd that's Spy Chameleon:  terrible stealth game.  Good speed-run, puzzle, collection thing.\n\nI suppose it's been mislabeled since there aren't a lot of games that marry stealth and speed well and somebody's gonna want that.  The only one I can think of is The Marvelous Miss Take (which looks a bit like Spy Chameleon, actually).  If you want stealth and speed, play that.  But don't overlook Spy Chameleon because it doesn't do stealth.  Just be sure you're the kind of person that enjoys a sack of hammers to the face.\n\nEr, "challenging arcade-puzzle" game.","July 13, 2015","true","9.1"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","88","43","49","22","11"

Also, the extended mission goals (find the ladybugs, speed run,...) help to add some challenge for completionists and definitely enhance replayability. In some levels the additional goals may create some frustration as they rely heavily on timing and/or location, but since you clearly feel how you get better with each try until you eventually reach the solution to those harder puzzles, that actually encourages you to keep playing. I admit that this is a matter of personal preference, but so far with me it's worked that way.\n\nEven though gameplay is the strongest point for me, visuals work nicely, too, I love the chameleon design.

I hardly ever go for indie titles or casual games, but this one is a total anomaly! With damn near infinite replay value thanks to the fly/time/ladybug challenges plus a global leaderboard, this game has had me hooked since I picked it up 24 hours ago.\n\nSpy Chameleon has one of the best learning curves I've ever experienced in a game - many levels are made in a way that is easy enough to complete, but difficult to master, especially in the later stages. The difficulty very gradually goes up, to the point where you don't even really realize that it's getting more difficult until you're trying to break the world record and you fail 50 times.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game isn't introduced all in the first 5 or 10 stages, which I believe is an extremely strong point. It gradually introduces new mechanics over each mission of 15 levels, so you aren't bombarded with new gimmicks but learn exactly how each new obstacle works and how it can be overcome.\n\nSpy Chameleon is one of the best games I've played in quite a while. It stand out in my mind for being so different, while pretty much nailing the difficulty curve and keeping the player interested. I very much recommend this game to everybody, easily worth the price!","June 12, 2014","true","25.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Some of the later levels were a bit more DIAS (Do It Again Stupid) for my tastes, but other then those handful of levels I quite enjoyed playing this. It's a top-down stealth game where the fun trick is you're a chameleon, so if the ground is red, blue, green or yellow then you can hide from enemies and cameras by changing to that color. I thought they did a very good job exploring that basic concept using several different mechanics. Yes, it does have a box you can hide in to avoid notice when not moving :-). My least favorite part was in the later levels when they had movable walls. Those seemed to be too twitchy for me.

At first this is mitigated by the quick restarts and frequent checkpoints so when you die you rarely lose more than 10 seconds.\n\nBut the design only gets more dickish, in the end I spent 20 minutes on a single checkpoint that required pixel perfect, perfectly timed movement to simultaneously dodge 3 camera bots while pushing a block that was your only source of cover. You have to run around this crate pushing it an inch at a time before you run back to cover about 10 times in a row to complete the checkpoint and get caught on one corner for a fraction of a second and you're dead.

For me, using the controller was better because the colour change buttons were easier to remember and push.\n\nAs a stealth game, the gameplay is the same through out the game, you hide from enemies (sometimes for several seconds), eat flies, push stuff and try to make your way out the other door. For some people this may seem boring, but I found the different enemies, level design and strategies to get past enemies, made me want to keep playing this game (that and the achievements).\n\nThe enemies are great, they're so cute and deadly at the same time.

The problem is the execution :P You have to use Chameleon's ability to change colors and blend in. You have to hide behind things to avoid detection. You have to distract your enemies to slip past. You have to time things right. Timing IS important. There are collectibles and they are fun to grab - not easy, not impossible, sometimes hard. This is a perfect game for me to hate, but it's not. It was saved by one feature - mid-level checkpoints. Without those I would not enjoy it and started hating the game. Thankfully chekcpoints are present, and even though game is really hard at times, it's still fun.\nGraphics is good, so is music and sound. Controls leave a bit to desire - you can't remap things - shame. Speedrunning lovers have a separate speedrun mode. Developer has recenlty released an update containing an easier difficulty and a few more languages.\nIf you like stealth (yep, that's a stealth game), you have a knack for timing then this game is a good choice.","December 4, 2014","true","9.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/recommended/297490/","MikeWelch","ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/","658 products in account","Very disappointing; a nice idea with polished presentation, and as such when you first start it seems like there is real potential for a solid game - but it quickly falls to pieces.\n\nOnce you pick up the basics it becomes unsatisfyingly rudimentary to blaze through all of the early levels. You will have to repeat each of them if you're inclined towards completing all the challenges, but far from feeling like this adds value to the game, it comes across as padding, and simply makes the gameplay feel old all the sooner.\n\nThen, when you hit the more challenging levels, the real problem arises. The difficulty is never increased by clever use of the game mechanics, but rather without exception is created by the imprecision of the controls and the lack of clarity in the visual style.\n\nIt is incredibly frustrating to be forced to restart again and again because you were a few pixels off the precise spot the game determines safe, or because you moved a fraction of a second off when the game wanted you to move. As a result, when you finally beat a challenging level, rarely is there the feeling that your skill has prevailed at last. I wouldn't even say there was a genuine feeling of satisfaction - nothing more than a relief that you don't have to restart the level yet again, having hit the exact sequence of key presses the game demands of you.\n\nIt requires such a robotic approach, and such repetition, that despite only having a few hours of content it manages to become crushingly tiresome before it's done. Despite costing little, there's dozens of better games on steam at half the price.\n\nDon't bother.","June 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/297490/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Spy Chameleon is an incredibly fun action puzzle game wherein you must reach the exit of a level by avoiding vision cones of enemies. It utilises interesting mechanics that I haven't seen in other games, such as the ability to blend into the environment to avoid detection, as a chameleon would do in real life.\n\nPositives\n- A unique concept that really makes for an enjoyable game that you will keep coming back to.\n\n- Beautiful graphics.\n\n- In-game collectibles. Perhaps you've already beaten a level, but you can always go back and try to collect all of the hard-to-reach ladybugs!\n\n- Trading cards and achievements. The achievements are well-paced, varying in difficulty. Unlike most games, there's no stupid achievements like playing for 40 hours or beating the time of 10 others on your friend list.\n\n- An emphasis on speed. Each level has a challenge time to beat, and there's also an achievement for beating every level in under 18 minutes. That's no easy feat, and adds a real challenge to the game once you've already beaten every level.\n\n- Cloud saving and controller support. You can stop playing on one computer, then start playing on another, with no loss of progress. You can plug a controller in mid-game and the game will automatically update to show you controller controls rather than keyboard controls.\n\n- Global leaderboards for times. So you think you have a fast time? Check how you stack up globally!\n\nNegatives\n- Some of the levels have ridiculously narrow margins of error regarding precise movement. For example, the final level has a vision cone that must be blocked by a filing cabinet to pass, though the cabinet is mere pixels wider than is required. Pushing the cabinet even slightly too far will mean you have to go back to the last checkpoint, essentially ruining a speedrun of that level.\n\n- There's a few minor 'detection' glitches; you will occasionally get detected when you shouldn't, and occasionally fail to get detected when you should. This doesn't have any real impact on the game, as the difference either side is only a fraction of a second.\n\n- In addition to beating the challenge time on each level, the gamer is also prompted to beat a much faster time shown when starting Speedrun mode. I can only assume these are developer suggestion times for the 'Sprinter' achievement. While it's nice that they gave suggestions, many of the times are literally impossible -- no-one in the world has beaten them.\n\nConclusion\nSpy Chameleon is an incredibly fun game, and one that should definitely be picked up. While I typically advocate going for games when they're on special, the price for Spy Chameleon is already cheap as chips for the content delivered. I'd actually recommend paying full price for it so that the developers are able to work on a sequel sooner! :)","March 11","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalsmark/recommended/297490/","metalsmark","MetalSmark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalsmark/","247 products in account","Spy Chameleon - RGB Agent is a fun, unique and charming indie game for fans of stealth and puzzle games.\n\nIt a fairly short, but challenging game. I completed the game with 29/30 achievements in a little over 11 hours. It can be difficult and will have you raging at times, but it's very enjoyable. There are some indie games that are so challenging, you feel like the developers hate you and just want you to suffer. However, this game is difficult enough to make you feel challenged without making you feel like completing it is an impossible task.\n\nThere is no story. It's just 75 levels of pure gameplay. In addition to the 75 levels, each one has 3 corresponding challenges to complete. There's collect all flies, collect all ladybugs and beat the time. This gives each level replayability. I was surprised at how innovative the game felt. As you progressed through the game, the levels not only became harder and more complex, but they added things into the environment that added advantages and disadvantages. There's colored surfaces to help you blend in, button-triggered moving walls to hide behind, boxes to hide in, etc.\n\nConclusion:This game is worth checking out if you're a fan of stealth games or puzzle games and is definitely worth the $5 it's priced at. There is no story. So if you need a plot to enjoy a game, this game doesn't have it. But if you just want a moderately challenging puzzle game, this is a good one.","February 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Personally I can only do a couple levels at a time before my attention starts to wander but I always find myself coming back to it.

The game is pretty challenging even on normal, requiring split second evasive maneuvers and decent planning to make it through. Thankfully, the checkpoint system keeps levels from dragging when trying to get past the hard parts. The concept is pretty fun, as well -- you change your color to camoflauge yourself. The game isn't a one-trick pony, though. It does enough with its gimmick that the game remains fresh throughout all 75 levels. It only took me about 2.5 hours to beat the game but I haven't gotten all the collectables.

It's perfectly stable but gameplay is overly strict for the player and a little lax on enemy vision cones. It quickly turns the game from being casual fun to being quite tedious. It's quite close to what I feel it should be, it's just not quite there as is.\n\nIt may be worth having a go if you like the look of it, it's pretty cheap and gets a decent discount on sales. I picked it up in the 2015 summer sale for £2.67. It also looks nice and has a few nice ideas in there. This only gets a thumbs down because there's no neutral option. I wouldn't tell people to stay away but I'd also only recommend it to people who don't mind things that get a little tedious.

Due to how keyboards are designed (google "keyboard rollover" for details), three simultaneous inputs aren't always recognized.\n\nThe UIOP keys (used for color switching) aren't typically used often in games, so even specially-designed "gamer keyboards" may have problems with this (most prioritize isolating circuits on the left side for WASD-area movement).\n\nIf it was possible to rebind keys this wouldn't be an issue, but the developers - for whatever reason - have not implemented this option. UIOP is pretty weird to begin with, and even without key jamming I'd probably prefer them on 1234.\n\n(to test your keyboard, google "Keyboard Ghosting Explained" and click the first link from Microsoft)\n\nIgnoring this pretty major issue, the game is a fun little timewaster - nothing too complex, but (again, aside from the above problem) competently executed. But as it stands I can't give this game a thumbs up - we're nearly two decades into the 21st century, if you design a PC game, there's honestly no excuse for not allowing players to set their own controls.","August 27, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","1"
