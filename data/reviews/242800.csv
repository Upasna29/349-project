Many of them played a few minutes and denounced it immediately. I have gone from start to finish. The game can safely be said to be 'complete', as in the developers won't add anything significant to better the experience. So why is this game so bad?\n\nA few facts:\n- 5 weapons available, where only 2 (wooden machete and M9 pistol) are actually used for most of the game\n- Crafting boils down to merely creating bandages, you can complete the entire game without crafting anything else\n- Crafting is limited to 7 items (8 in survival mode)\n- There are a total of 4 kinds of enemies, that pose virtually no threat whatsoever, due to inferior AI coding\n- The entire game can be completed in less than 4 hours\n- Shooting inanimate objects causes them to bleed\n- The single voice actor delivers his badly written lines in such way that you would quickly consider turning it off\n- A great deal of the game takes place in a temple area (The Maze), this area is riddled with instant death traps that are springed upon you for the obvious reason to infuriate the player and slow progress further into the temple\n- Level design makes frequent back-tracking unavoidable - in the maze it means constantly having to avoid the same traps over and over again\n- All enemies respawn after loading a save\n- Survival aspect in single player is negligable, due to readily available resources in all areas of the game\n- Your biggest threat will be the rock throwing monkeys and instant death traps\n- Animation quality is very low, this will be apparent from the very start of the game\n- No quicksave, despite the fact that frequent saving is absolutely mandatory\n- Most of the game mechanics rely on QTE's - bandaging takes about 20 seconds to complete\n\nA note on the added survival mode:\nA rather small section of the singleplayer map is isolated for you to 'survive as long as you can' - this entails running around in the day gathering food and crafting materials, then using a shelter to sleep at night. Due to the extremely barebones crafting system and the fact that everything is so easily obtainable, this experience does nothing to redeem the game whatsoever. If this kind of survival experience is desired, titles such as The Forest does this better in every aspect.\n\nSo tl;dr  - if you're looking for a survival game, there are plenty of other superior titles available. This game hasn't been too harshly judged by others, it fails in every aspect of gameplay from start to finish. For the morbidly curious, this game is an exercise in self-torture - it's not conducive towards any lulz whatsoever.","February 15, 2015","false","6.3"," 1,278 of 1,304 people (98%) found this review helpful 128 people found this review funny","98","278","1","128","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/recommended/242800/","MrJenssen","MrJenssen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/","520 products in account","Oh dear, poor Garry has gotten himself into quite a sticky situation! First, Garry the humble bush pilot had a bit of a mishap during a not-so routine transport job due to Yellowstone’s Mount Saint Helena erupting right as he passed over it, resulting in a crash landing in the middle of...The Amazon jungle? If that wasn’t bad enough, Garry now needs to endure countless lethal cannibalistic natives chasing after him all over the place, puzzles that’ll test your patience and game-breaking bugs that are as hilarious as they are frustrating. Let’s take a look at Garry’s Incident.\n\nSo, here we have Day One: Garry’s Incident, Wild Games Studio’s brand new, first person, action-adventure survival game. You play as Garry, a pilot who just crashed into the jungle and soon realizes that, along with the aggressive and possibly very hungry natives, rock-flinging monkeys and badly animated panthers that will devour your heart without a second’s hesitation, there is also something else going on in this place. Something very strange. Something...alien.\n\nThat’s basically the whole story summed up. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s look at the gameplay, shall we? So, Day One is, if anything, ambitious. It combines a lot of different gameplay mechanics in an attempt to stand out from the crowd. Though the description of the game might have you believe that this is some sort of open-world, free-roaming survival simulator like Minecraft or Don’t Starve, Day One is much more linear than that. You still have some freedom to move about the lush jungle environments as you scavenge for supplies and resources to stay alive, but this is definitely no sandbox game.\n\nSpeaking of Minecraft, there are some comparisons to be made between it and Day One. In a somewhat similar fashion to Minecraft, you have a hunger meter that gradually depletes over time unless you find food via hunting, fishing or plucking fruit from bushes. Day One also has a similar crafting system, where you combine items you find and click a button to convert into new tools and other useful things. Though you can experiment with the system to craft items, you’ll also discover pieces of recipes as you explore the world. You’ll need to memorize these, because the game doesn’t log the recipe for you before you successfully craft an item on your own.\n\nThe crafting itself is simplistic and the inventory menu is sub-par, making the crafting more tedious than it has to be. Click the crafting tab, then click the items you wish to use in the crafting process, hit “craft” and you might make something. Every time you craft something you need to go through the exact same quicktime event, over and over again. In fact, QTEs are very commonplace throughout the game and you’ll get annoyed by them faster than you would watching Daniel Tosh do stand-up “comedy”.\n\nAnother issue with the crafting, that is also something that goes far deeper than that, is the fact that this and the hunger system are completely arbitrary. You will never really need to catch much food. In fact, you can stay alive on the random fruits you find around the world alone. This is in part due to the fact that the game only has a couple of hours’ worth of gameplay before you complete it. In other words, risking your life hunting panthers or combining dozens of random items in an attempt to make a fishing rod is absolutely pointless. You’ll never need to worry about finding water sources to drink from or refill your bottle for longer treks either. Just click C - the default “drink water at water source” button - and you can drink water directly. Anywhere. Yes, even if there is no water around.\n\nNow, the aforementioned is obviously a bug and not intentional. Bugs are something Day One has a lot of. A LOT. I’ll give the developers some credit: they’ve released about five hundred million patches by now, improving upon the abysmal performance issues players had at launch and many of the worst game-breaking bugs. But even with most of the worst bugs now fixed - hell, BECAUSE many of the bugs are now fixed - it’s just so obvious that the game sorely lacks quality gameplay.\n\nI mean, where do I even begin? Okay, let’s look past the bugs for a second. I’ve already mentioned how the crafting system is pointless. Beyond that, the game’s mandatory puzzles are incredibly tedious and often demand that you backtrack and search every single crevasse in the large environments to find that one thing that’ll let you continue.\n\nAt one point, you’ll find yourself trapped inside an enormous maze of underground tunnels, where you need to pull switches in order to align some statues that opens up a gate, allowing you to escape. This simple task is arbitrarily stretched out and made incredibly frustrating by the fact that the switches are scattered around the maze far from one another, and finding them all is a pain because you only have a crude map painted on the rock walls to guide you. There are plenty of dead ends too. Sure, the various traps you’ll encounter are cool and somewhat challenging to master, but walking around for hours looking for switches gets tedious fast. This is not engaging puzzle-solving, people! It’s clearly just a cheap attempt to artificially pad out the game. In fact, the entire game suffers from this problem; you can spend a dozen hours completing this game that only has about three hours of actual gameplay and believe me, that’s not meant as a compliment here.\n\nThe extensive list of mind-boggling design choices continues. The game employs a crude stealth system that allows you to sneak up on enemies and kill them in a single hit. However this system is also made pointless because you’ll find so much ammo for your two pistols that you can easily kill every enemy in the game without worrying about ever running out. What is the point of spending three minutes sneaking up on some native - or engaging in close combat with him that exposes the atrocious melee system with broken hit-registration and laughable animations - when you can just shoot him in the head and move on without risking your life? For a survival game, surviving isn’t all that hard. Well, for Garry, anyway. For you, as the player, it can be a tough test to endure the torment of this game.\n\nAt least the game looks kind of okay. The graphics aren’t high-end or anything, but the jungles have a lot of foliage, making them feel lush and alive. It’s quite ambitious for such a small game. Animations, however, are not good. The world design is confusing and repetitive. You’ll also get stuck on objects or invisible walls all the time and you can clip through objects and even the ground. The sound design wobbles between mediocre and horrendous. Aiming your weapon feels sluggish. The inventory menu feels like it’s a pre-alpha placeholder. The QTEs are never-ending and...the list just goes on and on. Let’s cut it off here, shall we?\n\nI can sympathise with Garry Friedman. He’s in a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. As was I, when I played this game. No matter how hard I tried to look for redeeming factors, I just couldn’t find any. When I finally reached the abrupt ending, I was disappointed that the game just wrapped up before it ever made use of any of its interesting mechanics and before it went anywhere with the story. But, at the same time, I was also happy that I was finally out of that hell. It’s obvious that the developers had a lot of ambitious ideas, but sadly the few mechanics that work are rendered pointless by the level design and the game-breaking bugs. Despite some glints of ambition here and there, even when ignoring the bugs, there isn’t anything here to warrant purchasing Day One: Garry’s Incident.","November 21, 2013","false","5.9"," 1,919 of 1,993 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","919","1","0","23"

Keep in mind, I have bought Shaq Fu, Duke Nukem Forever, and even though I  don't like Call of Duty I still bought them to try them out. BUT THIS! This is by far the worst game I've played. I understand that it's being worked on, but more work should have been done before being put up for purchase. The combat is broken, I have no clue what I'm doing or where I'm going, the puzzles that I do find are too easy. You can take damage if you fall from a height slightly higher than your jump. Your gun...is not a gun. Guns kill people when you shoot them and the bullet hits the person. Here, it just mildly annoys them. But you! Oh you die really easily. You can take damage even if your hurting the enemy. You'll see them react to getting hit, they look like they can't attack you, but you still get hurt somehow!\n\nThe game is unplayable as it is. You get attack often giving you no time to heal and figure out what to do. Some could say this adds a chalenge, but I say if that is the case then it's an unfair one. I'm just glad that it has steam cards so I can get some of my money back.\n\nSomewhere under all of the bugs, glitches and poor design choices, there is a good game. A game that can live up to the description the game gives you (the reason I bought this game thinking it might be good) but right now, unless the develepor can get some help, this game is not going to go anywhere.","November 26, 2013","false","2.6"," 1,292 of 1,352 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","292","1","2","7"

It's the equivalence of if all the animals in the world took the biggest sh*t in their life and piled them on top of each other, oh and all of them had the diarrhea. Let's have a look at the strikes against this game shall we?\n\nFirst off, the graphics in the game look like a late ps2 game and considering this is a game that was released when GTA V was released that's unacceptable.\n\nSecond, no matter how good your computer is and no matter how low the graphics are set to in the game, ur computer will have alot of trouble running this "game"\n\nThird, most of the sound for the game is missing, for instance at the beginning of the game u need to escape a temple and all of it is falling apart and when some of it hits the ground there was no f*cking sounds! Tht is basic game design add the sounds in! Even old atari 2600 games had sound!\n\nAnother thing tht I noticed with the falling parts of the temple, despite the temple being made of stone all the parts that fell off were wood. How cheap were thes guys they couldn't copy and paste stone off of the walls and onto the ground so they had to do with wood?\n\n\nAnd all of that is in the beginning of the game! I have more complaints when u get out of the temple.\n\nThe one thing u notice is that there are tons of trees around u and tons of nature. Just a shame u can walk though the whole thing! I'm not kidding you can literally walk through the trees. Apparently the game must have been a huge fan of another game "BIG RIGS: OVER THE ROAD RACING". The creator must have loved that game so much tht he wanted to turn it into a first person, survival game called "Day one: Garry's Incident"\n\nAnyway a person takes ur flask u chase her to a camp and she wants panther meat in exchange for the flask. I find the panther and then he jumps on me and this panther looks really realistic (Sarcasm). It looks like he was made by a 5 year old out of clay. Then I take the meat back, get my flask then........ nothing. It gives me anther objective to find the plane that I crashed in but I've looked all over the jungle for a solid 3 hours and I can't find it.\n\nI found other quests such as search temples and solve puzzles that the dumbest man on earth would call "child's play" A quest where u need to rescue a tribe leader and u get a piece of meat....... WOW A PIECE OF F*CKING MEAT! NOT A GUN! NOT AMMO! NOT BANDAGES BUT NO U GET F*CKING MEAT! I can't see why the other tribes leader wants to take over her village  if the best she can offer for someone saving her life is giving them a piece of meat.\n\nUPDATE: I eventually found the plane next to one of the villages. Garry drops his alcohol in one of the crates and it explodes... expect it to have a hangover.Then I get a bad cutscene that looks like it was made in microsoft publisher used in a slide show. It then tells u to escape the jungle. WHAT! WHAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF FINDING THE PLANE THEN IF ITS STUCK IN A TREE. HE KNEW IT WAS STUCK IN A TREE AT THE BEGINNING. WHAT DID HE THINK HE COULD SALVAGE IT! YEAH GO GARRY TRY AND PUSH THAT PLANE TO CIVILIZATION!\n\nThe next part involves u trying to find a gate to leave the jungle... wow. A gate. TRIBESPEOPLE ARE FORCED TO USE STRAW AND STONE (no wait no no no sry straw and wood yeah thts right) TO MAKE THEIR HOUSES AND HERE IS A FULL METALIC GATE! WHERE DID THEY GET THE MATERIAL TO MAKE THAT THING! and this is the part where I hit a dead end. The objective says open the gate. Sounds simple. But I tried everything and nothing works. Not sure wht im meant to do\n\nUPDATE: Turns out I needed to use the artifact I found in the temples on a srange statue next to the gate. The gate opens and then the gate opens and I end up falling through the floor. I end up in an underground lair used by the unknown created by whoever made it. This is a big place for 1 simple objective... open a door...... there's no puzzle nothing uneed to do except pull a chain top open the door. THT IS JUST A HUGE WASTE OF SPACE ON MY MEMORY FOR MY COMPUTER NO WAIT! LET ME REFRASE THT.. THIS WHOLE GAME IS A WASTE ON MY COMPUTER'S MEMORY.\n\nAnother thing, u won't believe this, but someone at the development team must have been thinking "hmmm I like crafting... and I like QTEs (Quick time events) HA! I knw Let's fuse things together" That's right the cafting involves u needing to o a Quick time event. Ican't make that up. If u want to craft a bandage u need to press "W" in time to rip the cloth. To put on the bandage u need to tap "W" press "D" to get the cap off ur flask then tap "W" to clench ur hand at he right moment and then hold "S" to wrap a long bandage around urself. WHT WERE  THEY THINKKING!\n\nAnother thing tht I have to talk about are the monkeys....They attack u. Yeah! monkeys hit u with rocks! plus the monkeys are completely bugged and are one of the most glitched things in the game. Once a monkey was facing the wrong direction to hit me with rocks and while he was still facing the wrong direction he still hit me. Also 3 times this next one has happened the monkey sometimes gets stuck in the huts of the villages.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of glitches this game is one of the most buggiest messes I've seen. I died once and then I repeatedly spawned under the map and died again which forced me to restart the game. The panther bodies have disappeared for me several times when I want to skin them. Every time I try to climb up a temple I seem to get stuck on one of the stairs. In a few cases my game even crahsed when trying to bring up the inventory. The list goes on and on\n\nEven worse the deveelopers of the game have the nerve of trying to convince people tht the game is good! They took down a youtube video game reviewer's review of day one garry's incident for criticising the game and the youtuber's name is TotalBiscuit. They claimed to be doing it on copyright claims for use of GAMEPLAY OF Garry's incident! Other videos with gameplay stayed on but totalbiscuits was removed as his was the most viewed and he eventually made them put it back  on youtube. Another thing they did was that they payed a few people to put up positive reviews of the game on metacritic.\n\nAnother thing  that shocks me is that they released a DLC For the game called "Survival". U HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! U RELEASE A DLC FOR AN UNSTABLE GAME! U SHOULD HVE AT LEAST PATCHED UR GAME FIRST BEFORE PUTTING IN DLC!\n\nWhile we're on the topic of the DLC I'll tell u about it. It's basically u r trapped in te jungle but there is no story u just need to survive as many days in game as u can but it commits the biggest crime in a survival game THE DLC IS BORING! There are hardly any enemies in survival when u strt there r quite a few monkies and that is the hardest moment in all of survival the beginning. It's incredibly easy to survive aswell. There r tons of items surrounding the area, since there are hardly any enemies in the DLC there is hardly any threat! the only thing u will struggle to find is bamboo but objects regenerates.\n\nThis game has to be one of the worst, unstable games I've found.\n\nPros:\n\n+An interesting concept\n+An OK plot\n\nCons:\n-Bad grphics for 2013\n-Bad crafting interface\n-Terrible performance on any PCs\n-Glitched and bad A.I\n-Dialogue sometimes repeats itself\n-Some quests are glitched\n-They release a DLC for the game before patching it as if saying "This is the best it's gonna get"\n-An unforgiving price of £2.49\n-U can make a list of all of the stuff u can walk through\n-Quest objectives are sometimes unspecific\n-Extra missions are deleted from ur journal once u leave the area\nVerdict: 0/10\n\nUpdate 04/02/2016: for more on this game check out my gamefaqs review here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/679098-day-one-garrys-incident/reviews/161858\n\nSteam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","July 24, 2015","false","23.7"," 757 of 866 people (87%) found this review helpful 346 people found this review funny","87","757","866","346","43"

I got it on sale before it came out ($15 instead of $20) and I still feel like I overpaid/was ripped off.

Everything.\n\nPros\n1. Protagonist has a beard. I like love beards.\n\nLong version:\n\nAlright, so as you've seen from the reviews, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I honestly bought this game because I thought I could find genuine interest for it, but I was so wrong. Even for $0.99, this game isn't worth it. This game literally is competing for bottom place with Bad Rats- it's THAT bad. Allow me to go into further detail-\n\nMusic- There is little to none throughout this game. I started the game and noticed it from the get-go. There is a GIANT lack of music and it really ruins the mood for the game and ruins the playthrough for me because it's not nearly as dramatic as they wanted it to be. For instance, you'll start the game and soon after the temple you are in will start to collapse, but instead of crumbling noises from debris, it's just dead silence as you only hear you own footsteps. It's so lack luster and I think the game would be more enjoyable with more music in it.\n\nFrame rates- This game is just horrible with it. Max settings on a GTX 950 doesn't even manage to get 60 FPS when I'm outside that temple....thing....whatever it is.... It's just so horrible. Low settings still struggles to keep a steady framerate, especially when outside and combat is involved. Combat is also clunky as hell, but so are the frame rates. Heh. This game is just so unoptimized, like, it's not even funny. There have been several updates claiming to have "optimized" the game, but those patch notes are lies. These developers lied to my face by saying they optimized their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for my sexy hardware. Bottom line, the framerates are bad/borderline unbearable even if you have a gaming computer.\n\nAnimations- Holy ♥♥♥♥, the animations are HORRIBLE in this game. Animations really don't flow at all, for example, at the start of the game you're introduced to our character (actually, you aren't, he's just shown sitting in his chair with no introduction whatsoever) and he appears to be pulling a "Max Payne" and has drugs, beer, pills, etc around his desk. He then proceeds to pick up his beer bottle and he (I think) starts to bring it to his mouth, but ultimately fails and tips the bottle upside down (without spilling ANY beer) and putting it to his chin. No drinking sound effects or anything, he just sets the bottle down and the game transitions into the next place- which is what I'm going to talk about next.\n\nTransitions- my literal reaction to various transitions: "Wait, what?"   "Ummmmm, how does that even work?"  They're so out of place and don't work at all with the story line. Going back to that whole "Beer bottle that he drinks from his chin" part in the introduction, the transition to the next scene is absolutely hilarious. So, he's drinking (?) his bottle from his chin and he gets some sort of transmission from his radio and it mentions something about his warehouse. Soon after, the camera zooms into the window and then severely cuts to a random shot of our protagonist in a plane to which a volcano explodes- sending him hurdling towards the ground with a blown engine. Soon after the volcano explodes and he's hurdling towards the ground, a box in the back of the plane starts to glow a blue glow and it makes a portal to which Garry (the protagonist) goes through forcefully. This begins the storyline, where he wakes up in the middle of a forest; being dragged by some tribal natives to some place. He faints and wakes up again in a temple; hearing a native with a sword sing some ritual and plans on stabbing him for some sacrifice or something. THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO GET INTO, BECAUSE THIS STORY MAKES NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENCE AT ALL. So as you can see, the transitions make 0 (zero) sence.\n\nConclusion- If you thought about buying this game- don't, please, save you money. Even if it's for $0.99, don't buy it. These developers don't need to be supported and get more money to make another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for us. Even if you're going to buy it "for the lulz" please, just please, help some starving kid in Africa instead.

I mean you would think a game released in late 2013 would look good. Especially when games like Skyrim were out in 2011 for christ sake! But no! This piece of crap decided to use horrible graphics!\n\nThen theres the story. It sucks! Basically you are a guy called Gary (No ♥♥♥♥!) and your plane crashes leaving you in a 'Mysterious' forest and you have to survive. And thats basically it as far as story goes, except for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a dead familiy.\n\nThen of course theres the actual gameplay, you know seeing as this is supposed to be a game, basically its just your average survival game. Theres a crafting system (which sucks) , it lets you make stuff like medicine and bandages. You can find food to eat and drink water. You can interact wit locals by either killing them, trying to ignore them or do the occasional quest for them. Theres also weapons you can find. At the start you get a wooded stick, which for some strange reason is incredibly effective, later on you find an old timey double barreled pistol in a temple(WTF is it in a temple for?) and even later on you get a regular pistol, aside from that i dont know as i hated this game so much that i stopped playing it after that.  The ony other weapon i encountered was a magical one shot energy cannon that is permanently strapped to your wrist. Although its meant for destroying walls it can be used as a weapon. I personally loved the idea of this weapon but what i hated about it is that it only carries one shot and you practically never get to recharge it( which is done at altar thingies).The guns you get are ridicoulsly under-powered and pretty much useless, where as your stick is very effecttive. It can kill enemies pretty quickly and if you sneak up behind people you can do a pretty cool execution-style stealth attack which is one hit kill. What i hated were the enemies that i encountered. The most common enemies are natives and i kid you not, MONKIES!!!!! The navives are easy to kill as long as you use the afforementioned stealth attack but otherwise they are really hard to beat. The monkies are actually suprisingly difficult to kill considering what they are. They basically hide and throw rocks at you and if you don't find them they will kill you quite quickly, if you do find them they just run away and start throwing stones again. This brings me to another point, the natives will sometimes just ignore you but other times will completely randomly go ape-♥♥♥♥ and attack you. What i found most annoying about this is that if a monkey attacks you and you attack it it will sometimes run to a native who will then come and attack you, so you have to deal with two enemies at once!\n\nOverall i personally really hated this game and would not recommend it to anyone. This game tried hard to be fun but in the end it failed and just ended up a bad far cry clone.","November 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 146 of 166 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","146","166","15","2"

It was a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kebab forged from the very depths of the sewers. This game also stamps on those who try to talk ♥♥♥♥ about it hence my clever review disguise, you see?\n\nI loaded up the game to be immediately greeted by a menu system that could only have been imagined by a man who'd have his testicles mounted on his wall, peering at them and polishing them at the weekends. I also noticed that this game also doesn't even have its own icon as it was still displaying the UDK icon for the game.\nOk, let's crank up the graphics. This game still uses the default variable names in menus - bAllowHighTextureMaterials...REALLY\n\nI then started the game to find myself in a sacrificial chamber with the world's most oblivious temple priest of all time. I escaped from ropes that weren't even tied to anything to begin fighting him with a machete which I must of pulled out of my ♥♥♥♥. I killed him and there was no death animation, he just fell over dead and vanished into thin air.\n\nI then started cutting down some lights and pushing buttons with my incredible arms that allow me to push buttons from a distance of 2 metres. Then for no explicable reason, the temple starts to crumble with broken rock meshes. I ran out of there and entered a cutscene which contained no sound at all.\n\nI followed a girl to a village and had to do a stupid fetch quest for animal meat. I went down the dirt path and saw a panther which activated possibly one of the worst QTE's I have ever come across in my entire life. I killed it and stole his meat. I brought the meat back and then stopped giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the missions.\n\nI continued the way I went before when I came across a pyramid. I climbed and there were many mirrors obviously placed for some kind of puzzle. I couldn't be asked and went back down the stairs again. Or atleast I would have if I hadn't died from fall damage by walking down the stairs. This showed me the death camera which would look like what I imagine a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fly's vision to be like. It was here I couldn't stand it any longer and quit.\n\nBuy this game when it is super-cheap. I am 100% serious, you have to see this ♥♥♥♥!

Also the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy that i would glitch out when i was in any kind of building. i could be point blank with an ai and not hit them with the sword. I thought this would all be fixed because well it was a new game at the time and normally they release big patches and stuff gets fixed. INSTEAD the devs were like f*** it lets release patches that mess up the game even more. About 3 patches later my game completly stopped working  like the game would crash on launch it would crash when i hit play. it wasnt fun and then the best part was that it deleted my save file. ALL hours i spent playing this game were wasted i lost that time in my life and it wasnt even good time spent. Great games such as any of the ARMA games rock and i dont mind playing it whatso ever. now there is ONE good thing about this game. the whole story of the game (the concept of gary flying his plane into a deserted island was cool) this game was more like a massivly suckier single player version of the tv series Lost. all in all this game should be pulled off of steam and please never buy this game. you will regret it.","October 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 116 of 142 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","116","142","16","0"

I have little to offer that probably hasn't been mentioned already, but I'd like to point out that I purchased this game for the sole purpose of experiencing the pure comedy on show, and I have to say it didn't disappoint me in that respect. So, what's on the menu with this comedy of errors then? Well, floating half-naked tribesman/woman, monkeys that appear to be on acid running aimlessly round and round in circles, cut-scenes that look 15 years old, voice acting that sounds like it was recorded by the most boring man on earth and combat so poor you'll actually laugh when you kill something. (trust me you will). One minute you're alive the next minute you're dead and often with no explantion at all as to why.\n\nEven if this game wasn't bug infested, it would still be fit only to cheer you up after a bad day at the office, because it will make you laugh at least, sadly for all the wrong reasons. So, why not buy this wonderful comedy and revel in its awfulness?\n\n\n\nOn second thoughts... Don't, just don't.

The game is not only bad, but the Developers try to silence anyone who tries to warn others. I've submitted several discussions on the official page, only to find them removed withing seconds.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nWhat in essence is a brilliant idea, with some really great features like a crafting system (even if it is exremely limited), that enables you to make some neat tools and equipment such as: a shelter to sleep in, a fishing rod, and a water pouch for when you're feeling parched. I was very interested in trying out this game the concept is great; the final product, not so much.\n\nUnfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst games I've ever played, the opening cutscene; the part that is meant to encapture the interest of the player is riddled with glitches. It begins with the protagonist blubbering like a baby to some guy who didn't know if he wanted to stand up or sit down, stand on the desk or stand IN the desk. I was willing to overlook the awful animation and unforgivable glithy-ness if the gameplay was at least half decent.\n\nBut unfortunatley the gameplay turned out to be so dull that it makes smashing your face into a wall seem like entertainment. Don't be fooled by the trailer, the combat is... how can I put this... glitchy, no that's not it... terrible? Nope, that's not it either. I suppose the only real way to describe it would be "S**T!".  The game begins with the player being dragged off to some temple to be sacrificed by some locals who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that your helicopter crash landed into their friends, killing EVERYONE involved (other that you of course), you are then thrown into the worst combat that I've ever seen in any game, ever. Enemies seem to be able to attack you even though they clearly have a bad case of advanced rigormortism, I thought that they were zombies at first but alas, no, it's just more awful animation.\n\nMy advice is to save your money and play something else. At least until the developers can admit their mistakes and put some effort into making this game playable.","December 2, 2013","false","3.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","56","59","0","2"

Everything about it feels low effort, this is substandard for what a hobbyist UE3 modder might come up with. The game is tiny. You can run the entire circumference of the game world in about 3 minutes. It's populated by 4 NPC types. You have angry red diaper tribesman, angry brown bra tribeswoman, angry poo flinging monkey, and angry black cat. The bandages are bugged, if you cancel them before they finish you are healed full anyway and they are not consumed, so the survival aspect is out the window. Your supplies are virtually unlimited. The weapons make absolutely no sense. Your 9mm autoloader and your cap and ball pistol both reload by gently rubbing them. The game is plagued by technical flaws. Nothing feels right, nothing looks right. It's hard to explain, but everything is WONKY. That is the only word for the combat and movement in this game. Performance is inconsistent at best. The game doesn't even support my native resolution of 1360x768 so I played it in a window. But above all else, the sound design is horrific. I just played with the whole game client muted. The game is better muted than with sound on, trust me. You will never hear anything worse in your life as long as you live than the sound design of Garry's Incident.","May 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","93","54","58","17","5"

It prevents people that don't deserve this amazing game from playing it.\nI especially like the way that the game developer gave this game to me for free and told me to give it a good review and tell my friends to buy it :) So that's what I'm doing!\nIf you are looking for a challenging game not for the actual challenge but the fact that the game handicaps the player, look no further! If you're looking for a game which is more dull than minesweeper, you've come to the right place!\nIt is great to force your friends to play! The storyline is really unrealistic too which adds a ton to the immersion.\n\nGraphics - 10/10 (Very nostalgic of 3D games from 1998)\nGameplay - 10/10 (Brilliantly challenging, may be almost impossible to play!!)\nStory - 10/10 (All the good parts of FarCry 3 removed to give you a nice nitty-gritty experience)\nMusic 4/10 (It sets the tone and style of the game and has a long and various soundtrack [Not for me!!] )\n\nOVERALL A 10/10 WORST GAME EVER!\n\nMUST BUY!\n\nEDIT: So the game is now in the weeklong deals. That's fab, more people can experience the melted rainbow of a game that is Day One: Garry's Incidence. I am... happy... that Steam are behind this game and even went so far as to use it as a main game on their homepage. Steam would be making a mistake if they weren't endorsing this! Oh wait, no, the developer just bribed Steam to do it. Wow, that shows that the developer has the money and is therefore a great developer! I'm just going to go send him some money on PayPal.\n\nOh and some advice to the dev: If you made physical copies of the game, then the game would be worth almost 20 times as much by the value of plastic in the case and ink in the instruction manual. Maybe Gamestop will sell it? Just a thought.","February 8, 2014","true","1.2"," 693 of 1,030 people (67%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","67","693","1","93","41"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/242800/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","Yay, I get to review this now!\n\nFirstly, I am a huge indie games supporter, but check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfgoDDh4kE0 as to why these devs deserve all the smacks on their collective wrists they can get. Then check out their metacritic page (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/day-one-garrys-incident) and laugh along at its awesomeness. 0.5/10 average user score after 1548 reviews.\n\nStill, it came in the recent Bundle Stars indie game bundle, and surely can't be that bad right? Maybe just a victim of internet hate? And it has Steam trading cards, so it's pretty much me being paid to play it, right? Ha. Haha.\n\nLet's see. The graphics are absolutely awful, simple, low-rez, stock graphics pasted together, primitive character models are pretty much just going through the motions with no facial expressions and really crude, robotic animations. Corpses despawn immediately upon death, though the background corpses that are there are violently graphic.\n\nWhat little voice acting there is is dreadful, and really is just made up of short snippets (that often doesn't make total sense in the context - like "Uh oh" when you fail a crafting combination, even though you don't lose anything for it) set to trigger when certain events happen. It takes several hits to bludgeon enemies to death and in the meantime they don't sound very perturbed by it.\n\nThe AI is deplorable, when you can shoot npcs from range and they often won't come for you as they slowly die, nor do any of their friends around them. You can even sneak right up behind an npc, shoot another one, and none of them will hear it. Even when charging right up to them, half the time they just stand there glitched and let you melee them to death.\n\nCrafting is senseless, and involves a boring little mini..game? No, not really, just a mini-animation-thing, with keys to press, that shows off exactly how poor and juvenile their animations are.\n\nThe plot makes no sense, the starting video is incoherent (though the guy's utter lack of facial expression or reaction or voice as his plane is crashing is awesome), and there is no plausible explanation why things happen the way they do, like why that plasma weapon was sitting where it was or how the guy knows it's going to float up to attach to his arm or why/how he can still change weapons after that. NPCs will appear out of and walk through solid objects at will, the uneven screen shake during the starting escape portion will give you nausea, and you will find dumb bugs like how boxes during that escape portion can fall on your head and trap you inside their model without the game registering a death and forcing you to load or anything.\n\nAnyway I'm out of negative adjectives, except to say that the game is a pile of snivelporking frumpletops. This smells like a novice-level game programming class project that even for that level came out really badly, yet somehow got developed further after.\n\nYet, you should get this game. Why? Because it makes every other game on your Steam list look better by association. In fact, maybe it belongs on my Game Collector showcase on my front profile page... hmm. But hey, don't feel too bad about it, devs, some game had to be the bottom of the barrel here at Steam. By submitting this game, you just ensured another game didn't have to be. Very charitable of you.","January 14, 2014","false","1.0"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","5"

One day, whilst out flying my light airplane, a, er...I think it was a volcanic eruption or something...causes my plane to crash in an apparently uncharted - though presumably close to home - jungle.  I wake up from unconsciousness to find myself being dragged by "savages"/cannibals/guys in fancy dress to an unknown destination.  I again fall unconscious and awaken once more to find myself tied down to a sacrificial altar, with some joker about to stab me in the heart with what I guess, given the circumstances, must qualify as a "sacrificial" knife.  Not tied down very WELL, fortunately, as I easily break my bonds, grab a weapon and enter into a brief but awkward (but swiftly victorious) "combat" with my would-be murderer.  There is a native girl nearby in chains...my character briefly ponders aloud in a Duke Nukem-esque voice whether he should save her - thereby perhaps further risking himself - or leave her to her fate.  I choose to split the difference, and murder her in cold blood with a swift slash of my knife.  Garry has no time for sentimentality, he has some serious drinking to get back to...but first, he must of course return to civilisation.\n\nI begin to search around the huge temple area, and find two fruit-like objects on the ground...I attempt to pick them up.  Wondering why I do not seem to be having any success, I suddenly realise that they have been inside a BARREL all this time - or did the barrel just come crashing from out of the thin air above to magically envelop them?  It certainly seemed that way.  No bother.  Garry will not be hampered by any mere barrel, so he smashes it to smithereens and "obtains" the mangos.  The Gods can do their best to hide mangoes from Garry, but Garry laughs at the Gods and their petty whims...if Garry wants mangoes, so Garry shall HAVE mangoes.  And so I continue searching about the grand sacrificial hall, and find only a pair of double doors which not only refuse to open, but indeed refuse to even be acknowledged in any noticeable way, shape or form.  Just decorative, then.  So be it.  There must, however, be a way out of this wretched place, with its high ceiling and burning braziers and cleaved-in-two bodies casually scattered across the floor like so much spilled milk in a share-house full of slackers.\n\nBut what is this curious writing upon the walls?  No, not writing...cave drawings...telling me I must cut some chains on some suspended braziers in order to get two eyes to light up on an Easter Island-style stone head.  Of course!  Why had I not thought of this before!!  Foolish, stupid Garry.  Two broken chains later, another Easter Island refugee slides aside and a way out is revealed.  Garry can practically TASTE the freedom in the air!  We press on...\n\nThere is another savage up ahead, with his back fortunately turned to me.  I am informed by the on-screen gaming Gods that I can perform a sneak attack by pressing "CTRL" and edging forward, then pressing "E" when I reach my quarry.  I accomplish this, effortlessly but bloodily, by apparently placing my knife to the front of his throat and pushing inward (no "slashing" or "slitting" required).  Who are these strange men, with throats as soft as butter?  I have not the time to ponder, as I must press on as always...\n\nA room, with three buttons with symbols on them.  There are large amounts of intricate "writing" on the walls about them.  A time-consuming puzzle, perhaps, for Garry to decipher?  No heed, I shall simply press the three buttons, left to right...SUCCESS!  No devious puzzle shall prove a hindrance to Garry.  And what is this?  A strange object has appeared on a nearby stone, near to where I have recently picked up a flintlock-style pistol.  It is a magical armband, which Garry - being no slouch, and having no need of trial nor error - is extremely quick to realise, so of course, he tries it on.  It glows with an ethereal energy!  A new weapon, it seems.  But no rest for the wicked, as the whole temple begins to crash down around Garry's feet!  But alas, I am too slow, and soon enough find myself trapped within a multitude of fallen stone blocks which, in spite of failing to kill me, have effectively trapped me to the point where I have no choice but to restart from the last save point.  Such is life.\n\nThe second time around, Garry manages to avoid being trapped or crushed by falling debris, and even manages to casually shoot a fleeing savage in the back as he, like Garry, can do little but helplessly run for dear life.  We emerge, at last, into the open air of the jungle!  Not home and hosed yet, Garry.  Indeed, it is only seconds later that, erm, SOMETHING occurs - there is some vague semblance of a scuffle, and now there seems to be a savage running away in front of us - ah!  The on-screen gaming Gods inform us that she has stolen Garry's all-important FLASK, and as Garry is quick to observe out aloud, he can get by without "the women" but he cannot survive without his regular alcohol intake.  The chase is on, then, to reclaim Garry's flask!  Fortunately, the savage leaves a highly visible trail of stardust we can follow, even when she runs out of our sight.  At some point she decides the game is up - Garry is clearly too much of a match for her - and she stops and turns, patiently awaiting the fate which must surely become all who dare come between Garry and his demon drink.  The dastardly pickpocket duly dies for her sins, without so much as a fight.  She knows what she has done is wrong.  This is what befalls all who do not embrace the moral purity of Capitalism and choose instead to run around in wildernesses wearing loincloths.  Bet she didn't even know what "AFK" means, the brutish savage.  No doubt she would be vote-kicked from a bout of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus within two flaps of a butterfly's wings.  But fear not, Garry is here now in the land of the savages, and he will cleanse them all with not only the might of his magical armband, but drive his point home with the boisterous cut, thrust and parry of a well-placed and witty one-liner.\n\nBut alas, it is here that we shall - for now, at least - end our tale of the wondrous adventures of Garry, lost in the land of the savages.  Is there more to come?  We shall have to wait and see if I could, in all honesty, be ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nVerdict: 4/10 (6 out of 10 for sheer amusement value; 2 out of 10 for actual game quality...averaging out to 4.  See, Garry's pretty good at math, too...)","August 23, 2014","false","1.7"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","89","39","44","35","3"

The crafting and survival system is about as in depth as farcry 3. The combat is terrible, guns don't sound anything like they should and melee is clumsy. Day one looks and plays like a game released 7 or 8 years ago. The story from the beginning cutscene is almost non existant, read the plot on the product page to have any idea what is going on. As for variety of enemies we have panthers, evil tribals and monkeys throwing rocks, avoiding spoilers there is on more type but nothing exciting. One problem that really needs to be adressed is tabbing back to steam and back in screws up the video in game had to restart every time. Really couldn't recommend getting this game no matter how hard i try to like it.","December 2, 2013","false","1.3"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maluno1/recommended/242800/","maluno1","Maluno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maluno1/","885 products in account","My thoughts go out to anyone who, for whatever reason, bought this thing at full price. After 1 hour playing Day One: Garry's Incident, I was overcome with a feeling of shame for ever giving any other game a bad review, because the reason for those just seem petty now in comparison.\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene drenched in screen tearing even though vsync was enabled. I then find myself (as Garry) strapped to a stone altar of sorts in the second cutscene after which I must perform an action (mashing a button) to free myself before an awfully animated shaman ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sacrificially stabs me. During this whole scene there is absolutely no ingame sound, not even crickets. It's like they forgot to include the sound files related to that event in the game.\n\nAfter freeing myself and making that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation meet its demise, I find this scantily clad indigenous babe chained next to the altar and I'm faced with the choice of either freeing or killing her. Being a gentleman (one who sports a blade in case things go sour anyways) I decide to let her go, but I'm using a gamepad and the controls I'm being shown onscreen keep switching randomly between keyboard and gamepad directions, so I end up having to guess what to press only to hear her whimper as I kill her accidentally. Now she's dead, oh welp. I hit her again because... because yes, and she blurts out the same cry. And again, and again, and again. Outstanding. From now on it can only get better.\n\nNow I'm wandering around the temple until I find a piece of cloth and get instructions to craft it into bandages. I do that, and then I place two bandages in the crafting window to see if I could further combine them, and that's when our Garry says it out loud: "UH-OH!" and the game just crashes, with an UDK failure pop-up on Windows and all. That was actually funny because it seemed like he had suddenly become sentient (with a touch of clairvoyance) to our out-of-game reality, and I would naturally have considered a feature like that a pro, had I not found after relaunching the game that Garry says that every time you try to combine un-craftable things. Disappointment.\n\nVoice acting is not something I'm picky about, but here it is a thing to behold. I feel however I lack the vocabulary to describe something like that, and that it would be like trying to transcribe the humour in someone else's stand-up comedy act through written word. YouTube is just around the corner if you're curious.\n\nGiven the red wall of top rated negative reviews glaring at you from the front page of the game's store, where even the couple of positive reviews are either sarcastic or humorously and explicitly trying to not be flagged as 'innapropriate' by the dev (who seems to have tried to do that with no success), you'd have to be blind, stupid, masochistic or possess some real next-level avant-garde sense of irony to buy this game.\n\nBut if like me you got this in a bundle (with other games that you wanted) for nearly nothing, you might feel compelled to let its trading cards drop at some point. When you do that I'd humbly suggest playing the game while you wait for the drops rather than just idling, just so you can experience first-hand what will likely be the most ludicrous attempt at a game that you've ever played. If not for science, then for the sheer comedic value. And unless you're much more easily amused than I, the comedic value will last about as long as it takes for the cards to drop, at which point it will be the right time to quit and uninstall this garbage.\n\nNot that I'm trying to tell you how to live or anything.","June 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"
