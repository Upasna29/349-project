Pick your poison.\n\nThis game also still does not support online coop, despite the developer saying in the original game that he wanted to implement it, but did not have the time.

See my thoughts on why I enjoyed this game so much here http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/214770\n\nSuper Turbo Championship Edition is essentially a significant content DLC on top of Gold Edition, but since it makes so many changes to the game it is sold as standalone with a discount for previous owners.  Loading up a Gold Edition savegame simply would not work so if you started the game in Gold Edition you will have to start over in this one.  It adds two new large areas with new gameplay mechanics, adds a bunch of new enemy types (elite versions of existing enemies with new abilities,) some new graphical effects (heat distortion and shadows,) a new rage mechanic for combat, pollo bombs!, and reworks all the fights in the game.  There may be other changes I can't think of at the moment.\n\nWhile none of the new content is strictly necessary to enjoy the game, I found it well worth the $5 upgrade.  The new areas are a lot of fun and quite unique compared to the rest of the game and are integrated seamlessly with the story.  The INTENSO rage mechanic works well as a panic button letting you recover from a fight that's going badly, and that does become necessary.  The fight rework in addition to the new enemies makes the game significantly more difficult which I appreciated but others may not.  In some fights they went a bit too far though, covering the screen with enemies, removing all sense of strategy and turning the combat into a spamfest.\n\nSo which version should you buy?  I would definitely recommend this one, with the caveat that you may find it too difficult.","August 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/275390/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Hmm..\nNaturally when you're looking to buy a game, you want to get the latest and greatest version. It should have all the extra content, bug-fixes, and so on. However, the possibility exists that the newest verson could be inferior in some ways. Game-design is a constant and always finicky, and nobody ever seems to be satisfied with its results. So things get changed, and changed again, sometimes they're even changed back to their original state. It's a constantly confusing nightmare, and for what? In the end it all comes down to preference.\n\nForgive me, I love to ramble.\n\nSTCE is on paper*, the superior version of Guacamelee! Let's look at some of the facts:\n\nTwo brand-new areas to explore!\nA new boss-fight!\nIntenso!\nMultiple save-slots!\nNew enemies!\nEvery foe has a visible health-meter!\netc!\n\nIf you're hankering for more Guacamelee, then definitely grab this! The new areas are great. They make the world a bit richer, and are fleshed out with plenty of secrets and fighting/platforming to be had. I also like the little changes such as costumes being unlocked via silver coins. The biggest deal is that the controller-issue I had with Guaca-Gold is fixed, making this by default the superior version for me.\n\nBUT!\nSTCE is a different game, and it can be considered inferior in a way. The controversial addition is Intenso! It's the "shock gloves"** of Guacamelee. Once you fill a meter you can become a superpowered luchadore by pressing L3+R3. Once you purchase all of the upgrades you're practically invincible. Guaca-Gold wasn't a difficult game, so having the ability to cheese the rare moments of challenge makes things a bit too easy. Keep in mind that this ability is optional. Most of the time I forgot I even had it.\n\nThe new enemies are quaint. For the most part they're reskins that can move faster, hit (much) harder, and will sometimes teleport to get out of danger. Aside from nega-chupacabras doing tons of damage with their sword-stab, they're not a threat. There are also some flying fish in one of the new areas. They remind me of enemies from the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night. They only showed up in one area, and behaved in a similar manner. If it's a reference, then I applaud drinkbox for their attention to obscurity.\n\nIf you haven't played Guacamelee before, IMO it's best to go straight to this version. It's more convenient, since the original version doesn't have multiple save-slots. Having the most content is a definite plus as well. You might feel the urge to go back to Guaca-Gold for its original "true" level of difficulty but eh...I wouldn't recommend it. Most of Guacamelee's challenge is in a couple of boss-fights, and the optional areas like El Infierno. For the most part you're the awesome skull-cracking luchadore on a fun adventure. If you want a difficult Metroidvania, consider Valdis Story: Abyssal City (also on Steam).\n\nMostly though I'm just really happy and relieved that the controller issue I had with Guaca-Gold is fixed in this game. It's the main reason I'll probably never go back to the earlier version (though I have a fair number of achievements I should get).\n\n\n\n\n*What is it with "on paper"? I use that phrase way too often.\n\n**The gloves from Batman: Arkham Origins. Punch through any defense, combo count boost, makes things so easy.","November 3, 2014","true","7.0"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","46","63","0","0"

Super Turbo Championship Edition is the remake of Guacamelee! Gold Edition.  On it's own it is a fantastic throw-back to Metroid-style platforming, exploration, and "weapon" upgrades that aid combat, mobility, and access to new areas (the weapons being your fists, btw).  It is a remarkable well put together game of roughly the same length as Super Metroid, perhaps a tad shorter.\nA solid 10/10 if you're into number rankings. Definitely worth the money, and the time and effort you'll put into getting 100% and playing hardcore mode.\n\nThe caveat:\nIf you already own Gold Edition, I'm not sure this is worth the entry price.  I had and completed Gold Edition shortly after it came out last year.  Not wanting to spend money on this remake without knowing what made it different I finagled myself a copy through trading.  For those who have Gold Edition and are curious, the biggest CHANGE is enemy behavior.  It is slightly more difficult to scum your special attacks ad nauseum.  Another change is that costumes cost a second "silver" currency which is much more rare than the gold.  And the additions amount to 3 new areas with a total extra ~2 hours of gameplay (depending on your play style).  The other addition, which I never found necessary to use is a Turbo mode which makes Juan faster and more powerful for a limited amount of time. And finally you can drop an egg bomb as a chicken.\n\nAre these changes and additions worth $5 to someone who already owns and has played Gold Edition?  Well, that's entirely subjective.  In retrospect I'm glad I didn't spend the money for the remake, but I am glad I got to play it.  I truly love this game, and if it was made 20 years ago I think people would still be hype about it today.\n\ntl;dr\nGuacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition is worth every penny to a Guacamelee noobie, and is a crapshoot if you've got Gold Edition.\nEnjoy!","October 5, 2014","true","16.4"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

All of the stages and characters are beautifully crafted in a slightly demented sort of way, the fighting flows wonderfully, and the upgrade system is easy to use.\n\nAs for differences between Super Turbo Championship Edition and Gold Edition, there is a new boss, a few new regular enemies, two new stages, a few new music tracks, a new special power, and a heavily revised "Hard Mode" - which is many orders of magnitude more diffcult in STCE than it was in the Gold Edition.\n\nIn all, I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about the game...

Based on the trailers, I was expecting a pure beat them all, but it's actually a fairly original mix of a beat them all and metroidvania (a platformer with a huge map where you acquire new powers to unlock new parts of the map). The two genres are well implemented, and complements each other very well.\n\nOn the beat them all side, you've got an array of attacks available, and it's fairly easy to chain them together, which makes it easy to get huge combos. It's always satisfying to reach 50, 100, or even more than 100 hits combo. Every few screens, you will enter an "arena", where you need to be able to beat a serie of enemies before the exits are unlocked.\n\nOn the metroidvania side, you've got lots of platforming, and your beat them all attacks also serves as ways to reach platformers. An uppercut to reach higher ground, a dash to go farther away, etc. As with any metroidvania there is a fair bit of backtracking to do to uncover all secrets, but all secrets are "fair": the game give you tons of hints as to where they are, there is no random guessing to do, and the game gives you a completion rate on each map so you know if you've missed something or not.\n\nAnother aspect where the game is fair and fun, is the platforming. Like any metroidvania, there is a fair bit of jumping around, and combining your powers to reach the hardest parts of a level. However, the great thing about Guacamelee is that if you fail a jump, the game will teleport you right back to the last platform you were on rather than throwing you at the previous checkpoint, which might be quite far away. So even though they are some fairly difficult parts, you're never forced to play huge sections again and again, you just need to retry the last bit that you failed. That's very nice for players, it avoids needless repetitions or raging.\n\nHowever, despite theses mechanisms intended to make the game more accessible, Guacamelee remains a tough game. It's not a hardcore platformer like Super Meat Boy, but it's definitely more difficult than your average platformer. If you like challenging games, you should definitely feels at ease in Guacamelee, which has the added bonus that many of it's more tricky challenges are optional, so it's up to you to decide how much you want to push yourself. 100% completion is totally doable, but will requires some patience.\n\nOn the same point, it's fairly obvious the game is aimed at long time gamers. Beside the difficulty, it also packs a ton of references to other video games. Billboards in the backgrounds, specific piece of dialogs, characters...there are so many references spread across the game that I'm not sure anyone has ever been able to spot them all.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, people who are not familiar with platformers should stay away from the game. Though the mechanisms are fair, it definitely requires you to be familiar with some platformers tropes, and be used to chain powers together to fling yourself into the air.\n\nMoreover, if you want a relaxed experience, where you're just enjoying the story, the game is not for you, because the story is barebones. Though it introduces some interesting characters, the dialogs are basic, and the story is a stereotypical "knight saves princess" kind of thing.\n\nAll of that means that the pleasure of Guacamelee lies in its travel (the screen to screen gameplay) rather than its destination (furthering the story). With its many references, it's an ode to video games and is aimed at long time gamers. It indeniably succeeds at that task. However you should only try if if you're think that would be the sort of things you would enjoy. Otherwise, you're just gonna set yourself up for frustration.","February 27","true","27.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Gold Edition, and though I really liked the gameplay mechanics, I wasn't a big fan of the theme at first. I also have a long queue of unplayed games I've been trying to get through, and so I set it down for a while. And then a while became a freaking long time.\n\nSo I saw GSTCE come out, and thought to myself, hey that game was a lot of fun, here's the perfect excuse to go back. So I picked it up, and this time I couldn't put it down (still haven't as the game is running while I write this). You have a pretty simple set of combat moves (basic atttacks, direction strong/bonus attacks, a set of meters), but some very complex combo abilities emerge. Additionally, the evolving moveset unlocks new areas in the game similar to Super Metroid (can't speak for later ones, never had interest in a first person Metroid).\n\nThe control scheme feels super tight and rock solid. Often, you play platformers, and the controls will feel sluggish, or delayed. Or the inertia when moving feels 'off'. But not here. The game throws tons of crazy challenges at you (especially inferno levels or tree top), but I always felt like it was my fault I was dieing and not due to the game asking more out of you than its gameplay mechanics allowed for. They push you, but not too far. It feels really well balanced in this respect.\n\nThere is also something very satisfying about the combo system. From throws, to slams, to just straight up clobbering. Popups, juggles, it's got similarities to a capcom Vs game or maybe even a smash bros. It's one of those games where it's just really fun to turn on and beat the crap out of some things.\n\nThe game's art style, while seemingly simple and cartoony, is very rich, and contains a deceptive level of detail. The game has save points that you just walk past throughout the world, so you never have to stop the action. Similarly for starting up, menus, and cut scenes. These devs recognize necessary modern conveniences, and they got the biggest of them all right: let the player play the game and don't force them to watch/do crap that they don't want to!\n\nIf you own the original, this going to come down to what you think $5 is worth for a game. Do you measure it in terms of gameplay hours? Or do you measure it in terms of skilled labor hours put into it by a small indie game company? I chose the latter, picked the game up and have a blast ever since. If you're even a small fan of metroidvanias, I would recommend this game.","August 24, 2014","true","35.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition is such a game. The visual style is unique, captivating, and still coherent. Each objective, and the motivation for reaching it, is always clear, but you're still free to explore along the way or in the opposite direction as you so choose. The collectables scattered about the relatively open world are hidden well enough to require some exploration but not so well that you're inclined to seek out a guide - exempting a select few of course. The ever-growing inventory of new special moves are explained fully, used immediately, and are as useful for regular platforming as they are for fighting. Misjudging a jump and falling into a bottomless pit or a pool of green slime sends you right back to where you jumped from, letting you try again without even the frustration of returning to the last well-placed checkpoint. And if all that sounds too easy for you, there is plenty of post-ending secrets and challenges to test your skills on, including a second, more punishing difficulty.\nEvery part of this game just works so smoothly and is so enjoyable that I had a hard time putting it down. But the thing that really caught me off guard is that amongst all the joking and all the delightful silliness, there's still something dramatic and engaging here. There's a damsel in distress that remains defiant and selfless despite being helpless. There's a hero that remains focused and grounded despite apocalyptic consequences and dying himself. There's villains with their own tragic, narcissistic, or trivial reasons for acting as they do. And there's a climax that ties it all together into something more meaningful than it seemed to be along the way. There is truly nothing missing here and no reason to avoid playing this game.","December 3, 2015","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The 2013 original skipped Nintendo hardware, but luckily Wii U owners get to experience this expanded, definitive take on the game with new areas, abilities, and enemies.\n\nGuacamelee: STCE stars Juan, a lowly agave farmer bestowed with a super-powered luchador mask after a brave--but failed--attempt to rescue El Presidente’s daughter. Juan’s ensuing journey is presented in a cartoony manner that rarely wavers from a peppy, humorous bent, though I found the narrative’s handful of serious notes surprisingly compelling, as well. That being said, the story is never really intrusive. It doesn’t overpower the gameplay, but flavors it well, combining with a Mexican setting and vibe rarely explored in video games to form a vivid, refreshing personality that’s a tremendous asset to the experience.\n\nJuan’s adventure takes him across a series of gorgeously rendered locales, and the Metroid-inspired progression in regards to new abilities yielding newly accessible areas is pervasive throughout. The game does a good enough job with this structure, and its world is fun to explore. There’s always another hidden health or stamina upgrade to be found or perhaps an amusing easter egg referencing video games or pop culture lurking somewhere around. The ability progression makes it so that things really open up over time in terms of combat and navigating the game world.\n\nHowever, Guacamelee is admittedly a bit lacking when it comes to the pacing and environmental intricacy that are so key to the best titles in the “Metroidvania” genre. For instance, the map is segmented in such a way that environments feel set apart from each other, and there are loading screens separating the individual areas. The maps can be quite well interwoven within these discrete zones, but they don’t overlap with each other in significant ways. Also, the color-coded barriers that gate off areas until the acquisition of the proper abilities seem a bit paint-by-numbers and inorganic. All these elements dissolve a much-desired sense of seamlessness.\n\nFortunately, other aspects make up for these small deficiencies. Combat in particular improves significantly once more moves are unlocked. In the beginning, battles feel stilted, samey, and very chore-like. In the late game, when enemy types are more varied and the player has a wider array of super-powered moves available, combos become far more creative and stylish. The design structure still tends to rely too much on kill rooms, but the surprisingly deep and fun combat system that emerges over the course of the game mostly mitigates this flaw.\n\nThe way new attack moves also increase mobility (e.g., a Dragon Punch-style uppercut allows one to make it to previously out-of-reach platforms) is a nice touch that makes gaining new abilities feel more meaningful and adds extra texture to the game’s solidly-designed gauntlet of platforming challenges.\n\nThe only issues with Guacamelee are simply minor quibbles that keep it from true masterpiece status. It’s hard to worry too much about these slight imperfections when the game hits so many right notes, ranging from the lavish presentation to the deep combat and platforming. On the whole, it’s a brisk and refreshing joy to play, with a lively personality that's eminently endearing. Guacamelee is a fantastic Metroid-inspired platformer that shouldn’t be missed.\nSummary\nPros\n\nExploration is a joy\nFun presentation and personality\nNice ability progression\nOutstanding art style and graphics\nSurprisingly deep combat\n\nCons\n\nImperfect implementation of Metroidvania structure\nOverreliance on kill rooms\n","May 16","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the new mini-towns, the music, the 2 massive new levels, and the visual updates, but that doesn't mean that every new addition was perfectly executed. My main problem with the game is the Intenso mechanic. It seems really cool at first, but it REALLY hindered the combat for me. One of my favorite parts of Guacamelee was how challenging and tight the combat was, but the Intenso meter ruins that whole feeling. Instead of being a really fluid and tense action/platformer, the Intenso meter just turns the whole thing into a spam fest. This is especially evident in the new arenas. While I like the new arena layout designs, Drinkbox just decided to flood them with enemies to create the illusion of difficulty, but because of how easy it is to use the Intenso, these arenas become a breeze, with no real satisfaction attacted to them. Overall I would still recommend this game, but it's hard for me to say whether you should pick Guacamelee Gold up instead.

Well, since Super Metroid. It features a super fun combat system borrowed from fighting games, mostly and obviously Street Fighter, although it's much more simple and not strictly timing based for the most part. Platforming is the most challenging part of the game, requires precision and timing but game is not very punishing so it won't get on your nerves quick. If you're looking for an amazing platforming action then you just must try this game out, I can't tell you even a single reason against it, cause that is a 10/10 game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jxsin/recommended/275390/","jxsin","JxSin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jxsin/","1386 products in account","The original Guacamelee! is one of my favorite "Indie" games that I own, and I was extremely excited when I heard that the Super Tubo Championship Edition came to PC. I purchased it immediately and just finished my Normal playthrough.\n\nGuacamelee!: Super Turbo Championship Edition adds a good amount of extra content, in the form of new levels, new enemies scattered throughout the game, a new boss, and new abilities. It's a "Metroidvania" style 2D action game, but instead of a bounty hunter or vampire hunter, you play as Guacamelee!, a luchador fighting his way through both the land of the living and the dead to rescue his love.\n\nThe Good:\n\n*Unique art style drawing from Mexican folklore, specifically the "Day of the Dead"\n*Great music and environments\n*Tight controls\n*Clever, rarely frustrating platforming sections\n*Fun combat, with a mix of combo-based striking and grappling\n*Simple story with humor and references to classic games all over every stage of the game\n\nThe Bad:\n*Can't remap controls on a controller. This is a minor gripe, because the controls make sense, except for the new "Intenso" mode, which requires pressing LS and RS simultaneously on a gamepad. This is annoying, especially considering that RB and RT are both mapped to the same function, and either could have been switched to Intenso mode.\n*Game is short. I wanted it to last longer. There is replayability in a Hard mode unlock and a challenge guantlet of sorts, with lots of hidden items to go back and find for 100% completion. But even with the added content, I beat the game in 9 hours (not 100%), with a considerable amount of backtracking and exploration.\n*The new Intenso mode makes combat far too easy on Normal playthrough. Entering Intenso mode lets you just wail on anything until it runs out, forgoing combos and dodging entirely.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game. As an owner of the original Guacamelee!, I received the upgrade at a discount (67% off, or $5). I had no issues replaying the game from scratch, because it's fun. I'd be less likely to recommend the upgrade to existing Guacamelee! owners at $15, because there's not THAT much new content. For new owners, however, $15 is absolutely worth it, even with the short length of the game. You'll want to get 100% completion, and then tackle Hard mode if you still haven't had enough.","August 26, 2014","true","25.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a Mexican culture inspired aesthetic that pops out when you start going through the game. Guacamelee has all the things that Metroid/Castlevania games have had back in the day: Big environments, various collectibles that helps your character grow, big uncoverable maps, obstacles that block your way until a certain upgrade is unlocked which is acceptable use of backtracking elements, and more! The combat is not as simple as you might think for a 2D Beat 'Em Up since the unlockable moves help increase your combos and damage output.\n\nRating: 10/10 because I loved the 2D Metroid and Castlevania games (biased I guess).

Bought this game on a steam sale years ago and just finally got bored enough to play it and with my little expectations I was BLOWN AWAY.\n\nEverything from the art style, to the humor, to the gameplay, even the narrative left a very postive taste in my mouth. It's like a 2d version of my favorite game of all time ocarina of time. You go to a new place get a new power to help you solve incresingly diffacult puzzles just like a zelda, but this game adds in interesting challenges by adding moderately difficult platforming while fighting against hordes of baddies.\n\nThe action is everywhere, if I had to nitpick i'd say there are too many enemies, but a large portion of the enemies are optional battles. That being said combat is very fun. Its easy to string hits but you can do some pretty narly combos. And I love how baddies scale in this game, instead of taking a billion hits to kill late game they just start to dodge and become pseudo boss attack patterns.\n\nAnd each area concludes with a boss battle. The inner sadist in me wishes they were harder, but they are epic feeling. Every boss is unique, has a progression to how they attack, and once you figure out their patterns are very rewarding to kill.\n\nThe narrative is pretty moving. The plot is pretty straightfoward but the combination of the art style and the unique setting of the game really helps disguise the fact that it is basically dude rescues the princess platformer. The characters are memorable, the dialog is good and the cutscenes are powerful.\n\nThe comedy style of this game is gold for me I could see it being a detterant for someone who wants their game to be taken seriously, but its an indie game. At one point the devs run out of new ability names so they litterally say sorry we ran out of names and give you a move called "Dashing Derpderp".\n\nI just beat the game on regular mode, but in order to get the complete narrative I have to go back and play on a new game plus type deal and I'm ECSTATIC. I wanted to replay the original game almost immediately after beating it it was so good, but now I have a reason to continue gaming.\n\n10/10","May 15","true","25.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It took us about 7 hours to beat even with the two of us. You pretty much play as a super-hero luchador in a beat-em-up style game trying to save your princess. There is tons of secrets, in which you don't unlock the 'true ending' unless you find them all. You can also unlock different costumes which gives you different benefits and you can upgrade your skills. I played most of the game with the Diablo suit which kind of made it like hard mode even on easy.\n\nI gotta say this game really did remind me of the old-school games and some of the music even sounded alot like Mario and other games. Enemies were decently hard to beat without being too difficult, but keep in mind I did have another player helping me. Storyline is decent and there is tons of humor in the game also. It's kinda like they took everything people love about indie games and put it into this game.\n\nCo-op design is fairly decent but the camera kinda sucks as it will only follow player one instead of expanding. Every time you die you have a timer to wait to come back and when you do you're a little orb that floats around until your teammate releases you. I felt this made the co-op fair without being too much struggle. Pretty much a fun co-op experience that adds mild difficulty to great teamwork gameplay. Coordinating certain platforming can be incredibly hectic though and we usually just let one person do all the platforming at the hard parts because it was too hard with two people to do.\n\nCo-op is also somewhat buggy... I have a screenshot where instead of dying, me and my buddy just have 3 copies of ourselves each...\n\nI will probably replay the hell out of this game until I unlock all of the achievements. I can't really say too much bad about the game in all honestly so I would have to give the game somewhere around a 4.5/5.","May 30, 2015","true","16.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Chaining combos also feels smooth in battle, if you master it literally you'll stomp on enemies.\n\nThere's a regular platformer features like Double Jump, Air Combo, but what's best from this game is that the game cleverly incorporates it but sometimes it's irritating and requiring you to replay a part of the level again and again because it requires precise movement and fast fingers. I also like the swapping dimension between living and the dead, required when you progress through the game - quickly reminds me to Giana Sisters Twisted Dream and to some extent, Soul Reaver.\n\nGame graphic overall I'm satisfied, it has unique feel for me. Certainly not pixel level. Performance wise, I play no problem on my mediocre 635m with highest quality settings available for me, no screen tearing, no sudden FPS drops.\n\nGame's a platformer, and so as it stands it's best played with controller. While combos are easy to perform (only directional button + action button each), I'm not sure how fast my fingers would be had I played this with KB/M especially when you're required to be fast finger during a fight or moving thru a tricky level.\n\nAs for replayability, when you finish the game you're given hard level to beat. And achievements adding more appeal to come back and obtain. But for one simple playthrough, game's a bit short - I'm clocking at 6.5 hours or so for my first.\n\nThere's a leaderboard supposedly for bragging, but how someone beats the game less than 30 minutes baffles me to no end. I checked around and found it requires tricks, well.... not so good in my opinion.\n\nVerdict, good game, but if you own previous title you'll be sorely disappointed that there's no loyalty discount anymore. I'd wait for a sale or bundle since the improvements are not worth 15 extra USDs alone.","January 19, 2015","true","30.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/275390/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","While Guacamelee doesn't innovate the Metroidvania genre, it uses its brawler/lucha-libre fighting system to make a well-crafted experience. The polished mechanics for both fighting and platforming are worth your time.\n\nMy only complaint is that so much of the game (and gameplay) are call-backs to other games that the game lacks an identity. (Definitely not for the visual department). On the other hand, the similar mechanics could benefit newcomers who are not familiar with the games it works off of.\n\nFor die-hards of Metroidvanias, there is something worthwhile for you too.\n\nThe game starts off simple, but quickly ups the challenge and the world becomes more open. (There is no sequence-breaking, but you can earn certain collectables early with enough determination.) Then there are mini-challenges for completionists that will truly test your mastery.\n\nWhat's so Super, Turbo and Championed?\nYou get expanded areas and more challenges. (Every level was reworked.)\nMore enemy variety and a new boss.\nRebalancing of enemies' and player's attacks.\nNew mechanics: Player-controlled dimensional swapping (switching between worlds on the fly) and Chicken Bombing (not often used or needed except for 100% completion).\nUpgraded local coop: From 2 players to 4.\nMultiple save-slots (so you dont' have to strangle your friend when he overrides your progress).\nDLC of Gold Edition included for free.\nCostumes can now be permanetly unlocked.\nINTENSO Mode (a fury mode for extra damage and other benefits that you can unlock).\nBasically, the whole game was redone from the ground-up that buying the standard game is moot. (I got the Complete collection at a discount, and previous owners got a loyalty discount.)\n\nIt definitely plays like a game fine-tuned from the ground up, and it is better for it.\n\nWARNING FOR EPILEPTIC GAMERS!\nThe one change that I think needs more polish is the toned down epileptic screens and visuals. They are much better than what they used to be, and I'm glad they were changed because they made me sick.\n\nHowever, the Intenso medallion eyes and the names on the boss-screens might still be a strain on the eyes.\n\nAlso, the player-controlled dimension swapping is something I think the devs cannot fix for elipeptic gamers; the visuals are bright and colorful, and the platforming challenges for the harder areas will require lots of swapping between bright colors and a white-circle around the character.\n\nI think you'll be able to play the majority of the game without much trouble. But like I said, the more difficult platforming areas require you to shift on the fly, so be careful.\n\nLet's Get Ready to Lucha-Libre!\nWith all that being out of the way, let's talk about gameplay. The combat of Gucamelee has a careful synergy between your abilities and attacks, making your progression on platforming and combat obstacles both challenging.\n\nAll the abilities you unlock can be used as attacks: The Rooster Uppercut (a saving jump), the Frog Slam (dive-attack), the Goat Run (vertical scaling), the Dashing Derp Derp (yes, it's called that; a forward lunge) and the Goat Fly (Shinespark) are all new abilities that expand your combo potential. And the animation quality is so smooth that it feels energetic.\n\nThe dojo in the game can help you learn the intricaces of your abilities. Or you can experiment on your own.\n\nFor example, if you use the Dashing Derp Derp, and you want to keep the combo going, you'll have to roll to continue the offense (the DDD knocks the enemy too far away). You can then send the enemy flying with the Rooster Uppercut or wait after sending the enemy in the air normally, and then use a Frog Slam or continue with another DDD or a headbutt.\n\nCombine all those abilities with the grapple-based moves (throwing and doing some lucha-libre manuevers), and you will find yourself enjoying every single combat encounter you come across. The boss-fights don't feel special, but they're entertaining to say the least.\n\nThe platforming is no different; the careful attention to details of your surroundings can let you know of alternative routes or other means to unlock certain collectables. Health, stamina--for the special moves--and the INTENSO meter need three pieces for an upgrade, which you can purchase some pieces but you'll have to find a lot more on your own.\n\nTo compensate for giving your character a ton of versatility, the rule is you can use every ability once before you land on the ground again. I have found one or two screens where that didn't seem the case--maybe a bug--where the game forced me to do the platforming one way when I should've been able to use my Rooster Uppercut.\n\nThe Inferno challenges are the best platforming aspects because they're so short, while also very brutal on you mastering your fighting and platforming skills. The same goes for the Mask Pieces, which are all platforming-based; you need to find them (six out of seven before Callaca) to get the good ending.\n\nThe Game's Blemishes\nFor all the game does get right, I think some aspects of the game are lacking or not as finely executed as the gameplay itself.\n\nI already mentioned how the game lacks an identity because it borrows heavily from its sources. Choozo Statues, the memes of indie games and other video-games (from Grim Fandango to VVVVV), the Shinespark ability, the Metroid Bomb eggs--did I mention this was inspired by Metroid?--and tons of other references. But the story is forgettable too.\n\nEssentially, it's two young lovers who haven't seen each other since children now are a part of some demonic villian's plot for taking over the world. I like it 'cause the game reminded me of Mucha Lucha in its art-style and gameplay. But I'm not really given much of a reason to care about "El Presidente's Hija/Daughter" (that's her name), but the game spends a lot of time forcibly supplying plot points to sudden narrative moments.\n\nAnd speaking of forced, those innuendos. I gotta say, I never really played a game before where I thought the sexual tension in the dialogue was a bit too much. (And I played Conker as a kid). Maybe it was because it was so forced that I thought it was cringe-worthy.\n\nDying is perhaps the one drawback that improves towards the end. At every checkpoint, you get your health refilled. and when you die you restart at the last one. Thankfully, falling just teleports you to where you last stood safely.\n\nBut the biggest complaint I have about its gameplay is what you need to do to 100% the game. You have to collect everything; not just the upgrade-stuff, mask pieces, and side-quests, but also the health-orbs, INFERNO orbs and other stuff you might not want to break in order to save it for later. As a result, I don't see a reason to beat this game for 100% completion.\n\nAll you should do for a complete playthrough (around 8 to 10 hours) is collect as many upgrade pieces as you want, then collect all the mask pieces and get Gold raitings for the Inferno challenges. Then, when you're done, you can play hard mode and enjoy the game however you want.\n\nThankfully, you will want to play again because the gender-swap characters (Juanita or Tostalla) have a different playstyle to Juan. Juanita is much faster and does more damage, but her throws are much weaker. The other costumes have some passive-changes, but none that I would consider worthy for replaying the game like with Shovel Knight.\n\nGucamelee: Great as Junk-Food Or for Spicing Up Your Life\nYou can't go wrong with this game whether you've fallen in love with Metroidvanias before or if you've never played one.  You can be guaranteed that you will have a good time, especially if you are able to play with friends (respawns are available).\n\n(Guacamelee won't actually spice up your life; it's a game, not food.)","October 24, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has the battle system of any good beat-em-up, like Castle Crashers, but repetative and annoying. The whole "Press colored button to make colored platforms appear" makes the game more puzzley, but in a aggravating way that clashes with it's high action beat-em-up atmosphere. And all through this I wandering through confusing level design doing the same annoying parts over and over again. The only thing I really liked was the art style and music; the colors popped, and the music like something you really could hear on Mexican Radio. if the DJ had died and the music never stopped repeating itself. Maybe I'm being to harsh, because my entire experience was ruined due to the fact the it didn't register my controller and playing with a keyboard was agonizing. In all, I really, really wanted to like Guacamelee, but when I was honest with myself, I found I really, really disliked the whole experience.

This is how I feel about this game. It plays like a Metroidvania, Sounds like a Metroidvania, but doesn't look like a Metroidvania. Not that that's a bad thing, but Instead It tries to look like something completely different. Something more interesting and fun, and then fails.\n\nThis game is about an agave farmer who's in love with the daughter of "El Presidente" who you've been friends with since childhood and you secretly love each other and we're already off to a bad start. Your job is to take on the role of super powered masked luchador "Juan" and save the woman you love, who has been taken by a skeleton guy, who drags her into the afterlife to marry her, blah blah blah... prahpecy, blah blah blah... ultamate power.\n\n"Wait, What about the 'El Presidente' guy?" Who him? I dont know, he's dead or something. "But arent you trying to save his daughter from the afterlife? Cant you save him too?" is he the love interest? "No but..." Then there's no reason to pay any attention to him.\n\nThe story goes as you would expect it to go. Travel the world of "Mexican inspired world" and fight hoards of enemies while only going through certain doors at certain times with certain weapons cause Metroid to save her from Villan who wants Ultimate power. you know, the world that has refferences to other, more entertaining video games, except they're all luchadors cause Mexican inspired world.\n\nThe gameplay is decent because, well it's Metroid and Castlevania except instead of whips and plasma beams, it's punching and kicking. they didn't even try to hide it, you find a chozo statue and you think "Oh, what a clever easter egg" and turns out that's how you get power ups. certain monsters can only be killed with certain super mover, which you can only use if you have energy in your special meter, and only if your in a specific plain of existance, in a specific place on weekdays, unless it's a holiday.\n\nThere's nothing more to say, it's a sub-par Metroidvania that will keep you going only if you REALLY want to play a Metroidvania game. so to refferecne back to the beginning of this. This game is most certainly not a duck. It's more like a cow trying to swim.","January 7","false","6.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Learning and anticipating a enemy's attack pattern in Metroid or Cave Story is what makes them fun, and timing a roll negates any attack just as much fun.\n\nPlatforming\n-These segments are just pretty lackluster.

There is just one major flaw in it that almost kill the experience for me. The developers substitute actual difficulty with piling so many enemies in a tiny room to where you can't tell what's going on and you can't see your character. There is so much ♥♥♥♥ going on in this tiny room that you can't hit anyone. The reason for that is when an enemy hits you, you get stunned for a split second. That isn't a problem with reasonable, spaced out enemies, but since there are so many enemies another one hits in your stunned faze. Then another. Then another. Then another. The only way to finish these kinds of room is to get lucky and hope you can keep from getting hit even once. If it weren't for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Small room, 500 enemies" thing, I would have a lot more fun with this game. I'm still going to finish it. Reluctantly. I recommend it if it's on sale.

The look of your world is so great, and your humor and music just wonderful.\n\nThe first few hours of the game is also pretty fun. But then somewhere along the way it seems the developers got too full of themselves, and resorted to cheap and frustrating gameplay mechanics. Spikes, time pressure, crazy difficuly jumps you have to make it through, fights made more difficult by just increasing the amount of enemies, insanely frustrating and unskippable boss battles. There is so much bad game design here, and whoever designed some of these jumping puzzles should never be allowed to design games again.\n\nAfter giving up the first time I knew it was naive of me to hope for anything better in this version, but I got the impression it was made more balanced and forgiving. It appears that very little has changed at all. Even the addition of the "Intenso" mode does little to improve the gameplay. What they *should* have done was make an Easy mode for those of us who want to enjoy the story and platforming without obsessing over stupid combos and trick jumps for hours on end, and give the option to skip the bloody boss fights.\n\nSO, got that out of my system.\n","August 25, 2014","false","24.3"," 31 of 131 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","31","131","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auraofdawn/recommended/275390/","auraofdawn","auraofdawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auraofdawn/","35 products in account","Within a few days, Guacamelee went from a cool demo I played for a few minutes to one of my favorite games of all time that I was putting hours into every night.\n\nHow I got to that point is simple: its FANTASTIC. A beat-em-up/platformer/metroidvania/whatever sounds like a lot but it doesnt feel like much in-game, where you can do pretty much whatever you want most of the time. You can explore, you can beat things into a pulp, you can throw a bunch of chickens into a wall--you can even BE a chicken! The learning curve builds up perfectly from familiar platforming and simple combos to nearly DMC-level battles and quite literally the single-hardest platforming section I have ever seen (and beaten). And do I even need to mention how beautiful the backgrounds and level design is?? It forced me to stop playing and just stare on some occasions. My screencap folder for this game is INSANE.\n\nI have not played the Gold edition at all but if you're new to Guac like I was, this is the version I would recommend, hands down. If you're looking to upgrade from Gold, I'd still say go for it because I love it that much. I do know one of the new areas in this version is one of the largest in the game and gives a nice twist to the plot that I enjoyed, but that's something that either matters to you or not. I would especially sugest getting the soundtrack bundle of either version (I regret not getting it myself) simply because its amazing in the way it conbines the sounds of a retro sidescroller with traditional Mexican music.\n\nThe co-op is another thing I've yet to try, especially since 4-player is exclusive to this version, but everything I've seen of 2-player looked good. It definitely makes arenas easier, but I wouldn't do any especially challenging platforming on anything but single player. That stuff is hard enough to do alone sometimes, let alone trying to catch up when your partner is ahead. But if you just wanna screw with your friends, then go right ahead.\n\nSome rumblings I've heard involve people saying the use of Mexican folklore here is racist, and as a Mexican with personal ties to that folklore, I heartily disagree. Yeah, its weird that a Canadian studio made an essentially Mexican game. But personally? It's not near the worst I've seen in terms of using sterotypes. And the accuracy and respect present in the style and lore of this game more than make up for that kind of stuff. It seriously feels like a love letter to a part of my culture that I hardly ever get to see in ANY media, let alone games, and we need more of it. I need to be able to walk up to another NPC singing "Cielito Lindo" at the top of their lungs for no reason.\n\nI'm THISCLOSE to fully completing the game (damn El Infierno challenges) but I'd definitely say I've gotten my money's worth out of it and more. My first playthrough went a bit longer than the average because I wanted the happy ending and that involves basically another playthrough worth of work. If 14.99 isn't that cool to you, its been on sale a lot in the short time I've had it so just stick it on the wishlist and be a little patient. It'll be worth it :)\n\n11/10 would buy a sequel immediately","December 21, 2014","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A really nice platformer/brawler with interesting mechanics, such as turning into a chicken, switching between the dead and living world and combining different moves to get from a to b or to defeat certain enemies. Certainly nothing revolutionary and the story is ... well ...sometimes it has its funny moments. The luchador and "day of the dead" theme in general is pretty cool though. Would pick it up for about 10 bucks. Should keep you occupied for about 8 hours I guess. The amount of backtracking is definitely ok, since you will be revisiting many areas as the story progresses so I never had to "go out of my way" to get to new areas. You can also view all maps on the map screen and blocked areas are easy to spot as well as to how to get past them (dimension shift, pollo power or red, blue, green, yellow blocks). Combat is extremely responsive. All in all a solid 8/10 if you need a scale.","September 23, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also bought the soundtrack and all DLC as soon as it became available. You better believe I bought this and the soundtrack the first chance I had.\n\nGuacamelee! embodies the ingenuity, creativity, and efforts of many indie game companies striving to take the game industry out of an era of abundant brown military shooters, mmorpgs, and other quick cashgrab schemes. The environment vividly portrays Mexican culture along with references to many other games, movies, and memes without being too heavyhanded with it. The combat and platforming are quick and easy to learn but show a level of depth some games can only dream of achieving. Collectibles and challenges will have you running back and forth to grow stronger and complete areas 100%.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroidvania games, platformers, or just any good game you owe it to yourself to at least try Guacamelee!.

It is... but at the same time it's not. It features more content, but half the achievements are gone, and what is added isn't really that much of a difference in the first place,and could've simply been a DLC.\n\nThat being said, the visuals are really something to be seen, the soundtrack is good (and even more so when you notice the small differences when you swap worlds), the gameplay is tight, and it feels consistent... Until the bright colors get old fast, and the game will play a cheap trick and force you to play the game again to get a single achievement because it doesn't let you choose hard mode from the get go.\n\nSpeaking of the hard mode, the only real difference I felt was in X'tabay and Javier Jaguar fights. And boy, let me tell you , Javier was NOT ballanced at all. His dodging feels like the game is cheating you and the white barrier is absolutely cheap, when it regenerates and he will just dodge and swap worlds, or use his aura to blast you away.\n\nWith all that said, the game is still recommended. I just had a few bones to pick with it. It's not THAT hard, but something might not be enjoyable if you're trying to look for a game to complete.

A really nice platformer/brawler with interesting mechanics, such as turning into a chicken, switching between the dead and living world and combining different moves to get from a to b or to defeat certain enemies. Certainly nothing revolutionary and the story is ... well ...sometimes it has its funny moments. The luchador and "day of the dead" theme in general is pretty cool though. Would pick it up for about 10 bucks. Should keep you occupied for about 8 hours I guess. The amount of backtracking is definitely ok, since you will be revisiting many areas as the story progresses so I never had to "go out of my way" to get to new areas. You can also view all maps on the map screen and blocked areas are easy to spot as well as to how to get past them (dimension shift, pollo power or red, blue, green, yellow blocks). Combat is extremely responsive. All in all a solid 8/10 if you need a scale.","September 23, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also bought the soundtrack and all DLC as soon as it became available. You better believe I bought this and the soundtrack the first chance I had.\n\nGuacamelee! embodies the ingenuity, creativity, and efforts of many indie game companies striving to take the game industry out of an era of abundant brown military shooters, mmorpgs, and other quick cashgrab schemes. The environment vividly portrays Mexican culture along with references to many other games, movies, and memes without being too heavyhanded with it. The combat and platforming are quick and easy to learn but show a level of depth some games can only dream of achieving. Collectibles and challenges will have you running back and forth to grow stronger and complete areas 100%.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroidvania games, platformers, or just any good game you owe it to yourself to at least try Guacamelee!.

I would recommend this to anyone that likes metroidvania. However, I do have a gripe with the responsiveness of the input. When inputting the button press of what would be the B(X360) or O(Sony), the system sometimes fails to perform the move I am asking of it. I have tested with a microsoft brand 360 controller, a ds4 and a razer controller. It is unfortunate that I had this problem. It has made certain secret platforming sections much more difficult than it needs to be. I doubt that many others have had this, and I haven't seen anything in particular about this when googling. I still fully recommend this, even at the full price.","October 7, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guacamelee excels in numerous aspects which define this genre, and so for me this was a fantastic gaming experience. The music, aesthetic, and level design are all superb.\n\n- I’m also a pro wrestling fan, and so I loved that the game incorporated a suplex and pile driver into the move set.\n\n- I didn’t have any performance issues during my playthrough.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Absolutely nothing. Guacamelee delivered in every aspect.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI honestly can’t see how anyone who is a fan of metroidvania games would regret purchasing Guacamelee at full price.

I absolutely love this game. It really was just so much fun to play. The style, the music, the puzzles, the combat, I dig it. So much.\n\nC-c-c-combo breaker (!!)\nSo Guacamelee is an action platformer. The level designs are really cool, in the smart platform design sense and in the 'aw yeah this place looks bangin' sense. The levels weren't exactly hard (I don't know if this or just the combat changes in hard mode though), but mixed with the combat, it was fast-paced, kept you on your toes, utilized all your powers, and generally makes you feel awesome while playing.\n\nBut aside from the actual platforming aspect, I think the combat is where it's at. I don't know much about pro-wrestlers, but I sure as hell felt like one. Every so often, you get a new power, and you incorporate those new powers into progressing through the levels and for creating some new killer combos. When you get all the new powers, you pretty much feel like a god. At least I felt that way. Was nice. Very nice. Punch enemy into air, follow them, 1-2-3 combo, slap them back down, follow with a body slam, pick them back up, throw them to the left, roll to the left, HEAD BASH THEM INTO OBLIVION. Yes I love the combat and one day I hope to become the master of all the Guacamelee combos and to make the Combo Chicken proud of me.\n\nWe are Sex Bob-omb (!!)\nSimply put, the music is amazing. I actually found myself shaking my body to the music while practicing my pro-wrestling ways. I don't know how to really describe it, but the music really added that extra 'unf'. Especially the boss theme. I totally would have welcome any 3rd/4th/5th boss phases if it meant I could listen to this music and kick ♥♥♥ at the same time.\n\nEye Candy (!!)\nWhen I look at the graphics, the word that comes to mind is charming. Also beautiful and simple. And crisp for some reason. I think besides that, I'm just becoming a fan of this style of art, something that I also see in works like The Book of Life (movie) and Grim Fandango.\n\nNot much else to say other than this game was just as much a pleasure to look at as it was to fulfill my unknown pro-wrestler dreams.\n\n(Chorus)(Outro)(Fade-out)\nSo yeah. Sweet game. I look forward to starting hard mode (re-re-replayability !!!) one of these days when my backlog isn't clawing at me.\n\nGuacamelee doesn't take itself too seriously which allows for some really funny moments. Also, references. References everywhere. All in all, I had a blast playing it and -looks straight into the camera with a generic smile and gives a thumbs up- you will too! Did I mention you can transform into a chicken at will.","May 29, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got through the entire game in one playthrough.  For those of you familiar with Super Metroid on the SNES, this is pretty much like a love letter to the game.  The influence of that game on this one can be see all the way from the abilities you earn from statues to the similarities in some of the platforming mechanics in how you use those abilities.  The only issue with the game is that it is fairly short.  However, the replay value is quite high as the fighting mechanics are simple to learn, but provide a high degree of complexity, making the game so much fun.\n\nIf you're a fan of Super Metroid, I wouldn't even think twice about purchasing this game.

But Guacamelee is so much more than that.\n\nNowadays platforming games are scarce, a sad thing to say but true nonetheless. Guacamelee comes in that front as a refreshingly exciting new adventure where jumping is as important as fighting.\n\nAt the beginning you won't be able to do much, simple button combinations are all you've got to beat the early enemies, but you learn more moves the further you advance in the game. Those moves are both fighting and platforming oriented and you need to use them constatly if you want to progress.\n\nTo make things easier, you can buy diffferent perks in the store in exchange for money you get from defeating enemies, crate smashing or treasure hunting. You can also buy different skins for your character, both male and female, that will\ngive you useful bonuses in exchange for silver coins that you get in some particular chests and once you beat an arena.\n\nThe dfficulty curve in this game is outstandingly well done.  Forcing you to give your best in combat and platforming as well. Guacamelee's got one of the most frustratng platforming track you'll ever get to play (yes I'm referring to the saw blades) but it also's got some of the most entertaining challenge fights you'll enjoy (in hell).\n\nAlthough the theme of the game might not interest you, I can assure you that it doesn't become an annoyance. In fact you're gonna be so into the game that you're hardly gonna notice it. And after a while you may even start to like it as much as I did.\n\nAs for the queer design of the ingame drawing I can only say that it fits perfectly with the story and after the first fights is not going to bother you either.\n\nIt is precisely in the story where Guacamelee turns weakest. The overall plot is average at best but you're going to be so entertained with everything else that, honestly, you're not going to care.\n\nLastly, I'd like to say something about reaching 100% in the game, Most of the trophies are quite easy to get, but there are some that are not. Getting the gold medal in the challenges or finding all the treasure chests is going to take time. Getting the "good" ending is demanding too, you'll have to find all 7 parts of the mask and thet will require something else. In order to succeed though, the developers added two additional powers you can get. The first one you obtain in hell and the second one gets automatically unlocked once you find 6 parts of the mask. The latter is, by far, the most overpowered ability you get in the game but frankly, by the moment you get it, is kind of useless. It would have been nice to have these two abilities available in the new game from the beginning, or at least one of them, but the developers didn't see it that way. So you don't.\n\nIn short, Guacamelee is an absolutely worthy game to play that isn't too harsh, unless you want it to be, and will surely entertain you. Don't forget to purchase it if you liked it!","September 25, 2015","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a unique Mexican theme, with you playing as a Luchador Mexican wrestler dude, on a mission to rescue 'El Presidentes' daughter from skeletons, a guy with his head permenantly on fire and several other bad guys. The game doesn't take itself seriously and has a pretty funny story and set of characters.\n\nThe combat and exploration of this game is where it really shines though. If you know 2D Metroid or Castlevania, and even Dark Souls to an extent (with the shortcuts and linking world), its just like that in its exploration and level design. The combat is awesome, you can chain different style of attacks and throws together and its a lot of fun making huge combos, which happens often as the game regularly throws tonnes of enemies at you. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed the combat.\n\nThe game also has a really good looking and clean unique art style, that thankfully steps away from the common "pixelate everything" art style most indie games use.

If you're any sort of a fan of 2D platformers, buy it. The game is a triumph and I will recommend it to anybody. But that's not what this review is about. This review is about which version to buy.\n\nThere is much hoo-hah in the reviews here pertaining to the inclusion of Intenso mode, and the concurrent rebalancing of difficulty. I've beaten the original game twice - once on normal, and another time on hard - and I honestly didn't notice much of a difference. There are a few more enemies in some sections, but nothing that gave me any serious grief. If you're skilled you won't even need to use Intenso mode, but some people struggled with the difficulty of the original game, so I don't begrudge its inclusion. Think of it as an alterable in-game difficulty setting and if you don't like using easy mode, well then you won't need to use Intenso.\n\nThe purported remixing of existing levels is also very slight - basically a few new chests have been added and some old ones relocated. It's a non-event.\n\nPerhaps most worthless is the new power-up, the Pollo Bomb. Once you've obtained it, pressing B while in the form of a chicken will make you lay an egg that explodes after a second or so, delivering a ridiculously small amount of damage to nearby enemies. There is literally no situation in which a pollo bomb would be preferable to straight-up melee. It only really serves to break a few new types of barrier rocks, which typically lead to some of the 'remixed' sections.\n\nIf you're not going to be using the 4-player co-op, which I haven't tested, this really only leaves the two new areas as an incentive to buy the game. And they're good - nothing has been half-♥♥♥♥♥, and they don't feel like they've been shoe-horned in. They fit in seamlessly on narrative, geographic and aesthetic levels. They offer an extra hour or two of fun gameplay. But that's all they offer.\n\nSo ultimately, if you don't own any version of Guacamelee at all, buying this one is a no-brainer - it has the most content, and is the must customisable to your ability as a gamer. However, if you already own Gold, you need to ask yourself how much 2 hours of gameplay is worth to you, because that's the only thing of substance STCE offers over Gold. To market it as a completely separate game really does seem like a cash-grab, as I see no reason this couldn't have been sold as relatively inexpensive DLC.","December 3, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of the more satisfying things I played, plus a lot of simple good humor (specially when I speak mainly spanish).\n\nThe base game (and it's Gold Edition) is a great beat 'em up platformer with nice challenge in both aspects, but the fact of adding an INTENSO! meter and the possibility of playing this with 2 more friends is awesome. kinda remembered a coin-up arcade back in late 80s. Also, the Metroid-like exploring part is great too. I didn't had any problem at all revisiting areas looking to get that 100% on the area map.

The game isn't as open to explore as Castlevania SOTN since it's holden to the dreaded power-up curse stopping many explorers from breaking the sequence of the game. You will run into many challenging Scenarios to collect bonuses that are too plentiful to be well hidden. It doesn't take long until you stat running into rather difficult enemies that force you to acclimate to their own attack patter, rather than keeping the rhythm of your combo. You will have many tools to dealing with the enemies including a Suplex with long range AOE effect, a Piledriver with Midrange AOE effect, a Standard Throw, and Da Boot (Stronger standard Throw).\n\nThere are times when this can cause the game to glitch, such as a scenario later in the game that causes the enemy too fall into the pipes in a room filled with a pipe floor making the game itself softlock. You are forced to reload the savefile and try the room again if this happens, good thing the save point is only one room back.

Exudes style and confidence, with great level design and the brilliant use of its special attacks both for combat roles and for platforming and puzzle-solving purposes.\n\nUnlike most Metroidvania games, there is minimal backtracking, with each area being mostly its own self-contained "Zelda dungeon" of sorts. This is neither a good or bad thing, as backtracking and no backtracking can both have their advantages (one to familiarize the player with the game world, and the other to focus on progression)—but unlike, for example, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, the moments when you do have to backtrack aren't exceedingly terrible. Of course, there are plenty of opportunities to return to areas to find secrets and upgrades.\n\nIf I had to complain, there's too many memes awkwardly crammed onto billboards in the game's backgrounds. And buyers beware: the discount for owning the original Gold edition of Gaucamelee no longer applies.","March 2","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full of humour and action, with well thought mechanics and level design,  but also a good level of challenge. This is really one game you will enjoy a lot playing replaying if you like metroidvanias.\n\nStory: you play Juan, a luchador that has save his love one from the evil claws of Calaca, and stop his plan to bring the wolrd of the livings and th dead together! you will face many challenges, meet friends and combat foes to reach your goal and become the greatest luchador of Publuecho!\nWell, as you can see nothing blowing the doors off scenario wise,you won't play the game specifically for its super elaborated story, but it does the trick to accompany the game.\nThe game is however full of humour and references, and characters are endearing, which do make the game/story very nice to follow.\n\nArt: hand-drawn squarish and super colorful graphics that fits very well the theme of the game. It might not be to everyone's taste but as far as I am concerned find them pretty gorgeous.\nAnimation are very fluid and no slowing down comes to hinder the experience. Overall this is a very nice looking game.\nBut this is also a very nice sounding game: the soundtrack is very cheerful and accompany perfectly the game. Very good soundtrack I recommend to anyone.\n\nGameplay: now for the most important part, Guacamelee gets a very good grade here. A mix of combat a and platforming wroking well together. Controls are tights and very responsive, there is a good variety of movements to allow you to create very nice combos on the enemy. Those movements are also well thouth-out as they will also be used to solve platform puzzles/challenges throughout the game. Puzzles and challenges that are well designed, not too difficult but not too simple either, just the right amount of complexity and originality that makes it overal a good level design.\nThe game will occupy you a good amount of time if you wish to finish it at 100%  aroudn 12 to 15 hours the first time, and extra challenges are available for those who wish a bit more challenges. it also provides rankings for speedruns for those who like that!\n\nOverall this is a very good, fun and cheerful game that I would recommend to anyone. I ended up liking it surprisingly more than I thought I would. This is definitely a game that is high up in the list of good metroidvanias.\n","October 23, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But Guacamelee is so much more than that.\n\nNowadays platforming games are scarce, a sad thing to say but true nonetheless. Guacamelee comes in that front as a refreshingly exciting new adventure where jumping is as important as fighting.\n\nAt the beginning you won't be able to do much, simple button combinations are all you've got to beat the early enemies, but you learn more moves the further you advance in the game. Those moves are both fighting and platforming oriented and you need to use them constatly if you want to progress.\n\nTo make things easier, you can buy diffferent perks in the store in exchange for money you get from defeating enemies, crate smashing or treasure hunting. You can also buy different skins for your character, both male and female, that will\ngive you useful bonuses in exchange for silver coins that you get in some particular chests and once you beat an arena.\n\nThe dfficulty curve in this game is outstandingly well done.  Forcing you to give your best in combat and platforming as well. Guacamelee's got one of the most frustratng platforming track you'll ever get to play (yes I'm referring to the saw blades) but it also's got some of the most entertaining challenge fights you'll enjoy (in hell).\n\nAlthough the theme of the game might not interest you, I can assure you that it doesn't become an annoyance. In fact you're gonna be so into the game that you're hardly gonna notice it. And after a while you may even start to like it as much as I did.\n\nAs for the queer design of the ingame drawing I can only say that it fits perfectly with the story and after the first fights is not going to bother you either.\n\nIt is precisely in the story where Guacamelee turns weakest. The overall plot is average at best but you're going to be so entertained with everything else that, honestly, you're not going to care.\n\nLastly, I'd like to say something about reaching 100% in the game, Most of the trophies are quite easy to get, but there are some that are not. Getting the gold medal in the challenges or finding all the treasure chests is going to take time. Getting the "good" ending is demanding too, you'll have to find all 7 parts of the mask and thet will require something else. In order to succeed though, the developers added two additional powers you can get. The first one you obtain in hell and the second one gets automatically unlocked once you find 6 parts of the mask. The latter is, by far, the most overpowered ability you get in the game but frankly, by the moment you get it, is kind of useless. It would have been nice to have these two abilities available in the new game from the beginning, or at least one of them, but the developers didn't see it that way. So you don't.\n\nIn short, Guacamelee is an absolutely worthy game to play that isn't too harsh, unless you want it to be, and will surely entertain you. Don't forget to purchase it if you liked it!","September 25, 2015","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely love this game. It really was just so much fun to play. The style, the music, the puzzles, the combat, I dig it. So much.\n\nC-c-c-combo breaker (!!)\nSo Guacamelee is an action platformer. The level designs are really cool, in the smart platform design sense and in the 'aw yeah this place looks bangin' sense. The levels weren't exactly hard (I don't know if this or just the combat changes in hard mode though), but mixed with the combat, it was fast-paced, kept you on your toes, utilized all your powers, and generally makes you feel awesome while playing.\n\nBut aside from the actual platforming aspect, I think the combat is where it's at. I don't know much about pro-wrestlers, but I sure as hell felt like one. Every so often, you get a new power, and you incorporate those new powers into progressing through the levels and for creating some new killer combos. When you get all the new powers, you pretty much feel like a god. At least I felt that way. Was nice. Very nice. Punch enemy into air, follow them, 1-2-3 combo, slap them back down, follow with a body slam, pick them back up, throw them to the left, roll to the left, HEAD BASH THEM INTO OBLIVION. Yes I love the combat and one day I hope to become the master of all the Guacamelee combos and to make the Combo Chicken proud of me.\n\nWe are Sex Bob-omb (!!)\nSimply put, the music is amazing. I actually found myself shaking my body to the music while practicing my pro-wrestling ways. I don't know how to really describe it, but the music really added that extra 'unf'. Especially the boss theme. I totally would have welcome any 3rd/4th/5th boss phases if it meant I could listen to this music and kick ♥♥♥ at the same time.\n\nEye Candy (!!)\nWhen I look at the graphics, the word that comes to mind is charming. Also beautiful and simple. And crisp for some reason. I think besides that, I'm just becoming a fan of this style of art, something that I also see in works like The Book of Life (movie) and Grim Fandango.\n\nNot much else to say other than this game was just as much a pleasure to look at as it was to fulfill my unknown pro-wrestler dreams.\n\n(Chorus)(Outro)(Fade-out)\nSo yeah. Sweet game. I look forward to starting hard mode (re-re-replayability !!!) one of these days when my backlog isn't clawing at me.\n\nGuacamelee doesn't take itself too seriously which allows for some really funny moments.

This game is HILARIOUS and obviously made by people who love video games, as there are references to other classic games everywhere. The combat consists of a somehwat limited moveset, but it somehow works throughout the entire game. I played with a controller and the controls were responsive and well done. The use of Hispanic culture is well done and gives respect to the traditions that inspired the game ( soTumblr can't say there is 'cultural appropriation' or whatever)\n\nNEUTRAL: At times it can be confusing to know what to do but never anything super serious\n\nCONS: The ending is really difficult. I can't even get to the final boss because the final level is so damn hard. This probably says more abouit my ability to play the gamre more than anything else.\n\nVERDICT: I love this game. Fun, hilarious, original. Highly recommended\n\n","January 27","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/recommended/275390/","ShadowRFox","ShadowRFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/","225 products in account","A fun platformer. You play as Juan an agave farmer made luchador thanks to a legendary luchador mask. He goes on an adventure to save his childhood love, the El Presidente's Daughter, from the evil Carlos Calaca. Yea it a strange story, but hey what are video games for if you can't have a strange story from time to time. The story is really entertaining and the game is constantly making references to other games. It help set up a fun atmosphere.\n\nThe game play like your standard 2D platformer, but what set it apart levels have 2 designs, a living and dead. Playing as Juan you'll find yourself having to switch between the land of the living and dead to get through areas and find their secrets. You'll also have to use you're wrestling abilities as you learn them to help you progress through the game.\n\nThe combat involve punching your enemies enough to get them vunerable enough to throw them into other enemies or into environmental hazard. As you learn new abilities, enemies will start to spawn with barriers that can only be broken by using that ability. As you go through the game, you will encounter newer enemies that will put your new powers to the test.\n\nHonestly this is a fun game that knows how silly it is and it take pleasure in it. If you like luchadores, goats, chickens, skeletons, challenging platforming, and a fun "save the princess" story then this is the game for you.","June 28, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a unique Mexican theme, with you playing as a Luchador Mexican wrestler dude, on a mission to rescue 'El Presidentes' daughter from skeletons, a guy with his head permenantly on fire and several other bad guys. The game doesn't take itself seriously and has a pretty funny story and set of characters.\n\nThe combat and exploration of this game is where it really shines though. If you know 2D Metroid or Castlevania, and even Dark Souls to an extent (with the shortcuts and linking world), its just like that in its exploration and level design. The combat is awesome, you can chain different style of attacks and throws together and its a lot of fun making huge combos, which happens often as the game regularly throws tonnes of enemies at you. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed the combat.\n\nThe game also has a really good looking and clean unique art style, that thankfully steps away from the common "pixelate everything" art style most indie games use. Animation is also pretty nice and feels responsive as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOverall I definitely recommend!","June 2, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
