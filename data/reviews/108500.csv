But there is much more than just puzzles to this games and in this review I'll try to explain myself.\nIt all starts in a lab with a very nice introduction to the story about the engineer that has invented a way to control the behavior of the liquid and then realized the potential of his invention. To make it easier for me I will tell that with that invention you can turn liquid into a living creature that can follow basic commands. But as with any inventions there are potential issues. And those issues started in the very lab they were invented.\n\nAnd that were the learning curve starts, gradually. It's not very steep to turn me off right away and not to gradual to make me feel the game thinks I'm an idiot. The game definitely knows what it wants to be and tell that to you in the right way.\nAfter playing for about 1 minute I was completely into it and I knew I was not going to bed before I complete it.\n\nI think it is quite easy to ruin the game with a review spoiler so I will try to stay away from solving puzzles and just talk about what I loved about the game in no particular order.\nSo the first think I loved in this game are the Fluros, those creatures made of liquid using the invention I mentioned earlier. I felt that the protagonist has emotional bond with them and I started to feel that. You will probably too when you get into the game. There will be a variety of them and they will have unique abilities so you will have a lot to tinker about as the game progresses.\n\nThen there's graphics. From what you can see on the screenshots it's nothing fancy but there's charm to it. And for me that means more than anything. Believe me I recently played games that are 20 years old. So back to Vessel and it's graphics. It's an amazing blend of 2D and 3D that give the characters that unique look.\n\nThen there's music which I only started paying attention to after I learned the basics. The soundtrack is very immersive and it perfectly fits any given location or situation. I was sitting there on the couch with my headset on and enjoying the flow of sounds to my ears.\nThe controls. The first thing I noticed were the clues on how to use switches and other things it was great and I didn't really need any manual or even look at the control scheme in the settings. I was playing with a gamepad and I didn't turn of the rumble because I didn't even open control settings. And that was a good thing. Because unlike games where the gamepad ruble is more like a jackhammer that makes your entire body to shake. In this game it's gentle and just makes you feel the feedback from the environment in just the right way.\n\nGameplay is liquid. Yes, almost all you do involves liquid one way or another. It plays and feels so unique and I really don't remember any other game that was anything like it. Not that I played too many games but I played enough to say that for myself.\n\nAnd now, upgrades. It doesn't make the game any less difficult but it makes solving puzzles more convenient. And wanting to upgrade your equipment makes you solve optional puzzles and I love optional puzzles and missions.\n\nLast but definitely not least I'd like to tease you with a paragraph about the bosses. This being a puzzle game it will make you think how to approach every single one of them and the same tactics will not work. In my opinion everyone who plays puzzle games should complete the game just to appreciate the final boss and final puzzle. I can only assume how much thought went into making those and how satisfying it was to complete the game.\n\nRemember I wrote earlier that I planned to complete it that night? Not a chance. It took me 20 hours and it was worth every second I spent. And every penny to. Not that I spent to much during the sale but I would have bought it right away if I know what I know now.\n\nSo pick it up sometime and enjoy!\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","June 15, 2015","true","25.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

The Fluro are cute, exciting yet something to be respected. The puzzles are clever and sometimes amazing. It's sad that most upgrades are superfluous, especially since they feel like they could be used in exciting ways if the world just let it.\nAnd the environments. Gorgeous.

I don’t enjoy these types of games and I tend to find them overly frustrating or convoluted for the most part. Vessel certainly is not a cake walk by any means, and there were a few moments when I felt like progress was impossible, but it was nice because the reason I was having trouble was simply because I lacked a tool that I had not unlocked yet. The puzzles made me think but did not feel ridiculous or malicious, being able to progress through the game at a moderate pace really made the whole title so much more enjoyable.\n\nI didn’t complete the entire game, but it was not for a lack of enjoyment or a spike in frustration. Vessel is a wonderful game and deserves to stand out amongst the other physics puzzle platformers.","November 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Arkwright, an inventor who created an automaton called a Fluro. They were created to help out with laborious tasks which they can perform better than humans. Only problem is they start evolving and running amok so you need to go through the world of Vessel to fix what they have broken.\n\nTo help you out in the game you get a liquid gun with a tank attached to it. You can either spray liquid or suck it into it. It’s also upgradeable with different nozzle tips and larger tanks. With this and the Fluros you will be able to complete the puzzles throughout the world.\n\nYou’ll play through three different areas where you will need to repair machinery that the Fluros have broken. The levels consist of a factory, orchard, and mines. Through these levels you will discover new types of Fluro that you can use. You also need to capture each type which will then give you a seed. The seeds can be thrown on the grown and spray with liquid to form whichever Fluro it is. These vary from ones that like to press switches, chase you, collect liquid till they pop, hide from light, or go to the light.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are challenging and fun to do. I had a few that really made me think but the fun was in discovering how to get the different Fluros to work for you. The story also wasn’t too bad and did add a little to the game but it was really all about the puzzles. Overall Vessel is a fun challenging puzzle game to play and should not be missed.\n\nBear Pros:\nGreat liquid physics\nFun challenging puzzles\nFluro characteristics\n\nBear Cons:\nSomewhat lackluster ending\nOnly three areas to explore\nNeeds more of these great puzzles (not really a con)","April 20, 2014","true","13.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The puzzles are pleasantly difficult, and it features an attractive steampunk aesthetic.\n\nThe gameplay in Vessel is mostly about using giant steampunk factory machines and manipulating creatures made out of water (and later, other materials) into doing your bidding. Some creatures are dangerous, but death isn’t a major obstacle in Vessel; it just resets the current challenge.\n\nWhat makes Vessel so fun to play, though, is the wonderful sloshy water mechanics. It's really fun to splash through this game. The level design is creative, and the puzzles are thoughtfully made.\n\nIf you like puzzlers, Vessel is definitely worth a look. It's creative, polished, entertaining, and difficult.

Looked like a decent puzzler. Was looking for a game which could run on my laptop. This seemed perfect.\n\nGameplay\n-----------\nI played with Xbox 360 controller and it was very responsive. Full controller support i believe. Graphics are nice and colourful. Slightly cartoony and cute but HD. The music was not annoying although i think it looped throughout the game. The fluid mechanics are nice. The difficulty curve is good, starting off with simple puzzles and moving onto more complex ones. Some of them were quite difficult at first, but after a bit of trial and error and sometimes looking at everything from a distance the solution comes forth! Very rewarding feeling on completing the game.\n\nI will look at other games this developer has made as I like his style and enjoyed this game a lot. First game on steam to unlock all achievements too after investing 30 hours on it.\n\nConlcusion\n------------\nA very good game overall, i would give it 9/10.\n\nBugged Achievement (Internal Rejection)?\n---------------------------------------------\nSome people say one acievement is bugged, the one where you have to create a dark fluro out of green glo goo (Internal Rejection). The achievement is not bugged, you have to put some green and some blue on the floor, then put the dark fluro eye in to start creating the dark fluro, but the trick is to start sucking up a little bit of it as it is being created, if not, it will not sustain itself and explode / die. 50% of each green and blue and then eye and then suck up a bit of the blue so it is more green than blue...... worked it out after 5 mins of trying....","January 1, 2014","true","30.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The first one is that there's some sort of upgrade system that actually has no use. Nothing really gets easier by unlocking the upgrade, you can't get faster or die harder with the upgrades.\n\nThe other problem is I find the number of puzzles quite lacking. There are maybe... 25 main puzzles here (could be 35-40 if you count the tutorial puzzles). I was seriously surprised when the game ends, I thought it's just mid way, especially since I haven't used the upgrades at all.\n\nAll in all, I'd put down "neutral" score if I can, there are plenty of other games on Steam.","June 6, 2015","true","8.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

The fluro storyline makes this a daftly weird game. However, after struggling through the initial learning curve, Vessel turned into a decent puzzle platformer. The different fluid combinations and eyeballs types make for some interesting gameplay. Basically you use fluros to stand on buttons, engage switches, explode, or create steam by shooting water at lava fluros enabling some machinery to open a door. Then, later on in the game, there are much more interesting fluros offering new elements that keep the puzzles fresh. Overall, a good challenge and a fun experience.","March 20, 2014","true","17.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The puzzles are creative and always seem reasonably challenging. I always felt a sense of accomplishment as I played through the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has two very frustrating sections that can definitely ruin the experience, so I'll just warn you about them. The second and third numbered puzzles in the mines seem to require that you make the nozzle that lets you create fluro blobs, but there's no indication from the game that you will ever need a certain upgrade in order to progress. You need that nozzle because it lets you shoot fluros through the grates, but there's no hint from the game that you can do that. It's very frustrating if you get stuck and keep trying to shoot green goo through grates, which you're clearly not supposed to really be able to do. Also, on the section with ladders, it turns out that you can use one of the nozzles (the one that propels you a little bit) to make the jumps easier, but the game doesn't really hint very well that you can use that nozzle to do that.\n\nSecondly, for the final part of the game (the accelerator) you should probably just use a walkthrough to figure out what you're supposed to do. The requirements to complete it are very unclear and don't make a lot of sense.\n\nOther than that, the game was one of the most enjoyable puzzle platformers I've played. I'd say I liked it more than games like Braid, Waking Mars, and Fez.\n\n","October 5, 2014","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What makes it unique is that you can actually turn the liquid into living creatures called fluros which have simple behaviors you need to utilize to solve puzzles.  You also have a liquid tank and sprayer which you can use to suck up and spray liquids.  You play as the scientist who created fluros, which have now gotten out of control and are evolving new abilities and are interfering with machinery near your lab.  You solve puzzles in order to repair the machines so you can get your lab up and running again, and to study the new fluro types.\n\nThroughout the game you discover more liquid types and fluro types, as well as more interactions between different types of liquids.  The puzzles are varied and interesting with only a few being difficult enough to stump me for a while.  The game is paced very well without any large difficulty spikes or sudden flood of new mechanics.  Most of it works well, though as physics games often are, the simulation can be rather glitchy.  Especially when fluros are created with near the minimum amount of liquid necessary, they have a tendency to die randomly.  I did have to restart a puzzle or two due to not being able to fix various glitches, but overall it went pretty smoothly.\n\nGraphically the game is nothing special.  I wouldn't call the art style particularly pleasing but it gets the job done.  I would expect the game to run well on most PCs.\n\nVessel surprised me being much more enjoyable than I was expecting.  When the game was released I didn't think it looked very interesting but it turned out much better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974281429/recommended/108500/","76561197974281429","W. Crispy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974281429/","246 products in account","First and foremost this game is about half puzzler / half platformer, so be prepared.  Some of the platforming can be just as challenging as the puzzles, especially on the mouse and keyboard.  It does have an indie feel to it, and some of the progression suffers a tad, as in some places you can find yourself wandering around unsure of where to go next, most notably a section in the Factory, due to the counter-intuitive little map shown above the goal machines.  I won't spoil it, but basically the map is backwards.  The Journal in the game that vaguely tells you where to go next does its job, and that's it.  It doesn't hold your hand.\n\nThe graphics are really pretty, with an almost watercolor feel in places, and the backgrounds steal the show from the nearer sections to the screen and main characters.  I'm only past the first section, but I've already felt the overwhelming urge to break free of the puzzle's "prisons" and go outside and run around the lush looking town and landscape.  Another game set in this universe as some kind of RPG or Action RPG would be amazing.\n\nCoupled with the graphics is a really good soundtrack.  The sound effects are almost TOO good and eerily realistic for the cartoony looking style.  The music is really well done and fits the game nicely, ranging from artsy downtempo thematic music to more industrial techno type stuff, always matching the setting and action, or lack thereof.\n\nIf I had to gripe it would be about the controls, especially on the mouse and keyboard.  There are certain elements that require the player to grab a device and rotate it.  If you've ever played Little Big Planet you won't be surprised.  What DID surprise me was how long it took me to figure out that when using WASD, you really do have to use all of WASD when spinning certain circular contraptions around to get the speed up.\n\nWhat I mean is that if you're using a thumbstick, you naturally progress Up, to Right, to Down, to Left, and Up again as you spin the stick, but when using the keyboard I had to learn the hard way.  I don't recall any other game requiring me to go from W, to D, to S, to A, back to W in a motion like that, and it's really challenging.  I do like the mouse's use in aiming the player, but I may have to change to a gamepad before too long if the puzzles increase in difficulty.  The game says on the home screen that a gamepad is recommended.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot longer than I expected, and the style isn't really even "Steampunk," but more of a neat hybrid that still incorporates liquids, hydraulics, and temperature.  Some of the sections are engineered solely around the puzzles, and if you step back and take a look at these sections you find yourself asking why someone would build these mazes and dangerous pitfalls in the first place.  This can sometimes ruin the suspension of disbelief, but once you accept it for what it is it's really a rad little game.  I've noticed a bug or two with certain machines' physics getting out of whack, but there's an option in the game to reset a puzzle if you've screwed up or boxed yourself in.  Other than that, it's polished up well and a lot of fun.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nAfter dicking around trying to get achievements I changed it to a thumbs down.  The devs gave up caring and haven't fixed some bugs that make the game literally unplayable.  On some puzzles the physics engine breaks down and you have to reset it just to get a random thing to happen.  Multiple achievements are so finnicky to the point of frustration, not in figuring them out, but in MAKING THEM HAPPEN.  If you're just going to throw out arbitrary random achievements without testing them or making sure they work correctly then you can suck it.  A perfect game would allow a player to do a solid run with NO DEATHS, in the way Limbo does, but not here.  Half the puzzles and achievements towards the end require you to look them up online just to make sure you're trying to do them correctly, and then you find out that you are, and it's just the game that's broken.  No fix is coming, so what started out as a joyful experience turned into hair pulling anger.  I hate crappy devs that pull this garbage.","February 22, 2014","false","27.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Okay. So, you know how most puzzle games are supposed to work consistently so that solving puzzles when you know the solution isn't a matter of luck? Not Vessel! Be ready for your fluros to randomly die in the middle of a puzzle! Be prepared for the AI to go off the rails and do something completely different than you were expecting!

Yeah...\n\nI mean, I wanted to give this one the benefit of the doubt. It does try to avoid physics-based puzzles for the most part, and there are moments of clever ideas. But far more often, puzzles are just a matter of screwing around until you figure out what to do, at which point you actually have to get the game to cooperate long enough for you to do it.\n\nHonestly, I think the best part of the game may be the cave section before you get to the lab for the first time. There's a decent mix of platforming and puzzling there, and the puzzles can get pretty clever at times. I will go on record saying that I did play this first bit before purchasing the game and it led me to believe the game would be pretty decent (granted, I bought this years ago and never got around to playing it until just now, so...) but it goes downhill soon after. The puzzles in the factory all revolve around lava, the most dangerous of all the liquids in the game, and there's just a lot of dying in this zone... one of the protoplasm blobs literally requires you to just charge through some of the lava and hope you don't die. Every guide for this game has the same stupid solution.\n\nThe orchard area is... alright. There's a lot less dying, the puzzles revolving around the blue and red goo and the drinker seed are pretty clever, nothing's too obscure to the point of being frustrating. But then the mine area... jeez, what the hell. This is where the game shows its worst side. There are fluros who are attracted to light. But they're really finnicky and basically impossible to control, it's hard to get them to go where you want them to. On top of that, the first half of the area you're mostly spending time in the dark, with the glowing liquid lighting up the area around you, but you still have to do a lot of maneuvering in the dark regardless. Then you get the dark fluro, which is even more finnicky and has a habit of jumping off in random directions to escape the light, instead of going where you want him to. One of the protoplasm blobs and the last puzzle in the mines involves guiding these guys and they are just pests. Ugh.\n\nI won't say this game is devoid of good design because it's about half balanced between the good and the bad, but there's more than enough of the bad to just make it a rather unfun experience... even in the good parts of the game there's still a lot of waiting around, the puzzles in general are rather tedious. I never felt inclined to keep playing the game much, and on top of that I switched computers in the middle of playing this game, which apparently doesn't cloud save, so I got to redo a good chunk of the game, which was great fun let me tell you... no...\n\nThe graphics are okay, a little dated. The soundtrack and sound design is nice, but it's licenesed music so I can't give anyone on the development team much credit. The story is pretty thin until the ending, which is just... terrible...\n\nAnd there's really not much platforming here, either. A few puzzles have a little bit of platforming but it is definitely way more on the puzzle end of things. The game map is just a long string of puzzle rooms, too, there's almost no point to having these big open areas where nothing happens.\n\nI'm kind of rambly in this review, I guess, but I don't feel interested enough in this game to really sift through my thoughts. It's not very fun, it's kind of boring, occasionally frustrating, and only mildly entertaining at even the best of times. Definitely skip, you can do a lot better in both the puzzle and puzzle-platformer genres.","February 10","false","11.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Some puzzles are very easy and some are difficult until you find out that some mechanics were not properly shown so you did not have a clue that you could do that. After that it becomes easy or only a bit tricky.\n\nThere are secrets(blobs) with a liquid that you need for upgrading your stuff. I forgot, what was it for and finished the game without upgrades...\n\nThere is no voice-acting in this game just sounds and awesome background music by Jon Hopkins. Story is told to you in journal and that is kind of disappointing.\n\nGame is not very good looking as well. Loading screen is only 4:3 for some reason. Options are simple, but they cover pretty much all you'll need in 2D (2.5D) game. You can find there resolution, vsync, sound volume, fullscreen, music volume, gamma and language settings.\n\nIn some puzzles you can get stuck or it can bug out. Some puzzles also seem to cause crashes. You do something there, then it stutters and crashes.\n\nTo sum this up: Game has some little problems, but it's great in everything else!

They're very left-hand-heavy, being essentially those typically used by FPS games. While it does allow you to use the arrow keys for movement it seems like an afterthought, given all the other keys are clustered on the assumption of FPS-style use. While it works fine in a FPS, it doesn't work very well for a platformer, making the platforming a lot harder than it should be. The game itself does not provide a means of remapping the controls either, though it can be done by editing an INI file.\n\nThe ending seems a bit lack-lustre to me, though that point is entirely subjective, so there might be some players who find it perfectly adequate.\n\nThe visuals are just lovely. It's a pleasure to look at, and it really looks like an evolution of the 2D platformer. For that, and the fluid-based mechanics, the developers should be commended, and you should give them your money if you like this sort of game.","August 6, 2014","true","25.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, the core gameplay mechanic of using liquid physics to solve the game's puzzles doesn't feel like it was well implemented.\n\nThe player must manipulate creatures spawned from various liquids in order to solve puzzles and advance in the game. However, the liquid physics engine seems rather imprecise and flaky, as liquids and creatures will occasionally behave in odd ways. This, in turn, makes some puzzles frustrating, as it is difficult sometimes to tell if you tried to solve a puzzle incorrectly, or if you had the right idea only to have it messed up by some weird anomaly caused by the physics engine. This is especially true (and highly irritating) in the game's latter stages.","April 22, 2014","false","13.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

My computer isn't the best but it has run more complicated games than this just fine. It just has a lot happening with the liquid dynamics, and background and foreground all moving around. It made the game unplayable at points. I had to keep it at a really low res to play.\n\nTo summarize: Just another platform puzzler. Somewhat more unique than most. Not a very interesting story or character, though. A lot of 'upgrades' that don't really do much and feel like fluff. Lots of slowdown on ok computers. somewhat frusting at times because you don't directly control the solutions.

There are many good things about vessel so I think if you like puzzle platformer you will love this game.\nBut to be honest I'd say the game was just good, nothing "great" as many reviews were saying.\n\nFor example more often than not your first thing to solve is... figuring out WHAT you have to do. I mean you will not look for the solution but you will just try to understand what you should accomplish.\nThat's not the best feeling in the world.\n\nThat slows you down a lot, and gameplay (with fluid and not so perfect controls) will be sometime annoying.\nThe very last puzzle was for me too annoying for example and eventually I checked on the web for some help because I was bored to just try random stuff while trying to figure out what I should aim for.\n\nAnyway the game is nice and could be interesting for many players.\n\n\n+ Nice puzzles\n+ Nice atmosphere\n+ Cool 2d graphic\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ Early and mid game was fun\n+ And also addictive\n\n- Less fun in endgame (I hated the very last puzzle)\n- Often you have to figure it out what's your goal more than just understanding how to do it\n- Almost useless upgrades\n- Imperfect commands\n- It felt a little too slow","February 3, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a physics based puzzle game where you use liquid and liquid based "robots" to fix and use steampunk machinery. There are different types of liquids and several "behavioral chips" you can use to make different combinations of robots. For example in some puzzles you need to make one water and one lava bot collide so they make steam for a steam engine.\n\nSome puzzles can be skipped and you can go back to them later. Also some puzzles can be solved in different ways if you get creative. Combine that with relaxing music and you get a puzzle game where you probably won't get frustrated.\n\nI highly recommend it for people who like physics based puzzle games like Limbo, mechanical contraptions and similar.","February 17, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a cohesive world to explore, but the upgrades are mostly pointless as the shape of your spray matters much less than your aim and your plan.  Instead, prepare to have your mind warped as new fluids and AI modifiers get added to environmental puzzles.  The physics engine occasionally gets in the way, but it's all doable and there are multiple walkthroughs available online for those who get stuck.  There's also the option to warp back to earlier puzzles without walking all the way so players can feel free to try another puzzle when they get frustrated.  Overall, it's an impressive amalgamation of fluid physics and (for lack of a better term) herding that I haven't experienced in any other game.

Here is a platformer puzzle game with a unique mechanic and an interesting concept, but also balanced enough that it isn't too hard for the likes of me (see: Braid).  I first tried it at PAX, and was very glad to see it in the Humble Indie Bundle #6.\n\nYou have a backpack/nozzle device that fires different types of liquid, and you have these unusual 'seeds' that make living 'Fluoros' out of liquid.  The type of seed determines what the Fluoro wants to do -- push buttons, seek light, attack things, etc.  Using combinations of these seeds and liquids, you navigate levels full of buttons and levers and such.  As you progress, you acquire new devices and can even upgrade your existing ones.  It's also cleverly both linear and non-linear -- you can often skip a puzzle and come back to it later, and you don't need to solve ALL the puzzles (but if you do there's bonus rewards that you can spend on upgrades).\n\nThis game has a fun steampunk style, smooth animations, beautiful music, and lots of polish.  Even tiny touches like the sloshing sound of your backpack when you jump.  Everything meshed together well.  I liked it enough to get ALL the achievements.  It wasn't TOO short, but I wish it could be a little longer!","December 14, 2012","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a really, really well done puzzle-platformer with some great mechanics that lead to puzzles that are inventive and challenging, yet not overly difficult. It has a lightly Metroid-esque skill and equipment progression as well as non-linear levels. Yet it does a great job of minimizing some of the typical annoyances of that type of game, with a sensible check-pointing system as well as a map system that lets you instantly warp between already visited sections of levels\n\nIt's easily up there with Braid (thankfully without the stink of pretension about it) and Aquaria in terms of excellent 2D indie games that require some thought. I recommend it with little to no reservations if you're even slightly intrigued by what's shown in the trailer.\n\nPS.

And you're working on.. some thing. I'm sure this is explained at some point but I'm sick of reading character journals so screw the story. The focus is on these liquid AI machines. They can be made of water, lava, glowing nuclear ooze but what matters is they function as cheap hard labor workers; flipping levers and all that. Must fight urge.. to make a..  'wet back' joke. Anyways armed only with this liquid work force, a watergun and your wits you must bring a factory back online through a series of fluid-based puzzles. Did I mention this has a strong emphasis on liquids? It's certainly reminiscent of Bioshock; steampunk art style, water every where but this is more about the puzzles some of which can be very challenging near the end. It also seems they couldn't afford to do much testing near the end cause that's when it starts crashing a lot. Even so I still love it and no matter what I say try the demo even if you're not going to buy it.","July 15, 2012","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a great curve that shows you just how these creatures behave and how you'll need to manipulate them to flip switches, open doors, push levers, etc.  For example, they are attracted to buttons and must press them, but they are also attracted to light; in some cases, you'll need to use light to manipulate the path in which they take to press a button.\n\nPretty fun game.

As you progress through the game you'll acquire seeds that allow you to generate fluoros on demand.  Fluoros are semi-sentient liquid automatons that can perform a specific task.  There are button pushers, seekers, drinkers, light fearing, and light loving variations.  Liquids come in water, red juice, blue juice, lava, and fluorescent green flavors.  You can enhance your equipment by collecting protoplasm, but it isn't essential to solving the puzzles.\n\nGiven that this is a puzzle game, you'll definitely want to avoid looking up any walk throughs.  It is incredibly satisfying to find the solution on your own.  Unfortunately, some puzzles are touchy, especially the final puzzle.  You may complete a puzzle without realizing what you did, or have no idea what options are available to you to solve a puzzle.  This can be pretty frustrating.  There are some achievements that might provide an incentive to play through again, but honestly there isn't much enjoyment in repeating these puzzles once you've figured them out.  There are 'boss fights' so to speak, and that may chafe puzzle purists.  I feel they provide an added bit of excitement without being too much of a break from the rest of the game.\n\nThe art is very well done and the music does a nice job of providing a backdrop without becoming irritating.  This is important since you may spend quite some time in certain sections trying to find a solution to a particular problem.\n\nI easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an at-your-own-pace platforming puzzler.","May 11, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No wonder this got good reviews. I'm glad I played this first when I built my machine. The effects are wonderful. The puzzles are challenging enough that you could solve them with some thought and the Bosses are one of a kind. These cretures, they fluros, are a force to be reccond with. I give this game a 9/10, but only because it felt a bit short and the ending was a bit different to what I was expecting.

It is quite a compelling puzzle game, though admittedly I'm not that far into it.  As far as I've seen, though, it's an incredibly clever puzzle game as you try to manipulate idiot automatons into doing your bidding so that you can get out of each progressive room.  The game has a great curve that shows you just how these creatures behave and how you'll need to manipulate them to flip switches, open doors, push levers, etc.  For example, they are attracted to buttons and must press them, but they are also attracted to light; in some cases, you'll need to use light to manipulate the path in which they take to press a button.\n\nPretty fun game.

You have little helpers called Fluros who are both causing mayhem in your factory and who help you fix the problems they cause. You get to work with fluids like water, lava, blue/red goo, and glowing goo, making interesting combinations between them like steam, explosions and manipulating creatures afraid of or attracted to light.\n\nPros:\n+Good music (though a bit repetitive)\n+Great mechanics\n+Challenging puzzles but not TOO frustrating\n+Interesting art\n+Good length. Not too short, not too long.\n+Nonlinear within groups of 5-10 puzzles, so if you get frustrated with one, you can skip it and come back to it. Also, there's no requirement to do EVERY puzzle before finishing an area (you can skip one per area and still proceed) but you get bonus stuff for upgrades if you are tenacious and do them all.\n+Upgrades. You can upgrade your nozzles and tanks to make your life easier, though most (if not all) of the puzzles are solvable without any upgrades. They just reduce the number of steps you need most times, or the time it takes.\n\nCons:\n-A few puzzles are agonzing, either because you keep dying (lava creatures who chase you down, mostly) or have to restart because something went wrong with your setup. The final puzzle was torture, mostly because I knew what to do for AN HOUR but I had to keep restarting and setting the whole thing up once more because something went wrong with the execution.\n-The way the levels are set up is nonlinear, which I listed as a pro but is also a con. There are some arrows pointing you which way to go, but if you follow them, they just lead you to the end of the level (they're really just there to guide you after finishing a puzzle). You need to follow every path to find all the hidden goodies and bonus puzzles. You also end back up in your lab (the hub) after each area, which has the final puzzle in it, so I spent a good deal of time trying to get the final puzzle to work when I didn't have all the pieces, with nothing to indicate where I was supposed to go next. A bit frustrating. The levels are all connected to each other, with the first one you finish connecting to the lab on the left, so you basically have to travel counter-intuitively and PAST what you've already finished to get to the subsequent areas. Signs would  have been nice.\n\nOverall:\nThe cons are really just me whining (except for that last puzzle. It was a pain in the ♥♥♥.) Overall, definitely 9/10. I can see myself replaying this when I need a good puzzler. If you like Portal or Swapper, this is for you.","May 20, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Phenomenal art direction, particularly the music.  A shining example of indie game developing with notable emphasis on physics, art direction and conceptual ingenuity that shames many larger studios content to sit back and produce carbon copy modern military shooters.  Vessel takes a bold stylistic stance and it certainly has my recommendation.","June 1, 2012","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice idea, cute design but it can be very frustating sometimes. it's not really difficult to find the solutions of the puzzles but it may need the very right timing which can be sometimes tricky (and exhausting if you have to do it over and over again). And sometimes you succeed with a bit of luck because the creatures you don't control do as you want. Half price seems fair.","April 28","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
