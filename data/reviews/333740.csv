Now, there is a lot wrong with the idea that one man is going to investigate the disappearance of hundreds, but whatever....keep it simple. It's all good.\n\nAdd to that the basic story arc of a Buddhist apocalypse, and the comical aspects of this story reach their crescendo.\n\nSo, what about the gameplay? Well, you basically wander around with a pistol, killing the occasional zombie and reading the occasional note...when you can actually click on the note. Often, the game doesnt register your proximity to said notes, and so you cant click on them. I did find an end around by simply jumping on top of whatever surface the notes were on and reading them through my pistol's ironsights, lol.\n\nSpeaking of the pistol you cling to in this game....you pass by a plethora of other weapons, including grenades, assault rifles, etc...but your soldier doesnt seem to think they are good weapons, and so you are never able to actually pick them up or use them. They are simply part of the backdrop.\n\nThe graphics themselves are what you would expect from the vanilla Unity engine. Somewhat washed out and basic. I actually dont have a problem with that, and overall, I did think it looked fine for what it was going for.\n\nI also thought the level design was decent. It's obviously a linear experience, but frankly, given the sparse nature of the game and the relative lack of encounters, this works fine. It is designed to build tension, and does a decent job of this overall, although you do come to realize quickly that you really dont need to be too worried about what might be around the next corner since typically there wont be anything, lol.\n\nThe audio is fairly typical of these types of games. Sort of ominous sounding, with spikes in volume to try and scare you or make you more tense at the least. This would be more effective if there wasnt such a lack of enemies. Still, decent for what has become stock audio files (from what I can tell since I've heard the same music in other Unity engine games).\n\nSo...enemies. There are basically three types...your standard weak zombie, your soldier zombies that are essentially a bit more bullet resistant, and the fire spawned zombies (at least that is what I am calling them), which can easily soak up a clip or two of bullets before they die, depending on how close you are to them. They all simply rush you, so you will generally have plenty of time to drop them before they get near you.\n\nNow, your pistol is actually pretty easy to aim, and that was another positive aspect of the game. Pretty seamless, with auto reload if you drain your clip (or enter a new section of the map) or manual if you discharged a couple bullets and want to be ready for the next encounter. Bullets are fairly sparse up until a specific section, but you always have just enough to deal with the 1-3 enemies you will encounter every couple of sections/levels.\n\nInterestingly enough, there is a section which basically amounts to the boss battle, and in that lone section, it goes from a zombie here, a zombie there to an actual horde. I thought that was actually a challenging battle. You dont actually have to win. You simply have to survive for a certain amount of time. That was actually kind of cool IMO.\n\nAnyway, I will play Act 3 when it is released, and I dont regret playing this game at all, but it doesnt change the fact that, at least in my opinion, this is exactly what a 4 out of 10 game looks and plays like. It is currently priced at $5 USD. I wouldnt pay that much for it. For $2 or less though, I feel it would be worth a look. Still, based on a 4 out of 10, I give this game a thumbs down with the caveat that, for the right price, or as a bundle game, it is worth at least checking out.\n\nAlso, this is k/m only folks.","September 26, 2015","false","4.0"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","59","64","0","5"

There are many good aspects in it, including an interesting story line, and a  great horror ambiance (for the most part). However, there are still many things that should be fixed. First of all, the sound balance. In the beginning of the game, the wind is way to prominent, making it hard to hear anything else, including the horror atmosphere and the main characters voice. Furthermore, I'm not a big fan of the cut scene transitions. The first one caught me off guard. The computer takes control of your movement and floats you to the next area. This breaks the illusion of being in the game. It would be much better to be able to transition between places yourself, which would also keep me more absorbed in it. The game is still very interesting, but has some aspects that should be fixed. But since this is only in the beta, I'm sure that there are going to be many updates improving it, and I can't wait for them to come out. Still, this is a very enjoyable game, and for the price it's definitely worth buying. Below I posted my walk through of act 1, if you want to see it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgKuQ9cJ6qk&list=PLKMxTuqznyPPkgaE6aqdCot48LWE2GXsv&index=1","April 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","34","49","7","0"

Yet the suspence and horror is awesome. There are many think fast moments and pop ups that catch you off guard. When I was playing I flet parnoid looking behind me and taking corners slowly.The story is relatively simple but keeps the player hooked and makes him/her want to play, dive deeper into the game.\n\n\nThe animations are a bit choppy and the textures could use some reworking. I would like to see more weapons other than the Browning High-Power (Pistol), maybe the Lee-enfield or a Sten.  I would love to see co-op added to this game, would make even more enjoyable. Some ragdoll affects would be nice and would make killing enemies more statsfying.\n\nOverall Opinion:\n\nFor the price this game is awesome! I love the WW2 setting it fits the game very well. If you can look past the graphics and animations your will find enjoyment in this game. I am looking forward to the patchs and updates that will be coming soon.

It's ugly, it's drab, the sound effects are either terrible or poorly mixed. Badly animated zombies run at you and you shoot at them with no hit registry feedback that lets you know you even hit them, which is even worse when you have a part of the game when you have a bunch of them coming at you once in a tiring gauntlet. There's a reason walking simulators by indie devs rarely feature shooting or any kind of gameplay: Cause they'd suck at it.\n\nTake the one puzzle in the entire game: Find a key(which was hard to see, let alone find) then turn on a generator. That's it.\n\nStory? Soldiers find some artifact and then bam - zombies. Then two horrible British voice actors (that also sound like punk kids rather than soldiers) talk to eachother. It's also just not scary... unless really annoying sound effects is scary to you.\n\nThe ending promises that it will be continued, but I have some serious doubts about that. If you want to play it and refund it, I wouldn't even bother.

Most of the 90s/early 2000 games gave you a small free roam place to run around, this game, takes away that by placing invisible walls and telling you that you have to go this way! Going up stairs is a nightmare. If you wanna climb stairs better jump all the way up the stairs. Dont let me get started about ammo. each time you pick up ammo and you reach a new area, you lose all of your ammo. I passed 4 weapons from melee to rifles /machine guns and couldnt even pick them up.  I found myself questioning how did the devs even try to come up with the story when some of the tank objects/deaths just dont make since. Ex: 2 tanks in the middle of a bunker.

In fact I actually enjoyed a lot of aspects about it. It's not Unity engine fodder by any means, and utilizes the engine quite well. There is a decent story set in WW2 thats focused on the Japenese side, which is new and refreshing, and it has high potential for it being early access. However, there are quite a few issues that come with it. While the ambience is pretty good, most monsters roar loudly wherever theyre placed in the map, and even louder when they die. Killing them in mass results in an ear ache. The campaign seems to have unlimited ammo for the only weapon you have, which is a pistol. To counteract that though, you die in one hit, and the monsters are faster than you are. In the horror aspect, there was a handful of moments i felt tension. Walking through a jungle filled area not being able to see what was ahead was a bit nerveracking, especially since you die in one hit. And towards the end there was a holdout where the amount that rushed at you was a little intense. The cutscenes seemed to not work for me, it just  stayed in one frame where there was only audio so i had no idea what the hell was going on. I understand there will be more acts but the campaign was only 20 minutes or so. But a fun 20 minutes. Decent voice acting, and the gameplay runs quite smoothly.  As for the survival mode, a lot can be tweaked. While fun, theres only 3 maps. 2 where you can barely move from one position and one where its a very small area, but definitely the most enjoyable to me.  The survival aspect has limited ammo, keep moving to ammo pickups to survive. the rush of the enemies does add tension, but like i said, the ear ache is real. and the amount of corpses to see is obnoxious. While fun to stand amongst the corpses and bathe in the blood of your enemies, the lag is present. not gamebreaking, but annoying. However it is addicting for me to go back and try to beat my high score. all in all i have high hopes for this game, being in early access, theres room for more improvement, possibly more weapons, story development, more survival maps, and an indie title id like to hold in high regard.","April 7, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

The environments are nicely organized but they lose their effect when you drop the ball on everything else you're trying to do to make the game scary, i.e. the story and the gameplay.

The game could do with Subtitles at points (the accents sound like cuneiform in midair at times), the audio is well done. Perhaps slightly more dialogue, or maybe an NPC would allow the story to flow more easily, but it is easily picked up through atmospheric qeues.

You have a vague idea what you are dealing with (possibly more if you know what the British did in Burma in 1945), but you get snippets of the story via letters and notes. It needs to be expanded with videos and more dialogue, but as it is, it's a good start. At least not "US airborne in Normandy", so I like this aspect.\n\nGameplay:\nHorror FPS, where you currently only have a Colt. Ammo is really scarce till you get to an area with waves of enemies coming towards you, as you'll get lots of bullets for some reason. Devs said they'll change this to a fixed MMG, but you need to aim precisely, as most enemies need 4-6 hits to die, regardless of where you hit them. Weapons will be expanded, and it'll be good to fight with a Lee-Enfield, Sten, and some Jap weapons instead of a Garand or an Mp40. The Colt's animations look good.\nThe game legitimately scared me on some occasions. The Japanese bunkers are claustrophobic, and the caves are creepy. You have a flashlight, but it's not too useful (needs some tweaking to have more power). Of course at some points it's complete darkness, but those are not too common.\nOverall, not bad for a start. Needs lots of tweakings, and more free exploring, but it's gonna be fine. And undeads appearing in the dense vegetation...scary.\n\nSounds:\nNot much, but it's fine. General sounds should be a bit lower, and dialogues should be a bit louder.\n\nGraphics:\nWell...looks old, but it's an early state of the game. I'll wait to judge the final product, because I kinda like it as it is, but I'm used to older games.\n\nOverall: recommended.

Upon his arrival he is faced with horrors beyond that of the World War, will you be able to overcome them?\n\nThe game uses the unity engine,  it does has a story and the best part , There are no paid DLCs!\nYou guys should be thinking about what happens when the WW2 is finally over... well, it basically stops? not in this game!\nThere are a lot of Updates coming with new Acts, new bug fixes, innovations, and YOU, my friend, who bought the game, won't need to pay anything for that!, yes, you read it right, i repeat, there are no paid DLCs\nThe story take place in japan, so basically, what can we expect? nuclear bombs? Zombies? Yes, expect everything, because this game has potential\nAbout the price, i think it's worth, since the game is in early access and still updating, i'd say, it's worth!\nTo conclude this, i'm gonna say what i think about the game, in my opinion:\nThe game has everything to be good, just need that magic touch from developers and more ideas, zombies in a WW2 Game? hell yeah, i'd love to see someone being devoured over and over again.... :P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

This game looks beautyfull for a unity engine game and the gun you have pushes you into a false sence of security only to realise that a zombie can still completly destroy you if your a bit jumpy. The voice acting is pretty good for a five dollar game. But WARNING: Before playing lower your volume on your Computer to low, because the audio in this game will make you deaf because its so loud.\n\nI rate this game a 8/10 because of some small bugs and the audio being loud as hell.","April 18, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

You play in first person as you're trying to figure out the usual for a horror game. The who, what, and why. I know its some Nazi stuff, with weird alien or magic going on. I'm not to sure.\n\nWhat I did find out, however, was that this game does a great job of making you feel on edge. The interiors are tight and foggy, with many corridors and creepy sounds. The outside is dense forest and weird ruins. The creatures you face are still unknown to me, they seem to be skinless people? Monsters? Naked monster Nazis? No quite sure but the sound they make (which is the same sound everytime =(  scare the hell out of me).\n\nThey've done a great job with the ambiance and from what I can tell the game is pacing very well. I do have some Nazi bones to pick though. The load times are very poor right now. The first act is split into 6 separate parts and you hit these points where the cut to the next scene is abrupt and jarring. I'd love to see the acts as one continuous level.\n\nOther then that I see this game turning out to be a scary adventure with an interesting story and setting. So keep your eyes on this one.\n\nHere's my First Look of Act 1!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vnjp06eeD64\n\n\nYou can pick up The Falling Sun in Early Access on Steam 4/7/2015 for $5!","April 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It was terrifying, the permanent atmosphere of hoping to god another one of the those things doesnt come sprinting at you from around the corner. I'm used to playing fast paced games and a few shooters but the amount of shots i missed just from sheer terror was ridiculous. The graphics albeit simple were amazing at creating the right atmosphere combined with the sounds. The story line is very interesting and is the only thing that made me carry on, otherwise i would've quit and cried myself to sleep(with the lights on of course).Terrifying game with an Intriguing and unique story line what more can you ask for except for more of it.

I would be sounding scared and you know wanting to get the hell out of there.\n-you see Arisaka rifles on the ground, or machine guns planted down on the ground but you can never pick them up and you are just reduced to being a soldier with a pistol.\n-after reaching a cutscene your ammo is reduced back default 8 bullets a lot of the time, even if you had more to begin with.\n\nPros\n-First and best thing the sounds quality in this game are top notch, I had to turn it down because it was too loud and it was still loud enough to create a good atmosphere.\n-The plot even though never really explained and only found through soldier and engineer reports in the game, deffinitly fits into the war like scenario. I found the story interesting and even if its small, the background story is a lot more interesting then other shooters I have seen.\n-As easy as it is to kill an enemy dam when they hit they do some damage, which could add to the challenge of the game, but at the same time they never really get a chance to hit you. so this is really a good and bad situation.\n-The game has errors and such and it knows it, I am happy that the game doesnt try to sugar coat what it is or what its trying to achieve.\n\nThis was a little fun game and proberly worth picking up when the developers have fixed alot of the problems with the game, and made it a little better (REMEMBERING THAT THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS)\nMy opinion on the game is 5/10 its a early access game and still has a lot of time to improve itself. I dont really like rating but considering this game has a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. Its all up to you.","May 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The horror aspect is done really well and for a world war two horror game that's pretty important. It's tense and atmospheric and has jump scares a plenty.\nAs an early access game, it has tons of potential but it is currently still a little lacking in features (particularly the survival mode). There is a second patch already announced which promises to improve things further and my recomendation is really more to keep an eye on this games development rather than to necessarily buy it now, although for the tiny asking price, you can't really go wrong.\n\nCheck out my video for a look at the first two acts (after the patch) and my thoughts on the game generally.\nhttp://youtu.be/xhGbEJAkZ9k","April 22, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Noticed it has mixed reviews. This title is my "something to play when it storms and no lights and internet play on laptop" which reflects my low H.O.R. I have seen many horrible titles on steam and I have seen worse and have seen better. Understand that this title is still Early Access game, and expect issues with the game. So I am not going to knock down this title even tho its a LOL at this point. Got this title as part of a bundle so I am not out much. I would wait for another bundle or on sale. At its current state I wouldn't pay full price, I never do anyways. Far as recommend, well it is a toss up pretty much. The game still needs some wrinkles ironed out and the glitches fixed.

The first 15 minutes were absolutely terrifying (once you figured out how to get out of the starting area that is), the atmosphere in the first section made my heart race, and that's coming from someone who doesn't scare easily. That being said, the introduction of the monster for the first time was disappointing. And from that point the game abandoned any semblance of atmosphere. The monster not being particularly scary, the game becomes lackluster from this point on. For just a few other minor points, there's a section in the middle where it's incredibly easy to get lost and another section where theres a long path in both directions and one leads to a dead end, with no indication of where you're supposed to turn. The boss fight is essentially a shoot-em-up stage AND if you fail that you restart the game at a checkpoint WITH ALL THE AMMO YOU HAD FROM THAT FIGHT! (you pick up around 200 bullets in a game that's centred around having limited ammo). On that note, only God knows how the checkpoint system works and if you run out of bullets, you are screwed, there's no way to recover, no meele, no way to get more ammo. The monster just kills you and sends you back to God knows what checkpoint. So why do I reccommend this game? It's cheap and Early Access, there's tremendous potential here and lots of gameplay already. As such, I forgive some of it's flaws","November 21, 2015","true","1.1"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","2"

Surely will have more than just a pistol later but what I want to say is I'd LOVE to have the katana. It's (was) the Japanese front. Love the whole jungle deal in there, rich and thick and it blocks the sight as it should. So far real good enemy distribution thru the levels, i.e. scattered mostly rather than flooding everywhere(except the...), which is a good way to enhance the atmosphere of isolation rather than zed parties. Enemy do have different appearances in campaign levels which is a good thing indeed, very realistc thinking indeed. Too many games with just different 'types' of zeds wearing exactly the same stuffs.\n\nNeeds polishing(of course they know). Another thing: arent't ammo crates with a white star and a circle around it supposedly US issue? Yet we see British soldiers lying around.

I didn't really have any context to understand the story, but figured the game would fill me in, but other than scattered notes and a few points of voiced dialogue, I didn't really know what I was doing. The game tries to build suspese, so initially you have a pistol with a flashlight attached, but the flashlight only shines a very narrow beam of light, so I was feeling dizzy and sick on the first level. Once I got through that, things brightened, and the levels opened up a bit, but still felt cramped. Once I got into underbrush, I literally couldn't see anything other than leaves in my face, and had no idea of direction.\n\nThe combat I experienced consisted of lurching zombie like things shambling towards me. I would blast them with my pistol, but had no crosshairs or feedback for whether I was hitting them, until they died. The weird thing was that there are dead soliders everywhere, rifles, machine guns, crates of ammo... but I still run around with my pistol and a single clip.\n\nThere just wasn't anything fun about the experience of playing this game, and I'm excited to uninstall it.","October 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game does NOT update and I no longer hear much at all from the developers; I am under the presumption that they have abandoned ship on this title.\n\nIt's an alright game still if you're looking for about 30 minutes of time to kill, but don't buy this game with many expectations.\n-----------------------\nEdit: I did recently come across some bits of information. Firstly, part of the hindered updating may have been the result of one key developer being put in the hospital late October. Secondly, according to an admin post, 'The Falling Sun' is the first legitimate product of most of these developers--so granted, issues are/was to be expected here and there. It is also worth mentioning that the team is busy with alternative jobs (bear in mind, they can't possibly live off of the income they make from The Falling Sun, alone.)\n\nFrom what I can see, The Falling Sun was their attempt at getting 'off the ground' in the world of game publishing; bad preplanning might have been a severely negative factor here. Could this game bounce back with a miracle update that justifies the long wait?

But that's only because a friend and I were laughing our asses off over the game's content.\n\nOr the lack of content, I should say.\n\nUltimately this game went down a path no member of the Steam community is unfamiliar with.  It's an early access "horror(?)" game in which you take control of a lone British soldier in the pacific and, as generically as possible, find clues to unlocking the game's story in the form of notes and journal entries. It's all really just an incomprehensible mess of randomness, as there is absolutely no continuity to the journal entries and by the end of the game (30 minutes from the beginning) you realize that you extracted absolutely nothing meaningful from the experience at all.\n\nGameplay is subpar, per typical with how these indie early access projects tend to go. It's a first person shooter, where you have a gun, and ammo, and shoot at monsters who have very awkward and buggy animations. At the end of the story, they went insane with spawning enemies and they all charge you at once, and you just have to survive. Effortless.\n\nI get that it's early access, but come on, this isn't even worthy of being called alpha.","December 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This review is based on the first release of the game and no update has been made.\n\nSTORYThe story takes place in Burma after the end of World War II. You play as a lieutenant who is sent to look for a missing armoured colon. What he is gonna find are failed experiments and mayhem. There are currently two acts to the game, and so far little to nothing is explained and the story feels almost non-existent. Most of the story is told through letters found around the environment, which are poorly written and don't matter that much to the plot.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game does look really good: even though it's made in the Unity engine, there are many video options including antialiasing and refresh rate that goes up to 120 FPS. The game also performs really well. Unfortunately, all the environments are uninspired and boring, there is only one enemy type and there is the most useless flashlight in all of gaming history (it basically only lights your character's hands).\n\nGAMEPLAYThe two acts of the campaign are incredibly short, for a total of 20 minutes of gameplay. There is currently only one firearm, with apparently unlimited ammo. There is also a Survival mode featuring three maps where you have to fend off an unlimited wave of monsters.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is really, really easy. In the campaign you only meet a handful of monsters: they are usually far away from you because they kill you instantly and they all go down with two shots. In Survival mode you will fail because of the number of corpses that make the game's performance fall really fast.\n\nSOUNDThere are endless loops of loud and annoying background noise, as well as missing sound effects when sprinting. The monsters always start screaming when they spawn, and when playing Survival mode it feels like you are becoming deaf by the second.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are no collectibles, no secrets, no achievements and no completion bonuses. The only real reason why you should replay this game is to read the letters scattered around the linear path.\n\nOverall, I can not recommend this game at its current state: it is incredibly short and easy, there is no real reason why you should replay it and even though it is really well optimised, the sound department has to be improved and fixed. I will revisit this game when it comes out of Early Access, because it has really good potential.\n\nStory: 5\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 4\nChallenge: 2\nSound: 3\nReplayability: 1\n\nENJOYMENT: 4\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 26 of 117 people (22%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","22","26","117","7","0"

You'll finish two acts in twenty minutes tops and see maybe five admittedly well modelled enemies aside from a wave-based set piece at the latter act's finale. There is nothing to interact with aside from a few scattered memos and one instance where you need to find a key to open a door that can be found about twenty feet away.\nFor me, THE FALLING SUN isn't atmospheric or cohesively narrated enough to be an effective horror game and lacks every basic mechanic necessary to be a shooter. It cycles through scenery like a holiday snaps slideshow. You die in one hit but so do the enemies.\nI'll see how it develops in the next couple of acts and patches. It is, to its credit, a fairly good looking game but aside from that, this is essentially a walking simulator with maybe twenty bullets worth of action to its name.\n\nCheck out my abridged playthrough below.\nhttps://youtu.be/ldLml_kEbv4","April 10, 2015","false","13.2"," 19 of 104 people (18%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","18","19","104","9","2"

Played it for 41 minutes untill i got stuck into what i assume is the last level since zombies just keep on coming and i don't have enough ammo to fight them off.\n\nIf the zombies touch you, you are dead. Instakill zombies wtf. Medkits in the game do not make any sense since what i assume is the only part where you can get damaged is when you have to duck under flames.\n\nThe graphics are ugly as one would expect from budget indie horror games on unity engine. Sounds are bad and even in low volume from the mixer the zombie sounds are breaking my eardrums. Note to devs turning the volume of scary sound to the level of a nuclear detonation does not make the game scary. If you are going to play this then i would recommend to mute the whole thing since there really is nothing worth listening to.\n\nUninstall works so 5/5 for that.
