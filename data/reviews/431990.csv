Impressions Video Right Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gFrqVnAcgk\n\nAfter this game had an initial problem of not being able to actually download the game for most of it's first day after it launched, the developer finally got that issue fixed... Thanks Dev!  :-)\n\nThe game offers a pretty typical horror theme affair, there is nothing in this game particularly special or that makes it stand out.  In fact, it's fairly bland and is certainly offers nothing memorable, but it does what it offers fairly well and looks to offer an hour to an hour and a half of content.  (I was able to complete 4 of the 7 sections of the game in about 40 minutes)\n\nWhile not a great value with so little content included and nothing that makes it stand out, it's hard to recommend this game to anything but diehard fans of this sort of game.  Maybe a sale price of 50% of more off the price would make it more appealing.\n\nDon't expect anything here to scare you, it's just not scary in the least bit.. and I consider myself a "wimp" to scary games if that helps you understand.\n\nWhile I played a good sport in the video, honestly I feel no desire to go back to finish the game as it just feels much more like a 'chore' then a 'fun' game to me.  I think when I recorded the video, I was actually so surprised that the game worked as well as it did, I was just happy about that.\n\nIt's too short of content, it's controls are janky, the puzzles are more lame then challenging, and there is nothing here that will scare anybody in my opinion.  In short, I wouldn't ask a friend to play this game even if it was free because I would consider their time alone wasted on this when there are so many better games out there with loads more content.\n\nAdd in the fact there is nothing procedural or random in this game means ZERO REPLAY VALUE.\n\nNaw, I cannot recommend this game, sorry devs.  There's many much better free games that do this better and offer more content and scare fun.","January 8","false","0.7"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","39","58","3","0"

Locked-In Syndrome is defiantly NOT "a story of a man who has been closed in his own subconscious." There is no story.  You basically just walk/jump around, so now I will contradict the "Features" of the game.\n• ''First person exploration''- Yes it is.\n• ''Eerie high suspense atmosphere''- Kinda, but not really. There's also some really annoying music at times.\n• ''Shocking and immersive moments throughout the game''- Nope not even one.\n• ''Solve intuitive puzzles and clues''- If you consider finding a key to open a door an "intuitive puzzle" then I guess so.\nThis game has many physics-based bugs where I got stuck countless times. Not to mention countless crashes, in the fact that the game doesn't even disable your mouse, so you're constantly clicking out of the game. Overall the game falls between bad and ok, but I don't recommend it.\nBut don't just take my word for it, give it a watch.

Its just a miss match of half life assets thrown together into a somewhat navigable level. The Flashlight is completely useless, you might as well just leave it off. I could see just fine without it. The combat is god awful there's no semblance of how much health you currently have its just, you get hit 4 times and you die. There's no red haze around the screen to tell you you're low on health or nothing. Just 4 hits *Therp* DED.\n\nThe Monsters are about as smart as a brick, I could kill them easily if i got them to run into a wall while i whack them with a pipe on the otherside of said wall. This first "Puzzle" the game makes you go through is simple as all hell. You find a junction box that powers this lift that takes you across the darkness to another area. But you can't get at the Box because there's a gate in the way with a warning sign in Russian, and its locked. allz you have to do is turn around and notice a mannequin sitting on a City 17 bench... And it holding the key.\n\nJust take the key and unlock the gate open the junction box go through an animation of your guy flipping the switch (your guy is apparently a Oily reddish character) and then your useless flash light goes super nova and your blinded practically by this blue haze which didn't help you see through the darkness. Sigh i played a bit more and Trust me it doesn't get any better. OH Floating chairs..Wow T_T like i haven't seen that in countless other FREE games before.\nIts nothing new at all.\nI guess the ONLY enjoyment i got out of this game however fleeting was at the very start when the text on the ground told me to not jump in the water i thought "WHAT? You can't tell me what to do" and i jumped into the water and died. it put a smile on my face :)...and Then i had played the game..Sigh :/","January 9","false","0.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

You can give it a try on some sale but you loose nothing if you don't play it.  30-60 minutes of gameplay. First level was very promissing and I expected some kind of walking simulator full of abstractions but later it turned out pretty generic indie horror. Good thing is you have a weapon so you don't have to run away from everything. But also no zombie hordes attacking you which is often annoying in horrors where you have weapons. Few jumpscares present. And another good thing this game has less bugs and problems than most of Unity indie horrors nowadays, almost none I would say except sticky walls which affects jumping.","February 4","false","7.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCPoshJames/recommended/431990/","PCPoshJames","James@PCPosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCPoshJames/","181 products in account","TL:DR -- This game is horrendously bad; so much so that it is rendered virtually unplayable.\n\nFirst and foremost, I should say that I had to tolerate a fair bit of bad design before ever even reaching the first level - and even as bad as all of what I'm about to cover is, these aren't the reasons I encourage you to avoid this game like the plague! First up, the UI: A game like this should have more options than "Good", "Great", "Beautiful", and "Fantastic", especially since the graphics on this game are too primitive for the previous choices to really change anything. Secondly, the UI should offer you a choice of resolution, or even GUI scaling if you Alt+Enter into windowed mode.\n\nBut UI concerns might be excusable once you're in game, right? Well, grab a book and catch up on your reading because the game starts with your character, a camera tied to the seat of a small row boat, drifting through the world's most pointlessly prolonged intro cinematic. You will get to watch as over the course of 15 seconds a word or two at a time slowly (very, very slowly) materializes infront of you, where it will stay for another 15 seconds, before it slowly (Very, very slowly) fades away to about 15 seconds of cloudy sky, after which you get to repeat the whole process over again for the next couple of words, until you've strung together "Studio 47 Present Locked-in Syndrome" over the course of about two minutes that feels very much like a week in prison.\n\nOh, and that "Studio 47 Present" thing isn't my grammatical error; the failure of subject verb agreement rests solely on the developer for that one.\n\nBut none of this, none of it whatsoever would matter if the game was fun, intersting, or at even playable... But it's just not.\n\nThe first level greets you immediately with collission physics, as simply walking from the first to second platform through the overturned metro cart requires you to find some sort of magical "sweet spot" that is exactly the same size as you are (And getting out is far harder than getting in). You'll dodge an obstical, jump a pit, and the proceed to a catwalk which you will fall off because, I assume, your character navigates around exclusively via pogostick. Which is not to say that you jump well, or often, but that only about a 2" chunk of you seems be in contact with the ground at any point in time, and that all-too-important 2 inches has a nasty habit of moving itself around. If your camera is centered on the narrow catwalk beneath you, you release the WASD keys, and spin your camera around to survey the view, you will fall.\n\nBut after a while you learn the clunky collision and finish the level to make it level 2, or as I know it, the place where you're likely to abandon this horrible, horrible game. Level 2 stars you off decending a flight of stairs, watching some floating crates, and denying a melty store manniquenne's cry for help. Neat. Immediately following, however, you will enter into a large room with a seemingly dead end. The room features a view distance limiter in the sense of a dense black fog, and since one pathway leads to a dead drop into death, and the other leads to a completely broken elevator, you end up wandering between these two features and the previously mentioned flight of stairs completely lost.\n\nUnless, of course, you notice the small, subtle, wall-colored ladder above the doorway leading back to the stairs -- a task which increases in difficulty depending on how well your monitor displays (or, more accurately, doesn't display) darkness. Once you've noticed the ladder you'll climb the ladder for a good solid minute before reaching a small landing with an arrow pointing you towards a door.\n\nYou approach the door and a monster shambles out towards you. You know there's nothing behind/below you except a broken elevator and a bottomless pit, so you navigate around the monster and go through the door, only to find that the room is full of monsters and surrounded on all sides by bottomless pit where walls wouldn't have gone amiss. So it's clear you at this point that you were supposed to turn back when the monster appeared.\n\nWhat you're actually supposed to do is leap off the platform and land a considerable distance below on a narrow catwalk about half way up from where you first started climbing the ladder. The catwalk is too far away to be jumped too from the ladder itself, so you have to make the jump from the top of the platform. But I did this 37 times.\n\n37 times.\n\nAnd do you know how many of those times I managed to contact the catwalk? Only once, and then my momentum carried me off the side and into the bottomless pit to try the whole thing over again. The catwalk is too close to the platform which you're jumping to be landed on if you were sprinting into the jump, and too far to just walk off and land on. So you have to sprint and then decently early in from the ledge to stand a CHANCE of touching the catwalk, before taking fall damage and continuing straight off the edge.\n\nI can forgive a lot... But this game is just absolute trash.","March 29","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stages that require frame perfect jumps are made extremely tedious by the controsl and physics that make you feel like you're playing with gardeners gloves on. You'll end up needing to restart a level countless times because you get pinned between two soft, lightweight and moveable objects.

However, the game needs some serious work. So much work that this game should be in Beta, not released. There's countless mechanical issues, sound issues, visual glitches and other annoyances.
