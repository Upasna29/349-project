"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serivik/recommended/328000/","serivik","Serivik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serivik/","379 products in account","Dragon Fantasy: The Black Tome of Ice is a love letter to Squaresoft's SNES-era RPGs. It clocks in between 10-15 hours long (my played time includes some AFKing). The overall story is above-average and the game is packed with homages to games both classic and contemporary. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor and goofiness, but it doesn't get in the way.\n\nThe combat is turn-based, but quick, and you can get by without much grinding if you approach the battles tactically or turn down the difficulty. I recommend turning message speed up to max. Also, there are no random battles; all monsters appear on the screen. They can be avoided and sometimes even baited away from their pack for an easy kill. They even stay dead for as long as you are in the area, often allowing you to backtrack to a campfire to recover hp/mana and save.\n\nGraphics are so-so. There are some clipping problems here and there, lots of resused NPC sprites, and a few common special effects for skills. It has some charm of its own, but don't expect the detail of Chrono Trigger or the smoothness of Secret of Mana. There is plenty of room for improvement, but the graphics definitely aren't an eyesore.\n\nI have a difficult time judging music, but I will say this game does it pretty well. Some of it is catchy, none of it was annoying, and most of the repeat cutovers are well-placed, if not perfect.\n\nIf you love SNES-era RPGs (Chrono Trigger, in particular), you will enjoy this game, but I would recommend it to any JRPG lover.","May 28","true","16.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Not that it should matter but I'm saying it because I know it does.\nEdit.....\n\nThe "humor" is really childish and too cheesy for my tastes. While the battle system is the same as one of the all-time greats in Chrono-Trigger I am nearly an hour in and still mashing the same commands over and over again to get my 1 character to kill the same enemies over and over again. That's just wasted potential right there that may be fufilled later on but at this point I am asking for a refund.\n\nWhile I gave this a "Tenantive Thumbs Up - But Please...please...please tell me they picked a better name for the second town/city/village or this might be a quick turnaround."\n\nThere was a quick turn around...\n\nLiked....\n\nBattle System\nRan Well\nRetro-Snes Presentation\nNo Random Encounters\n\nHated....\n\nRepetive Battles that in an hour of play had made 0 use of things that make the battle system great\nChildish Humor\nPacing\nStory - Vague (This is part 2 but i can't imagine part 1 will help this much) and unintersting\nAs far as I played the world here seemed to be pretty generic and bland\n\n3/10\n\nAsking for a refund....","May 29","false","0.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
