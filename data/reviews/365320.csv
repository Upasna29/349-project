Not much else since its only the first episode and I have heard others are on the way so this review will only be judged on the first episode.\n\nThis review will change as more episode are released overtime.\n\nPros:\nSolid Horror atmosphere\nSome good tension here and there\nSolid attempt from Indie-developers\nSound Design is spot on.\n\nCons:\nCharacter Animation is terribly done (Do stuff while staring at your shadow, you'll see what i mean)\nLevel Design repeats itself a lot (Felt like i was walking through the same corridors and offices for 75% of the game)\nQuestionable objective markers (*Walks Outside, must get to roof for whatever reason?*)\nSome Bugs (Was stuck in crouch mode and was unable to stand for a while at the keycard part)\n\nSTORY & ATMOSPHERE:\nStarting this game up, I was somewhat intrigued with the beginning aspects of the game but it really shows its limitations which will be discussed in a different section. Starting with the story, it follows a guy named John who, unexpectedly, has to work a night duty at a research center which has pushed the panic button. 2 guys and a girl (from the voices) have arrived at the research facility to investigate what's going on and its your job to get to the bottom of things. For the most part, its more just a rinse and repeat of traditional horror games. Something goes wrong ---> main character goes to investigate ---> Stuff happens ----> Main character must escape facility or find out what's really going on. Their are some other stuff horror games throw in but that's the gist of it. The game sets the atmosphere up well for the most part but towards the end, it kinda loses it after the 2nd level transition. It definitely has its scare moments but they get repetitive and dull while having some tension throughout the game but not much else. The characters, however, are completely forgettable because their is very little given about any of them. After the first 5 minutes, you basically just follow this hidden path with little context outside it. I mean, if the lady was alive, why is she unable to communicate to you through normal means? She didn't state her communication device broke or anything. She also walks around the facility just fine despite stating her leg broke and wants the player character to find them.  Towards the end of chapter 1, the horror elements become lost and confused and rely too much on cheap jumpscares. For the most part however, it's an ok starting story that sets the game up in a nice but bland way. Hopefully, we'll see some improvements come episode 2.\n\nThe Rest:\nThe rest of the game however, does not hold up very well at all. Graphics are meh, animations are very awkward, the layout of the levels repeat several times, some bugs here and there, and very questionable objective markers. When it comes down to it, story and atmosphere need a substance to hold it up throughout the game. Too bad its being carried in a poorly designed vehicle. First up, the animations are terribly done. Running without hands moving, holding a flashlight without it showing in the character's shadow, running up and down the ladder, and even jumping felt awkward (i think holding the jump button allows you to jump higher?). While these may be some minor things to pick on, they, nonetheless, make up the game. I also ran into some bugs such as being unable to pick up a fuse even though i had no idea why I was picking up random fuses without them serving a real purpose. The monsters didn't do much despite being spotted by them as sometimes they would follow me slowly, and sometimes they would ignore me. Not sure what was going on there, might have been a bug or something.\n\nThe level design, for the most part, was disappointing. I couldn't tell if i was really walking through a research facility, or if I was just walking through some random office building I found in the middle of the woods abandoned. Nothing in the building makes it seem like an actual research building, just some offices around with a cafeteria and some elevators. Nothing really stood out to me as being "woah... That's cool! I wonder what kind of research was going on." The only reason I remembered it was a research building was the fact I was in a hazmat suit and the beginning of the game which stated it. You mainly just go through the motions, walking through a ton of vents and following the linear path set before you. Their is very little optional exploration besides the rooms you are forced to go through.\n\nThe game does have some puzzles but they, for the most part, are too easy/too few. I think I only ran into like 2 puzzles (Elevator and solving an encrypted message). Hope to see more in episode 2 to break up this walking forward monotony. Some of the object markers, felt like they appeared too early or just didn't do anything after they were completed. I guess for the most part, your overall objective is to escape but I couldn't even tell as the game didn't bother to tell me after the first time it did, and swapped objectives. One of the objectives stated I needed to get to the roof for some reason, and then proceed to walk back inside for no apparent reason. I mean, couldn't we have technically escaped the facility at that point by just climbing a tree and jumping over the fence? Not really sure what was going on there but well, went back inside for some reason.\n\n\n\nShort Review:\nFor the most part, you walk down this hidden path, some jumpscares happen, you run into the monster a couple times, and that's it. In its current state, I can't entirely recommend this game as its short, and has way too many technical issues that plague the game. I hope the developers bring more to the field than what has been shown so far since most of it has already been done in plenty of other games more effectively. I also hope they fix a lot of the technical problems holding this game back such as the character animation and interactions. If this is all this game has to offer and the following episodes just bring more story, it's gonna be hard to recommend suffering through all of its problems just for some story and a couple jumpscares.","July 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","39","50","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/365320/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Note: This game was provided to me for free for review purposesOverviewQuadrant is an episodic horror game revolved around a small group of scientists sent to investigate in secret a distress call from a failed research center. The group soon part ways to explore the facility and weird things start to happen. You play the role of one of them, and try to escape the danger you've discovered.\n\nThe Pros:Good Horror Setting - The environment is a horror cliche standard. Empty building, ravashed furniture, scattered documents, locked doors, complete darkness. And while the elements are a textbook case, it lacks in execution, which I will go into detail in the cons section.\n\nImmersive - You can see your feet and the plexiglass and some of the edges of your hazmat suit, and when you run your screen gets blurry because of the heavy breathing clouding the helmet. You can't run very fast because of the rigid construction of the suit, and get tired really quick 'cause... you're a labrat, not an athlete. Very nice attention to detail, and it makes you really get into character.\nThe Cons:Poorly Optimised - Despite it's mediocre graphics and lack of particles or animation, the game cannot run a constant 60, hell, sometimes it just drops between 36-45fps constantly, making it a really choppy experience. I see no reason for this on a high end gaming PC.(My specs are on my profile, if anyone is curious)\n\nRigid animations - The few things that move in this game (your hads, feet and the monsters) have very unrealistic animations, almost looking like plastic action figures. While on the subject, your shadows look horrendous. Look at it while moving around, and see almost no movement, just a rigid model. See gameplays and you will surely note it.\n\nRepetitive Environments - This building is huuuge, and it shouldn't be so. The assets used here are very limited, and you'll see the same desks and chairs and broken montiros over and over and over again, with nothing new other than the layout. Most rooms are very spacious for what they hold, and the occasional ravaged room isn't enough for me to consider level diversity.\n\nCliche Enemies and Gameplay - I don't really want to spoil the first chapter, for people who want to play it, but for the ones who are undecided let me tell you what will happen. You will find a lot of fuses for no reason, even though you will need it only on one occasion, and in a low number (needed to use four, ended the game with 13). There will be plenty of jump scares, a couple of monster chases, and on the second one. Guess who the enemy is? Half-Life Head Crabs copycats. Gameplay is also so recycled from other games, I don't even know what where to begin. You have a few puzzles now and then, can find story-related documents, audio logs and picture cards. Other than that, you walk around aimlessly.\n\nCLOSED DOOR SIMULATOR 2015 - Remember how I said the building was too big? It was for a reason. Not having doors would look like crap, and having to design so many rooms would be repetitive and time consuming for the devs. So what did they do instead? Lock them ALL up. 95% of doors you will encounter will be locked, 4% are open so you see which way to go and 1% are unlocked so you can explore some more.\n\nEpisodic - For me, episodic means a sort of early access. We give you the first chapters of a story we havn't even finished yet for you to enjoy. Even if you don't need to purchase them seperately, which would have been the final nail in the coffin, waiting an unknown amount of time for the next part of the story is not a good thing either.\nConclusionThe trailer and the screenshots on steam made it look promising, however the execution is so poorly done that I cannot recommend this. If you are looking for a good horror game you have better luck with more professional games, like Amnesia or Alien: Isolation. This game just tries, and unfortunately fails to combine good aspects of different games together.","September 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","0"

I would have rated Chapter 1 negatively itself, in it's early stages. However, playing the full game all the way through really is the only way to experience it properly.\n\nCONS:\nI'll begin with the cons, which are as follows. The collision seems really buggy, I'm almost afraid to walk certain places for fear of falling through the floor or getting stuck, which only happened 2 or 3 times, but really it shouldn't have happened at all. The story and game design is all over the place, in the sense there's gameplay inconsistencies, where some areas you'll have puzzles that are difficult to understand, and other places you'll have platforming for no reason. Some of the creatures are creepy, some are just silly. Graphics and textures are alright for an indie game. From what I understand, this game was created by just a few people, so some of these issues are excusable.\n\nIn general, I felt hardly any dread or horror from the creatures themselves. A few exploits of the AI are that some of them you're able to just run right past and it kind of negates any horror or suspense that comes from avoiding the creatures. Combat is pretty useless, I'm not sure why it's even an option, aside from using pipes to break through to other areas.\nThere are a few really long cutscenes and monologue exposition. To be completely honest I tabbed out and checked my email while one of them played in the background for something like 3 or 4 minutes.\nThese, along with a list of other smaller things (too many flickering lights, repetative environment/empty environments etc.) are my main gripe with this game. But to be fair this is an indie game and I did expect some of these issues. The price though, maybe a little high at $13.\n\nPROS:\nAlthough it does have it's fair share of cons, some parts of this game are actually really well done in my opinion. The sound design for the most part is incredible, and is responsible for most of the game's horror. The sound is what made this game hard to play at night, it's actually quite scary when you don't know what to expect. The story does have some things that are a little out of place, but as you learn more and go deeper it really does come together quite well in the end and touches on some very interesting concepts. The music is incredible, I know music is subjective but I personally loved the soundtrack and I'll be buying it when it's available. Some environments actually have some really cool storytelling going on and it's worth playing through a second time to see it all. I can tell a ton of work went into creating this. It's not the next Outlast by any means, but it is an indie horror worth playing at least once.\nYou can tell the devs got better as they made this, you can see the environments and game design become better as you progress. Which, personally, is a good thing to me, since it ended the game at a high point for me.\n\nShort Version:\nYeah, this game has bugs, and glitches, and some odd design and story choices at some points. Some monsters aren't that scary, it's got a lot of exposition sometimes. There's a lot of scavenging for fuses and notes, and some odd puzzles that are either too easy, or a little difficult. It's what you'd expect from an indie horror game.\nBut, atmosphere is incredible, and the game itself is more story-oriented than puzzle-platformer. The horror comes from the implications of the events that take place in the facility, rather than relying on cheap jumpscares (although there are a couple). Quadrant is borderline Lovecraftian, and the story really opens up at the end and provides answers to things previously unanswered earlier in the game, which I was hoping for.\n\nLike any indie horror, it has flaws. But, when it does something well, it does it very, very well. It's a solid effort by the few devs that worked on this and completed it.","May 1","true","1.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Suffice it to say, this modest little indie game never had much chance of living up to the grandiose heights of that recent mega-corporation mega-game, but it certainly can't be faulted for lack of ambition therein.\n\nIt's atmospheric, super-scary, has excellent sound design, some challenging puzzles (well, they were for the hopeless likes of me, anyway!), and looks like it may actually have a genuinely interesting storyline.  I say "looks" as this is only the first part of an intended three-part "season", so here's hoping they actually get that far, release-wise (otherwise that price-tag is looking rather steep).  Some minor technical flaws aside - I'll be damned if I can get the cursor to line up properly when trying to pick up an item, and the Options menus are a mite confusing to negotiate - it is nonetheless looking like a mighty promising proposition.

I could hardly hear what the characters were saying and there had been no actual jumpscares. You cannot interact with friends in any way, as soon as you go upstairs and use the outlet you never see them again.\n\nWhat's So Scary?\nThe game is extremely atmospheric. Based in the Aether Research Facility, in the distance you see silhouettes of many strange shaped statues, figures and occasionally flickering lights. I love that in Horrors.\nThroughout the game you find fuses, audio clips, newspaper clippings, email snippets and video tapes, each one revealing more and more of the story.\n\nEmails and letters go on about rocks arriving in the quadrant and begin showing signs of life.\n"Animal characteristics, movement and even partial understanding." one states. Progressing into the game more and more is revealed about these strange rocks, showing photographs of extraterrestrial giant spider-like creatures. Are they really rocks? Where are the spider creatures now?\n\nWhat Let It Down\nIt seemed like I was going through the same coridoors almost all the time. I'd find the amount of fuses required, I'd open a vent, and I'd go into an indentical coridoor. They're increasing the level design in Chapter 2, so I wish them luck on that!\n\nThe character animations are, if I may say so, awful. Our character always has his arms by his sides, when sprinting, running, or hitting a giant spider with a fire extinguisher. What was the point in the fire extinguisher, by the way? I hit the spider several times, I seen blood but it never died...\n\nConclusion\nQuadrant really made me jump. It made me sit on the edge of my seat and it sent shivers down my spine. Not many horrors have done that to me.\n\nI await Chapter 2! With increased level design, some minor bug fixes and some sound-effect splicing this could be one of my favourite horrors.\nBased on Chapter 1, I give this game a 7.5/10.\n\nTL;DR, No Spoiler Review\nNot all about the jumpscares, Quadrant delivers a fine share of every aspect that horror games should require. With edge-of-your-seat intensity, this game will seriously send shivers down your spine.\n\n7.5/10.","August 10, 2015","true","31.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/365320/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1062 products in account","Product received for free\n\nStatus: 100% Complete\n\nQuadrant is an episodic first person horror game made by a very small team. Unlike many other horror games on the market, it doesn't rely on jumpscares and cash from screaming YouTube kids, instead it focuses on the adventure itself, story and atmosphere. It was supposed to be a 5-episode deal, but then the whole story was cut to just three episodes (the price has been lowered as well).\nWhen I started to play it, the game reminded me a lot of the first F.E.A.R. game, by the Episode 2 it already was like Half-Life 1. Speaking of which, if you played They Hunger mod for Half-Life 1, this game and that mod has lots of things in common.\n\nThe graphics are like in the first Half-Life (low-poly models, primitive animations, old looking effects), but with the modern shaders and higher resolution textures (physics based shaders of Unity 5). The latter make the game look great and blood stains, for example, look REAL.\nAlso, coherent style in everything all the way through the game. I never felt like some texture was out of place or had a lower resolution than the others (maybe there were such ones, but I didn't spot them and they weren't obvious), the same goes for models and sounds.\nIt may be all low-poly and old-looking, but the game is pleasant to look at, which is much more important and certainly better than games with super-fancy shaders and effects thrown in without any thought.\n\nThe game has weapons and combat system, but the weapons were completely useless for me and I couldn't kill a single enemy with them, always running away. You have a delay for attack animation and enemies kill you with just 1-2 hits. It doesn't matter if you run forward and back while attacking, their attacks will still reach you. Combat system is useless for big enemies and only OK for killing those alien things on the walls which shoot with some goo or something. So run, run and run.\nYou can also break the walls with a pipe, but as you could guess, these are very specific walls which you need to destroy to proceed further in the game. Still, it looks cool.\n\nI enjoyed playing Episode 1 and Episode 2, but forced myself to go through Episode 3. The last episode was pretty weak (aside from environments, they were great, as usual), just walking in the pure darkness with barely anything happening. Which would be OK, but these new action “trial and error” sequences made it worse. You need to learn every turn just to make it in time and total darkness and many enemies running after you don't help at all.\nAlso, those “jump down the cornices in the vent” parts get really old by the end of the game, they were used too much, in my opinion.\nBut the game definitely has some surprises under its sleeve.\nWhen I met the first spider, I was somewhat hoping it'll glitch in its way so it'd be easier to deal with while I was running around, but then it just started to throw tables around, going right at me. When I first met the creature which senses your movement, it was pretty terrifying to walk around it. And there are many other memorable moments like these ones.\nThe pace is about right and the game is never boring to play (even the last episode).\n\nQuadrant has controller support and it works great. However, there are action parts in the game which I highly doubt you'd be able to complete with the controller. Right stick sensitivity is set to low, which is good (in my opinion), but in the fast action parts the sensitivity makes it impossible to turn as quickly as you need. Just be prepared to switch between controller and mouse+keyboard.\n\nThere were some bugs (like falling through the map, objects without physics colliders, a bug with animation of the doctor) and many slowdowns (especially in the Episode 2), but overall it's a well-polished product.\n\nIt's a very low-budget game (the developer said it was “zero budget”), but it's a low-budget game done right and there was a lot of care put into it. It's an interesting, quality old school horror, which you don't want to drop until you complete it.\nIt's three episodes now and Episode 3 is not as good as the 1 and 2, but for 10$ it's completely worth it (just the very first episode alone is worth 7$, in my opinion).\n\nReview copy provided by publisher\n\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","May 15","true","7.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you judge it according to other indie horror games, this is most definitely a thumbs up.  If you play a lot of those, this game is for you.  If you judge it according to AAA or simply bigger studio non-indie horror games, this is mostly a thumbs down.\n\nUltimately, to be fair, you have to look at its content for what it is and what it was trying to do and whether or not it succeeded.   The answer is:  sorta.  Not really.\n\nThe production value is pretty decent.  The sound fits right in and the whole game is creepy as hell.  The atmosphere is done right - in the beginning.\n\nAbout a third of the way through the game you meet the second kind of "specimen", and..... that's it.  That's all there is.  There's a one-time encounter with a third that isn't hard to deal with, and you can SEE a fourth later on, but there are no real interactions with it, and it shows up only once.  The problem with this is that once you realize this is all you're getting, the tension is pretty much gone.  The primary two types of specimens in the game are rather badly animated, but again - would you rather compare this to other indie horror games, or ones from bigger studios?\n\nThe writing starts off okay and descends to a kind of "eh" throughout.  There are film slides and written paper logs for you to read to fill out the rest of the incident in your mind, but very little of it actually matters.  You won't care about any of the characters, and many events feel tacked-on.  There's a HUGE lack of payoff for the end.\n\nI fell through the floor twice in the game, and I'm sure it would have been more often if I hadn't avoided certain spots, both related to ventilation shafts.  Invisible walls abound.  Collision detection is rather poor, not only from monsters but movement in general, and it definitely killed me on parkour parts more than once.  Sometimes you can see through wall edges to other rooms.  This lack of polish really breaks the ♥♥♥♥ out of the immersion every time it rears its indie head.\n\nThe game often appears to be non-linear, but it isn't.  Many, many rooms and hallways exist simply as dead ends with nothing in them.  There are really no items, just fuses to open doors, and metallic fragments that I apparently never got enough of to find out what they do.  There were so many pointless areas and doors that were unopenable that it felt as though the devs intended to add a whole lot more, and just never got around to it.\n\nAnd then there's the length - five hours?  Really?\n\nIf the game goes on sale for around five bucks, it's worth a play, no matter who you are or what scale of horror games you prefer.   But ten dollars?  No, absolutely not unless you are a hardcore fan of indie horror.  If the game had been longer, had more depth, more mechanics, more specimens, more craftsmanship, I would have been all over this thing, but it's just too short and mediocre in its overall impact.","June 2","false","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The opening is well done and while the first monster encounter was confusing at first (Why give me weapons twice if I can't actually kill or even stun the dang thing?) the game takes off from there!  A decent plot, having worked as a Tech for the DoD I rather liked the layout and have experienced the early plot twist IRL, though I wasn't permanently screwed as our hero was...  I enjoyed the game, the blind monster section was genuinely scary and the monster model / animation was fantastic!  If I was the Dev I'd redesign the 1st monster encounter if possible, the model isn't that realistic compared to the later models, but still this was a great game and for $5.19 I highly recommend it.","May 6","true","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

One by one your friends are found screaming in agony as they are being ripped apart by whatever is stalking you.\n\nThe game gives games like Outlast and Alien Isolation justice.

New alien creature spiderman walking on ceiling looked as though he had applied grease/vaseline to his body and slid           around the ceiling.\n\n2. The creatures are blind but crouching does nothing to keep them from hearing you, in fact you can run as long as your not within a certain distance of them. If you are within said distance crouching and walking slowly does nothing since they will "hear" you and then come charging in trying to give you a great big hug-o-die.\n\n3. I have fallen through the floor at least 5 times due to a clipping bug.\n\n4.  I have walked through walls and doors due to clipping bugs.\n\n5. Swimming.....well let's see this man has the lungs of an olympian god at first when he was in his hazmat suite I thought "well I bet he has supplied air in that thing."  Then later you are taken out of your suite so I don't know maybe he evolved gills being around all those aliens.  Swim forward=fast,  swim up or down=his legs and arms are broken.  One time I was swimming towards the end of the game and my character got stuck swimming permanently but I did not realize it I just thought the swimming part was extremely long until I saw a monster dash by me really quick under the water and I got to a room that has a timer that counts down from 20 and was still swimming and could not figure out what to do....then I died in the countdown room and when the game reloaded all the water was gone.\n\n6. I have loaded into the game and all the monsters have vanished.\n\n7.  I wish I had taken a video of the alien monster walking on 2 legs it is hilariously bad.  He looks as though he is two stepping to the bathroom to have a nasty dump.\n\nNow I realize that this is a indie game/early access, but this second chapter needed to be beta tested a whole lot more.  Like I said up top I really enjoyed the first chapter it was cheesy but good cheesy this new chapter though is bad cheesy.\n\nJust finished Chapter 3, which I believe is the last chapter to be made in this series, though I could be wrong.\n\nThe alien creature animation was still  bad so no change there.\n\nIt was or at least seemed a lot shorter than the previous 2 chapters.\n\nThe ending was left open for what seemed like a sequel but I do not know if they will do anything more with this story.\n\nAll in all this chapter really didn't do anything new for this game as said above it was short and you don't get any closure because they left it open ended for a sequel so I really fail to see the point.  Alien humanoids have terrible walking animations I am surprised they did nothing to make it look any better from the last chapter considering this one was the shortest.\n\nThey did add more of the same jump down elevator shafts jumping puzzles that were in the last chapters and they decided to add some switch puzzles that were ok until the flooding electric water room switch puzzle of which I died the first time doing it and when I reloaded the level all the sound was muffled because it thought I was still underwater.  That puzzle can go to hell considering the jumping in this game is clunky feeling.  Oh they also brought back the must find fuses to get through door puzzles, yep got 2 of those.  There is also no final boss type monster that you battle with you end up with 2 back to back run out of this area before 2 minutes are up or you die.\n\nYou can tell that this last chapter was rushed to get out by how short it is and how they recycled the same thing over and over in it.  I will say though unlike chapter 2 I did not clip through any walls or doors and did not fall through the floor.\n\nAll in all if you want a cheesy horror game that started out with a really good story and kinda just flubbed in the end then go ahead and buy it.  If you were like me and thought that chapter 1 was really good but needed work and expected the following chapters to improve on what they had established story wise and design wise well you will be dissapointed that is why I do not recommmend it.\n\nChapter 1 = rough around the edges but has good atmosphere and story build up.\n\nChapter 2 = buggy(at least when I first played it) gameplay terrible alien animation and so-so story\n\nChapter3 = Has same terrible alien animation some good addition to the story until the stupid open ended ending which brings no closure to the story as a whole and rehashed puzzles and level design from the first 2 chapters.","November 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","3"
