For starters, I still do not agree with the price model that Disney used, and I stand by that point. Secondly, I would like to say that if you have played past DI games, you can (to my knowledge) use the old figures, which was a good move by the devs. If you enjoy games like Skylanders, or past DI games, you should at least try this, because it isn't all a bad game, the DLC just ruins much of the experience. If the DLC model is fixed, than I may be able to reccomend playing this, but untill that happens, this will stay a negative review.","November 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 770 of 820 people (94%) found this review helpful 297 people found this review funny","94","770","820","297","26"

I've accepted your DVD mark up, and bought them. But this... This is rediculous!\n\nI've tried to give the game play a shot. Free is free and my kids love Mickey, Monsters, Cars, and Toy Story . From what I played it is. Not great but ok and a would be good game for my sons.  Heres the problem and why they will not play anytime soon, at least not until a big sale. It is a micro transaction mess. The DLC shown is only part of it. There are pay walls everywhere. There is no reason for it. This is at best a $60 game + $20 or so on DLC; But not for this amount  of $. G.M. Crysler I so want this to be awesome.\nLet me start. First it is a basic platformer(like the old PS2 days) then a cart racer(not the same level as Sonic Allstar but close), then it's a building game,(like minecraft with less choices) then a PVE nonstop grind fest. I feel like it's pulled to many direction and if you choose one. Well, that will be 12.99, then another will be another 12.99. You like Star Wars $$$. Oh you wanted to use those characters in the Star Wars Universe? $$$. So you like Cars and Monsters as well? $$$$$$$ You like Mickey. Oh you know thats $$$$$. On top of that the game is confusing at times. Not at what to do, but to figure out what you want to do. Where you want to go and each time there is a pay wall. It crushes all game play.\nI know this is a "F2P" game like an MMO. But, even the worst MMOs have boundries. This is for kids and childless adults who are like kids or want be a kid again. Not keeping it at a set rate is criminal. Look they could say $100 or so and you get everything, throw a free weekend and if you liked it then there you go. Just doing math(something they are hoping you can't do) I figure for what my kids would want for 5mins of fun. It would cost 53.99. Then they would want something else. Boom another $15-40. The more, and more.  No game! NO GAME is this many cachings to get everything. At least not since the NeoGeo. Again that was ONE flat rate that almost no one gave into. The gameplay is not amazing it's just normal and pulled in many directions. However, the directions that I wanted to try. Well they weren't included. Infact much of it isn't included to try. So how would I have the foggies if this game is worth my time and my kids time and more importantly my money. Either mark it as a DEMO or make it "F2P" it can't be both.\nThen theres the Video Options. There is little options, but anything should run this because it looks like WOW. But ofcourse it has a high recomended requirment for what it is. My main rig handles this no prob, but thats a 4790k/980ti. My laptop which has a i73610q/675m drops to about 35-40 fps and never hits 60. With all graphic options off I see no difference. So I had to change the resolution, but most of the resolutions types don't even show up on my laptop.(also it crashes everytime I change that setting) Oh and no V Sync.(That is just lazy and you want how much of my money) Then theres the hard crash that comes and goes. This is where you have to ask yourself,"Did they take any time to port this?" Wish they did, but it is still very playable. That is if you get passed the loading screens. I have a decent rig and yet the loading here takes me back to when I played on consoles. So... Yeah, a port through and though. Infact the loading time is the same on my laptop to my desk top and one is much faster than the other. Again livable, but why?\nCome on Disney this is a $60 game at best and you know it. You don't even have all the characters from your own franchises. There is no Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, or Eeyore! No Muppets, Little Mermaid, and no Lion King to pick from as characters. But theres the Lone Ranger from that movie that bombed, and two different types of Star Wars. The only draw here is to have Matter and Mike Wastowski roll on some dudes or race. Yeah the characters are the draw, but you already know that. This game would be worthless without them. But, not even Mickey himself could justify these prices. Sad because I want this to be good on PC. So my kids will want to game on PC, and this console generation can be my last. If the console players are paying these prices and paying for internet I pitty them. They shouldn't have too! To those saying its for console users, understand this isn't good for consumers. You are a consumer, and you only get so much money in a life time. Pretty sure the title is a miss print. This is Infinity Pay without Limits 3.0 and a serious avoid until Disney comes to their senses and iron out things this may be worth while. Or a huge sale, but thats the only way to get into this.\n\nUpdate! 11/26/15: There is a 50% off of most of the game on Steam. Ofcourse this site only shows part of it. All 1.0 characters and Toy Box Take Over/Racing is 50% as well. In anycase I was able to purchase what my kids want for 50% of the gold Disney wanted. In my eyes 50% is still full retail but reasonable, but you may still disagree and in some ways you should. Parents need to take time to learn the payment method here. Again they should be upfront, if you buy a character pack you should get the toy box access. On a side note the cart racing is a lot of fun and something Disney should show off abit more.(think Cars 2 style gameplay and memorable tracks) I would like to see them add to it, though some of the tracks feel like they could have done alot more; however the Candy Crush track from Wreck it Ralph is possibly my favorite track of any racer. Not overly surprising that the same studio that did this did Sega Allstar, but this should have gotten more attention. The Demo track is not in the game,(Which that should be) but you can create it. The toy box can be fun too,(Though I have seen CTDs here from time to time when placing roads) and the weakest thing here is Toy Box Take Over. Thats the one they let you try because Disney. It is well voice acted but is short and small. The level are simple and if you have Fantasia Mickey you will easily beat it. The core game is not bad at all and there is a good amount of content for 60-100 bills. Dangum, they accually made a better Star Wars game than E.A, with space battles and a story! Each charater has their own abilties. Ralph smashes multiple enemies and throws bombs, while Jack Sparrow slices and shoots. But paying for avatars though; sorry charaters is pretty lame. There are as I said some important characters missing. Like where is Goofy? Oh that bugs me. How is he not a playable charater, I don't like him but you would think? 3.0 is just in no way worth what they are asking at full retail and there is no way of knowing if this is for you or your kids with what is "free". That being said the PC seems to be the way to go here, as the console prices are much much worse and come with toys you are not suppose to play with.(cause thats a thing now) So I recommend this game if you can spend less than a $100, but good luck doing that normally. Seriously it's like it was made by Scrooge McDuck himself, and no he is not a playable character either.","October 30, 2015","false","39.5"," 726 of 785 people (92%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","92","726","785","76","18"

So be warned. Plus no windowed option. I tried the good ole "-w" deal and that didn't even work.\nDon't even download this "game". it's exactly like the first two but with "more content".

The reviews however do not reflect this. This free to play game is meant to serve as a companion for the game if you own it on console. I own this on PS4 as well and have bought into the figures. The nice thing is with these figures you get a card that gives it to you digitally. This is where the PC version is nice. I dug out my code cards, plugged them in and have almost every character I bought physically (minus ones that were bought used). Most people who come on here are expecting this to be a fully functioning game which quite frankly it isnt. It is meant to be a COMPANION to the console counterparts. I thus cannot recommend this with full faith unless you already are playing it on console AND have kept up with all of your code cards.","November 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 127 of 147 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","127","147","10","1"

There are also pay walls everywhere. You can only have one game save at a time. I assume you have to buy more. For that fact alone, I do not recommend this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is decent (Star Wars DLC). Its feels like a fighting game, but has good Star Wars flavor to it. The story isn't anything spectatular, but there is fighting, chases, and environmental obstacles. The camera is wonky at times and can become unresponsive, requiring a restart. There are also memory leaks, causing substantial frame rate drops... requiring a restart. Those are the most serious bugs and they really wouldn't bother me much except this game has been out long enough for major issues like this to be patched, but they haven't.

It wouldn't be going into 3.0 if it wasn't. I started out with the original on Xbox360 and got some play time out of it. The whole toybox thing was kind of what got me to try it out, growing up with LEGOs. That, and the collecting aspect, but the toybox was why I ended up with Disney and not Skylanders.\n\nThen came the Marvel acquisition, and, apparently, a whole new game, despite the same name. Was kind of disappointed at that point. Especially when I finally broke down and bought 2.0 and found that the playsets, while they did contribute pieces to the toybox, did not work with 2.0. No backwards compatibility. Kind of odd, I guess, since I originally said it was the toybox feature that hooked me. Thankfully at least all the characters were still able to be played with.\n\nAnd now Star Wars brings 3.0. Hmmm...not entirely sure I want to shell out for another essentially same game that I can't use my prior investments with to their full extent. This, more than having to shell out for stuff is at the core of my issues with the Infinity series.\n\nThe DLC, meh. The console versions were at least as money grubbing with all the playsets and characters and power discs, so no real change there, other than they put them in larger bundles, apparently. That, and the character packs duplicate characters that are in the play set packs.\n\nI downloaded this just to put enough time into it to give a review on the first 2, honestly. I may keep playing, just to see what's changed, but I'm not impressed enough with the series to recommend getting into this, unless you do play it free only and don't buy any of the DLC. Odds are 4.0 will come out sooner rather than later, and will break anything you're previously purchased.","October 31, 2015","false","8.4"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","36","42","2","1"

With my PC, I can play Infinity with no trouble. That is until I actuall started playing. The game runs far better than its console counterparts, but the one thing here is that you CANNOT use a Disney Infinity figure base thing to bring in characters. The base is connected via USB, the devs could've easily added in support for the figure base. Thats right, even if you already have the figures and base, you cannot use them on the PC version. You have to pay 6$ for each character or you can put in codes that are included in the packages for Infinity figures. Before the PC release, most people had no use for the codes and simply threw away, meaning that people who already have huge disney figure collections like myself have to purchase the characters once again in order to play them, albiet the purchase is through online means and microtransactions.\nIn short, the game runs better on PC, but you CANNOT use a Disney Infinity base or figures. Only play this version of DI if you have a lot of money and are willing to spend it on a lot of useless virtual junk.","November 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","21","23","4","0"

It isn't free, that I can assure you, there are however three free demo characters you are provided with that change every other week or so and a few power discs that are provided for you (From Star Wars, Marvel, and Disney themselves) so you don't have to buy any right away. This game seems more intended for those who are familiar with the console's mechanics of the gameplay. Having the console version, I can reassure you this game is fine but is lacking online multiplayer yet and of course there are some packs or characters you may have to buy. But if you compare it to the console, it is nearly no different apart from the fact that on PC you can create much bigger worlds.This game isn't bad, it's just a matter of whether or not you're willing to pay for characters and small discs packs which is really just an option and not a demand. (Which are pricier on console because the figures come with both a card for PC redeem and the figure itself). To put it simply, I recommend this game if you're a fan of disney, have a few dollars on the side to spend if you wish and don't mind playing by yourself (For now while they work on an online multiplayer update). The game is still pretty enormous even if you don't pay for much, if not anything at all, the game doesn't rely on purchases of anything, but it is recommended maybe a pack or a charcater, or two, for your collection, which aren't pricy on their own at all for PC.\n\nIf you are looking to have fun in a Disney Sandbox game, with various dlcs and neat characters and cheap packs, none of which are demanded, then this is a game I can recommend.\n\nIf you have no intentions of purchasing anything at all or playing a game that requires some patience while the Developers continue to work on it, then this game isn't for you.\n\nThank you.","December 31, 2015","true","45.7"," 56 of 85 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","56","85","7","0"

So many different DLCs. What do they mean? If I already have the Starter Pack, what happens if I get the same Character pack? Anakin/Ahsoka gets replicated?\n2. Yesterday I saw more than 10 different DLCs, now only 6. What gives?\n3. I I buy directly from Disney's PC Store, will it still work?\n4. Do figures work as well?\n\nDisappointment\n1. So little Graphics Options, there were some weird graphics on my machine (same graphic image stuck), thought of modifying graphics at Options but there were so little options\n2. Why does the Intro last so long? It's very annoying to repeat. Please do something about it\n\nHowever, if Steam/Disney could fix the above, I'm sure more people would be happy to dig in.\nMake no mistake, I do look forward to getting more of this game, just that I'm very confused at the moment.","October 30, 2015","false","13.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","0"

It did not say that on the Store page when I first went to try it. If I had known that, I wouldn't even have tried it; which is probably why they don't mention it.\n\nThis, my friends is the game I can point to when people compare 'Pay 2 Win' games. It's a pay to everything. If all they really wanted was our money, it should have been a one time purchase like a normal game. Not decieving for a shoo-in. Ironically, that mindset perfectly fits with Disney's logic of "It's 100% free. But if you want to enjoy it you have to pay big monies."\n\n-\n\nThe intro btw is locked-in, unskippable & far too long. I even had a phone call in the middle of it & couldn't pause or end the cut-scenes. By the time I got to the Mickey Mouse part I was so frustrated I didn't want to play anymore. With no exit menu option possible, I bitterly decided to 'go along for the ride' until the intro was over. I held 'W' to accelerate the vehicle & didn't bother to steer or do anything else just to see what it'd do. The game practically played itself for me, running me into barriers & exactly where I needed to go. I ended up first place, of course.\n\nIf it clearly doesn't need me there, other than for my wallet, then my wallet & I will go elsewhere.\n\nTLDR; Disney's trying to tug at your heartstrings with this P2W game, and very likely your kids emotions. Don't let your kids beg you for money so they can be happy; you're only teaching your children bad values, as well as making you the Scrooge because you're standing between them & their favourite characters.","November 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

The support page for Steam/Windows 10 versions of this game no longer exist on their official help page, and the Zootopia pack is not available here.\n\nUnfortunately, from what I know so far, there is no way to transfer your already purchased content to the console versions either. That being said, I have contacted Disney, and I hope I can at least get some free alternatives (at worst a discount), so that I don't just outright lose the content I purchased.\n\nThe only good thing that came from this is that I didn't purchase a lot, and what I purchased was discounted because of the "May the 4th" sale. Unfortunately, I do not believe this is a good game, as the bugs in it are too numberous, and the fact that PC support has been completely cut off is ridiculous.\n\nGood luck to all of the people who have bought their content strictly digital.

Unless, you get unlock codes on the internet (check the Disney Infinity subreddit where people share their spare codes). Otherwise you will have to pay to unlock them, but at this price you're better off buying the actual figures than the digital only ones as the physical ones are cross platform (unlock the character once and you can use it on any platform, PC, IOS and Android included) while the digital purchases done on the PC version are not carried over to other platforms.\n\nTL;DR: good for the physical figure owners, not for the rest.","November 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 42 of 71 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","42","71","6","0"

And I am surprised, or actually puzzled... I am not quite sure why so many people downrate the game for the store and the player having to buy pretty much everything. Not that I am DEFENDING it, it's just... when I first saw Infinity figures at the store, I read about it, and learnt that the BASIC IDEA is to buy those figures so you could use them in your game (and have the figures on your shelf, I guess). That's what I heard the game was based on.\n\nSo I was surprised people complain about just THAT. However, is the F2P-thing a lie? Kinda, but not entirely. You CAN play the game and unlock some stuff for your toybox, you can do the daily challenges and dabble around with a very very basic toybox (the building-area). In order to do so, you can use three characters that are available for trying. The three available ones are switched every week, AFAIK. When I tried it, I was able to play Olaf, Asokah and Hulkbuster.\n\nI then went on Ebay and searched for Infinity webcodes (the code the figures come with. You can type them into the store in game and unlock the respective character). For 1 EUR, I was able to buy Luke Skywalker (be careful! Some of the guys sell codes for a EUR or two, but ask for like 11 EUR shipping cost, which is silly, as they can just email you the code).\n\nNow, what is the game like? It's fun! It ofc is aimed at younger players, and is totally safe to be played by your child... it's kinda cute, and has a mix of jumping, running, climbing, melee and ranged combat (each character has unique abilities, and you can unlock more).\nIt's not terribly challenging, but IMO, it's made with some love for the franchises (Disney/Marvel/Star Wars). It has references to all those movies and characters, a great soundtrack (of course it does, as they can use the soundtrack from, like, the SW movies), and you will find a lot of very familiar characters.\nOf course, it's a matter of taste whether you like the graphics, whether you like to play jump and run in some Alladin-area with a SW-character, etc\nIMO, this is a fun casual game.

If you've played any of the previous versions of the game on console and connected to a Disney Account, you can at least bring most of your unlocked content and figures over to this version.

The main source of my frustration for this product is the incredibly inconsistent and buggy interface for actually creating content.  Being a game designer in real life, perhaps I'm spoiled with professional design packages like UE4 and whatnot, but you would think a simplified design tool like Disney Infinity presents would be pretty easy to use, but it's not!\n\nThe player is inexplicably transported all over the world as they are building it when they introduce new props to the world.  Sometimes they are snapped to the ground, sometimes they are under it, or over it.  You can't tell at a glance where your objects are in 3d space in relation to the objects right next to them, the only clue are the enormous bounding boxes where you can try to get them aligned with each other and hope for the best.  Even then, since they don't have a uniform standard for the size of pieces, or at the very least there doesn't seem to be, it's incredibly difficult to make anything that looks properly aligned.\n\nI just spent an hour trying to build a simple bridge out of blocks and line it up to the space mountain set piece only to have rogue blocks made inexplicably in the distance that I cannot delete, I accidentally deleted the randomly generated terrain, which I couldn't undo, and I couldnt line up the giant space mountain set piece to the bridge I made despite the meager sense of snapping the product gives you.\n\nIn the end I made something, and it wouldn't let me save my new "thing" without deleting my old.  I don't think this would have occurred on my PS4 and to be honest, I tried to use the PC version thinking my professional expertise would make the process of building something for my daughter faster on the PC.  Well that was silly of me.\n\nLets talk about the interface.  D00d.  You give me buttons to raise and lower objects, and then suddenly they don't work anymore?  You have the spacebar place interface overlapping with the lower button interface if you click, so you can accidently place objects somewhere you don't want them.  Was this tested before release?","January 9","false","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's neat that you can use characters you own (as long as you redeemed their code on the Disney Infinity website) to use in the Toybox but not being able to use the figure itself on the portal kind of sucks the magic out of the game. You can buy the characters and their playsets digitally but it just isn't the same and feels like a cash grab. Sure, it's kind of the same as buying a figure to access a character already on the disc if you're playing on console but at least you get a cool figure to go along with it. Here it feels shallow and like everything is behind a paywall.\n\nIf you're someone who wants to play this get it on a console with the figures and play it the way it was meant to be enjoyed. There's some good stuff here and if you're a big Star Wars fan then there's a lot to love. Also the Toybox mode is woefully underappreciated.","December 26, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

It's simple control systems and gameplay are probably geared toward kids but they take me back to old classics I used to play with friends when we sitting on a coach in one of our pads mashing buttons and trashtalking like champions.  Good times.  The graphics are crisp and the whole thing is a pretty tight package but the whole thing manages to fall on it's face when it sells you on nostalgia then abruptly and completely fails to deliver.\n\nThe PC version of this game is hopelessly behind the console versions.  The huge sell of this game for me would have been multiplayer.  As time goes on and friends move on with their lives online play would have been fantastic to relive old times with a friend far away.  Neither local or online multiplayer are supported on the platform.  If this were the case unilaterally it would have been a disappointment but with comparisons to the other platforms it is unacceptable.\n\nUpdates for DI seem sporadic for the PC version and as new features are introduced to consoles while deficiencies on the PC are not addressed I can not recommend investing in the DLC for continued play.  Download the free client and take walk down memory lane with what feels to be an amusing button masher but don't take the experience any further unless the developers make some kind of effort to inprove the experience and address the disparities.","March 14","false","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're very misinformed. Apparently some people think Disney are likely to give content away for free, which has never been their style. I think making the base software free and only charging for the story packs/characters is great. On consoles you have to buy the base software too, for 40 quid! It works out so much cheaper on PC. And codes come with the physical characters so you can still enjoy owning the actual figures. Its a win win. It's a particularly good deal during steam sales. I only wish codes for the levels came with starter packs, instead of just the characters.\n\nIt also performs better than some claim. It performs decently on a 6600K's integrated graphics chip. Not a lot of frames, but playable. Some more video options would've been nice to combat this. Being able to turn of reflections would've helped.\n\nI'd also love to see story packs come out for 'The Good Dinosaur' and 'Big Hero 6'.\n\nAll in all, Disney Infinity has been a pleasant surprise for me since I started playing 2.0 this year.

This allows them to resell the codes. A seller will send you the code via ebay message if you specify (this means instant delivery). These codes can be redeemed on the online site for PC content, as it is all linked to one account. Therefore you can buy all of the Star Wars and Marvel quest content for around 10 -30 dollars. Characters cost around 2-5 dollars a piece via this code-only method.\n\nI unlocked ALL marvel quest packs for 2.0 and ALL star wars content (characters and quest packs) for about 35 dollars.

Also, if you have exisitng characters that you bought, and you kept the little card that came with them, you can redeem the code in the game and unlock all of those characters on pc. The only thing keeping me from purchasing a pack for the pc is that it has no multiplayer at the moment. When they implement the multiplayer, I will buy the Star Wars pack for my son.

However, I have to come back and change my review now with the revelation of some important information. I did not know, at the time of my original review and did not until just now, that Disney has DROPPED PC SUPPORT for Infinity 3.0. I just purchased Juddy Hopps only to realize that she is not playable on PC, neither is Nick, Balu, or Marvel Battlegrounds. This is disusting to realize, especially since they made no official announcement of not supporting these items. Why include web codes that cannot work?\n\nBetween the abhorrent pricing model, and this new revelation (which was probably a decision made soley for the sake of reinforcing the pricing model, as PC users could get around it with web codes), I cannot support this product. I will continue to play it, because it is a fun game and I've already spent some money on it myself, I CANNOT suggest anyone download this game or give them ANY of your money. DON'T buy it on console either, because everything is insanely overpriced. None of the playsets are, in my opinion, worth $20. None of the characters, no matter how cool or endearing, are worth $15 individually.\n\nDo not support this garbage business practice.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nSo, I tried reviewing this game three times earlier today, but for some reason Steam would not let me post. Hope it will now. Anyway, the short is this: DO NOT LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS KEEP YOU FROM DOWNLOADING THIS TITLE.\n\nThe reviews claim that this download is nothing but microtransactions, and that this is only a demo. Both of these are true, however, there is still a substantial amount of content available to play and I believe this is one of the better Demos you will find on Steam. It offers a short playable demo for each available playset, along with 3 (you can unlock an additional 2) weekly characters for free. Yes, the characters and playsets are overpriced and the entire game is basically a money-suck. With that said, no one is requiring you to buy absolutely everything. I'm having plenty of fun with just the Star Wars sets and characters. Speaking of, you can find many of the characters and sets being sold very cheaply on Ebay. I would still suggest you purchase something from Steam to show your support, but if you can't afford the standard prices there are other legal ways of obtaining some more content and making it worth-while download.","March 28","false","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The console versions of Infinity 3.0 recently got an update for some new modes and figures, and the devs have already made it clear these are not coming to the PC version anytime soon, which also means that any toybox save files that use items and props from the new sets are now incompatible with PC.\n\nIf Infinity interests you, don't bother with this version, get it on a console instead.

I wanted to set the record straight on the game's relative "freeness" as basically 100% of the negative reviews are complaining about.  I think this absolutely qualifies as a free game.   I have played probably 40-60 hours of this game, not spent one dime, and still have not found all the free content.  That is more content than most games that cost $60 have.\n\nThat said, what this game and Disney do suck at is clear pricing schemes, bundling content in a way that benefits the consumer, and creating a menu structure that is intuitive and allows people to find content that is available to them.  I garauntee that the reason this game gets so many negative reviews and that people think it doesn't qualify as "free" is because when they get to the main menu they press "Play."  Makes sense right?  WRONG.  Pressing play gives you access to something like 5 demos and one daily quest.  And who could blame these people.  Stupidest thing I have ever seen a developer do.\n\nSo, where is all the free content?  Press "Build" and you gain access to the toy box functionality and this is where most of the free game is.  Enter the toy box hub, and start talking to the quest givers and entering all the doors and using widgets.  The toy box hub map itself is quite large and does have mobs to kill, hidden toy box items, and so forth.  So, get ready to platform and explore.  You even get to climb around the ewok village and that was nostalgic coolness for me.  There are several hack n slash missions, racing mini games, farming type stuff like you might find in other open world games, sidekicks to collect and level, characters to collect and level, etc.  These free characters even rotate weekly so you are constantly getting access to new characters without paying a cent.  Better yet, your leveling progress on free characters you use is saved so that you don't have to start over when they become available again or you buy them.  Beyond this going into the toybox theater will also give you access to what I currently see as thousands of player made toyboxes that have little mini-missions and other things to do inside them.  Very cool.  You can also make your own with some limited functionality and skins (just like any other free to play game).\n\nSo, what do you not have access to as a free player or what do you have to pay for and how does that all work?\n\nThis is perhaps the most confusing part of the whole thing and that is saying a lot given how stupid the menu tree is.  First, all the storymodes that you have demos of in the play menu have to be bought.  If you want to permanent access to specific characters they have to be purchased.  The toy box take over and raceway mini games also must be purchased.   The toybox itself - where you make your own levels - also has to be purchased if you want to have access to all toy box options - buildings, skins, vehicles, etc.\n\nNow a normal company or free to play game would make these all discrete purchases and make them affordable so that you could microtransaction your way to victory and get exactly the content you want at a reasonable price.  But this is Disney....  They didn't do that.  Buying an individual character, for example, will set you back at least $6.  That's right, you can pay $6 and get absolutely no story content or unlock any toybox mode and get nothing but one single character.  Instead, the "best" way to purchase things is by buying bundles.  Okay great.  That will make it easier to get a whole bunch of stuff at once right?  No.  There are ridiculous amounts of bundles.   The most straight-forward bundles are the "Starter Packs" and "Storyboxes" - Story boxes get you a single storymode with two free characters and I THINK unlock a toybox mini game.  The Starter Packs unock one storybox (including the two free characters) and get you access to the full toybox mode.  Oh wait but there is more....  Disney has decided that the best way to distribute their product is to give specific retailers exclusive access to certain bundles and characters....  Not sure if steam will let me list them here but just look around.  You will find some stores that will bundle like 5 star wars characters with a startpack and so forth.  Some characters can only be bought at certain locations (or directly through Disney).  A total mess...  And the worse part is that many of these packs overlap content and then there are certain characters (Darth Vader, for example) who are in NONE of the packs at all...  You also have to make sure that the pack you are getting (which will often be targeted at consoles) also includes webcodes to unlock it on your PC.\n\nOkay.  So is it worth it?  I think if you can find a good sale on some of the bundled stuff, yes.  The game play is really fun if you are wanting something casual and especially if you are looking for something for little kids - or parent-child gaming time.  They really have done a great job making some polished game play (save the driving stuff - that is a little clunky on PC).  I have not purchased anything yet but hope to look into some of the Star Wars story modes.  The demos were pretty cool and I want to play through them all.\n\nHopefully this review helps you find the free content that is there.  Well worth the free download to get to it.\n\n","March 31","true","114.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I must admit that I was very hesitant to download the game in the first place because reviews on all platforms this game is available on were very negative (Steam, Google Play Store, Windows Store, Amazon). However most reviews tended to be the same complaint about having to pay for things so I decided to try for myself and being a huge star wars fan I really wanted to try this for the star wars alone, I admit Iâm not much of a Disney guy...til now.\n\nTL;DR Game is awesome, fun, excellent. Quit your whining about having to buy things as this game is not as bad as other games are with their microtransactions and pay to win schemes. Characters are good. Donât buy toy box unlock if you have an APU, Donât buy toy box unlock unless you know for sure your computer can handle building in the toy box. Highly recommend.\n\nIn my experience free to play games offer little and want too much for nothing and most are really pay to win schemes. All free to play games are free to enter but charge a ton on microtransactions (buy coins for this buy coins for that) then charge you upwards of $20 or more for packs that allow you to have the better weapons etc. Disney Infinity however is nothing like that, there are no micro transactions as you can win the blue sparks (the play money used to buy toy box content) with everything you smash and every enemy you kill.\n\nCharacters are not free but you can use the trial ones for a limited period and then choose other characters each time, you can level them  up and if you ever do buy the character their levels and powers are still there.\n\nAs a free player you have the ability to play the daily challenges, visit and play in any of the community toy boxes which are plenty so there is always something to do.\n\nBuying the playsets allows you to play each playset plus you get two or more characters. You donât have to spend too much on the characters or the playsets, you can buy them on Ebay or trade them on reddit (web code only). You can unlock all the star wars playsets and characters for about $20 if you are patient and shop around for deals. The playsets are really fun and collecting all the characters  in a series by hunting them down on ebay and other places is fun in itself, I mean who doesnât like finding a playset worth $19.99 for only $2? Itâs like finding treasure!\n\nAll in all the game is fantastic, fun and just plain awesome. The characters look great, each with its own unique powers and weapons. The playsets have a good story and offer hours of fun. âInfinityâ things to do.\n\nOf course nothing is perfect and this game comes with its glitches some of which are very annoying sometimes almost not allowing you to play. Some of these glitches include not being able to use the mouse properly as the sensitivity seems to be broken and therefore making flying or pod racing nearly impossibleâ¦..that is if your computer cannot handle the graphics. Way to get around most issues is to lower the screen resolution in the main game menu options down to the lowest and then most issues in this game are gone. Be aware that this game does not support APUs so Disney will not offer support for some of the games problems but to be honest they did try to help me even after the fact that my craptop is very low spec and did not meet their system requirements.\n\n\nPros:\n-Infinite hours of fun\n-Good looking characters\n-Good gameplay\n-Good stories\n-Good graphics\n-No microtransactions (unless you want to spend money on sparks which you can get free in game)\n-No pay to win\n\nCons:\n-Glitches, many - However most are due to my piece of caca laptop not meant for gaming so basically I do not count it against the game itself.\n\n-No APU support, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT buy the toy box unlock unless you KNOW your computer can handle building in the toy box. You can try this out during the tutorial, if you get the âperformanceâ warning and does not allow you to place objects then you most likely cannot build and if your laptop has APU then it will be nearly impossible for you to use the toy box. I say nearly because there are ways around it but still very limited. I would say simply you canât use the toy box. Disney will not be fixing this either so be advised. I made the mistake of buying the toy box unlock but glad that I was able to get a refund from steam.\n\n-No Multiplayer - it is very sad that this is not available...yet and possible never on PC\n\nI highly recommend this game.

The graphics are great (I'm not a huge fan of the art style, but that doesn't mean the graphics are bad), the sound design is -perfect-, especially for the Star Wars content, and John Williams' epic tracks are put to spectacular use here. Combat is less than stellar, but it's a typical action game with some combos and special abilities thrown in. It's no Devil May Cry, but I've yet to get bored with it. (I also have lots of gametime outside of Steam, by the way.)\n\nFor DLC, it's very much a "buy what you want" gig. The people complaining about the price of DLC most likely will not be wanting to buy every single character out there. You also get 50% off for buying said DLC digitally from Steam or the Disney Store, but I -highly- recommend, as others have stated, you buy them from the Disney Store. The Play Sets are very well designed, and aside from a couple grindy parts in Rise Against the Empire and The Force Awakens, they're paced well and follow the story in a unique and fun way.\n\nThe meat of the game, I feel, comes from the Toy Box mode. Here you can create your own levels and maps, complete with objectives, enemies, and even bosses. I love just messing around in there, and you can also download plenty of maps from other users. Some of them are -very- well done, and seem like purchase-worthy DLC, and it's all completely free. You do -not- have to own toys used in player-made levels to play with them.\n\nOverall, I really think Disney Infinity is a great game, and I went into it not expecting much from it. And yes, eBay is a -great- place to buy some DLC. I've spent around $30 on Twilight of the Republic, Rise Against the Empire, The Force Awakens, and Kylo Ren... the latter two I paid full price for.\n\nI honestly recommend Disney Infinity, just go into it expecting to at least spend a little bit to unlock the stuff you want.

Here's a hint- go to ebay and look for web codes. Or that friend of yours who has all the figures. Buy their codes off them. I got the 3 main players for Â£7 between them. It's very affordable. Then you can buy the characters you like if you can't get the codes at a fraction of the figurine price.\n\nIf you run into the same error I had with inside out - game progress saves but character level doesn't- make sure to buy at least toy box takeover. You can test the theory in normal toy box as well though, I imagine. Play inside out to your desired level. Notice in your collection that the character still says level 0. Save the play set. Enter toybox take over as the character and watch the information update. Once the new level shows you can save and leave and it won't go away.\n\nDon't be stupid when you get this game. Spend some time researching your cheapest options. I opened all playsets and a fair few characters for less than Â£50.","December 24, 2015","true","14.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kotcha22/recommended/361640/","Kotcha22","Kotcha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kotcha22/","154 products in account","After playing for a couple hours, here is my opinion:\n\nWhen you download this game, you ONLY have access to the demo of each part of the story (I'm going to review only the Star Wars part as it's the only one I've played). You will have access to a temporary character to try it out and you can't save the game. Without buying anything, this game doesn't have much interest.\n\nNow what I thought when I started this game is that I'm a fan of Star Wars and I was looking for some nice looking cheap figurines. I found the Disney Infinity ones on Amazon and that's what got me to look the game up on Steam. On PC it's less interesting than consoles as we don't have the "base" included in the "Starter Packs" of consoles versions of the game. If you play on console, please get to the review of the game there.\n\nOn the other hand, the advantage of the PC version is that you actually don't need the base and thus to buy the Starter Pack which is quite pricey. On PC, simply download the game and buy the "Starter Packs" that you can find for about 30â¬/$/pounds, it also comes with 2 figurines related to this set and unlocks the part of the game related to that set. For example I bought the Force Awakens playset which comes with the Rey and Finn figurines and unlocks that campaign.\n\nMy reasoning is that each figurine is 15â¬, for me it's pretty cheap and the figurines are well made, big enough to be seen but not so much to be annoying to transport. They seem also child-proof (pretty tough). I basically bought the figurines and in my point of view, the game that came along was for free. As such I was mostly interested in collecting them and the game was a bonus. Note that you have a web code in each playset/figurine that allows you to unlock it for your Disney account in the game. Once done, you can then play the full campaign of that playset and save your progress.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's actually pretty good, it reminds me of the LEGO games minus the humoristic touch but better looking and IMO better gameplay. It's definitely made for kids so don't expect a KOTOR plot or dialogs but for fans of Star Wars it's pretty neat. Can't say about the other campaigns but I'd guess it's as good.\nAlso note a few things: you can unlock characters in a campaign that don't belong there, for example the Force Awakens campaign starts with Finn or Rey or Poe, but later on you can unlock other characters like Kylo Ren, Obi Wan, Yoda etc... So you can always play your fav characters at some point in the game.\nAlso note there is a "build" area in the game where you can pretty much design levels. I didn't dig much into it at all but I will once I finish the campaigns. It's nice there you can play any character you want.\n\nIn the end I recommend the figurines, if you're looking at them for a collecting/goodies point of view, go for it, they're pretty decent and the game comes as a bonus and isn't half bad.\nNow if you're looking for a transcendant Star Wars gaming experience, I'd say move along, probable not for you. Also if you're reluctant to spend money in the game (or figurines) then forget it, it's not a F2P model but more of a demo game and you have to buy it later.\n\nHope it helped! Cheers!","January 4","true","2.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

This might actually be the BEST Star Wars game to date.\n\nKeep in mind, the game is a free to play model. So you'll have to buy some of the characters. At the same time, they do have a free rotation of characters (for example. This week, perhaps Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader might be free, next week, Hans Solo and Finn). The play sets however, are a different story. You have to buy those by themselves as well. The Playsets are stories and levels you can play.  But even if you buy one character and a playset, you actually get a GOOD amount of content. Over 15 hours of gameplay for about $22 (if you buy one play set and one character) and that's actually pretty good considering some games have 10 hours and one character for $59.99 plus tax.\n\nI think something that people don't understand about this game is, the Toybox is free 2 play.

This one changed my mind for the simple reason of having better graphics, better gameplay, and much better setting than past games.\n\nAs far as complaints about dlc, this game is meant to sell the toys.  If u dont have a console version of the game, i wouldnt revommend this version for the simple fact that the playsets are far too expensive.\n\nIf, however, u own the console version and have ur webcodes, then by all means play the hell out of this.  The toy box is much easier to use with a keyboard and mouse, gameplay is smooth, and u dont have to worry about having a bunch of the toys and portal laying around.\n\nIn response to those saying that the codes did not gove them their characters in game, they may not have input the codes directly into the game, but rather on the website.  The only reason i say that is because every single code i have ever put in has given me the correct characters on my account and they were all input from within the game itself.

The main part of the game is a demo, and the story modes are going to be limited to the areas that are set by the demo.  In the process of doing the demo, and linking my Disney account, I unlocked 3 characters and a ship.  This part of the game is limited without micro transations, and is short.\n\nI spent more time in the "toxbox" mode, which those that are familiar with the Toy Story 3 game (or other Disney Infinity games) will be quite familiar with.  You can create and play various scenarios here.  This is the part of the game that has the most replayability, and the part that I would think that my children would greatly enjoy.  Personally I found this to work quite well, and with a connected xbox controller was smooth and fluid.  I went into the theater and played around on one of the "user created" levels (made by Disney to pitch their new Pixar film releasing soon).  There seems to be a lot of variety in the games that can be created, and overall I thought it was a lot of fun, although frustrating at times.  Obviously the content experience will depend on the creator.\n\nI'm not sure how the portal works with gameplay at this point.  For most consoles (with a physical disc for the game) the portal is required and comes with it.  I do not see that the portal is used so far in the Steam version, though.  If it is, it must be optional.","November 21, 2015","true","29.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

When you finish with that (maybe in 18 hours or so) try out the demo for toybox takeover or do daily challenges.

Granted, this is mostly because I already have characters and playsets because I own the console version, but I think that's really the point. This is here for those who already bought the stuff but want to play on PC, and it does it well. The only things I really have to rebuy is my hexdiscs, even then it's cheaper than buying the blind bags and hoping you get what you want.\n\n\nNow I can understand the negitive reviews. Disney Infinity 1.0 for PC gave you a full Toybox adventure and a free character just to get you started. 3.0 doesn't do the same, but instead lets you demo all the Toybox adventures it has to see if you want to buy them. But you're getting the base game itself for free. Consoles can't.\n\nBut out of all the negitive reviews, only a few can be seen as legit\n-Multiplayer is still not in\n-Devs recently abandoned the PC version for an indefinite ammount of time\n\nFor what it is, it's a good game. It's the closest we can get to a LittleBigPlanet type game for PC, and it's great at that. Sure you may have to shift through some trash in the toybox to find good player content, but that goes with any game like it from LittleBigPlanet itself to Super Mario Maker.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fun Sandbox type game\n+ Unlimited user-generated content\n+ Huge cast of characters to play as\n+ Cheaply get the exact hexagon discs you want instead of trying your luck with blind bags\n+ Buying a physical version of a Toybox Adventure and Figure gives you a free digital copy as well as being able to be used on all platforms\n\nCONS:\n- No Multiplayer for PC\n- Not backwards compatable with previous Toybox Adventures\n- Not all characters can be used with all Toybox Adventures, not even as a 100% Completion reward\n- Infinity base not supported, you'll have to buy digital hexagon discs and relevel your own characters\n- Can't pick up where you left off on from other platforms\n- Anything you buy is only for the Steam version of the game\n- Devs have stopped updating the game for the time being\n\nRating 7.5/10\n\nFinal Note: Do not play this unless you already have some adventures and characters.

This game gives you NO charactes, other than 4(at first) weekly free characters, then after a while, you get up to 6. You can only play one level over and over without buying the content packs.\n\nThat looks like a bad review, but it really isn't. This game is amazing for all ages. It's replayability value is extremely high, the Star Wars characters feel Authentic, as do all the rest.\n\nIt would be nice to see some characters from the Disney games such as Kingdom Hearts and stuff.

I've had my doubts before diving into this Infinity thing especially after reading all the negative reviews here on Steam, but still wanted to try Star Wars play sets since I see myself as a huge fan. I decided to give it a shot and downloaded the base game which is free and only includes demo chapters and characters. Then I bought The Force Awakens play set (much cheaper in contrast to its' Disney Store or console counterparts) and I see that I've made the correct choice buying this pack. If you are a fan of Star Wars or any franchises that came with DLCs I don't think you'll be disappointed. Graphics are -as expected- very Disney-like, that is both appealing and cute. Gameplay is simple yet very fun accompanied by many side quests and mini games. Also, let's not forget that TFA play set is (so far) the only official game about the new episode. And I've yet to play the famous Toy Box mode.","December 24, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can install it for free and play a little,  Compared to the console versions that huge.  The DLC for the PC version is also much cheaper than most of the console addons (come with plastic figures and such that I have seen break and you should try not to lose).  In general pricing wise I give this game a thumbs up compared to the console version.  So the FREE TO PLAY aspect and DLC PAY TO PLAY features  are resonoble.\n\nOnce in the game it's okay and seems to work fairly well.  I have run into a few bugs here and there but support has been good with most of these.\n\nNow for the reason it gets a BIG thumbs down from me.   2.0 apparently had multiplayer support.  The console versions have split screen.  3.0 seems to have replaced 2.0 (I can't find it anywhere) and DOES NOT HAVE MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT yet.   The website and support said November and then I emailed support and they said there was actually no ETA on that feature for the PC.  This seem a rather big missing feature for a game that does a lot with community content and multiplay maps.   I hope I can get a refund of my purchase so I can get a game I can play with my daughter.","December 13, 2015","false","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Not only that, but now they have abandoned doing anything with this game for the computer, and have essentially told us "up yours" by dropping all future updates and support for this game, because people aren't going to impulse buy this game; which is probably worth 2 or 3 weeks salary, for a moderate household.","May 31","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SX_panda/recommended/361640/","SX_panda","Stone Cold Dwayne Johnson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SX_panda/","372 products in account","There are more than just a few limits in this game. First of all, there is the limited content. There are about 6 demos in this free version of the game, and each of them end before things get exciting (they are also very short). Secondly, you have limited character control. Everything about the way the game plays seems clunky, awkward and generally just not enjoyable. Sometimes hitting the attack button will cause characters to jump to nearby enemies and decimate them, other times the characters just punch the air while enemies shoot at you from 3 feet away. The camera controls are just horrendous. It takes 5-10 seconds to reposition the camera to where you want it to be due to incredibly slow camera movement and no dynamic camera positioning (something that Super Mario 64 managed 18 years ago). Finally, there is limited room for exploration since levels are incredibly linear, and they are constantly being interrupted by short cutscenes and tutorial tips (despite asking to skip the tutorial).\n\nIf you ignore the fact that the majority of the content is locked behind ridiculously overpriced paywalls this game is decent. It has a nice (albeit dated) visual style, a great cast of characters, and the gameplay isn't awful. It's not good, but not awful. However, unless you want to spend Â£100+ for a decent game when there are plenty of great family games out there for a quarter or less of the price (e.g. LEGO Star Wars), I cannot recommend it.","December 6, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(solutions below)\n\n\nI originally bought this for myself as well as my son (4 yrs old at the time of this writing). At only a few hours in, there are a few things that keep coming up:\n1)You need to pay (and keep paying) for content as it's quickly played through.\n2)The content is priced at a level that would rival single-title purchases. Why would you buy AAA-priced content for a simplified experience?\n3)Minecraft was easier for my 4 year old to get into and play. (cheaper too!)\n\nPros:\n+Good Array of characters, features and attributes.\n+Most content is geared towards 5 year olds and up. My 4 year old is alright at controlling the characters and somewhat effective at fighting.\n+Maps and environments are interesting and well throught out (though small and restrictive to help the young ones not get too lost.\n\nCons:\n-The editor has a rather awkward interface to use when making your own content. (Could have used better radial menus or a design palette.\n-You have to pay to get the pieces to make your own content interesting.\n-No Multiplayer or co-op.\n-No way to remap keyboard controls (the current keyboard layout isn't intuitive and could be simplified for its target audience (Y7 +/- 5 yrs).\n-The catchphrase is "Play without limits!" but the product is defined by it's limitations:\n1)Paywalls for good content (good reason, but the price is huge)\n2)The engine is simple and doesn't push the limits on graphics\n3)The content is very quick to play through.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThough it has a lot of promise and interesting  and enticing content possibilities, the game is still too pricy for what you get.\n\nI think this could easily be solved by:\n1) first lowering the price for content\n2) buy content for the year and you get everything for that year\n3) retain the ability to buy individual pieces of content\n4) when people create content that people use, they can get credits for it that they can use to buy more content (possibly already implemented. I didn't get that far.)\n5) If you buy DLC, give discounts on other DLC (either bought at the same time and you get a higher discount, or bought later at a reduced discount).\n6) Go multiplayer! Sharing the toysets with your friends is by far the most fun thing you can do with what Disney's already created! Play with your friends. (Invite-only multiplayer won't require game host servers, and it will make online interactions easier to control (parents know who they're interacting with.))\n7) Go MMO! - Make Disney Infinity THE place to be online! The engine is already there, now just put together the server infrastructure, and you'll have a virtual amusement park where everyone can hang out. (Granted, online interactions may not be suitable for all ages, but the kiddies have to get used to interacting online responsibly and accountably.)\n\nMonetization in gaming is a very tough to balance and a very hard problem to solve in a way that many people like. I don't propose to know what works for everyone. I respect the content creators, the artists, programmers and musicians that helped put this all together. I so much want to like this game (for my son and also for me). Please leave more reviews and comments to help the devs and the company make this title better for everyone.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 27, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerranUp16/recommended/361640/","TerranUp16","TerranUp16","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerranUp16/","195 products in account","The important take-away for the PC version is that it is better in every possible way than the console versions... except for its current lack of co-op of any kind. Lack of that feature is killer, but hopefully the developers provide an update to fix that.\n\nSo everything except co-op... Running on even a budget gaming PC, the game feels so much better than it does on any console. Smooth 60fps @1080p with maximum settings was easily achieved by my GTX 750 Ti and it greatly improves the feel of the game for having done so. While not a major surprise, compared to the Wii U it is absolutely night and day, and it's similarly ahead of the newer platforms.\n\nSince this is singleplayer-only right now, the feel of the mouse/keyboard setup can take center stage a little better, and that feel is excellent. Star Wars in particular benefits tremendously from the precision of the mouse/keyboard setup, and Ninja Theory's combat system feels more coherent with it as well because mouse-targeting allows more natural combo chaining. My only complaint with these controls is the lack of a quickly-accessible in-game key map guide as while everything works well with the default mappings, they are not always obvious.\n\nThe other important aspect of the PC version is how well it works with the purchaseable characters. Which is just fine, perhaps even better than the consoles in many ways. It tends to be much more convenient to load the characters onto your Disney account with a code and to select them from in-game menus than it does to fetch the physical characters and shift them around on the power matt. And of couse you have the flexibility to buy the toy characters to have them for display purposes if you want or to save some money and buy the digital unlocks instead.","January 18","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And coming from a Disney game you should already know that. The free content is just a demo, and there are also timed free characters. But if you want to play a free game go play Dota or TF2...\nThis game is FOR KIDS. It has a lot of grinding of simple tasks like collecting items, or destroying objects. Gameplay similar to a LEGO game.\nThe content is overpriced on Steam. But I just went on ebay and got 3 play sets and 6 more characters for about $20. So only the steam DLC is overpriced, but you can get the same content from other sources for a much lower price.\nProsDecent gameplay. It's a slightly more complex than a hack-n-slash but still simple enough so that kids can play it on their own.\nGood variety of characters with skill trees.\nGood voice acting and cutscenes, kids love it.\nConsLots of padded content, it looks like you are playing an MMO.\nThere are only 3 play sets on the PC, and 2 of them are Star Wars related.

Yes, I have bought the console version of this game, which is what you're supposed to do. This game is more of a freebie with the console version. You don't pay the full console version/Starter pack price, you don't get the full game. Simple. Are you expecting a full game like this for completely free?\n\nNow on to the actual game. CONS: only get this if you have a good PC, because if you can't really run this, there's no graphical options to turn down modelquality, texture quality, etc. etc. You can't use controllers, or if you can you can't change any control schemes. The pros? VERY Fun game, Cool-â¥â¥â¥ figures, fun campaign modes, great graphics (provided you can run this game well enough to see them), and overall just a fun time. If you have the console starter pack, use the webcode included and get this game.

The Infinity system starts a demo introducing you to the Toy Box, and there are demos of characters to play, but you unlock characters by purchasing an Infinity Model at someplace like Wal Mart, or buy a DLC. Technically, it's not free to play since you have to buy the characters or play sets, but the Disney Infinity 3.0 SYSTEM is free to download - ergo free to play.\n\nWe didn't discover that you actually don't need a game console to use Disney Infinity until we bought a PS4, so you don't need a gaming console, just a model and steam account (or probably some other gaming portal that's participating). We also discovered that you can't share characters on Steam like you can on the game console, so that's one drawback. Otherwise, the system is fun, if not really easy to understand about what's a time limit demo character vs. one you buy the figurine for.\n\nWe suggest that you download Infinity from Steam and buy a playset from a retailer instead of buying a digital download because the models are universal on all consoles, plus you get the one time redeemable code for online (that you can use in Steam or elsewhere presumably).\n\nOne last thing, it's doubtful this is a true single player platform because Infinity has multi-player options, although we've not explored the process for joining lan or online multi-player.","November 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

She spent hours just lost in them, and I enjoyed playing with her, So when this popped up, we jumped all over it. We knew we would have to pay, but given that we didn't have to buy a 64.99 starter pack, then an extra 34.99 for the Inside Out play set, made our day. She never played with the toys once we bought them anyway,  So we instantly grabbed Inside Out for 19.99 and off she went. All smiles, and happy.\n\nIt's a good game, it's a fun platformer for her, and production values are pretty high. If they can offer more options for the pc crowd, because there are a few frame problems, everything will work out dandy.\n\nThe problem with a game like this is it is advertised as free to play. It's not, I don't care if you get to try the first level whatever, that makes it a demo. PC gamers have gotten the short end of the stick for years, from shoddy ports, missing features, and well just things not coming at all. So a lot of PC guys do have a very negative opinion of console type practices, and believe me this is a very console type game, with a mobile game model. The silver lining here and the reason I am not taking a massive dump on this is that I can pick and choose what I am getting for my daughter, she doesn't want to play the Clone Wars?

The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise.

You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full!

There are two kinds of each Playset DLC, one includes the Playset & two characters ONLY, and the second includes the Playset, two characters, one of the Toy Box Games and Sparks pack. That is why there are DLCs that cost much, because they contain many thing, a starter pack includes much more than a normal Playset DLC.\n\nCharacters are a basic DLC in this game, but you are NOT supposed to buy them all! You can buy only the ones you want, you don't need to think that because there are a lot of characters DLCs then to get the game as a full game you'll need to buy them all, no! Every player is allowed to purchase any character he wants!\n\nPower Discs can be Customization and Toys I'll say here the same as what I said about the characters, you are NOT supposed to buy them all! In fact, the Power Discs are not as useful as the characters are, Power Discs are more like extras.\n\nToy Box Games are like a mini-Playset. The first one, Toy Box Speedway DLC unlocks a racing game with tracks & cars and is recommended to Mario Kart or Sonic Racing players. Again, it is not a must.\nThe second DLC is a mix of a Playset + Toy Box + The Daily Challenge, it's a story about the Disney characters which happens in the Toy Box and it's being played as the Daily Challenge is, only Toy Box Takeover has bosses. And Again, it is not a must.\n\nSparks Packs gives you an in-game currency, which can be used to buy toys in the Toys Store or you can buy Costumes for characters you've bought, more Team Ups or more Battle Helps. Purchasing the Sparks Packs DLCs is not the only way to get Sparkes, you can earn them while you play in any mode, so these DLCs are only if there's something you want in that instant.\n\nGameplay(Gameplay of the Free to Play version)\n\nGameplay is amazing, you can beat, shoot, race, build, fly, ride and basiclly anything on this Free to Play version, you even get to play in each Playsets' first level! And you get a weekly ever-changing three characters + 2 characters bonus.\nAnother thing which is free is the Daily Challenge mode. On that mode you're able to play with any character you want fighting against enemies and a boss on every day! Only this itself could be a free to play game.\n\n\nAll in all this game is 10/10 in my opinion, and people should be greatful for Disney Interactive Studios to make a free to play version on Steam, while there was no Steam free to play version for the 2.0 one.\n\nFor more information check my Guide, currently all the sections are in process, but you should check the Guide from time to time to get more information about this game:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=544177092\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped, any questions, doubts, or anything, feel free to send a friend request and I'll do my best to help you with your problem.\n\n-Zoibator","November 4, 2015","true","186.9"," 25 of 73 people (34%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","34","25","73","4","6"

It's like complaining that Steam is "free", but then makes you pay if you want to play any of the games on the platform other than the demos. Yes, if you want to buy every character and every game, it's going to cost a lot (just like buying every game on Steam would cost a lot).\n\nSo think of this as Disney's Steam. Rather than releasing an Inside Out game, 3 different Star Wars games, a Kart Racing game, etc as separate products, they make them all unlockable content inside of a single interface. I think it's amazing that they continue to make each version available as a free download on PC. To buy the EXACT SAME download of this, with the same content (or lack thereof) included costs $30 on Xbox One. To think of it another way, the Star Wars starter set cost $60 for consoles. On Steam, you just need to buy the playset in store for $30 instead. You still get the physical characters etc, and you can play every single level and feature on your PC that you'd have to pay twice as much for on the console.\n\nFor someone who already plays the console version, and may have multiple playsets, characters, etc, it means they con use them all on PC now for zero cost. Can you imagine if you bought any other console game, and the developer said "hey, you can run it on your PC and iPad too for free"? That would be a great feature. And, in this case, it IS a great feature, and one we're lucky to have.","November 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","23","0","0"

If you don't log in you can't play (no offline mode which kinda sucks, but I am always online anyway so it doesn't really matter)\n\nThey have demos (general the first "level" or mission)  of all the standalone modes, which I think the folks here are having issues with as they think that is all this "Free to Play" (not to be confused with "Free").\n\nOn the console version you have to buy those Play Set packs and Toy Box games (they do not show up on console if you don't put them on the reader. I assume they are always in the menu here cause this version doesn't use the toys.\n\nWhat I recommend is you go through the Toy Box Hub (Under "Build" on the main menu) this is 100% free and there is a lot of gameplay there. When you have had your fill of that access the "Community Content" I think it is either on the main menu or the "Build" option.\n\nThis is IMO the best part of the game. These are all of the User and Disney created Toy Boxes (100's maybe 1000's to access) Some are better then others of course, but they have a rating system and a top downloaded and all that jazz to filter out the good ones.  Some of the community content makes you use a specific character, so if you don't own it or it's not on trial you might have to skip it unless you want to buy a character.\n\nYou can literally never run out of free content on this game if you just poke around all the options and not get caught up on the Play Sets (which you have to buy in the real world and don't get the demo to try it out on console, you have to spend $34 in retail and have no idea what you have until you start playing. I actually like the demo modes as I have found I kind of like Inside out and would never have tried it without the demo. (Not sure I will buy it any way though)\n\nHonestly I say give it a shot. This game DOES NOT make you buy anything, and I don't think they expect anyone to buy everything. This game is about options not grubbing money. Most people that play it have already bought the physical products, so I assume that is who the game has been made for and they are not spending money in this game.","November 2, 2015","true","2.1"," 19 of 61 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","19","61","4","0"

Still recomend, especially if you are a fan of the previous versions on console.\n\nPros:\n-Toy Box mode accessable with items to purchase with in-game digital currency available as unlockables\n-Physical figures are unlockable with card codes so no need to repurchase\n-Trial characters let you play characters before you buy\n-DLC options are less expensive than real world toys\n\nCons:\n-High cost of DLC\n-Limited graphics options and optimization makes this game run pretty poorly on an average machine\n-Menus are pretty hard to navigate to get to any actual content\n-It says full controller support but there does not seem to be an option for it anywhere.\n\nLong windedness:\nThere are a lot of reviews calling this a demo and noting the high DLC prices. First, I'd like to point out that the Toy Box mode, a creative platform for building and playing with features of Disney Infinity is available after the roughly 10 minute introductive gameplay and cinematic sequence which everyone is calling the Demo.  You have to choose the "build" option from the main menu and there is even a bit of directed game play if you choose the toy box guide world. You have access to many of the "toys" from the last two games without purchasing with in-game currency. You could spend quite a while creating and sharing worlds in the Toy box without having to spend a cent.\n\nI will agree that the prices for the additional content is still too high, but, as I had hoped, they are less expensive than buying the physical figures. I would argue that since you don't get any actual figurines and instead get access to a portion of code, the prices need to be a lot lower. I can see, however, how they would not want to completely lose demand for the actual toys by undercutting them too much. Overall, I think making a digital version of the additional content is a step in the right direction when the only way to get some of the older figures and discs is to pay a collector's premium on ebay. There is definitely some magic lost without the portal and toys, but I am happy to see at least one Toys-to-Life game letting older content be purchased as digital. The good news is that with some digging around in the menus, you can redeem the code on the included cards with the playsets and figures to unlock characters and discs already purchased. This was great news for me since I own the previous two games on console and didn't want to pay a second time just to get a digital copy of something I already paid for.","November 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 24 of 73 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","24","73","3","1"

Let me explain. Disney Infinity is a platform that allows you to purchase "play sets"... games made by disney with story specific themes. The platform also allows players to use the huge amount of content in the game to make their own adventures (hense the INFINITY name). This "Toy Box" allows you to lay out levels, create NPCs, spawn monsters, and create all sorts of logic/triggers that allow you to organize all of this into an actual story to be played out. This is, by far, the most intuitive part of the game... allowing up to 4 players to design a quest together AT THE SAME TIME.\n\nSo... let's discuss what you get for FREE, What's a DEMO, and what you actually have to pay for:\n\nFree:\nAccess to all player made content from the Toybox (Community Content).\nAbility to build using the toybox (can not save).\nSeveral randomly selected characters to play as.\nRandom Daily quest\n\n\nDemo:\nFirst level of each currently available Play Sets\nintro area for the Toybox Play Sets (not the same as player made toybox creations)\n\nDLC:\nDisney made Play Sets\nAll additional character/vehicle content\nDisney made Toy Box Play Sets\nFull Toy Box building suite (access to assets, saving, and submitting to disney)\nPremium Toy Box\n\n\nSo... to summarize, the Disney Infinity platform is a design framework that lets people create their own missions using a wide variety of art and logic tools. Accessing this content is FREE for everyone. Then there is content made my Disney, which you can demo, and purchase if you want to.\n\nIn all reality, there is far more content in the "Community Content" portion of the game than there is in all of the DLC combined... and if you decide you want to get into the the Disney made stuff, you can pay for it.\n\nThe only real flaw I see here is that Disney makes players pay ($10 or included in any Play Set) to have full access to the Toy Box. This means that people who want to create content for the game have to pay to do so, while people who want to play the content made by other players can do it for free. Seems to me that Disney should not be charging people to develop content for their games... but there's enough people out there that have no issue with this, so there's a bounty of playable content out there... and always more being made.","November 6, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","22","0","0"

You can demo each storyline option and each week different characters are freely available to play as. You can create your own levels and freely access TONS of user created content, some of the user content is equivalent to standalone game addons! Think in terms of Little Big Planet and being able to explore the many varied worlds that users create.\n\nThis is a free to play game, by now we should all know what free to play really means--paid DLC options are to be expected. Looking at the reviews you'd think it was the first time people had come across a "free" to play game.\n\n\nThe developers posted a great summary of what is available for free, it may get berried or missed so I'll include that here:\n"Free players have complete access to the following -\nâ¢	Daily Challenge mode (Found under the âPlay" option in the main menu) - Once a day you can try to defeat Syndromeâs Hero Destroyer (A 3 level dungeon crawler experience with a boss battle at the end). If you win depending on the difficulty you have a chance at winning sparks (our in game currency) or digital content (hex discs and characters).\n\nâ¢	Rotating Trial Characters (Trial characters have a stop watch icon and are found under the âCharacters" tab of the "My Collection" option in the main menu) â Every week you will get a new group of trial characters that you can try out for free. You start with 3 trial characters and can unlock up to 5 by completing quests in the new quest system unique to the PC game.\n\nâ¢	User and Disney Created Toy Boxes (Found under "Disneyâs Toy Boxes" in the "Community Contentâ option in the main menu) â Free players have access to 100âs of user and Disney created Toy Boxes some of the best are full on stand alone games inside the Toy Box.\n\nâ¢	Toy Box Hub (Found under the âBuildâ option in the main menu) â A launch-and-play destination that offers tutorials and access to games based around genre themes such as platforming, racing and farming.\n\nWe offer demos of all the different stand alone game modes. This means that you can play the first level of all Disney Infinity 3.0 Play Sets, Toy Box Games and Toy Box Builder Mode, giving you the option to try them out before you buy them, which unique to the PC version of Disney Infinity 3.0.\n\nIf you have already purchased any physical product that you use on your console you can use a web code and any supported web codes will pull in that content to the digital platform. That means all of your characters(1.0, 2.0, and 3.0) 3.0 Play Sets and Toy Box games will be available to be played on Steam with no extra cost.\n\nAll DLC is considered extra content and is not needed to complete all Steam achievements. We want to offer everyone the chance to play in the worlds that they love with the characters they love, and you can choose what extra content you want (if any). Hopefully this helps to clear up any confusion on what Disney Infinity 3.0 offers for all players. Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoy the game."","November 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 36 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","7","36","0","0"

Primarily, this game was designed for console use since you have the base portal where you can place your physical figures onto.  The PC version?  Doesn't use either of those so in order to get playsets or characters you need to purchase them digitally via their in-game store or over Steam itself.  That's where people go nuts over it.  What people don't realize though is that you can acquire what you need to play the game elsewhere.\n\nWant the Twilight of the Republic playset but don't want to spend $40?  That's okay.  Find a code on ebay and spend $2 (Rise Against the Empire and Inside Out are also about $4 each).  Yes, it sounds a little scummy but if you're somebody that is very disappointed with the pricing of the game's DLC, then ebay is the best way to go.  For under $50, you can buy quite a lot of playsets and characters which is almost like buying a new game.  The people who buy the physical items for the console versions are more than likely the ones selling those codes for the PC version, so Disney Infinity 3.0 (and other versions) is already being supported.\n\nThat being said, I've spent very little money on this game so far and have been enjoying it quite a lot.  Combat for the 3.0 characters (I've only tried out Star Wars ones) is VERY different from previous entries.  Our Jedi friends play more like they belong in an action game, making combat feel more complicated than 2.0's (I haven't tried 1.0) simple button mashing.  From what I can tell, playing as Anakin in Twilight of the Republic, combat felt very similar to combat in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed mixed with a little bit of Kingdom Hearts and for me, that is very fun.   If that's the gameplay you enjoy, then this is right up your alley.\n\nDo yourself a favor and do a bit of research about this game, find other places where you can get the DLC (ebay being the recommendation), and give this game a try when you unlock more of the main content.  You'll find that you might enjoy the game more that way if you get over the biggest hurdle keeping you away from it.  If you're a collector and just want the figures, I recommend buying the physical ones and using the digital codes for the PC version.","November 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 38 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","7","38","2","0"

This is basically Disney's version of Skylanders. We all knew what it was. If you don't want that, then don't buy or play this game.\n\nFirst, the game needs at least one patch to fix the stupid intro forcing you to watch every time you play. It doesn't seem like game saving is working right. That could be a deal breaker for some people.\n\nSecond, the game is built around the toy model still, but it does have some packs of characters and play sets you can buy if you're into that. Also, if you bought any characters or sets for the console versions of the game, you can use the web codes to activate them on here without paying anything extra. Also, the sets, packs, characters, etc. all cost less than half of the physical items so if you want a character but don't care about the figure you can save some money buying it from Steam. It seems pointless to complain about this. The toy model is literally what this game is and you should know whether you are into that or not before you even try it.\n\nThird, the game is fun overall itself. The playsets are entertaining and the characters are fun to play as. The new Star Wars characters were a good addition in my opinion. Also, if you have a Disney Account you can sign in and download other people's toyboxes to play around in. Some people have honestly built some pretty insane things. My kids absolutely love messing around in the game and there really aren't any other games that let you play as most of these characters, sadly.\n\nFinally, to reiterate, know what this game is going into it. You aren't going to enjoy it or like it if you: 1) don't like or care about Disney characters, 2) don't want to spend money on anything, 3) hate the business model of nickle and diming you for everything, or 4) think the game is something it is not. Still, you can enjoy yourself in the game.\n\nIf all you want is a building/creation game then I would recommend Project Spark as someone else mentioned. It's free on Xbox One and Windows 10 Store and lets you build things. However, if you want to play with Disney characters and build Disney themed worlds to play around in and some adventures with some of the characters, then this could be a good option for you. Don't let the negative reviews complaining about only one aspect of the game stop you from playing something you might be willing to pay for.","October 30, 2015","true","21.0"," 31 of 108 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","31","108","5","2"

The gameplay itself is there. I found the game fun to play, driving, fighting, flying, building, it all felt good. However the game itself is very limiting as to what you can do if you do not buy other packs to go with it. On top of that the PC version of the game is super buggy, I have had tons of issues with it so far, like getting stuck in infinite quest loops, falling through the ground infinitely, various freezing events, and even trouble getting the game to run with my resolution.\n\nReally I still recommend the game, its fun playing as all the different characters, its fun building, it really trys to be what it is advertised as. However I feel that the game would be much better on console, as the PC version definitely needs more work in a variety of ways. Aside from bug fixes I feel like they need better pricing for all there microtransactions, or better yet a way to earn the items in game without having to pay for the characters and packs. As cool as that sounds thats a little to free to play for Disney I am afraid. The reason the console versions of the games dont get ripped on for all this micro transactions and DLC nonsense is because most of the time they come with some kind of physical item to use with the game, like a figure or disk type of deal.\n\nOverall I would give the game a thumbs up, but the PC version a thumbs down. Disney Infinity needs work, and it most definitely is NOT "play without limits".","October 31, 2015","true","8.0"," 8 of 51 people (16%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","16","8","51","2","0"

If you use those codes you then get access to content and don't have to buy the game a second time.\n\nNow being a month or two after launch of 3.0 this finally hits steam. They added "DLC" for all content of all the previous Infinity releases. In those games they were never free.\n\nNow sure it would have been nice for them at at least give you a bit of content if they are going to call it free. That said the gameplay of the game itself is fun. A lot of fun actually.  There was a ton of collaboration from many popular game studios to make this game.  I loved 2.0 and the marvel playsets. So far I love the 3.0 Star Wars playsets even more.\n\nThe game has no graphics options. The load times are slow. The game is a pure console port. As was Infinity 2.0. The technical side of things the game can be cleaned up a bit. Give options for PC gamers. However the point of the game is fun, and on that front it delivers quite Successfully.\n\nCan't wait to play the Rebels stuff at some point.\n\nIf the reviews want to give the game an actual review then sure read them. If they are only crying about the DLC down vote them and move on as they aren't real reviews. Disney could have handled this better. Sadly that hasn't been the case.

Infinity has never been a stand alone game. Ever. This is the third one. Still not. I have been a fan of the franchise since the start and love the addition to Star Wars to the stable. It's just plain fun to play. It's not a hardcore game by any means, but that doesn't mean it's not a solid platformer. Plus being able to play Star Wars this way is almost as good as Lego.\n\nNow here's the thing. I buy the toys. I have most of them. I play Infinity on console. With each toy comes a code that unlocks them online (You do so at Disney's site and it keeps your collection across mobile and PC). So for those of us who play on consoles and already have our figures/codes - This is JUST the PC client, thus 'Free'. You can download it from their site without even signing up. At some point it's going to want to link your Disney account to the game and then it unlocks your figures.\n\nSo the problem is listing this as a "Free to play" game. It sets up expectations of something it's really not. It's just the PC Client for those of us who already play, and have invested in, Infinity.\n\nAnd in THAT aspect, this is the best of the three games, easily. It's still a simple LOOKING game and being on PC isn't going to change that. But the gameplay is worth it and it's why I've gladly spent the money on quality figures and a decent platforming game. If the idea of buying the physical figures (or, for some odd reason, the digital versions!?) doesn't sit well with you, you're going to have a bad time.\n","October 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 64 people (19%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","19","12","64","6","5"

Now I can understand that some of the experience is taken away by not letting you play with the physical base or figures, and having you purchase every little character, or playset that's in the game. Basically, when you download the game, you've just "bought" a freemium game. I wish companies would just let us pay the initial price and maybe a few DLCs here or there, instead of letting us download the game for free, and then proceeding to nickel and dime us to death, but that's just me. But the game is really fun, even just with the demos you originally download. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Disney/Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars in a new, reminiscent look.

However if you are aware that this is a game created to be sold in chunks, mainly with action figures. And then realise that the PC version is in fact the cheapest and easiest way to play those chunks, you should should have the right mind set to judge this game.\n\nAnd with that mind set, this game is great! The console version costs $75 for the game, portal and the prequel Star Wars "play set" (read: game) , the one you don't want. The base PC version is FREE and you can buy the Inside Out or Original Star Wars play sets for $35. So for $35 you are getting 2 sweet figures, 2 characters for the game (comes with code for the PC version) and a great game to play alone or even better with your kids. Or just buy the digital packs for $20, or shop around for people with codes to sell.\n\nAnd as an added bonus you don't need to swap the figures on the portal on the PC version. And if you don't care about the figures you can get the codes cheaper!\n\nI really wanted to play the Original Star Wars set but did not want to pay over $100 to do so, which is what I would have had to do on PS4. But now with the PC version, I paid $35 (for the play set) and am also playing a superior version running at 60fps!\n\nThe play set games are MUCH better than the 2.0 ones, and you can also buy a kart racing game and other "toy box" adventure game that uses any characters from Star Wars, Disney or Marvel!\n\nNot to mention the SUPERB toy box mode that allows you to build and share your own levels or play tons of other user created levels!\n\nPeople judging this as a regular free to play game built on micro transactions (like Marvel Heroes for example) are missing the point. This "free" game is just a method of delivering a unified platform to sell you other games that use the toys to life figures the games were built for.\n\nNOTE: Two bugs NEED fixing right now. It tries to make you play the intro every time (you can quit out eventualy but it takes ages to load and you have to watch the start).

I'm not sure why it's listed as free to play, but I suppose it's the closes that Steam can come to representing the toys-to-life genre when there are no toys to purchase. However, for those looking to get in on this content, this is really not a bad way to achieve it, especially if you don't want the clutter of all of those figures, or the added cost of producing them.\n\nInfinity 3.0 starts you off with a trailer of sorts, with parts of it that are playable, before the control is taken out of your hands and you're whisked onto the next part of the franchise they want to show you. A lot of the negative reviews I'm seeing point out that this trailer seemed aimed at selling the various content packs, and it is. However, it sounds like a lot of players stopped there, when Disney provides more to do before you have to purchase anything. Once the playable trailer ends, you're dumped into Infinity's main interface. From there, you can go into the Play menu, select a playset, and play through an entire mission for each of them. In my opinion, this was the perfect amount of gameplay I needed to determine whether a playset was worth purchasing.\n\nSo what about the playsets, are they worth it? When you compare the cost of the console counterparts for these same playsets, it certainly seems so. They physical console counterpart for the Rise Against the Empire play set, for instance, is $35. In digital-only form for the Steam version, it's $20, a significant savings. I believe those looking to own the figures can still buy them and redeem a code to use them in the PC version of Infinity, but don't quote me on that.\n\nPC players get a bonus of not being forced to buy the base or physical figures to enjoy what Infinity has to offer, and at an appropriate discount. Whether or not the game content is worth purchasing depends on the style of game you enjoy. I found the content provided for free to be just as much fun as any of the fantastic Lego games available for the PC, and there's the added bonus of playing in the toybox with the characters you buy after the campaign is done.","November 1, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 59 people (17%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","17","10","59","3","0"

As an alternative for those that are completely uninterested in purchasing the physical 'Toys', the PC/mobile game offers you the ability to purchase any toy or playset you desire, at a discounted rate from the physical ones.\n\nThe general gist of the Toys-to-Life genre is to put the figures you own, on a base connected to the consumers console platform of choice (Wii U/ PS3/ PS4/ X360/ Xbox One), and see their characters come to life on their television screen. That is lost in the PC/Mobile version of this game.\n\nThat being said, it definitely isn't a game for everyone. It has decent platforming and combat, and a decent set of creator tools to create your own areas to play around in. If you aren't into building your own levels, or don't feel like springing for a playset or two, you'll find yourself very limited in what you can do. But if you try the included demos for the playsets, and find that you enjoy it, you'll find a fun game.","October 30, 2015","true","0.9"," 33 of 120 people (28%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","28","33","120","5","1"

You are basically just downloading a hub with a few demo's, the base game to which you will gradually add content.\n\nNow, this content takes various forms. There are 3 major Packs for Infinity 3.0. 2 are Star Wars related. Both are $39.99. Then there is the Inside Out pack which is a puzzle platformer I believe. Each of these is a game in it's own right. Do not view it as DLC. I have purchased "Twilight of the Republic" pack and it's a fantastic action platformer. This could easily be released as a stand alone game and be worth the price. You also get a couple of characters with which to play the game and toybox access. It really is worth every penny of the 39.99. Even if you only buy one of these packs and nothing else you will have a blast in the story and toybox modes.\n\nOk, lets get onto the characters. In my opinion avoid the character DLC's. Go buy the figures. The figures aren't too expensive and are great quality and make a fantastic collectable, worth the price just for this reason alone. Each figure comes with a code. You just enter the code and the character is playable ingame. Also you can still use that figure on any of the console versions of infinity, via the base.\n\nThere are also other various unlocks for Toybox mode, racing etc. I cannot comment on these as I have yet to try them.\n\nI do think the hex packs are a blatant money grab, my opinion, you don't need these and are not forced to buy them.\n\nLike i said, you could easily just buy a single pack for 39.99 and get a huge game with lots to do. You can even buy the boxed packs for the console version and use the unlock codes for PC and the figures/base on console. 2 for the price on 1. Everything else is purely optional, you don't need to buy them. It's designed to be a kind of hobby, collecting figures and playing them in game.\n","November 1, 2015","true","112.8"," 3 of 41 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","3","41","0","0"

I enjoyed it. (ofc 13 hours is a lot. I did quite a few other things biside like chatting) But that's something I like about that game. I can play on my own style and in my own speed.\n\nFor all the people complaining about the DLC price and that the free to play version isn't free. That's just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I paid 4 Euro so far for 1 Hero because I wanted to play as Iron Man and it was worth it. Yes, all the heros toghter are quite expansive but you don't need all. If you buy like 4 or 5 + the Toy Box for 10 Euro you have all what you need.  for about 30 Euros.\nPlay Sets are just intresting if you want the heroes as bundle with a pre build world with some quests in it and some content for the free build mode.\n\nBut the game itself is the building stuff. That's what makes it so great. Sandbox without limits for 10 Euro.  + heroes if you want some special heroes.  And that's worth it pretty much.\n\nThe Free 2 Play version offers you different game modes. Ofc. not a lot of content but it's enough to get a idea of the game and if you want to have some special things from starwars, buy starwars stuff. If you want Marvel, buy Marvel stuff. You know? You can take the stuff you want. I f.e. don't want Disney characters and playsets and I would feel bad paying 60 bucks to get all the play sets and won't play disney stuff.  I will buy the Toy Box for 10 Euro now and mess around with my own world.  And next week after some patches (hopefully) I will buy a starwars play set for 15 euro.\n\nFeel free to add me and we can build some stuff together once the multiplayer is working again. :)\n\n\nEDIT: I add this now because I've noticed that there are a lot of people that don't understand the system Disney offered here. They rated "my personal" review as negative. (rating a positive review negative is either because of jealousy or stupidity.)\n\nWhat do you guys expect from a FREE 2 PLAY game?  Free 2 Play Content for 1000 hours of Game play?  I don't think so. If you do, you are stupid and should sell your PC / Console / Smartphone.\n\nThis Game is "Free 2 Play" because it have to be free 2 play. Otherwise you can't sell Content on steam. If they tag it as "Demo" they couldn't sell Content.  Blame steam because they do not offer a way to say "Free but strong limited Content as base platform for a a la card system"  Because that's what it is.\nThis free versions is supposed to give you an idea of what you can do. And it shows you content you "can" buy. That's good because you don't want to buy stuff you don't like. Just try some stuff in the tutorial and go to the store to buy the stuff you like.  ToyBox + ToyBox Take over + Starwars Playset including 2 heroes is with 35 still cheaper than other games. buy 3 extra heroes and you are at 50 bucks.  50 Bucks is a normal game. And you got way more content. The interesting point is the possibility you have with all that ToyBox content. Again: It is a BUILDING game. All the missions and quests keep you busy for about 5-10 hours. The rest is BUILDING. The ToyBox is where you want to go after all. This game is not a Campaign and not a story. It is about building OWN campaign and story's. And to do this you need to pay about 35 Euro. You don't want Takeover beat em up stuff for 11 Euro? Don't buy it.  You want racing stuff for 11 Euro? Buy it!  You want both? okay. Buy both and you pay 17 Euro for both.","November 1, 2015","true","157.6"," 10 of 60 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","10","60","2","11"

It has it's flaws, but nothing game-breaking. I didn't start playing DI until 2.0. At first, I thought it was more for children aswell, but it definitely is just as good for adults (including myself).\n\nThe best feature is clearly building your own Toy Box/Level. What I "dislike" the most about it is that I usually reach the level-limit before I'm finished, since I like to add as much as possible.\n\nIt's best to ignore people complaining about the price for DLCs.

This is a game where they give you a framework, and from there, you need to purchase games and characters.\n\nNow this is free to start playing where if you are on the Xbox / PS / Wii Platform, you have to purchase it. And with that purchase you get a plate, 2 characters, and a game.\n\nSo you if you want to play a game you still need to buy a game and to use a character, you still need to buy a character.  That stinks, but that is their model.  On the positive side, if you already have the Disney Infinity for your platform, characters come with web-activation cards, and you can use those codes to use them within this game. So this means if I buy the Chewbacca character, I can play it on my platform with the little plastic character, and here in Steam if I enter the code.\n\nNow not 100% sure if the games have activation cards, will have to dig in my kids box of stuff and see if the games can be activated.  Also not sure if I take the plate and connect it to my computer will it allow me to use the plastic characters in steam.\n\nIs is it a great deal no, is it a horrible deal, also no because if you want *ALL* the characters, you have to buy them. So no free lunch.\n\nWhere you can make out is if there are sales when the physical characters are less than the general $13, then you can make out.  Also Inside the game, you can usually purchase 5 virtual characters for about $17, so just requires a little planning.\n\n..no let me go look for those other cards my kids so carelessly disregarded...","February 3","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does this mean you shouldn't get the game? Absolutely not! The game is very fun and cute, and an absolute blast for Disney/Marvel/Star Wars fans (I fit in all three, so you'll understand my enthusiasm). It is clearly designed by people who very much love the source materials.\n\nSo yes, you will have to pay for the playsets if you want to play this game, otherwise you won't have much to do at all. Yes, those playsets are a bit overpriced considering they are completely digital, especially if you are buying individual characters. But bear in mind, buying one playset gives you access to a whole new story, which will grant you a fair length of fun (especially if you explore and do the sidequests).\nAnd then of course, there is the toy box, in which you are free to put things together and let out your creativity as much as you want. I have spent hours customizing my home and I loved every bit of it.\nOh and don't forget that you can also buy the physical sets and use the codes on it--that way you get to keep the cool figures, and play with the characters in the game.\n\nIn other words, despite its flaws (I didn't mention it, but the port just cut out multiplayer functions, and there are some bugs here and there), I really enjoy this game, and I definitely recommend you try it as well--maybe give it a go on a console first, if you can.","January 11","true","67.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Me and my 8 year son enjoys it..\n\nOnly problem I downloaded Disney version on day 1 and played that, couple days ago I bought steam DLC Toybox Takeover and Speedway and its not cross compatible and I also lost all my save games suddenly.  My toybox unlockables is also not available in Steam version.\n\nSo my advice is rather use the Disney or Steam version for full enjoyment.  My only option is to carry on with Disney version and by the DLC again via other methods.\n\nHope they can sort out the technical account issues\n\n","January 5","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was utterly impressed when I first got this game (not by the performance though), as I have always wanted as game like this. It's a real blast to play, but only if you have the buck, because otherwise, there isn't much of a game. I'm serious, everything requires money, even 90% of the toy box.\n\n\n\nMoving on, what are it's most prominant, positive features? First of all, there are tons of characters which are true to they're movies, comics, etc.\n\nSecond, the toy box. Players can make anything of they're liking (as long as whatever it's not too complex, as this game isn't detailed enough to allow players to make microscopic atoms), players can then upload them to the toy box database for other people to play, or they can just play the many fantastic toy boxes which are already available.\n\nThird, the gameplay. The fighting in this game is excellent, as well as the character animations, though the pc version has a lot of clipped character animations (I could be wrong about this, and it could just be my pc not having enough ram).\n\nThere are many, many more wonderful features which I will not state.\n\n\nNow  the negative parts of the game. First off, the p2p system. Sadly, almost everything in this game is locked, and the only way to unlock them is by purchasing dlcs. Even characters are locked, every single one of them. Sad isn't it?\n\nSecond, there's the less-than-satisfactory pc port. As I stated earlier (it may be just be my pc), there are a lot of character animation clippings, and I only see it on pc, never on consoles. There isn't an edit file, and the videos option which are tweakable in-game are quite impressive, this is all that they provide, SSAO, FXAA, DEPTH OF FIELD, GAMMA, and one more, but it's very insignificant.\n\nThen there's the online play. Only consoles can play co-op, haha, yeah, only consoles, how ironic. But what if you don't like co-op? Maybe you prefer Pvp? or Pve? Well, they don't have that either. The only "online play" that they provide for the pc, is player-created toy boxes which are updated frequently.\n\n\n\n\nThat is all that I am going to cover for this review, there are many more aspects of this game to be talked about, but I'll just leave it here.\n\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but it is very expensive, and unless you're willing to spend some money, you may not have much fun with this game.\n\n\nThank you for reading my review. God bless.","January 16","true","50.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually I would say PC over console, any day! However, this game absolutely sucks on PC version. The Playstation version is great! The PC version is terrible. I'm not even one of the people complaining that things cost money. My boyfriend and I have bought almost all of the playsets and two dozen characters. Again: awesome on the playstation, terrible on the PC. No Hub world?????? Ridiculous. Yes, I pay for playsets but I also love running around the amazing hub world (fighting in halloweentown, racing in tattooine, changin the skies, flying around the disney castly on the green goblin glider) and doing challenges like the Urban Brawler and stuff. All of those aspects are missing from the PC game. (How suspicious that those are the ones you don't have to pay extra for... hmmm) Also sometimes the PC version bugs out and won't let me exit the game unless I CTRL+ALT+DEL and that's just obnoxious. The game won't response to pause or escape. Just annoying. I have literally 24 characters, 8 powerdiscs, and I think all(?) of the playsets, and I am NOT a console gamer... but for once I think I'm going to uninstall the PC version and just stick to the PS4 version.

Wait what?\n\nYes, this is still Disney Infinity - Toys to Life is the whole point! Anyone complaining about the concept clearly didn't do research about what they were buying. The PC game is essentially a tie-in to the console version. You don't NEED a console game, but that's how it's intended. I bought the Xbox 360 base game for 35 bucks (which is the average cost of a playset) and a couple of other figures so I could play them both on PC and my console.\n\nAll Infinity characters and playsets you buy physically come with a code you can redeem on the Disney website, which then adds those characters and playsets permanently to your account so you can play them on PC for no extra fees. Whether you think the figures are worth the 10 bucks they charge is up to you. Personally I love them and get excited whenever I get to buy one! The quality is very high, they have a unique and lovable style, and they look great on a shelf. If you're going to collect Disney figures, you might as well use them for playing, and really, collecting is part of the fun with this game! (unless you don't like collecting things, in which case this is probably not the game for you)\n\nI've played the demo of the Inside Out playset, which I loved, and bought the Rise Against the Empire set with Luke and Leia. This turned out to be the Star Wars game I had been waiting for for years! A little reminiscent of the Lego games with a cute style and gameplay that is simply fun. If you like collecting sparks, jumping around, relatively simple combat, and driving fast vehicles, this is the game for you!\n\nKnow what you're getting and enjoy it. My recommendation is to get the physical version of the game, but it's not necessary. Hope this helped someone!","January 15","true","97.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the 1st thing you need to keep in mind.\n\n2nd I have Downloaded 2.0 starter pack on steam which had 3 character with it. Logging in to 3.0 would not retrieve those character for some reason even though I keep getting the prompt while playing 3.0 to login my Disney account to retrieve my 2.0 characters.\n\n3rd I have this on Android and IOS, tried logging in my account but same thing, no character from 2.0. I purchased a 3.0 character on Android tried logging in IOS... Nothing! Total BS! Login my sons account on IOS and using my Android tried to invite my son to do some multiplayer but it is grayed out... Not sure why that option is there... I even tried using two IOS device same thing both option are grayed out... So in short, NO MULTIPLAYER FOR PC, ANDROID or IOS.\n\n4th PAY! PAY! PAY! The game does not come with a single permanent character. There is a 3 free hero every week as Disney calls it but don't waste ur time on that as you need to level up your characters.\n\nFinally, the game it self has nice graphics and plenty of gameplay option unfortunately to enjoy it you will need to PAY! Want to play with your son or friends or family? FORGET ABOUT IT! so I'm not sure what audience or gamers Disney is after if the most important thing of game such as this is missing... MULTIPLAYER!!!\n\nI WOULD PAY $60 for a full version of this game with split screen local coop that me and my son could have enjoyed... Such a shame... And for all those trying to say that this game is not intended for local coop and such... That is totally BS! Why the F would you want to play all alone in a game such as this???","January 9","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the Game with DEMO verions of everything and has NO need to have a portal.\n\nIn some ways it is actually better than the real game but it fails in multiplayer I believe.\n\nThe game is fun and in this verion there is a mode called Toy box takover. This allows almost any character to play in a multiworld adventure. Thsi is the best mode of the game ive seen yet, thought the star wars set are excellent. if you dont want to buy the toys this is a cheaper option.  I fyou buy any items the code you get with the toys can be enterd into the web store and you keep those bound to your disney account even if you sell the figure..\n\nThis game could have been far great, if i could only have time to speak with a dev.\n\nTHis uses the free to play model of SMITE with a flavor of the month hero to use.","April 6","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the character swaps are done in game via the UI which is my preference. I have purchased all the characters physcially (most on sale or via trades) and used the WebCodes to have them all available via PC. The game can be considered "Free to Play" on PC if you already have WebCode cards for figures or playsets. If not, they you will be required to purchase the characters or playsets via Steam or via the Store in game.\n\nThe game itself is what you would expect from the Infinity series with a new coat of Star Wars paint. I like the updated combat system as things can be more complex than just button mashing (if the user chooses to learn and utilize it). Quests are standard fare, fecth this, destroy x number of baddies or things, etc. There is some story and I find playing the game a relaxing expeirence for my family and I to enjoy.\n\nWith the above being said I have a warning for anyone looking using the most recent round of characters and content on Steam.\n\nBaloo, Judy Hopps, Nick Wilde, Ant-man, Vision, Black Panther, and the Marvel Battlegrounds Playset with Captain America and not supported or available in the PC Version of Infinity 3.0. Apparently Disney is no longer supporting Disney Infinity 3.0 on PC as of March 2016. I found out the hard way after buying all the above so I thought I'd pass this info along.\n\nDisney's lack of future support for Infinity 3.0 has me a bit sour on the game itslef as I really wanted to play with the new characters and especially with the Marvel Battlegrounds playset. I still recommend the game, however, be aware the future charatcers and playsets realesed by Disney will seemeingly not be supported in the PC version as the game continues to release new content.\n\nUPDATE: I have changed my recommendation and No Longer Recommend Disney Infinity based on Disney's announcement today (05/10/2016) in that they are cancelling Disney Infinity for PC and Consoles alike. Disney no longer be supporting the game. They have some additional content already in production (including three new characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass later this May, and the Finding Dory Play Set launching in June). These obviously will not be playable on PC at all but consoles will get to enjoy this new Infinity content when released. In addition to canceling the Infinity series, Disney has also declared they will no longer [publish games and has closed Avalanche Software in Utah. Sad to see this happen, but this is where things stand. Again, I can no longer recommend Disney Infinity as the company has abandoned this game, the software company that created this wonderful game, and has also abandoned its fan-base.","April 15","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the negative reviews are from people who don't know how to use Ebay as a source to make this game great. The things you buy from the toybox is locked UNLESS you have a starter pack. Well guess what? You're in luck. You can literally buy the Twilight of the Republic Starter Pack ($39.99 on Steam) for literally $1.00 on Ebay... YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT!! ONE FREAKING DOLLAR!!!\n\nNow that you guys know the trick... GO BUY IT AND ENJOY THE GAME!\n\n\nEdit: I freaking loved this game but now that they are shutting down this game without PC getting offline so I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING ANY DLC anymore... You'll just be wasting money. It's such a shame because this game has amazing gameplay, but now gone to waste. GG Disney... I'm never buying â¥â¥â¥â¥ from you ever again.","April 25","false","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only can you play in content made by the developers, you can also play load of ToyBoxes that have been made by the community. There are a lot of them that might as well just be a Playset. There is so much that you can do in this that it really is infinite. The reason though that this has such bad reviews is because you have to pay for each character and playset. You can still play the game for free but there is a limited selection of characters that changes each week and limited access to the toybox. If you already have physical toys or only want to buy the digital versions of everything, then this is perfect for you. However, as of right now, they have no plans to continue to update this version even though the console versions will continue to be updated. Personally, I hope this changes soon.","April 15","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
