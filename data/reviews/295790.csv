A simple yes or no for a game does little to explain how strong of a yes or no you're really giving the game.  Butwhen it comes down to it, the bottom line is that I can recommend this game and here's why:\n\nThis is one of those truly unique games that does something new and should be rewarded for the efforts in spite of it's short comings.  I'm not normally a "list" guy, but I think it will suit this review well; so here's a list of pros and cons about this game.\n\nPro:\n* The game has a truly unique story that tells the tale of a traditional Inuit legend.\n* The game's visuals stand out, whether it be the gameplay graphics or the animated story segments in between chapters.\n* You can really get a sense of how much passion the developers put into this project; they really wanted to share their history and culture with people and found a unique way to do it via gaming media.\n* There's the option of playing co-op locally.  I didn't play co-op at all, opting for a single player experience, however, from what I could tell while using the switching mechanic to play solo, the game should work well in co-op and the story pulls you in so that you can really bond and share an experience with whomever you play it with.\n* The unlockable cultural insights vignettes are really well done and enjoyable.  They keep things short and to the point where you're given enough to be interested but left wanting more.\n* As a single player experience, there were some really nicely designed sections that proved to be challenging and rewarding.\n\nCons:\n* Those well done unlockable cultural insights are locked away behind the collectible system in the game.  Most are easy to find and the chapter select menu gives you a count of how many you've found in a chapter.  As I wanted to know more and more about the Inuit and found myself unable to do so until I found more collectibles, I was slightly irritated.\n* There are some really unfair sections of the game as well as some sections where the goal/objective is rather obtuse/unclear.  I had quite a number of deaths I felt were unfair.\n* The game is pretty short... you can probably knock it out in an afternoon, especially if you're playing co-op.  And after you've found all the cultural insights, there's not a lot of replay value here.\n\nSo overall, I give this game a yes, as I believe the experience provided is greater than the sum of it's successes and failures.","November 26, 2014","true","8.2"," 380 of 395 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","380","395","11","9"

I went in the game expecting to play a cute and simple puzzle-platform game with a cute girl and an even cuter arctic fox, but I got away more than that. Through the game, you collect "Culture Insights", which are basically video interviews with the Iñupiat people. And you learn a lot about them, without it being boring. Also, I must point out that I'd probably never pick up a documentary movie about the Iñupiat on my own--this game was a very smart way to bring their own culture to the rest of the world.\n\nGame-wise, it has ups (music, graphics, different abilities between the 2 characters, collectibles, some smart puzzles...) and downs (you'll get frustrated because of controls, or the AI controlling your friend making it die once or twice, some movements failing not because of your skills...), but the overall gaming part is also good.\n\nI'm afraid my review might turn some people away ("I don't wanna have to learn anything while I play games!"), but really, give it a try, it's totally worth it ;) And if you don't wanna watch the video snippets, you don't have to, they're totally optional. But you'll miss on a lot, since the snippets are always related to what's going on in the game and provide a much better gaming experience overall.\n\nSo kudos to this great iniciative.

You guide Nuna and her friend an Arctic Fox in a journey through the Alaskan wilderness.\n\nThe art style is so amazing, with beautiful graphics and lovely drawn characters. The stunning environments possibly make Never Alone one of the most beautiful games out there.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427482654\nIn terms of gameplay, Never Alone is a fairly standard platformer. You'll make Nuna and Fox run and jump across icy gaps and snowy platforms, using each one's unique abilities to journey through environmental mazes along the way. Nuna and Fox have complementary skills. Fox jumps higher and, along with wall-climb ability, can summon the ethereal spirits that help them reach trickier spots. Nuna can push or pull objects and use a throwing weapon called Bola, capable of shattering icy obstacles that block your forward progress.\n\nThe blizzard at the center of the story plays a role in the mechanics as well. In some levels, strong gusts of icy wind blow across the screen at seemingly random intervals, requiring you to hold a button to brace against the ground and avoid being blown backward. Or in other areas, the wind gives Nuna a speed boost, making her able to reach higher or further away platforms that otherwise are unreachable.\n\nYou can choose between playing this alone or with a friend. In single player mode, one player switches between the two. In co-op mode, one player controls Nuna and the other one Fox.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429605594\nMost of the times the controls are responsive, but there are a few spots in which the collision detection doesn't work as it should, causing Nuna to jump into abyss instead of gripping to the walls. On top of that, the spirit platforms that are activated by the fox only exist when it is close to them; if the fox moves away, the platforms fade out of view and cause characters that were once standing on them to fall.\n\nThe game starts at an easy difficulty level - the first few minutes of gameplay are a walk in the snow, or some simple jumps, letting you savour the story. However, the difficulty of the jumps increases as the game progresses. The same goes for the puzzles: some of them require patience, and a lot of trial and error to figure out the correct solution. There's a rough difficulty spike towards the end of the game, where the jumps need to be timed and very precise. However, the game has a lot of checkpoints and in between these checkpoints it autosaves before every jump in order to make it easier for the player to retry them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430145465\nThe game length is around 4-6 hours, depending on your skills; it has low replay value, but for the 4-6 hours you are playing it, you are transported into the Alaskan way of life with the stunningly beautiful graphics as well as the narrator telling the story in his native tongue.\n\nThroughout the 9 chapters, you will encounter several collectibles. Each of them unlocks a short video - a cultural insight featuring people from the Cook Inlet community talking about what it was like to grow up in the region's unforgiving cold.\n\nPlay this masterpiece; it will win your love.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","April 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 136 of 145 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","136","145","0","11"

A small, fireside tale of limited scope but great appeal.\n\nThe gameplay is nice and smooth, and both the co-op and single player - where you'll switch between both controllable characters - are implemented well. The visuals are top notch and for me carried most of the attraction. The tilt-shift depth of field, the muted colour palette, the subtle lighting: they all complement each other well. There's many a wow moment there, even if this is a short experience. If you're looking for extended gameplay, this is not your fix. I completed the game in little over three hours. For me, that's fine. I like it when games don't overstay their welcome, or go for artificial extension.\n\nIf you're looking for challenging, innovative gameplay, or if you're expecting a prolonged experience: this game offers neither. What it does offer is rich and rewarding, but that is mostly by proxy of setting and design aesthetic. And if you like those, you're sure to like the documentary-style bits of film describing the Iñupiaq way of life and this people's cultural heritage. You discover these bits of background in-game. I found all but one in my single play-through without really looking.\n\nIn conclusion: this was a welcome dip in Iñupiaq culture and folklore. If you're interested in that, and don't mind a little puzzle platforming along the way, plunge right in.\n\nI played this game in 1998p on a GTX680 without a single hitch.\nGorgeous views abound![www.flickr.com]\n\nEDIT: a lot of reviewers mention a less-than-perfect partner AI. In fact, I didn't perceive it as such. Quite possibly because I still have quite a low opinion of most in-game AI I've encountered, I immediately assumed that during the single player experience, you're supposed to continuously flick back and forth between characters. In fact, I found it one of the more fun gameplay mechanics to keep switching as quickly as possible. When there was a gap to be jumped, I jumped with one character first, flicked to the other mid-jump, jumped again, and flicked back before landing. Try it out. You'll not only encounter much fewer of these glitches, but you'll have some more fun along the way.","November 18, 2014","true","8.0"," 137 of 152 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","137","152","0","4"

The character animations are fluid and detailed, not to mention the work that went in to creating the environment. The art style in some parts of the game also lends to listening to an old story, which is exactly what they were going for.    Gameplay  7  The controls and puzzles were unique, and for the more part enjoyable. Towards the end of the game some of the mechanics can be frustrating, but nothing that will make you quit. Things can be made a bit easier with a friend (playing alone you must control both the characters, though the Companion AI is fairly well done, with little to no glitches).    Story  9  Never Alone was created to tell a story, and tell a story it does. Though extremely short, (Beat the game in about 2 hours) Never Alone was a wonderful journey. Few games actually manage to feel like you are being told a story, but Never Alone draws you in and brings you along to tell you about a girl, an arctic fox, and her journey to save her people.    Multiplayer  7  The multiplayer in this game is local only. Each of you takes control of one of the two characters. A neat little story to sit down and enjoy with a significant other, or a friend who enjoys a good story.    Replayability  3  As wonderful as the journey through this game was, there is little reason to go back and play it again, as the puzzles and interactions with the world will be exactly the same every time.    Overall  6.8/10  As usual, please remember that a 6.8 is not by any means a bad score. This signifies that the game is above average. Never Alone managed to capture the feeling of being told a bedtime story, which is an impressive feat in and of itself. Due to how short the game is, I would highly recommend waiting for a good sale to pick this one up. That being said, I feel Never Alone is a game that anyone who enjoys a good story and casual gameplay should pick up. You'll fall in love with that little arctic fox. There are few stories that I would use the word "beautiful" to describe, but Never Alone's is one of them.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","January 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 321 of 401 people (80%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","80","321","401","17","11"

Of course there is a difference between the myth that is told and the game concerning the characters (in myth is about a boy but in game is about a girl, of course the story is the same though) as also it has a very interesting gameplay.\n\nNow, the game is a platform type with a type of puzzles (which in first look you will think that it might be difficult but it is not) which Nuna (the main story character) have to solved with her trusted "Bola" and her white Fox friend (the second game character), of course you will have your "trials and error" moments but this is how all platform-puzzle games are.\n\nThe game can be played as a single player which you can change back and forth with Nuna and Fox which in return the second character will be controlled by AI, as also you can play the game in Local Co-Op (for the moment, maybe in the future we will have online Co-Op too) with a second controller (already you can use a keyboard as control but for keybinding, at the moment, you have to change them yourself through game file but the developers are working on it for a better solution).\n\nOf course you might find some bugs in the game but these bugs aren't "game breaking" (as I have noticed from my point of gameplay) and the developers are note them down in order to fix them.\n\nNow about the conclusion if I recommend this game or not.\n\nGet the game if:\n\n1) If you like other cultures myths and legends, platform and puzzle games, then go for it you will not regret it (I haven't ^_^) because also it has "Cultural Insights" videos that you must collect during your gameplay and watch them either pausing the game or (better) after finishing the game.\n\n2) If you want to play with a family member of yours and/or friends, this is a great choice but bear in mind that it is in local Co-Op, it doesn't have (yet) internet Co-Op. For those who want to play the game with their children, I suggest you to first play the game in single mode and then decide if your children can play with you (due to "trial and error" moments). As for the "PEGI - 12" that is mentioned in the shop page about having violence in the game, it isn't the violence that most games have but only a violence that you can find in and children's story book and/or cartoon (again do play it in single mode and you decide).\n\nDon't get the game if:\n\n1) If you get easily frustrated that makes you "drop" the game, then don't get it as this game will have a lot of "trial and error" moments.\n\n2) If you get easily angry because of some bugs in game which makes you "drop" the game (which the devs are going to fix)\n\n3) If you prefer to play the game right away in online Co-Op (better wait when it will implemented)\n\n4) If you get extremely sad during some sad moments (which in the end it doesn't ^_^)\n\n5) If you don't like short games (you can finish it in a few hours but this is how telling stories are)\n\n\nAs I said in my posts in the forum that this will be my opinion after finishing the game and having a clear view of it and it is upto you to "take it or leave it" (it is your own choice and not what we write).\n\nAs for me, I am very grateful for the developers and Iñupiat people for making this great game. Through the game not only we learn about Iñupiat folklores and traditions but also it is a good lesson about environment (watch the videos, after collecting them) and community.\n\nThis is a type of game genre that is missing from game industry, games that are created out of pure cultural folklores and traditions.\n\nAs my ancestors once said: "Those who forget their history, language and traditions, at the end they will be forgotten"","November 20, 2014","true","5.5"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","81","86","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/295790/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroNever Alone is a game that I’m sure many people will love. It has amazing storytelling and you can work through this little puzzle platformer completely by yourself or together with a friend.\nAnd even though the platforming segments won’t blow anyone away, what’s there is solid, if only a little bit glitchy sometimes.\n\nAfter only a small introduction you’re put in control of a little nameless girl who wants to find the source of a blizzard that threatens to destroy their way of life. Along the way she will meet a fox that will tag along and help her get through some of the tougher areas. The fox has the ability to jump higher and can fit through smaller areas humans normally can’t pass. Ultimately, the girl will also help the fox by moving obstacles and destroying them with her bola, which acts like some kind of slingshot.\n\nGameplayThis is yet another 2.5D platformer which means that pretty much everything is modeled in 3D but you’re watching it all from a 2D-plane. You’ll be walking, climbing, running and jumping through all kinds of icy environments like abandoned villages and watery caves. Since the game takes place in Alaska you obviously don’t have to expect sunlit beaches and lush forests here.\nThe story itself is told by a narrator. There are small animations being shown from time to time that push the story forward and during a level a few lines are also usually spoken. These spoken lines usually describe the events you’re currently experiencing.\n\nAs I already mentioned the game can be played alone or co-operatively with a friend. If you decide to play alone you’ll be able to control both the girl and the fox and you can switch between them on-the-fly with the press of a button. The AI will then take over the other character and help and follow you as best as possible and it does this unexpectedly well. There were just a couple of times where the AI didn’t do what I expected it to do but that problem was quickly solved by switching characters.\nThe way the AI reacts is surprising and admirable, especially for a relatively unknown game like this. I didn’t expect to see something like this unless it was an AAA title. But yes, enough about that.\n\nThe game does have a few glitches that I think could easily be avoided. Sometimes the physics get really weird when one of your characters gets squashed. It’s nothing game breaking but it’s weird to see and it throws you out of an otherwise lovely experience. Then you have the controls which aren’t always as tight as they should be. I’ve had multiple times where I pushed into a certain direction only to see my character perform it with less velocity resulting in death. Note that it works fine most of the time but a little tweaking couldn’t have hurt. This is yet another thing that could easily have been avoided. Otherwise this is a very technically impressive title, with extremely fast loading times. I think loading a level takes a mere two seconds before you can play. This is impressive to say the least.\n\nGraphics & AudioThe characters are well animated and cutely designed. They have small details like fur and the girl’s hood moving in the wind. The girl also seems to be walking deeper through the snow while the smaller and lighter fox can practically walk on it. Of course, there’s a lot of snow so most of the things you’re going to see are white or blue. The atmosphere is done really well.\nThe sounds the girl and the fox make are cute but are usually only heard whenever one of them dies. You won’t hear a peep from them otherwise, because the narrator will be telling the story here and not the characters.\nAnd I can’t really remember the music, which must have been quite subtle then. At least I can say that it wasn’t distracting.\n\nLengthPlease note that this isn’t a long game. Like many other narrative games the goal is to tell a story and not to let the game drag on and on by giving you more and more until you finally get bored with it. A level usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete and a complete playthrough should take you anywhere between 1,5-2 hours. It speaks for itself that playing this completely alone will probably take you a little longer because you have to constantly switch between characters whereas if you have a buddy you can control both characters simultaneously. In any case, 2 hours is more than enough and I’m actually glad that it wasn’t longer because that would’ve impacted the experience a little. For the completionists there are owls to be found that will unlock short movies that usually give you a little backstory about the current level or scene.  The owls aren’t very hard to find and with a little effort you might even be able to collect them the first time you finish the game.\n\nClosingNever Alone is a beautiful little game. It’s not as emotional as Journey or To The Moon, but then again; it’s trying to tell a different kind of story, a story that most of us probably aren’t even familiar with. Therefore this is a game that you should definitely play. It might not be long but if you care about the experience itself you won’t mind, trust me.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","November 21, 2014","true","5.1"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","85","97","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/295790/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Video games as art seems to be the most recent movement within the genre and the latest evolution in what art is and can be, from giant names like Myst, Shadow of the Colossus, and Journey, but also from smaller works with The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, all of them share a common theme - art, whatever that may be, it’s becoming harder and harder to deny that the medium of video games can produce art on a visual level, audio level, emotional, and even spiritual planes. They can confront our views of life and existence or to make social and political commentary with surgical precision (see Spec Ops: The Line). At the core of all of these is on aspect that has been part of art since its inception with early humankind: Story. From telling grand epics of battle to the most private and intimate moments between a child and a mother, the story holds it all together and Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is no different.\n\nGameplay: 88 B+\nNever Alone is a typical platformer with basic controls, the essentials one could say, it fits the game’s environment and for the most part is accurate. There is some stiffness in the movements at times as well as some blind jumping and timing required by the player or pure luck in reaching that magical height with your Arctic Fox companion in order to get over a cliff ledge, it can cause some frustration, but it isn't game breaking. Having such basic controls allows the player to focus on solving a puzzle instead of remembering combos or a certain move set, more in the spirit of Sonic the Hedgehog, but at a slower pace.\n\nAudio: 97 A+\nThe music and ambience, along with the narration, is the shining jewel upon this gaming achievement. Like many before, the soundscapes are just as big of a factor to the world building as the visuals, which we'll get to dive into later. The native sounds of not just the land, but of the people and the words spoken in the tongue of theIñupiat people, native to Northern Alaska and Canada, which you can simply listen to while you play or you can turn on the subtitles to read more into the story. Even more subtle sounds such as an owl’s hoot indicating a checkpoint or a gust of wind all add to the immersion without the need for hyper realistic visuals. There have been multiple instances when I was just let the game sit there and let the ambience play.\n\nVisuals: 95 A\nSpeaking of the visuals, they are superb for its setting. Much like the mobile hit Badlands and Limbo before it, there is a simple aesthetic in contrasting features, the characters and environments are based off of the culture not just in how the people look and dress, but also in their art and how they see the world from the landscapes, the animals, and the elemental spirits which surround and inhabit every aspect of their lives. While Limbo kept with the black and gray hues and shades, Never Alone does venture into some darker and vibrant colors, though it would be completely understandable if you just let the game sit and watched the snow roll over the hills like an interactive screensaver. There are some clipping issues and edge detection problems here and there, but like with the controls, they aren't game breakers. The scenes are all quiet self contained, having their own quirks with the foreground and background complimenting each other instead of one vying for the player’s attention.\n\nContent: 80 B-\nNever Alone on Steam is a fairly large download, especially when compared to other games of it’s type and even giving some higher end game a run for their money, but this is mostly in part to the short videos you unlock as you play the game, some are easy while others can be more difficult to find. Each video gives an insight to the culture the game is based off of and made by, in a way it’s an interactive documentary. The game does offer a co-op feature allowing for two people to control both girl and fox at the same time and as I mentioned, a fair amount of hidden objects to find for the curious, all of which does not necessarily take away from the game, but its addition is a matter of perspective, the gain is not a better weapon or being able to jump higher, but knowledge. The videos are appropriately called “Cultural Insights” and are just that, snippets that barely scratch the surface. Replayability is not really a strong point of Never Alone, but more about the experience of hearing a story being told for the first time. It captures your and brings you along. The true replayability lies in the co-op as you may share the experience with other people and seeing their reactions and emotions to the story unfolding before them as you tag along as a secondary teller.\n\nMultiplayer: 75 C\nNot much to really say about the multiplayer aspect of Never Alone, a basic co-op in the vein of Sonic the Hedgehog , except when one or the other falls, you start over from the last checkpoint.\n\nDesign: 79 C+\nThis is quite possibly the hardest aspect to nail down let alone grade. The fact that this game exists is somewhat of a miracle, so to judge it too harshly would seem unfair being an indie title, not to mention a new type of game structuring, but that doesn't mean there aren't any faults. As mentioned before, there are some graphical flaws, difficulty curves, and other things that may turn away folks from this, especially those looking for a “perfect” experience, but experiences like this doesn’t require perfection. Had this been made by a larger team and budget with similar faults, then one could expect a lower grade altogether. This is one of those times where the effort is what should remain in focus and not whether they colored in between all the lines.\n\nStory: 90 A\nThe story of this game cannot be judged on its quality in terms of plot holes, quality, realism - this is a myth given an interactive element and thus must be taken as such. The story is told very well and and in a manner as if you were with a tribe elder telling you an ageless tale passed down from generation to generation. Having that tied right into the gameplay, the pacing is fully dependent on your progression through the game and with the soundscapes flowing in and out, accompanied by the art and visuals, the words ensnare you into investing with this girl and her fox as they trek along for the first time with you and for the innumerable times as a tale.\n\n\nVerdict: 86/100 B\nNever Alone is not alone in what it does and is part of an ever increasing trend in indie games taking on stronger story and art driven games, but the genre is still young with vast amount of themes to explore and interpret which we will dive into with time. The one thing Never Alone does well, that is not as common, is that it tells a good, solid tale without the curse of having every detail deconstructed, because you simply cannot without taking the magic away. It would be like trying to analyze Ulysses or Peter Pan on its realism or possibility and missing the point entirely.

Some of the mechanics feel clunky.\n\nThe title is beautiful and I'm certainly glad I played it once, I cannot bring myself to recommend it to anyone from a game play perspective. And for one unfortunate reason. Controlling two characters turns into a nightmare during some parts of the game with the AI lagging behind and getting crushed by various objects, or trying to jump onto a moving iceberg too late and dying.  Other times the AI appears to just give up and throw itself into the ocean when nothing is wrong. With a second human player, as the game supports, and encourages, these problems are for the most part completely resolved.\n\nIf you HAVE NOT played this title yet, but intend to purchase or have already purchased it, I strongly recommend that you play it with a friend the first time. This may GREATLY improve your first impressions of the game, and your overall experience. The game will actually encourage this at the beginning when the characters are introduced, and I have to say I agree with them.\n\nHowever, if you don't care about such things, it IS a beautiful game. The world has both a wonderful childlike quality to it with darker undertones present throughout.\n\nUnfortunately Steam does not allow for a "Yes, I recommend the game, but under certain conditions option" but we can't have everything. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, or simply beautiful games, this may be something you would  like.","November 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 199 of 266 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","199","266","2","4"

It's really hard to make jumps, like you're trying to climb on barbed wire or something. Sometimes the Girl and the Fox just don't want to jump. Controlling the Bola and aiming it is one of the most god awful things I've ever had to do, and companions can be a bit incompitent at times.

Said game starts off promisingly; it looks great, it's full of atmosphere, it has a cute fox companion, and the character swapping seems like a promising mechanic. Alas, before long you're close to throwing the controller at the wall because of the clumsy and imprecise controls, annoying camera and very frequent glitches that require you to restart at the previous checkpoint. Again, and again. Shame, because I really wanted to learn more about the Iñupiat, but I just couldn't wrestle any further with the sadly flawed game they wrapped it up in. Having said that, I get the impression this was designed primarily as a co-op game, and perhaps it works better if you have two players, but the AI that conrols the second character when you're playing single player seems determined to make life as difficult as possible for you.","February 14","false","0.8"," 110 of 142 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","110","142","2","9"

The game is only 3 hours long, but towards the end I just wanted it to be over.  The developers did a nice job of gradually ramping up the platforming difficulty, but towards the end it gets really tedious: jump into wind gusts, switch to the other character to pull platforms, switch back, and jump again -- over and over.  When you are playing solo, occasionally the computer will move the character you are not controlling in a way that causes it to die - forcing you to start over.  That gets annoying after a while.  It happens most when you are controlling the fox, which is too bad because playing as the fox is much more fun than playing as the girl.\n\nAll-in-all, I give Never Alone a 3 out of 5.

The core idea of "hey let's teach our kids about our culture by making a video game" is neat and I'm happy to support that.

I've started to think of the critter as Derpfox no matter how cool he is.\n\nI feel like I'm about halfway through the game after one hour, but the cultural videos seem like they are a big part of the experience and I haven't watched many.

Be warned watch out for the hungry Polarbear you must run, jump, run, jump,and just run for your life.\n\nAlso sometimes the puzzles are a bit tricky to solve, so i watched youtube videos to help but only if i could not find my own solution to progress further in the game, and really the solutions where very simple to solve.

This game is just filled with enough frustrations to drag the whole thing down despite the clear love that was put into it and how beautiful it is.\n\nThese frustrations are bugs and I've run into gamebreaking glitches where I had to reset the checkpoint in order to fix, like an NPC just running in circles instead of leaving which prevented me from moving a block to advance or not having a platform appear after I hit the thing that summons it.\n\nThe hugest glitch though is the fox just falls through platforms and dies, to the point where I can't progress anymore because the fox keeps doing it, even when I'm controlling it. This game clearly had more of co-op in mind because for whatever reason the devs thought having your AI controlled partner being able to die is a good idea so I've run into multiple instances where the AI just leaps to its death or doesn't run and gets killed by an enemy. Babysitting the AI is not fun.\n\nAlso some of the chase sequences are way too punishing. I’m far from a newbie at platformers but the window to do things in some chase sections felt way too small. All my problems can be fixed through patching though and I really hope the devs fix it, because this clearly would be a quality game if it weren’t dragged down with these bugs.\n\nSo in conclusion, don’t buy it now, wait for patches.

I say watch because the gameplay is pretty run-of-the-mill puzzle-platforming and earns this recommendation almost wholly on the back of the excellent documentary footage (the "cultural insights") and the art direction.\n\nThe art direction is stunning. As I parsed the occasional glitch or two what kept me playing was the visual appeal of the game. The 3D models are tolerable and appropriately adorable for a game about a fox and a little girl, but the game's backgrounds and use of cultural imagery really make a generic-playing game look and feel special. There's love and heart in this game and its apparent in the art, in the music, and in the in-game narration. This is a very simple game being used as a platform to demonstrate this culture.\n\nAnd, you know what? I'm cool with that. The idea of a game showcasing a community rarely given public space to talk about who they are is a decent one with a lot of potential. This is hopefully an early trailblazer both in terms of game development strategies and in terms of cultural connection. The 24 videos contained in the game are sometimes touching, as with the story of the girl riding a polar bear or memories of playing with Arctic Fox. They are sometimes informative, as are the ones discussing the importance of words like Sila or the stories of the Little People. They are all entertaining. The idea of playing a documentary like this is both interesting and reasonably well-applied here.\n\nI look forward to this studio's next effort and applaud them for this game. While it hardly pushes envelopes with its platforming, it is a welcome change of scenery and a well put together exploration of the peoples of the Arctic. If you have no interest in these people, you will have no interest in this game.

But really all the game has are nice visuals, same screen co-op, and a whacky plot... with documentary footage sprinkled into the levels as collectibles.\n\nThis is a platformer first and foremost, so I'd expect the controls to be tight and responsive, they aren't. All jumps have an unpredictably slight delay and grabbing onto a ledge only works 3 out of 4 times. Jumping backwards is impossible, you have to turn around and then jump.\n\nOther than jumping and climbing, there's other issues with gameplay mechanics. Throwing projectiles is a pain, it's an awfully awkward system and it down right doesn't work sometimes - which can be really frustrating when your character's lives depend on it. Moving platforms around is a joyless and slow process later on in the game. Co-op feels underdeveloped, with the work load feeling very one sided, at first the fox character is doing all the work, but towards the end, the female is doing all the work. If it was instead balanced throughout the game, co-op would have been much more fun.\n\nGlitches made parts of the game in-completable. Which is what the game feels like, incomplete.\n\nI've never been so frustrated playing a game before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/295790/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Never Alone is an indie 2D puzzle platformer with a unique inspiration source, showing a folk tale set in the Alaskan permafrost. The game was built in partnership with the Alaskan Native community, delivering an atmospheric experience set in a snowy world, delving into the lore of the Inupiat people.\n\nWhenever a new 2D platformer comes out of the indie scene, we have to answer the question of whether its existence is relevant or if it's just another consequence of having bigger and better game making tools and 2D platformers being easy to make. Never Alone passes the test with flying colors, as it's based on a folk tale and also packs in some neat documentary footage, delivering interesting facts about the Alaskan natives and their culture. In the game, you play the role of a young girl going on a quest to find why the blizzard isn't stopping, before her village starves as a consequence of not being able to hunt anymore.\n\nThe game plays as you would expect from a platformer, with plenty of running, jumping, and the occasional bola shooting, and a slew of facile puzzles to solve. The action blends realism with supernatural elements, such as an ice giant, a huge ice whale and helpful spirits, all based on the folklore of the people living in one of the harshest environments on Earth.\n\nYou assume the role of Nuna, going out into the great unknown and braving the elements in order to save your village. However, you are not alone in your quest, as an arctic fox comes to your help and follows you during your journey, helping you by talking to the spirits. In addition to this, you'll also be able to move boxes, swim around, jump through trees, and do a lot of running for your life when being chased by polar bears or the game's antagonist.\n\nThe controls aren't as smooth as they could be, as you can't freely jump around as you would in an action platformer. For instance, you can't jump backward, you have to first turn, and then get some momentum before a jump, which can lead to frustrating situations where you fail to reach your target. Furthermore, the transition from running to shooting your bola is also a bit choppy, especially when you need to shoot it fast, and aiming isn't always as accurate as it could be.\n\nThis is further aggravated by the fact that the characters don't always manage to grab onto ledges, especially around boxes, and the AI controlling the inactive character isn't always making the best decisions. However, a recent update has solved some of the AI issues, and there are a lot of checkpoints in the game, so it's not that big a deal in the end, even if the controls could have been a little bit more responsive. Aside from these points, the game plays very well, with enough variety to make things interesting and with a right difficulty balance, enough to be slightly challenging, but not enough to put you off.\n\nAs you progress through the story, you will unlock live-action documentary sequences, detailing the lives and beliefs of the Alaskan natives, which are a worthy view, especially if you're interested in finding out more about the various cultures of the world. The overall atmosphere is great, and the different motives used during the adventure are very interesting, the entire thing looking like a blend of fairy tale and gritty survival story, lending mature themes a puerile spirit, and blending a sort of childish awe with the need to understand and internalize what is going on in the world around us.\n\nIn this regard, the game's story is like many other folk tales of old, seeking to add an anthropomorphic value to natural occurrences beyond our grasp, and to offer the events that influence our lives some higher meaning and, most of all, a purpose. There are Little People, there is a Manslayer, the archetypal person putting its own needs and desires before the community's, Sky People, and a lot of other nice things to discover and wonder at.\n\nThe entire game aims to convey a picture, that everything in the world is connected, according to the Inupiat's strong sense of community and oneness with nature, and it manages to do it quite well. Never Alone portrays a living world, through spirits, its lore and your interactions with the arctic fox, even in the places where the frosty environment it all takes place in seems to suggest nothingness and death. It's essentially a playable fable, a way through which the old explain the world to the young, seeking to inspire them and help them cope with things beyond their control, and to respect their surroundings.\n\nThe inspirational story of a little girl saving her village is an overarching theme of human folklore, the hero typology, risking everything for the good of the many, and showing that initiative, empathy and self-sacrifice are the pillars of a healthy and durable community. I would have liked the game to be longer though, because I wanted to find out more about the people and explore the unknown world of their lore further. I respect the fact that the levels don't have too much padding just for the sake of providing a couple more hours of content, but I still would have liked a meatier experience, in the end.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, managing to evoke the dark and snowy days of the north pretty well, alongside gusts of wind and more eerie elements such as spirits and the personifications of the northern lights. The artistry is generally pretty good and varied, with decent assets and interesting designs inspired by the culture of the Inupiat. The cut-scenes are especially atmospheric, largely due to the fact that they are entirely narrated in the natives' language, adding to the entire experience. The art direction has a wonderful feel to it, in the sense that it manages to capture a childlike quality when portraying the world, while at the same time possessing some darker undertones that serve the story well.\n\nThe unlockable insight bits are also nice, they're not too long, so they're entertaining enough without overstaying their welcome, making the whole thing more enthralling than a simple documentary. Overall, the atmosphere and strangeness of the arctic world manage to paint a pretty good picture of the way the Inupiat see their forbidding environment, as a place teeming with life, history and hope, instead of the barren outlook it would have for outsiders.\n\nThis is far from your average puzzle platformer, as its main audience is not the die-hard old-school fanbase of the genre. Never Alone is first and foremost an educational experience, and this is the standard to which you have to judge it in order to fully appreciate it. It's far from the polished experience some indie developers have delivered in Brad, Trine or Limbo, as it suffers from the occasional glitch and has some control issues.\n\nInstead of being all about gameplay, Never Alone is more about telling the very personal story of a people living to honor tradition, being inspired by Alaskan natives folklore and even offering short documentary clips about their life and history. The atmosphere is great and the gameplay is satisfying, albeit with no difficult puzzles, and it's short and has pretty much no replay value. The storyline is interesting and ties in with the gameplay very neatly, and it also offers the option to play cooperatively, with two players each controlling one of the characters.\n\nIt's a brilliant way to go about edutainment, especially when so many indigenous communities are growing increasingly thin due to the advent of the global digital age and the growing influence of popular culture. The way it's all designed, with gameplay and narration interspersed with relevant background videos exploring the importance of the things you’ve just uncovered, further serves to make the entire experience meaningful and endearing.","December 30, 2015","true","75.4"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","50","74","4","1"

A story is being told during the game in a native tongue and has captions for you to read so you can understand. However, you do not have time to read them as you flee a persuer and whilst performing precision tasks. Completing levels does not give you the sense of completion as solving puzzles in most games do as the feeling is merely a sense of relief as the stress of the previous level has finally been overcome.

The start of the game is great, a (very) young huntress tries to find the reason of a storm that has been active in the area for quite alot, to end it before her village dies of hunger, because they can't hunt like that.\nYou walk, find a fox, and walk to the right, and walk a bit more, and a cutscene appears; occasionally the narrator tells you what's going on, and that's about it.\n\nThe platform parts were tedious; from what I recall, the fox has a mystical connection with spirits , and when he approaches them, they turn material and move to help our little protagonist, but they move slowly and you'll find yourself falling quite more times than you'd like to admit, the movable objects and puzzles are tedious and slow, you'll fail and get a bit angry because you wasted 1 minute just pushing a stick, and when you complete the puzzles you don't feel great, it's just like, "ok", I don't know how to explain this.\n\nAfter some time walking and walking and jumping you find your weapon, the "bola". To use it you have to use the right stick of your controller in a very weird way; I found it extremely inprecise and tedious; the first boss is just walking right and ocasionally hitting small fences that he creates of snow with your bola. VERY TEDIOUS and not rewarding at all, because of the horrible controls of the bola. I decided to quit the game because I wasn't really entertained.\n\nI have to admit, the videos are pretty cool and you learn more about their civilization, you can see how the developers put lots of love in the game, and care. But the game per-sé is not enjoyable, in my opinion.","January 30","false","0.5"," 61 of 94 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","61","94","4","10"

Not only does it look and sound great, but it also brought closer to me a certain culture and places that I may never have a chance to experience in person.\n\nAnyway, the review:\nGraphics- lovely, lively (despite being mostly deserted) setting. Characters are beautifully designed and animated, especially the fox,,, Plenty of little details which indicate that the developers really put their hearts into making the game, like the way the hood falls from the progatonist's head when the wind blows in ther face... The graphics are simple, yet I never felt they lacked refinement. Additionally, despite the locations being often quite similar, I never got the feeling of monotony.\nMusic/ Sound- rather good, I think. The howling of the wind sounds great and its presence nearly everywhere really seems to be one of the factors that create the atmoshpere of the game. The narrator does an excellent job and the music fits the atmosphere very well. Saldy, none of the musical tracks have had a hjuge effect on me and to be honest, I don;t really remember what the music sounded like. It was there, sure enough, and didn't spoil anything but it just wasn't very memorable.\nGameplay- nothing groundbraking, really. The game is a rather simple platformer with hardly any puzzles for the player to solve and some co-op content thrown in. Playing solo, like I have, it is no harder to finish the game than if one were to invite a friend to help, which I find a very positive feature. The AI of the companion does what it's supposed to most of the time, albeit the number of places where it is necessary is very limited. The game worked nice with a gamepad, until it decided that both characters should perform exactly the same moves, which inevitably led to one of them falling to their deaths... Still, at least I had the chance to see that mouse + keyboard combo work perfectly fine as well\nCharacters/ Story- This is where the game really comes into its own. The story is based on an actual Inuit tale and is a really nice adaptation of a folk tale. The characters are likeable but given that the game is short, there is not much time to see any of their personalities to develop very far.\n\nWere you to consider just the above, Never Alone would seem as an average, pretty platformer. But it's far from that. All the parts somehow add up to much more than just a sum of the advantages. The game has some sort of magic that kept me wanting to play on. This charm is defenitely not to be found in the gameplay but rather in the story, characters, the music and the visuals.\nApart from the game itself, there are quite a few collectibles, which unlock insights (literally) into the culture and the stories that inspired the game. While in the majority of games I just can't be bothered to look at them, here they felt just as much a vital part of the game as anything else. To be honest, I wish there was more. Much more.\n\nIn conclusion, I would give the game itself a score of about 7/10. The tangible mechanics, visuals and audio of the game are nothing groundbreaking, although they leave a positive impression. However, the feel of the game, the story and the 'Insights' lift the grade to a final 8,5/10.","July 17, 2015","true","10.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

There are so many things going through my head as I finished my playthrough of Never Alone. The biggest one is how the idea of this game was born out of the want to educate people about Native Alaskan culture. Upper One Games, brought into existence, through E-Line Media and Cook Inlet Tribal Council, have managed to produce an amazing and captivating game through stories from a culture most of us don't understand.\n\nThe first thing to discuss is the art style of Never Alone. Everything from character models to the environments are spectacular. Granted, the cutscenes sometimes took a bit of that sparkle away from the game, but the art while playing is downright gorgeous. I caught myself many times with my mouth wide open and eyes dried up from hardly blinking. The animations help ground you in the game. They are smooth and seamless, yet the characters have weight to their movements, immersing me further into the game. Environments are dynamic and interactive. Riding on trees through the forest, running away from polar bears, and climbing large animated objects give the game an action packed feel.\n\nIf I were to rate each section of the game serparately, the mechanics might have been rated the lowest. This is not to say the mechanics are bad, but everything else was on another level. The two character puzzle solving mechanic is brilliant, yet I don't think they took it far enough. Most puzzles in the game are one note and very straight forward. I felt like they could have expanded on the difficulty of the puzzles at some point, perhaps requiring more back tracking or more steps in certain puzzles to accomplish that. The game mechanics overall were good though, using the two characters simultaneously to solve puzzles, very interesting platforming, and dynamic environments that require the player to react accordingly. If Upper One Games is going to release a sequel to Never Alone, they need to develop more intricate puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of a two character puzzle solving team, the lack of character development for Nuna and the fox were actually very positive choices. Even though I'm an almost thirty year old white male, I could easily put myself in Nuna's shoes and feel like I'm the little girl trying to save my village. Sometimes no character development is the best choice for a game and its immersion. I felt a natural bond between the two characters, a friendship that evolves over the game. Words don't have to be spoken between Nuna and the fox, but the bond naturally develops as the player uses both characters to work out puzzles, giving a strong feeling of comradery.\n\nNever Alone does a great job progressing the story. There are not many moments where I felt that I wasn't making progress towards something. The story is quick paced, including multiple nemeses, which provide smaller subset stories to the overall story arch.\n\nLast but certainly not least is the sound quality in Never Alone. The music and ambient sound is what ties the whole game together. Upper One Games does a great job at setting the mood for whatever is happening on the screen with not just the visual quality but also the audio.\n\nCongratulations to Upper One Games, for being the first Native American development company, and for nailing their first project. Hopefully we will see more high quality games coming from this company, albiet maybe a tad bit longer next time eh? :) Overall, you should definitely play this game, it finishes around 3 - 4 hours which might make the price too steep for the hours you will get out of the game. I gaurantee that those few hours will be a blast though.","November 18, 2014","true","4.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

It gets much easier when played in co-op though, even though some moments can STILL get very infuriating.\n\nOverall, I'd still advise anyone who wanna play something that is different, and that'll make them discover a culture they don't know, to play this game, despite all it's flaws.

Fans of story-rich games and /or platformers should find something to like here.\n\nThe story, while on its own interesting, is heightened by its connection to the Iñupiat people and their culture.  The short videos you unlock as you progress strengthen that connection and transform the game into a quasi-documentary.  It’s clear the devs intended the game and videos to be viewed simultaneously and make it very easy to do so while in game.\n\nThe gameplay and platforming is ok, not great.  There is certainly some originality in the use of the fox, animal spirits and the wind/blizzard.  The controls are good enough to get by but aren’t always as tight you need them to be, particularly in the faster areas of the game.  But those were few and I never got stuck on any area for longer than a couple of minutes.\n\nAll in all, I’d recommend.  It’s a short game, 3-4 hrs, but feels like you get more out of it than the relatively low time investment would suggest.  And I found the graphics and art direction to be gorgeous.

The concept really intrigued me and the game looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous. After finishing it, I believe I've got my money's worth, but it does leave some to be desired.\n\nYays:\n-I actually learned something while playing, and you will too. The Alaskan Native culture is fascinating to learn about. The game features short unlockable videos called "Cultural Insights" that serve as a mini-documentary about the people's culture, beliefs, and way of living. It teaches us how they believe that everything on Earth has a spirit, how they pass down stories from generations, and even how awesome having an Arctic Fox as a pet is.\n\n-The game's presentation and visuals are beautiful. For a game made on the Unity Engine, it's amazing to look at. While the game has a slightly cartoon-ish feel to it, the frozen lands of Alaska look wonderful. The sylization of the cutscenes are also great. In any other game I'd say it looked cheap, however in this game it's justified. You can see why when playing it.\n\n-That fox, man, I mean. Dude, I want one.\n\n-Puzzles aren't very unfair or cheap. You probably won't ever be stuck on a puzzle during your playthrough.\n\nNeighs:\n\n-Options are limited. No rebindable keys or graphics settings outside of "Low, Medium, and High" but for a 2D platformer, it's more forgivable.\n\n-Jumping can be a little wonky at times. Sometimes, even when you're sure you nailed a jump your character will still grab onto the ledge first and pull herself up.\n\n-The game was pretty clearly designed for two players, while most of the game works fine without two people, several parts near the end feel like a flustercluck of keeping track your two characters.\n\n-AI is kind of dumb. They do a fair enough job of following you, but they can sometimes take too long to move, resulting in their demise.\n\n-Very short experience, although your times may vary. I completed it in three hours while I've seen major sites take around four to six.\n\nOverall, Never Alone is a very solid debut title for these developers and, hopefully, the start of an amazing new genre of video games. You're probably going to have a good time with it.","November 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

You collect what are called cultural insights as you progress which teach you about the lives of this Alaskan tribe in the form of educational videos.  Unfortunately, this was the only seriously interesting thing about the game. I enjoyed the knowledge about a tribe I haven't heard of before.\n\nWhile I liked the direction the game wanted to go in, it was just plagued by clunky controls and at times, terrible level design that made playing very frustrating.  Manuevering between characters at points was awkward and it didn't help that every enemy killed you instantly.  I appreciate the effort put into this but it simply fell short.

It gives you a glance into a culture you are most likely not familiar with (I wasn't either), namely an Alaskan Native people, called the Iñupiat.\n\nAs you play through this game, you find yourself listening to a storyteller speaking in their native language, telling you a story about a terrible blizzard. You set out to explore its origin, accompanied by an arctic fox, as the protagonist of this intruiging story, as it is being told.\nOn the way you will be confronted with a series of challenges, in a world that is stunningly portrayed and supported by beautiful music.\nAnd one more thing in particular that makes this game so fantastic to play (if you have interest in such things), are the videoclips you unlock as you progress. It's like watching a Discovery Channel documentary, where the commercial breaks are replaced by well-crafted platformer puzzles you have to solve!\n\nFor me the only downside was how short this game was, because it takes ~3 hours to 100% this game, and it doesn't have a high replayability after that.

The mechanics and setting make it a refreshing experience. There is a crazy plot twist that changes the gameplay significantly. Easily recommended if you're into a beautiful, awe-inspiring, and really challenging platformer. By challenging, I mean testing you on everything you've learned with quick timing towards the latter parts of the game. This isn't quite as breezy as Brothers or Journey.\n\nIt's a strong tale of courage to seek serenity in a harsh world full of spirits, blizzards, and along with the best and worst of humankind. What makes it more impressive to me is how the original character for the fable is meant to be a boy but here it's a girl and she's just a strong inspirational hero that doesn't get nerfed because of some plot convenience and isn't subservient to others.\n\nSometimes the AI can be a bit wonky, but you can manually switch between both the girl and the fox instantaneously. If you have friends/family/relative/significant other, I'd recommend playing with them as you hear them shriek at the challenges and chases like I did with my sister :D\n\nGorgeous is an understatement, coming from a small game made in Unity. The snow, wind, and ice effects along with the foley made me feel subconsciously a bit colder as I was playing. The narration during gameplay reminded me of Bastion, and if you're into games like Brothers, Limbo, or other cinematic platformers that have cool animations but can be a bit trial-and-error, check it out.\n\nI would love more interactive tales that explore other cultures' mythos and fairy tales.","November 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

An excercise in complete and utter boredom, frustrating controls, atrocious level design, and a nonsensical story. If you'd like to learn about the culture of these people then go for it, otherwise I can't in any state of mind recommend this.\n\nI played through this in co-op thinking it'd be a fun short experience and we were bored to tears, the videos are interesting, but the gameplay is so repetitive and uninspired, causing nothing but frustration and confusion.\n\nThe pacing is all over the place, with the most exciting points being right at the beginning (the polar bear bits) and the ending being painfully tedious and anti-climactic.\n\nThere are endless amounts of glitches that will constantly send you back to your last checkpoint, and for a game that only lasts roughly three hours, after the first two or three levels I found myself longing for it to end, yet it dragged on and on and on and on.\n\nThere's a line in one of the videos which talks about how the Alaskan Natives are brilliant storytellers, which seemed to come through in some of the interviews (particularly the one about being stranded on the ice) but where was that ability during the creation of this game? The story is complete and utter nonsense, turning something as magical and beautiful as the Northern Lights into an infuriating obstacle that you can't wait to be finished with.\n\nIf you want a cute and difficult platformer, grab Ori and the Blind Forest, if you want a heartwarming and quirky story, pick up Gravity Ghost, but under no circumstance should you buy this if you're looking for a solid gaming experience.

And, I'll tell you what, that part is interesting, and the game itself lets you know that. At the end of every level is to remind you to watch the documentary, the game itself is steeped in vague symbolism and strange unexplained details that you'd understand if you (points at) watch the documentary. And that's fine except I was sold a game not a movie.\n\nMeanwhile, the game itself is just so incredibly poorly done. The closer you look at it, the more you realise the holes that are in the platforming and the padding pushed into it. For a platformer, the jumping itself should be seamless and the movement (the thing that is the MOST IMPORTANT PART) is jerky, glitchy, and unclear. I died at several puzzles because I just did not know where I was expected to go and, best part, a lot of the time you're timed. I was being chased time and again and I had to take multiple leaps of faith on parts that might've been branches, might not have been. Sometimes a spirit platform would show up, sometimes no. I met my end at the bottom of many cliffs and frozen waters because that game was built on trusting your partner and the mechanics to work like they're supposed to (gusts of wind, platforms appearing out of nowhere)\n\nMy favorite part was when I was at the penultimate level and I could not get past a particular part not because it was difficult, but Nuna literally, could/would not, grab a hold of a wall at the end of a jump. I slid my face all the way down that wall and into a bed of spikes, and had to redo. In fact, I thought I broke it until I finally made it somehow without changing anything and then had to wrestle with the same pit of spikes but on a /higher/ leverage. You are never taught your limits because those limits were always changing. It was buggy and long, and i hope you liked doing it the first time because you're gonna have to do it a second time.\n\nSo, the short of it is, for a documentary, its wonderfully researched and very informative. As a game, I never before had so much frustration in one thing that I had to put it into words and now I guess I'm publishing it.","January 12","false","2.8"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

You don't see much games like this, which is why it's pretty sweet to play something different.\n\nBut unfortunately, to me, it has more negatives than positives such as having unresponsive controls, which is absolutely frustrating to deal with since you have to switch between two different characters fairly quickly at most parts. When one of them has been attacked, you instantly die - it'd be nice if you had a chance to at least get back up and try again instead of just dying and going straight to the last checkpoint (this annoys me a lot mostly because having pretty unresponsive controls and constantly dying in one hit tends to result in repeating that certain part a few times). Controlling the Bola can be difficult because it doesn't aim properly most of the time, you have to click the right spot for it to not bug up the aim; speaking of bugging up the aim, there's a fair amount of bugs in this game that definitely need to be fixed, the game bugged a few times for me when I jumped onto the ground or onto a wall then suddenly died or became glitched in a spot (using the Artic Fox, unsure about Nuna though).\nProbably playing local co-op would be best.\n\n(Sorry if I didn't word this review properly, it was hard to put in words)","March 1, 2015","false","2.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Gameplay-wise, it's a disaster. Average on a good day, barely playable at a not-so-good day. Sometimes, the physics will work just fine, while other times, you feel like walking on the moon. Then the game glitches out, or your AI partner makes an unexplicable jump to their death, or gets stuck somewhere, and you have to start over. If there wasn't a checkpoint around every corner, this would be ragequit inducing.\n\nThe puzzles are hardly worth talking about; most of the time you have to find a hidden thing, use the same simple mechanic over and over, or time your jumps correctly. Sometimes I would run into a new area and die a couple of times before realizing what the game wants me to do. Then I do just that and move on. Nothing to it; it's not a challenging game.\n\nThe story is okay, but nothing special either. It's a children's fairy tale told by an Alaskan Native. No character development, just a basic there-and-back-again set in the harsh snowy desert, with some magic thrown in.\n\nSo while I appreciate the beautiful visuals, as well as the spotlight on Alaska Native folklore, this game just isn't good enough.

It's great and all that they're trying to shed light on Alaskian culture but hoooooly crap is this game just not that great.\n\nFirst off, you better have a friend to play with or else this game takes frustration to the next level with its down syndrome AI. I mean We're literally talking about having an extra limb on your body that does nothing but get you killed. So many times did I find myself having to switch characters to just to get my guy the hell out of the way before getting crushed but I just never had enough time to move both of them, if I was lucky, and which I was, both would actually move at the same time.\n\nSecond off, The controls are just clunky. I admit that unity isn't the best engine when it comes to controls so I'll cut them slack there but jeez, just turning left and right was so damn clunky. Just all the animations in general were pretty clunky. I found myself constantly getting blown facing the wrong direction regardless of where I was trying to direct my character. AND THE STUPID WEAPON? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why in the world would they have the aim feature AND the shoot feature in the SAME stick. (I played on a 360 Controller) So many times of running away and never getting my thing to shoot cause the aiming and shooting was just SO terrible.\n\nThird off, the game was terribly short and the passed on tale was just not that... interesting.  I mean we're talking only hours of very boring generic story telling. I feel like they could have at least spruced up the story a hair just to make it seem more enchanting... But it was the same puzzles, the same dragging story, and nothing more than a very easy platformer.\n\nI'm typically not this critical towards games, especially an indie game that focuses on history more than the game but I just felt the need to tell the real story about this game rather than the flood of positive that seems to be clouding the front page.","April 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

It's not over before it starts, and the pacing is okay.  However, the game is interspersed with (optional, but constantly unlocking) videos explaining the culture of the people the game is based on.\n\nAs a cultural exploration, it's okay.  Production values of the videos are fine, but the content is mildly interesting, not enthralling.\n\nAs a game, it's just not very good, or very fun.  The mechanics can be finicky in a way that break not only with platforming conventions, but it's own rules.  If you're climbing, you can jump backwards away from the surface by pushing away from the wall and hitting Jump.  However, you can't jump backwards from a standing position.  You have to turn around first.  But, you can't just turn around, since if you even just tap a direction, you not only turn, but move in that direction, which changes your location and possibly makes it so you'll not longer be able to jump and grab the ledge you could have if only you could just jump backwards. Or just turn around without moving.  Or if the ledge-magnetization was more forgiving (it's inconsistent).\n\nYou end up dying and returning to checkpoint (after a few seconds unskippable "oh dear" cutscene from the other character) quite often, but rarely because you didn't know what to do, but because the game fails to execute on your intent.   If the platforming was tight, I would have completed the game in even less time, and enjoyed it more.  But despite a patch fixing some of the behavior, I doubt they'll fix the fundamental platforming to make it actually fun.\n\nI think the people making this game enjoyed it a lot more than you'll enjoy playing it.  Can't quite recommend it.","December 18, 2014","false","3.0"," 90 of 164 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","90","164","0","2"

I love the artistic style and was immediately drawn to the story of Nuna, a young girl whose life is saved by an Arctic Fox. Together with the fox who can speak to the arctic spirits, they set out to find out why the blizzards are so severe, which is causing her village to starve. I'm not going to go into the story in much detail because of spoilers, but it is well written, and very atmospheric, being voiced in the native language with subtitles. It is a unique and interesting way of telling a folk tale that very few people would otherwise get to hear.\n\nEducation\nThrough playing the story you unlock informational panels which make up a video documentary taken to explain the life of the Iñupiat people. As the game tells us, this is a "living people, a living culture" - this is not ancient history, these are the people that still live in Northern Alaska today. This is their way of life. I found this extremely interesting and learned a lot about a cultural heritage I would not have explored otherwise. The mesh between game and documentary is a superb way to promote education in different cultures, tradition and language. I really hope that we get more games that can do this so well.\n\nGameplay\nNever Alone is a linear, story driven game with basic puzzle and platform elements. You can switch between controlling the Nuna or Fox, and a co-op partner can take the form of Fox in local co-op only, making it a relaxing couch co-op game. I could see this being a fantastic game to play along with a child. Unfortunately, the platforming can be frustrating, as the controls are somewhat clunky and the animations slow and at times awkward. In a platformer, the last thing you want is to feel like your character is dying because of a lack of responsiveness, and this is sometimes the case with this game. The puzzles and interactions and actual mechanics are very simple, but I found them fun and engaging, but the platforming is mediocre at best. The game was also let down a little by some bugs and glitches; I had to restart a few times to get past places where my character had glitched.\n\nThe Foxtales DLC adds a separate short story and takes around 1 hour to complete, as well as unlocking five more videos. It adds a few minor mechanics, and has quite a different setting to the original game as it's mostly underwater. I enjoyed it just as much as the original. You will need to complete the DLC in addition to the main story if you would like to get 100% achievements, which can be obtained on one playthrough by simply completing the game, the DLC and unlocking all the Cultural Insights.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are looking for a good story, beautiful aesthetics and an interesting new culture to explore. If you are purely looking for a platformer; this is definitely not the game for you. Thumbs up - but be prepared to watch your characters die a few times, and it won't be your fault.\n\nA unique game, mixing interesting culture, storytelling, language and art. Let down by the clunky gameplay, but still a great experience.","February 29","true","6.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I think it is a wonderful game, even if its relatively short, that tells a great story and has great art design to go with it.  It is suitable for people of any age and has a wonderful message of friendship, teamwork, and perseverence (to name a few), and a great way to learn a bit about some of the people we live among.  I would love to see more added to this, whether more stories added to the game itself or maybe a sequal game that adds more of the stories and more about the people.\n\nHowever, the gameplay as it is is better suited for more advanced players who are well familiar with platformer games and love these types, but beginners might find it a bit difficult or too challenging and really talented gamers may find it too easy.  I would suggest adding a difficulty ratng to counter this problem.  Beginners could start out with easy (or casual), normal could be the current game play for those who are familiar with platformers and find the difficulty just right, and a hard mode for the gamers who find the current gameplay too easy for them.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the Bola.  Now, I didn't get the game until after the first update which fixed the Bola aiming so I don't know how bad it was before.  I don't think the aiming itself is bad now, but I think some people will find it a bit difficult to do when you're in a bind, in example, being chased by the wicked man.  It would be cool if there could be an option to change how you aim the bola, on controllers, to make it easier for the more beginner players, but also keep how it is for those who find the current aiming suitable.  By adding a change of aiming, allow the Bola to be aimed by thumbstick or d-pad and released by another button.\n\nOne last thing.  Online co-op.  I really think that the game could benefit from it.  Letting friends play together who can't just come over and share a computer to play the game.  I know all this stuff takes time to learn and do, but I think online co-op is a great option to consider to help reach more people.  I would so play this game again with friends to help them through the game and learn about the story and the people it came from.\n\nBut all in all its a good start and hope to see more.","January 23, 2015","true","5.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

For one, it's a documentary pretending to be a video game, leaving most of the game aspects subpar at best.  Controls are sluggish and glitchy, often resulting in the main character getting stuck midair or falling to her death after sliding off of a cliff due to the delay between commanding her to jump and her actually jumping.  Other issues include poor camera management that occasionally leaves one character off screen and inconsistent mechanics that allow water to kill you in most levels except one.  Lastly, controlling the Bola is a huge pain and pretty much impossible to use with any real accuracy.\n\nMost of the puzzles consist merely of jumping from one ledge to another.  I'd say there are less than 5 actual puzzles (consisting of more than just platforming) in the entire game, summing to less than 30 minutes of play time.  These puzzles were enjoyable, but you do spend an awful lot of time simply walking and jumping from left to right.\n\nThe culture insights to the Alaskan natives are very well presented and you're pretty much guaranteed to unlock all 24 of them as you play through the game.  I think only 2 of them are missable.  Watching these videos as they unlock is necessary in order to understand the content of each level (such as why the northern lights want to hug you to death or why midget natives live underground), yet some of the videos also spoil upcoming game content in the levels.  So you lose out on the gaming aspects if you watch the videos but you lose out on understanding the setting if you don't.  This makes for a lose-lose situation either way.\n\nThe game itself directly follows a story of the Alaskan natives, and I'd say each level fits very well with the narration.  The story isn't spectacular, but at least it adds some meaning to your otherwise suicidal wandering through the blizzard.  There's only one thing about the story I didn't understand: how does chipping an axe have anything to do with caribou feet?  This is a rather strange ending to an otherwise interesting fable about the cause of a blizzard.","April 10","false","4.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

She is saved by an Arctic fox who then becomes her companion. They both then set off to find the source of the eternal blizzard meeting friends and foes along the way to try and save their way of life.\n\nNearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game. The story of the game combines different folklore tales of the Alaskan natives and produces some wonderful, atmospheric storytelling. The game is narrated by a native elder who speaks in their native language throughout. The whole narration is very well done and due to the fact that the narrator is speaking in the native language it not only adds a degree of gravitas to the story but also a sense of atmosphere.\n\nGraphically the game looks great. The Arctic setting looks great its mix of black, blues and whites all make for a very eye pleasing vivid look. The game visually reminds me of a cross between Brothers and child of light at times. The mixture of the 3d and 2d works really well and the effects such as lighting, snow winds and more look good and provide great atmosphere. The soundtrack of the game is also wonderfully composed and adds to the ambiance of the various situations and story points throughout.\n\nIn terms of game play you must use both Nuna and the fox to accomplish different tasks in order to progress. Similar to Brothers, Nuna and the fox both have different roles. Nuna can climb ladders and ropes, move heavy obstacles, and throw her bola at targets. Where as the fox fit through small areas, scramble up walls, jump to great heights and can control spirits that come to help you. In single player you can seamlessly switch between the two at any time allowing you adapt to any given situation or puzzle.\n\nYou can use either use mouse and keyboard or a controller to play the game. The game has clear been designed with the joysticks of a controller in mind particularly throwing Nuna's Bola and so I would recommend using one if you have one.\n\nAs you go through the eight chapters in the game you'll come across a variety of puzzles and your run of the mill platforming to take care off. Usually you'll need to you both characters abilities to overcome hurdles such as moving a crate with Nuna so the fox can jump, then run up a wall to the throw a rope down so Nuna can climb up. As the game progresses Nuna and the fox will gain some other abilities such as Nuna's bola which is a throwing weapon that Nuna can use to break objects among other things.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are done fairly well and all work well in the arctic setting. The folklore adds really colorful elements and characters to the game such as spirits who help to traverse land. Like in any puzzle platformer, as you progress the puzzles become more difficult however theres nothing that requires more than a couple of tries to get right. Should you find yourself dying the game has a regular checkpoint system denoted by owls along the levels.\n\nAs well as the single player, you also have drop in co op which works really well. Having a friend control either Nuna or the Fox can not only be fun but also allow you to progress much faster and smoother. However you will require a spare controller to play co-op..\n\nWhile the Never Alone hits the right marks in terms of looks, atmosphere and story it does currently have a number of issues. Firstly something that hopefully the developers will try and iron out as soon as possible is the sheer amount of bugs in the game. In several major places in the game I found a couple of bugs that hampered my progress briefly and I had to restart from a checkpoint to continue.\n\nAt one part in the game I was getting chased by a polar bear until you reach an ice bridge. Now whats supposed to happen is the bear steps on the bridge and falls into the water which triggers a water spirit to carry Nuna and the fox across the water. However on several occasions this scene bugged and the bear wouldn't step on the bridge causing the ice just to break apart and causing me to die over and over until it after on reset the bug was no longer present.\n\nAnother issue is in the single player mode only. Because you can only control one character at a time the other follows. Sadly if your in danger say for example someone is throwing rocks at you the non controlled character sometimes forgets to move and dies which can get annoying.\n\nOne of the great aims of the game is to educate people on the culture of Alaskan natives. They have done this by putting insights which you unlock through playing. Insights are short videos which you can watch anytime that explain different parts of the culture. It was a great way to implement this in the game and some of the short videos contain really interesting information.\n\nAs a whole Never Alone is very well produced. While it does have some minor hiccups along the way. It is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle platformer that not only allows you to traverse beautifully crafted Arctic environments. But its a video game about sharing and ultimately celebrating a culture. Not only does the game provide entertainment but it harnesses to some degree the mediums other potentials such as education.","November 18, 2014","true","8.1"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","1"

It's also a documentary short film about traditional Iñupiat culture. Iñupiat folklore has some beautiful (and perhaps wise) concepts concerning harmony with nature, and while, like me, you may not find all the film clips interesting, some definitely are. I enjoyed the anecdotal segments especially. Also, the mythological segments (although I originally intended to skip them) do add meaning to the games highly fantastical story.\n\nFEELS: I was surprised how quickly and deeply I engaged with the characters. I think cuteness lead to empathy and empathy lead to tension. Some utterances potentially overheard by my neighbours included "NO....... NO..............", "WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥", and "CLIMB LITTLE FOX, CLIMB!". The swift, brutal deaths, magnified by your companions heartbreaking reaction, are a little disturbing and slightly guilt inducing, for me evoking slight semblance to LIMBO, except more family friendly.\n\nGAMEPLAY/PUZZLES: Speaking of LIMBO, Never Alone is way more puzzle-platformer than I was expecting; and I found the specific puzzle design more frustrating than engaging, particularly in the second half as the platforming puzzles became increasingly time limited. I died and retried a lot at some points, often left asking "but where am I supposed to go?". From a design perspective, I like puzzles, and I like intense chase scenes, but I dislike when the two are combined and I'm not given sufficient direction or time to ponder an obstacle. I suspect I could have benefited a lot from the local co-op mode, had I had a foxy friend free for furry frolicing.\n\nEdit: After playing Valiant Hearts: The Great War, the gameplay and controls in Never Alone could only be seen as "average"; not terrible but not mind blowing either. They are tertiary to the games cuteness and mythology, and would not be satisfactory if it were any longer.\n\nPRICE: Another potential neg is $15 USD may be a little high for a 3 hour game, according to Steamland precedent. I personally picked it up on sale and feel I paid an appropriate sum o' dosh.\n\nAbove caveats notwithstanding, I'm recommending this because I feel it's one of those somewhat well executed, short & sweet little indies which don't come along too often.","August 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","2"

The 3D art is gorgeous (though I'm not a fan of the 2D style) as is the story of the Alaskan people told through mini documentary videos.\n\nWhat isn't beatiful is the gameplay. Very basic platforming with increasingly more insta-kill sections as you progress, as well as terrible AI that has been responsible for at least 75% of all my deaths (if the AI misses a jump, stands in the wrong place on a crushing platform or lags just a tad too far behind you and gets grabbed by moving enemies it counts as a death and you go back to the last checkpoint). The game may very well be better played co-op, but that's not an option for me, and the AI consistently lets me down. It's not just bad; it actively takes leaps of faith and fails, killing you without any input on your part, forcing you to repeat a section up to 10 times (in my experiance).\n\nI want to like this game, I really do. I beleive it IS a great game for the first two reasons, and the platforming has a couple of good moments, but overall it's a frustrating game that gives no guidance and often requires you to die to know what you have to do during action sequences. I've even died during cutscenes. It's a nice idea poorly implimented. So with a heavy heart, as a videogame I can't recommend this, but if you want some great environment art and cultural interest, then I do.\n\n[Edit] The final sequence is the worst gameplay I've experienced from any game for a very long time. I would not be surprised if most players gave up trying at this point. The AI doesn't follow, which kills you; the AI doesn't avoid enemies, which kills you; you have to wait for timed gusts of wind, if if you miss more than one, all you can do is wait for death. It's unbeleivable they thought such punishing, unenjoyable, unfair gameplay was good enough to ship. I can't un-recommend the gameplay enough.","March 1","false","4.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There are also "Cultural Insight" videos that you can collect through the game that share little pieces of Iñupiat culture.\nThe only weak spot I see in this game is in its puzzles, specifically the level of difficulty. Most of the game is extremely easy but there are some spots where the difficulty seems to ramp up pretty high. It may be less difficult using a controller but some of the movements felt really awkward with a keyboard and mouse, The challenging puzzles are mainly difficult because they are not very intuitive in game.\nI didn't think I would like the co-op mode or controlling two characters in singleplayer but the gameplay here was very well thought out. You need both characters to finish the game, one character doesn't overpower the other. The best puzzles in this game come from trying to  maneuver the two characters without one of them falling off a cliff while the other character uses their abilities to open a passageway,\n\n***small edit***During my second play through I noticed that some of the gameplay mechanics made some areas more difficult than others. There seem to be some areas that follow different "rules" than the others (like the girl or the fox automatically following or not). This made some puzzles very frusterating.

While part story, part platformer, and part documentary/education it’s hard to label this game, which ultimately leads to its appeal.\n\nWhile the art is wonderful, the platform elements are what keep this game from being perfect. Bugged by poor controls and wonky bugs, the game suffers at times and becomes dangerously (like pre rage quit) frustrating. Some of the puzzles and/or figuring where to go next can increase this frustration. On one episode in particular, I had to restart the game to actually get the NPC to do what it was supposed to.\n\nOn a mechanics level, quite a few people have complained about the bola mechanics but in my opinion its no different than firing like in a bubble shooting game or even Angry Birds. Those that have difficulty with keyboard controls will ultimately have to resort to using a controller, which is a blessing.\n\nThe game really shines in the story telling department as well as the interesting information and history.\n\nPros –\nDrop dead gorgeous\nImmersive atmosphere\nBeautifully rendered, you feel like you are in a Pixar film\nExcellent use of Documentary information\nAdorable main characters\nNice blend of story and platform.\n\nCons-\nBuggy game mechanics\nBuggy scripting\nSome difficult maneuvers\nPeople not used to using keyboard controls may have difficulty\nFrustrating difficulty spikes (easy, then suddenly hard)\nAnnoying recurring themes (like the wind gusts)\nLimited replayability\n\nOverall, 8/10. Would not pay full price but when purchased on sale it’s a must own. A worthy addition to anyone’s library and a unique game that belongs in its own genre niche.\n\nIf you have difficulty using arrow keys or WASD to control a character on a 2d Left to Right type game and do not have a control, I do not recommend this game to you.\n","February 10","true","5.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The fairy tale has an instructive character which, it is necessary to notice, not at once becomes clear. The history tells about Kunuuksaayuk (the image of world danger) the Little girl of Nong whom you operate, a problem which happened to the village – an infinite blizzard, you go to look for its source and you meet the fluffy assistant. A polar fox – in culture of these people a pet & along with it, a magic & not clear being, the conductor to the world. Together with it Nong goes for travel through Alaska. The history though from other culture, but allows to remember for itself something important.\n\nGame looks extremely, And the polar fox can sometimes mix up with the snow, is painfully realistic - that he reacts grumbles and looks. Some photos hypnotize, in them there is a desire simply to look.\n\nThe gameplay doing boasting of games something fascinating. Formally it is a usual platformer more, than something. The gameplay is in work, it is simple that it is necessary to reach from point A & B, by means of wind jumps. At some moment travel, a blizzard starts blowing more strongly, blowing off heroes. Unfortunately, game has diseases of the worst representatives of a genre. The hero sometimes doesn't reach a ledge, utykatsya in is mute, but doesn't cling, in general some time unfairly ignores. In game there is a cooperative, 1 of 2 options. Playing together it can simplify a task to seem surprising. You can always give game to intelligence to be simplified. Constantly one of the main characters, remaining without management, does something, except silent expectation.\n\nThe most important part of game - "A deviation to culture". In it 24 surprising videos speaking about inupiat life are collected, from beauty of Alaska the jaw sometimes hangs down, there is a desire to observe & revise again these short videos lessons. Rollers "are given" both for passing of game and for gathering of the hidden owls. In both cases you receive them in time. You ask - "that occurs?" literally in a minute you will find a roller which will explain to you that around occurs. Videos are released by real inupiata, they speak English which surrounds them. Some deviations add cultural shock., the narration goes about hunting by means of boats and copies, then in the history there is a mobile phone & the helicopter, it upsets, it is necessary to reconsider again to be convinced that all heard correctly.\n\nLove similar projects, so make it! also don't feel sorry for effort. Don't pass the unusual project, I similar didn't see long ago. My assessment 8.5\10.","November 30, 2014","true","5.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","2"

While I’m not familiar with the story itself, so I can’t speak for how close it is to the original or how well adapted it was, I can say it is (at least in so far as I played it) definitely a very beautiful story, with gorgeous graphics and sound effects/music to match.\nVisually, the game is striking. Playing it… it leaves a lot to be desired.\nIn Never Alone you switch between two characters: a young girl named Nuna and an Arctic Fox, who go in search of the source of a neverending blizzard in order to stop it and save her people. The puzzles are fairly average, and the controls for the game aren’t what I would call the most comfortable ever but they are also not too bad (WASD, space, and a couple other keys)… when they work. For you see, as beautiful as the game is, the performance leaves a lot to be desired.\nIt took 4 levels of menu to reach the detailed video settings, and even at its lowest, it performed poorly on my computer. This is rather undesirable, particularly when your introduction to the game involves being chased by a polar bear who likes to glitch back and forth when performance falls, and having to jump lots. Failure to run from it or jump properly results in your death and having to begin from the last checkpoint. Or, you know, glitching the game and running as an invisible form until you reach the fox and then running on and on and having to restart yourself because that’s clearly getting you nowhere…\nThe game does have many glitches and annoyances. Walls are sometimes impossible to jump onto, the camera can become uncomfortable, the fox can become a little bit unhelpful, you may fall forever from the map, and you will die because of all of these… a lot. It’s one of those games that when it works, it’s a wonder to play for the story and visuals, but when it doesn’t you just want to flip a table and never touch it again.\nIf you manage to get through the entire eight chapters, you will be rewarded by unlocking the entirety of a documentary on the Iñupiat. What little I managed to unlock of it looked both interesting and very well done, but as beautiful as the game was, the annoyances were much greater than my desire to watch the documentary.\nAll in all, for the story, looks and sounds, and the documentary, as well as the obvious interest in making more people aware of the Iñupiat, I would like to rate this game highly; but the amount of times low performance and glitches caused my death ended up making me quite frustrated. If you have a low specs PC I would definitely not recommend you try it.\nIf you have a decent PC you may still get some glitches, but if you’re interested in the story, it might be worth seeing if it works, as it is quite a beautiful experience when it works.","June 4","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

And while it certainly looks nice and the girl and fox couple is charming, the controls and thus the gameplay are a huge turn-off.\n\nAiming the "boomerang" weapon - which has to be used on a regular basis to progress - is a chore, especially with a controller. Controls in general feel sluggish which is obviously a big no-no for a platformer. The game itself is rather glitchy and badly scripted as well which got me stuck more than a few times within the short period I played.\n\nOverall, I'm very disappointed and wouldn't recommend the game in its current state despite the nice atmosphere and interesting traditional aspects.","June 6","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's well paced so you don't get bored, and the puzzles usually aren't repeated more than once, so it keeps everything fresh.  The game I would probably compare it to the most would be the Trine trilogy.  Solve puzzles by switching between the Wolf and Nauna who can both do different things to progress through the levels.

I've played a few platformers on different platforms, but this one is simply not a good game. While it is a decent story, the mechanics are slow and clunky. I have often times gotten upset over how slowly you drag things even. Not to mention that the AI for the absent player sometimes fails to make jumps, causing you to repeat sections you could have passed easily. Also, there is a major shift in play style halfway through the game that just seemed cheesy and made the game less fun to play.

Co-op in single player is annoying - quite often your AI controlled co-op partner will die on their own forcing a restart. Luckily there are a lot of checkpoints so you never have to replay a lot. But checkpoints tend to bug as well - on a few occasions after dying I was respawned at checkpoint AFTER the place I died not being able to replay the section.\n\nPuzzles why not bad are also not innovative at all, they are average but are brought down by the fact that you mostly fail them because of clumsy controls.\n\nEducational material, while very interesting, is presented in worst way possible. Instead of learning in-game you unlock parts of documentary movie through your playthrough, each time you unlock something new you are supposed to pause the game and watch the new part of the movie which totally breaks immersion.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful Artstyle\nHeartwarming Story\nGreat Sound and Voice-over\nDocumentary material itself\n\nCons:\nClumsy Controls\nWeak Platforming\nUninspired Puzzles\nPresentation of Documentary breaking immersion\n\nAll in all the the only good reason to get this game is that it's beautiful, but if you're interested in educational value watching the movie separately is much better idea, same if you're looking for puzzle platformer - there are also many better and less frustrating ones.","March 11","false","7.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","3"

It really adds an unique touch to it. Some kind of cutsenes show parts of the story you are experiencing in a beautiful way which reminds me a bit of Journey. In the end you'll learn where said story is based on. I loved the fact that it's one of the last things you'll learn. Like it sums up everything. The little insight videos you can unlock every now and then really add to the atmosphere and the game. It's like a documentary, but better. I've learned a whole lot out of this game and some insights even surprised me. The scenes and music chosen for those videos were really beautiful. They made me even tear up at some parts.  /don't judge me, I got really caught up in the story ;_;\n\n\nThe gameplay itself is great. I used a controller and it worked fine. I'd actually recommend a controller over the keyboard, it seems a lot easier this way.  The game runs really smooth, the graphics itself are just BEAUTIFUL and I love the overall atmosphere. It can create a creepy, cold, beautiful or whatsoever feeling. It's great.\nI ran into some bugs every now and then, like glitching through the platforms, but I can't complain in any way. I don't know about the co-op, but I can see it working well. No framedrops, no nothing. Everything was fine.\nSome parts can get a bit frustrating because you have to be fast and basically switch between the characters frequently. But it's not that bad, it took me a few tries to figure out the right way. The only negative point at those parts would be the sounds of the howling wind. It's reeaaally loud sometimes and I got a headache of it for hearing it over and over. You can set the volume lower though, so that's probably a flaw on my end.\nI suppose it can get a bit boring for some people though. It didn't for me, just wanted to point that out.~\n\nConclusion: So.. overall this will definetely be one of my favorite games from now on. It can't beat e.g. Journey and To The Moon for me, but it is a masterpiece in itself and I'd buy it again without a doubt if I had to. With it's great narration and graphics, it feels just like getting told a story in a way that makes everything come to life around you. It's almost magical. It CAN get a bit frustrating at some points, but that's completely fine. It's a game after all, it is supposed to be challenging, even if it's just for a short amount of time. If you're even thinking about getting the game, then go get it! It's really not that expensive compared to other (worse) games and you'll even gain something out of it.\n\ntl;dr: Beautiful, interactive documentary. Awesome graphics and gameplay and a great story. Well worth it's price. Would recommend everyone to at least give it a try.","November 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iharlequin/recommended/295790/","iharlequin","арлекин","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iharlequin/","473 products in account","Review with images @ https://voxludicus.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/review-never-alone-kisima-ingitchuna/\n\nThe first documentary released on film was Robert Flahnook's Nanook of the North, an ethnography filmed more than ninety years ago that shows the struggles of an Inuit family in the Canadian Arctic. It is an odd, but pleasant coincidence that the first video game documentary you get to play through revisits this region, telling a short tale that has its roots in the Alaskan Iñupiat people.\n\nNever Alone is, more than anything else, a documentary - not only in its Cultural Insights segments you can find throughout the game by locating the sometimes hidden owls, which are short, filmed clips of Iñupiat people (with care to interview both old and young people) talking about topics ranging from their customs, nature, family and tradition - but in the way the game's own story is told. Adapted from Robert Nasruk Cleveland's retelling of Kunuuksaayuka, Never Alone's story follows a girl named Nuna and her pet arctic fox on their journey to find out the cause of a never-ending blizzard - a journey where they, and you, will meet creatures of Iñupiat myth and lore, and the events will be described to you by a man in Iñupiat language, as if you were hearing an elder tell you a story of his people.\n\nThe bridge that connects the player to the proper documentary Never Alone is is the gameplay. You'll traverse multiple levels, each with their own theme but all in the Alaskan permafrost, alternating between Nuna and her fox. Nuna is capable of dragging and pushing things, as well as using a bola you find early in the game to break things and call spirits. The fox can fit in smaller places and climb vertical walls, as well as jump from one wall to another and bring forth any spirits that might be hidden in the levels. These spirits offer help by means of serving as platforms, dangling ropes and climbing creatures that can bring Nuna to places she alone can't reach.\n\nSadly, said bridge is closer to a makeshift creation rather than a proper, strong one. The game is easy throughout its entirety, but you'll often find yourself being sent to a previous checkpoint because it failed to register you grabbing a spirit's edge or a jump of yours glitched at a ladder's corner. Playing alone I also couldn't help but feel that certain segments were made for co-op play and poorly optimized for the single-player experience: at one point you'll have to evade ghosts who want to use your head for eskimo football, and having to restart a section will happen often, as the character you don't play as will always follow you and will always lag behind. It's a bridge you'll still be able to cross, but most of my failures would be better defined as the game's failures.\n\nThe game's graphics work well to flesh out the frozen beauty of northern Alaska, with a detailed foreground that stands against the looming vastness of its varied background, where you'll see from the frozen wastes of the arctic to its starry nights and northern lights. The game's soundtrack is properly downplayed, enhancing the feeling of solitude in frosty Alaska, but what really adds character to the game is the Iñupiat voiceover telling you the story as you play it.\n\nIt took me a bit more than six hours to finish the game, and I felt satisfied with what I played. There's little reason to come back if you've already gathered all the cultural insights, though I say that not as a flaw - the game is about conveying a story and introducing you to the Iñupiat's culture, and to tack anything else on for the sake of replayability or length would feel like unnecessary filler, specially because the gameplay doesn't hold itself as a main reason for playing Never Alone.\n\nNever Alone would be better called an interactive documentary than a game. While the gameplay is a weak foundation and alone would not be able to uphold Never Alone, its narrative and documentary aspects strike out as solid pillars, and made me want to go through the game's middling gameplay just to hear more about the Iñupiat from the Iñupiat, and have their stories told to me as they tell to their own. I left the game knowing a bit more about a different people and its traditions, and plenty of curiosity to learn more about them - and that's what I thought Never Alone was about, something it delivers exceedingly well.","July 31, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The core of the gameplay is solid, if not great-- this type of sidescrolling puzzle platformer and single player coop gameplay style has already been done better in many other games, including Limbo, Trine, Lost Vikings, and others, but that doesn't make it bad. Finally, the game and its developer should be commended for attempting to create a game that reflects indigenous culture, values, and art while also educating players about a culture with which they are most likely unfamiliar, and using profits to help fund education in Alaskan Native communities.\n\nThe mechanical execution, unfortunately, prevents it from being a satisfying and enjoyable gaming experience, in my view. I'll put it this way: if you play Never Alone, you WILL occasionally die due to the sluggish, imprecise controls and fiddly platforming. This is basically guaranteed. You can also expect to be forced to replay some sections because your AI companion couldn't keep up with you or decided to wander into a trap or off a cliff. You may die due to the camera's frequent inability to keep both characters in sight. And it's quite possible scripting errors or other bugs will force you to replay some sections-- this happened to me at least two or three times during my playthrough, including one point where a platform failed to materialize when it should have.\n\nAs a gamer, I am extremely tolerant of bugs, lack of polish, and unbalanced or even broken gameplay when I enjoy other aspects of a game enough. I will happily choose to play a messy but interesting game over a polished, forgettable one any day. But I don't think it's asking too much to expect a three to four hour game to be consistently fun for at least most of its duration. I probably spent over half of my relatively brief playtime in Never Alone frustrated or annoyed by one thing or another, and this makes it hard to recommend for anyone simply looking for a good game. However, if you-- like me-- support the developer's goal of preserving indigenous culture and folklore, educating the public, and promoting diversity in game development while also bringing money and attention to a worthy cause, it may be worth a purchase. I do genuinely hope the developer does well and gets to make many more games like this, as there is much to admire in what they've done here, and I hope that their success encourages others to follow suit. I just hope their efforts in the future will produce better games than Never Alone.\n\nAs a side note, the unlockable "cultural insight" videos are interesting to watch, easily digestible, and may arguably add value to the overall package, but I personally would have preferred a short documentary film that provides a better overview and more context, rather than a collection of brief, individual vignettes that don't provide insights so much as glimpses into a culture.","March 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I absolutely love what the developers set out to do, the game succeeds in its goals of educating players about a unique culture and way of life, and I think that the way in which the game was developed in collaboration with an alaskan native people is a beautiful approach, that will perhaps inspire other developers to do similar things.\n\nYounger generations are becoming increasingly native to digital media and environments, so it makes sense to adapt and preserve as much human culture as possible in a format that will appeal to a modern and future audience. So, for that reason alone I would reccomend this game.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the game itself uninspiring. The controls were unreliable, the puzzles and traps were irritating, rather than providing the player with a satisfying sense of accomplishment, there were physics glitches, and although the interaction between the girl and fox was novel at first, it was not enough to set it apart.\n\nUltimately the game itself undermined the story and atmosphere, and I couldn't help wondering if the overall experience would be better if it was stripped bare of the cumbersome mechanics, a thought echoed by the friends I was playing with.","November 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I do genuinely hope the developer does well and gets to make many more games like this, as there is much to admire in what they've done here, and I hope that their success encourages others to follow suit. I just hope their efforts in the future will produce better games than Never Alone.\n\nAs a side note, the unlockable "cultural insight" videos are interesting to watch, easily digestible, and may arguably add value to the overall package, but I personally would have preferred a short documentary film that provides a better overview and more context, rather than a collection of brief, individual vignettes that don't provide insights so much as glimpses into a culture.","March 7, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have Native American background myself, and the idea of finally being able to play a game that incorporates traditional stories and Native culture into its gameplay after years of playing games overflowing with influence from European mythos sounded wonderful. Kudos to the creators for authenticity: Never Alone is a beautifully genuine and earnest game, and at times I got chills because of how familiar the ideas depicted in the game are, especially those talked about in the cultural insights. I've seen Never Alone described as an interactive Ghibli movie; that's a fair description, because this game is both atmospheric and magical.\n\nThe praise ends there because Never Alone has major problems. The Ghibli comparison might be fair, but it's certainly not deserved. Never Alone plays like a SNES era 2D sidescrolling platformer (think Donkey Kong Country); 2D platformers aren't exactly known for their sense of adventure, exploration, or heck, even world building, but typically they aren't this monotone. The wintry, arctic atmosphere is utterly unrelenting and there's no variety. Every area is virtually indistinguishable with few, if any, unique traits to separate one wintry, arctic landscape from the other wintry, arctic landscapes. I understand the purpose is to create a cold, hopeless atmosphere, to make the players feel as if they are being assaulted by the blizzard themselves, but when the entire game is like this it just becomes dull.\n\nThe other tremendous problem is the controls. They're clunky, slow, and just difficult. The keyboard layout is a struggle to use efficiently and the controls can't be remapped to a custom configuration either; I tried using a controller but the bola, a key part of the gameplay, is essentially unusable on a controller so that's just not an option. Movement is slow, swimming is worse, and general maneuvering makes the actual platforming far more difficult than it should be if it the gameplay wasn't so clunky and sluggish.\n\nUnfortunately, that describes the general gameplay as well. The blizzard mechanic is tiresome and frustrating. It probably would have been okay if it was implemented sparingly, but the frequency of its intrusion where you're blown around (often to your death) just because you didn't hit Ctrl soon enough or just slowed down for no reason whatsoever isn't fun, it's tiring. The platforming puzzles are fairly basic and also are often less fun than they are tedious, especially because of the sluggish and clunky controls. The final "level" culminates the frustration because there are death traps everywhere, yet they'd be pretty easily avoided if the controls were more fluid.\n\nHonestly, this is another example of why Steam should have a neutral option for review feedback, because it's still worth trying despite the flaws. The cultural exposure and the way it is incorporated into the game is lovely, and that permeates the entire experience. It's just that the execution needed a lot more refinement. I was lucky enough to get this for essentially nothing via a Humble Bundle; at the current $15 price tag this absolutely isn't worth it unless you're one of those people obsessed with snow and winter like Jari Mäenpää, in which case go crazy I guess.","May 22","false","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, at some point, the game just stopped working (CtD before even the title screen), and following all the recommendations (update driver, etc. etc.) didn't fix it. (I reinstalled several times after to see whether maybe there'd been an updated that fixed it.) Seeing as the game was fun enough to keep me playing, but not super-fantastic, that's when I threw in the towel. Shame too, as I like the idea of edutainment, and would have been up for buying follow-up games exploring other cultures.

As an experience and a story, it is exhilarating. It is a semi-guided tour of Alaska and the fables of the Iñupiaq, a place unknown to much of us.\n\nThe documentary portion of the game is nicely woven into the story and gameplay; informational clips of Alaska and the Iñupiaq people are unlocked by reaching certain points (some obvious, some hidden) of the game. These clips can be reached and watched with a simple tab-key. Once you're done, you can then quickly return to your explorations with another single press of the button. The game's atmosphere is exquisite, sometimes breathtaking and sometimes haunting, and always constantly evoking the harsh beauty of Alaska and its cold winds.\n\nOn the other hand, the game itself is linear and short (roughly 3 hours). There is only one major path through the game, and any detours you can take will barely last half a minute and are only there for hidden documentary clips. Further, the controls can be awkward and imprecise, and glitches can sometimes frustratingly send you slipping into a bottomless pit. On that note, the game fortunately frequently auto-saves after every platformer puzzle, so that glitches and your own slips won't set you too far back.\n\nUltimately, Never Alone is an educational tale, an interactive story. The story it tells and the experience it delivers is well-worth the time and the purchase. Plus, I heartily recommend any game that delivers a positive message like this:\n\nKisima Inŋitchuŋa: "I am not alone"\n\nRemember that.","September 30, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It made me want to know more about pre-colonial North American history a little, the graphics are suprisingly good and the control are also fairly tight too.\n\nBut, in the few hours I've made so far, that's further than 50% of people and a) the developers should really have given us a reticule for the bola, I'm sure I'm not the first to say this and b) despite being an ambient-style game, I've died more than in dark souls...\n\nIf the developers wanted to recreate the feeling of isolations, difficulty and fear (which would entirely fit with the theme) - then great. But the game needs to provide more internal prompts if so.  When you're forced to revert to a walkthrough because you were doing it corretly but it requires pixel perfect precision, it doesn't seem to fit with the intent of the game - which seems primarily to be a mechanism to teach about a particular society.\n\nRegardless, so far, it's fun and intresting - probably best watching a walkthrough if you want to progress though!

The game play centers around using each of the characters' abilities to proceed further in the level and supports local co-op. The story is a teling of an old native story, comprising different elements of the culture in question. The game I'm most reminded of is Brothers: a Tale of two Sons. The two-part puzzle solving draws a lot of parallels, but is designed for two people to play. The story is nice and told in the native language of the people; unfortunatly if you don't speak native Alaskan, you'll have to read the subtitles. The game is short (about 3-4 hours). If you like documentaries, there is about 30 minutes of native Alaskan people talking about their culture, which is enlightening.\n\nI can recommend this game with a couple of stipulations: the first is that I would suggest watching each unlockable part of the documentary after each level. It will provide a good pace and won't break flow. The second and most important is that you should grab a friend to play the co-op with. unlike Brothers, this game's play style was designed for two people to work together, and even though you can switch between the two characters, several portions of the early game and most of the late game requires them to act near simultaneously, which can make the game play sticky and frusterating if you are playing by yourself.","January 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/recommended/295790/","actherian","Therian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/","483 products in account","Now, I'm not the biggest fan of platform games. I used to have pretty much no choice but to play them having grown up with the likes of Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario World, but never did have any real patience or skill, 3D platformers made that a lot easier later on, like with Spyro the Dragon and those became bigger favourites, though still far from my most favourite genre (if I can ever decide what that is! I love RPGs, but RPGs can be platformers, point & click, FPS...)\n\nStill, having won this game over at SteamGifts[www.steamgifts.com] from a kind user giving away a copy (I've given away well over a hundred games myself too, all different.) I entered a couple of others before winning, as you do, but only enter for games I believe I will eventually play fairly, either to completion or at least invest a few hours, no matter how long that takes.\n\nNever Alone somehow quickly rose to the top of my play list. I'd heard good things about its play style, characters, art style... You name it. In-particular stories from why others had it on their wishlists, which would vary from wanting the trading cards to loving the idea of playing the fox. One person even commented they'd planned to play with their younger brother, but had kept arguing over who'd play who! Numa or the Fox.\n\nAdvertised as co-op, I had no idea how would play both characters at once, but the AI was (mostly) top-notch, a little silly at some points, but it was easy to swap between characters, and many of the puzzles were interesting, fun and requiring a little thought, usually just to slow down and think them through. It even kept me interested for the entire time I played, though my heart skipped a beat at one scene when the Manhunter snaps the foxes' neck. This is completely unavoidable, and story related, but heart crunching, even though he does come back almost immediately with new powers, a reborn spirit.\n\nThe added short videos are well worth watching too, for they tell the story of the Alaskan natives and how they have survived in that environment. Their culture, history and how they live in their communities, in many respects, a lesson much of the world also needs to learn once more.\n\nIn short, we'd break this down into positives and negatives.\n\nPOSITIVE Great Artwork Style with realistic movement in both animal and human.\nInnovative puzzles ranging from the usual timing of movements to having to use the weather to your advantage.\nHD Quality Mini-Movies, telling the history of the Alaskan Natives and a bit of extra backstory into the actual scenario\nEasily played both in single-player & co-op mode. I hadn't even tried with another person, but did setup so I could control both at once for one or two levels just to practice for fun.\nStory. The story itself is relatively short and simple in practice, yet it holds an important lesson that can be interprated in different ways, all to a positive. Myself I took away that even the weakest, or most unlikely, person can make a a true difference. Nuna was but a small girl, yet she braved what the others would not. Ever curious about the blizzard threatening her village.\nNEGATIVES Missing elements to the story. Such as why the Man-Hunter, or at least the Iñupiat version of the Big Bad Wolf, wanted Nuna's Bola, and how he hadn't found it from the Owl Man. Or how her village, supposedly destroyed by him, was inhabitated again once she had returned, fleeing from the Ice Giant.. I went back to the relevant chapters 2~3 times, and viewed ALL the cinematics, but could not find answers to these.\nSome may disagree, in fact I'm sure many will. But I'd unfortunately have to place the Soundtrack here. If there was much of a soundtrack at all, I'd have missed it entirely. It did not stand out for me at all, had any played. Mainly only during cinematic movies, or one time at the village. Not any kind of obvious or consistent soundtrack.\nSome very minor bugs, intermitantly appearing. Fox sounding like Nuna when jumping or injured on occasion, for instance. Or later into the game Nuna appearing to "float" in mid air, when she would ordinarily fall right away, notably after using the wind to "power" jump.\n4 Achievements requiring additional purchase of the Foxtales DLC. I don't know if they could be set to only show up with the DLC installed or not, but this is kinda off-putting.\nOverall, I definitely can recommend the game. It stands out to me as a game suitable for those both experienced and new to the platforming genre looking for something a little more casual yet addicting.","February 20","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It is full of bugs, to say the least. The jumping is clumsy, at best, and you will commonly find yourself missing jumps due to the poor input response, or the character was too far over the edge, or I really don't know because the jump timings constantly seem to be changing... Other, more rare, times you bug out and jump farther and overshoot everything, (including your wildest imagination). There is also a random delay that can occur as well, which becomes very troublesome considering the tedious and unforgiving circumstances which the game puts you into like having to press B quickly before the wind picks up and O NO TOO LATE YOUR BUTTON DELAYED AND YOU FELL INTO THAT PIT. No worries, LET'S RESPAWN YOU RIGHT AS THE WIND IS BLOWING SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE THIS TIME. (Good thing they add checkpoints about every 3 jumps or so or I would have uninstalled long before 2.5 hours.)\n\nAdd to that a terrible control for aiming the bola, lag (in an offline game wtf?!, My computer is way more than able to run a game like this.), and repetitive chase scenarios where they give you no spare time and basically force you to fail repeatedly if you do not know what lies ahead (this is where the random delays become most terrible), and you have a completely frustrating and aggravating experience.  The fun parts of this game are short-lived as you are suddenly reminded why it is so bad with some misfortune. I'm kind of just into it now to see the rest of the unlockable videos.\n\nThe puzzles are not satisfying, they are cruel and tedious given the poor controls. Honestly, they should have just made a  cultural documentary and cut out this bug-ridden horribly coded game that, minus the antropological aspect, is a less than mediocre platformer.\n\nDid anyone playtest this thing before release? 2/5, 1 point for the concept and raising awareness, and 1 for making that money. Upset: yes.

It plays a bit like Limbo, albeit a little less polished. There were a few instances of the game glitching me to my death which frustrated me, but the checkpoint system in this game is very forgiving so I wasn't set too far back.\n\nArtistically, it was very unique. The visuals are obviously heavily influenced by native Alaskan culture. I wasn't particularly enthralled by it, but at the very least, it's nice to see some cultural diversity in my game.\n\nThe narrative is, again, very cultural. That being said, it's rather bland. I never felt all that invested in the characters or the outcome of things to come.\n\nOverall, the game is nice. Nothing particularly bad about it, but it fails to grab me in any significant way. And while the "cultural insights" tend to be fairly interesting, it tends to more often feel like it hurts the pacing of the game if you watch them as you get them. This is probably a really good game to get if you're interested in learning a bit about Alaskan Native culture.

The level design is nice and gets you thinking without ever being too complex.\n\nThe backdrops are gorgeous, even when it's just simple blurry shapes in the background, it lends to the atmosphere so well.\n\nWhile you can play the game on your own, I would strongly advise playing with a friend or a family member as the AI of your companion (be it Nuna or the Fox) leaves a fair bit to be desired.  At times I found myself jumping over a gap, only to watch the companion follow me but completely mistime the jump resulting in having to play that section of the level again.\n\nIt's not a bad game to play on your own, just a little frustrating at times is all.\n\nThe idea of including lore and cultural background is, in my opinion, a great one.  It teaches you about a culture that a lot of us are unfamiliar with, and that can only be a good thing.  More developers should try something like this in order to educate us about something that they care about.

At first glance, it's another puzzle platformer like Limbo and Valiant Hearts, and like Valiant Hearts, attempts to educate and inform people, which I greatly appreciate and find is a key part of understanding both the culture in the real world and the parallel to the game. But at it's core it's still your standard puzzle platformer. Right to left, learn mechanics, solve the puzzle. I love that.\n\nThe hate, however, lies in the actual gameplay. My major problem is the unresponsive controls, more specifically not being able perform an action without significant lag, and tht has cause me to die numerous amounts of time. It may be because I am using a mouse and keyboard, but regardless this lag shouldn't exist. More annoying is the fact that the AI that accompanies you will sometimes glitch out and kill itself or cause myself to kill myself, resulting in the need to start over. Again, happened numerous times and resulted in me dying a lot. And my third problem is about when I need to solve a puzzle, but obstacles generate that render it impossible to complete the puzzle without having to return to checkpoint. It's only happened a few times, but it's still worth mentioning that it made me frustrated and waste a lot of time.\n\nAll that said, I still find myself enjoying the game, both the educational aspect and actually playing the game. No doubt there are major improvements programming wise that I hope will be address soon, but until then I will continue to press forward, as the story is fun, deep, and embracing.","November 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really hope to see more "games" like this in the future (hint hint, developers :D). Also, disclaimer: I grew up in Michigan and PA and love snowy environments that look pretty. That may or may not have been at least half of the reason I originally purchased this game ;)\n\nWhat's awesome:\n* Beautiful storytelling in the native language. For a while (until you hit some of the more difficult puzzles), it feels like a movie that you're loosely controlling. Really good job on the storytelling aspect.\n* Amazing art!\n* Well-produced videos with a bunch of interesting cultural knowledge.\n* The environments... wow. I know I already mentioned art, but the environment design and appearance is just stellar!\n* Beautiful soundtrack that moves with the game.\n* While I can't say from expeirence (yet), it looks like they did a good job with the co-op aspect.\n\nWhat's not:\n* In solo mode, the alternate player is a lot like Tails from the Sonic games in terms of AI. Some reviews really bash the AI. I don't think it was that bad TBH, and I know firsthand how hard it is to code good AI (and they got a number of stupid "death avoidance" things spot on, which I know are very hard to do). This game is like 98% there. That last 2% would make the difference between great and awesome though.\n* There are a few puzzles that you have to switch back and forth between characters to solve. This is brilliant. However, in solo mode, 2 or 3 puzzles require some speed, and are rather irritating when trying to solve it yourself on your first playthrough.\n* Movement could use a bit of improvement. Don't get me wrong, I *love* how Nuna will be all like "whoa" when you almost walk off an edge, but sometimes I actually intend to ;)\n* The resurrected fox spirit interaction is a bit tedious. I feel like this should be a bit more automatic.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. I think it would be better with an Xbox controller than keyboard+mouse, but haven't gotten the chance to try it that way yet. Beautiful storytelling, immersive world, and a few good hours of fun ;) I'm a generally slow gamer and it too me 5 hours from start to 100% completion.","December 1, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

What a disappointing mess.\n\nDon't let me deter you completely from the game, however. The sound design and overall charm of the game is definitely worth your time, specially if obscure stories of lesser known tribes capture your interest. Based on a collection of Alaskan myths and folklore, Never Alone puts you in charge of a little girl named Nanu and her arctic fox companion, as they journey to establish the source of the blizzard that has struck her village.\n\nPlaguing your adventure are floaty controls devised by Lucifer himself and an obnoxious aiming mechanism designed by Beelzebub and his spawns. Seriously, whoever greenlit that aiming function has never played a game past 1983 and should not be in charge of such a task, if any task at all. Fire him/her/them now.\n\nIs this game worth your time? Only if you are an Inuit, an Inuit sympathizer, or related to any member of the studio.

It's so difficult to rate it using Steam's system, cause I don't know if I can recommend this to anyone, even though it's a decent game.\n\nFirst of all, this is a platformer. Any good platformer relies on two very important things: responsive controls and interesting gameplay. Does this game have any of those two things? No.  The characters sometimes don't jumb, they don't move where you want them to, they don't aim where you want them to and in general don't feel as responsive as they should. Is this gameplay interesting? Well, it's alright. Nothing new...just some good ol' jumping and running.\nI've seen games that did what this game is trying to do, in a MUCH better and interesting way (e.g. Brothers).\n\nHow much game-time do you get from this game? 5 hours max. (Which is not much, given what this game costs)\n\nIs the story interesting? Again, it's alright.. I've seen games with much more interesting storylines and characters.\n\nSo, what are the pros? It looks nice... and the music is calm and relaxing.. Shame that all of this is overshadowed from your frustration, since you'll find yourself dying over and over again even due to the bad controls or the incredibly stupid AI.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, this game is a platformer, but not a good one. It's trying to be a relaxing game, but it's incredibly frustrating. It a story-driven game, but the story is average. And it costs 15euros even though you can finish it in less than 5 hours.\n\nBuy Brothers instead.","March 1, 2015","false","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is full of bugs, to say the least. The jumping is clumsy, at best, and you will commonly find yourself missing jumps due to the poor input response, or the character was too far over the edge, or I really don't know because the jump timings constantly seem to be changing... Other, more rare, times you bug out and jump farther and overshoot everything, (including your wildest imagination). There is also a random delay that can occur as well, which becomes very troublesome considering the tedious and unforgiving circumstances which the game puts you into like having to press B quickly before the wind picks up and O NO TOO LATE YOUR BUTTON DELAYED AND YOU FELL INTO THAT PIT. No worries, LET'S RESPAWN YOU RIGHT AS THE WIND IS BLOWING SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE THIS TIME. (Good thing they add checkpoints about every 3 jumps or so or I would have uninstalled long before 2.5 hours.)\n\nAdd to that a terrible control for aiming the bola, lag (in an offline game wtf?!, My computer is way more than able to run a game like this.), and repetitive chase scenarios where they give you no spare time and basically force you to fail repeatedly if you do not know what lies ahead (this is where the random delays become most terrible), and you have a completely frustrating and aggravating experience.  The fun parts of this game are short-lived as you are suddenly reminded why it is so bad with some misfortune. I'm kind of just into it now to see the rest of the unlockable videos.\n\nThe puzzles are not satisfying, they are cruel and tedious given the poor controls. Honestly, they should have just made a  cultural documentary and cut out this bug-ridden horribly coded game that, minus the antropological aspect, is a less than mediocre platformer.\n\nDid anyone playtest this thing before release? 2/5, 1 point for the concept and raising awareness, and 1 for making that money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/recommended/295790/","actherian","Therian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/","483 products in account","Now, I'm not the biggest fan of platform games. I used to have pretty much no choice but to play them having grown up with the likes of Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario World, but never did have any real patience or skill, 3D platformers made that a lot easier later on, like with Spyro the Dragon and those became bigger favourites, though still far from my most favourite genre (if I can ever decide what that is! I love RPGs, but RPGs can be platformers, point & click, FPS...)\n\nStill, having won this game over at SteamGifts[www.steamgifts.com] from a kind user giving away a copy (I've given away well over a hundred games myself too, all different.) I entered a couple of others before winning, as you do, but only enter for games I believe I will eventually play fairly, either to completion or at least invest a few hours, no matter how long that takes.\n\nNever Alone somehow quickly rose to the top of my play list. I'd heard good things about its play style, characters, art style... You name it. In-particular stories from why others had it on their wishlists, which would vary from wanting the trading cards to loving the idea of playing the fox. One person even commented they'd planned to play with their younger brother, but had kept arguing over who'd play who! Numa or the Fox.\n\nAdvertised as co-op, I had no idea how would play both characters at once, but the AI was (mostly) top-notch, a little silly at some points, but it was easy to swap between characters, and many of the puzzles were interesting, fun and requiring a little thought, usually just to slow down and think them through. It even kept me interested for the entire time I played, though my heart skipped a beat at one scene when the Manhunter snaps the foxes' neck. This is completely unavoidable, and story related, but heart crunching, even though he does come back almost immediately with new powers, a reborn spirit.\n\nThe added short videos are well worth watching too, for they tell the story of the Alaskan natives and how they have survived in that environment. Their culture, history and how they live in their communities, in many respects, a lesson much of the world also needs to learn once more.\n\nIn short, we'd break this down into positives and negatives.\n\nPOSITIVE Great Artwork Style with realistic movement in both animal and human.\nInnovative puzzles ranging from the usual timing of movements to having to use the weather to your advantage.\nHD Quality Mini-Movies, telling the history of the Alaskan Natives and a bit of extra backstory into the actual scenario\nEasily played both in single-player & co-op mode. I hadn't even tried with another person, but did setup so I could control both at once for one or two levels just to practice for fun.\nStory. The story itself is relatively short and simple in practice, yet it holds an important lesson that can be interprated in different ways, all to a positive. Myself I took away that even the weakest, or most unlikely, person can make a a true difference. Nuna was but a small girl, yet she braved what the others would not. Ever curious about the blizzard threatening her village.\nNEGATIVES Missing elements to the story. Such as why the Man-Hunter, or at least the Iñupiat version of the Big Bad Wolf, wanted Nuna's Bola, and how he hadn't found it from the Owl Man. Or how her village, supposedly destroyed by him, was inhabitated again once she had returned, fleeing from the Ice Giant.. I went back to the relevant chapters 2~3 times, and viewed ALL the cinematics, but could not find answers to these.\nSome may disagree, in fact I'm sure many will. But I'd unfortunately have to place the Soundtrack here. If there was much of a soundtrack at all, I'd have missed it entirely. It did not stand out for me at all, had any played. Mainly only during cinematic movies, or one time at the village. Not any kind of obvious or consistent soundtrack.\nSome very minor bugs, intermitantly appearing. Fox sounding like Nuna when jumping or injured on occasion, for instance. Or later into the game Nuna appearing to "float" in mid air, when she would ordinarily fall right away, notably after using the wind to "power" jump.\n4 Achievements requiring additional purchase of the Foxtales DLC. I don't know if they could be set to only show up with the DLC installed or not, but this is kinda off-putting.\nOverall, I definitely can recommend the game. It stands out to me as a game suitable for those both experienced and new to the platforming genre looking for something a little more casual yet addicting.","February 20","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It plays a bit like Limbo, albeit a little less polished. There were a few instances of the game glitching me to my death which frustrated me, but the checkpoint system in this game is very forgiving so I wasn't set too far back.\n\nArtistically, it was very unique. The visuals are obviously heavily influenced by native Alaskan culture. I wasn't particularly enthralled by it, but at the very least, it's nice to see some cultural diversity in my game.\n\nThe narrative is, again, very cultural. That being said, it's rather bland. I never felt all that invested in the characters or the outcome of things to come.\n\nOverall, the game is nice. Nothing particularly bad about it, but it fails to grab me in any significant way. And while the "cultural insights" tend to be fairly interesting, it tends to more often feel like it hurts the pacing of the game if you watch them as you get them. This is probably a really good game to get if you're interested in learning a bit about Alaskan Native culture.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/295790/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a very cute game that offers a lot of story and history. It explores the culture of the Iñupiat people (Alaskan Natives) and, specifically, the story of nature and its massive influence upon the world. As you explore the amazing landscape that has been laid out before you, you will begin to appreciate the intensity and dedication to quality in which the Iñupiat have presented this game. Not only does it offer stunning graphics, but it provides such a storytelling that you may sometimes question whether it even is a game at all. Please do not, however, let that deter you from purchasing this. This can easily be classified as a documentary within a game, and I believe that a lot more 'games' like this should be created. Not only does it let you explore a culture, it also educates you on the beauty of the world and what it truly has to offer.\n\nPros+  Very educational game that I believe most people should try out\n+  The music is satisfying enough; the sound effects are just as good as well\n+  You get to play as a tiny little fox... and it is absolutely amazing. Believe me\n+  Achievements are easy enough to achieve, however some are locked behind a $3.99 pricetag (DLC)\n+  The game has nice narration and works to provide as much background as possible in a visually pleasing way\n+  Offers a unique style of gameplay: you're able to play as two different characters; careful planning is necessary\n+  Educational "Cultural Insights" can be picked up throughout the game; perhaps it is my love for history, but I found these to be a great aspect of the game (made it unique)\n\nNeutral±  I was pleasantly surprised that the game required more puzzle solving than expected. During the first half of the game, I solved the puzzles with ease. Towards the end of the game, however, these puzzles became increasingly time limited and almost frustrating. You will die, and you will die a lot\n±  Very immersive game: Never Alone can easily have you're blood pounding or nerves shaking. Perhaps this is a bad thing for some, but for me, it's a positive. By the time I achieved a jump, a climb, or some other performace, I felt a great rush of accomplishment or joy. This is how games should be\n\nCons-  The $14.99 + $3.99 price tag for the base game and the Foxtale DLC are a bit intimidating, especially when you will most likely play the game for about 6 hours tops\n-  Controls are annoying near the end. For a game with such a price tag, you would think the controls would be tight and responsive. This isn't the case. These loose controls will get you killed and when you die you start the level all over again. This issue becomes more frequent when you're controlling the Fox (towards the end of the story)\n\nGames like this don't really come along often. Seldom do they attempt to educate and impart knowledge on their playerbase, but Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) does a fantastic enough job to cover the bill. Allow Nuna and Fox to take you on a journey of cultural history through a vast tundra.

I'll start with the cons, because for me they outweighted the pros.\n\nCons:\n- Unfriendly controls (especially if you're playing it in a single-player mode)\n- Story lacking any kind of sense (even fairytale one)\n- Unclear in-game tutorials (e.g. how to unlock all the cultural insights)\n\nPros:\n- Nice visual design\n- Still a good story\n- Cultural insights (an easy way to learn something new, something you wouldn't have even tried learning otherwise)\n\nSeems like 3 to 3, right? No. You can strike the last one out, because you are VERY likely to unlock only the most of them, but not all. And you wouldn't even realise what you did or didn't do wrong. The game simply tells you NOTHING about the process of unlocking cultural insights. Yes, you can see it for yourself that they're triggered by being close to that owl. But no clue as to where you should look for it -  sometimes you jump there and you're dead, sometimes it's a hidden path.\n\nAlso, Foxtales DLC should have been made free (and the devs actually promised it to be free, but here we are). The game is short already. not including it was really nasty.","January 22","false","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And it is so beautifully animated and shows such character as it moves and growls/barks/cries, it's just amazing.\nIt's mostly a slow paced game that is just telling a story. Or it is so far anyway (about an hour in).\nI don't expect it to be a terribly long game though, but that's ok if it keep up this level of quality.\nIt has some basic puzzles, like pulling boxes to climb onto high ledges, using each characters abilities, such as fox can scramble up walls, girl has a bola and can move boxes and such. I have also had a couple of chase sequences, which are nice and end before they get tedious.\nMostly though, it's just walking through the world, climbing up ledges and stuff like that, while an old eskimo man narrates the story.\nSo beautifully animated and drawn, such a lovely tale, it's impossible to dislike it so far.\nAnd the documentary-style videos you unlock that tell you about the real people, how they lived, their past, their stories, and most of all their beliefs (that are what make up the story in the game) are really nice. I actually find myself looking forward to each one. I really can't wait to unlock them, and I find myself disappointed that there are only 24 of them and I have already unlocked around 10.\n\nThe one big drawback is the co-op. For TWO reasons. Reason one, it's local only, which is a shame. Reason two is the biggest drawback; it defaults to co-op if you go back to the menu to watch the "insights" (these are the mini-documentary videos I mentioned before). If this happens while in a chase scene or something, you die. Because you control one character, the other trots alongside you. If it reverts to co-op, however, the other character sits and waits to be caught and killed, which is unavoidable. Death is fast. If you fail a chase, you are just dead, no two ways about it.\n\nOther than these co-op problems, this is a game I highly recommend for anyone wanting a nice little side-scrolling storytelling game that is unlike almost anything I have ever seen before.

The gameplay is repetitive, unchallenging, and the controls frustrate quickly. I can't imagine much time was spent on the multiplayer at any interval because the camera nearly made my cohort and I enemies, and we survived Mario Party.\n\nThe gameplay shifts amusingly mid-way through the story, a stunt that many games have failed to pull off.\n\nI'm afraid the interactive portions of this game just weep poor design. Understanding the parts of the environment you can interact with is easy enough, but collision detection is shaky at best, the response time and restrictions on controls would have left a body trail a mile long, but we couldn't finish the game.

The Co-Op also makes for a great way to spend some time with a friend to solve puzzles and just relax.\n\nCons: The AI just needs a tighter leash to the main player and more danger-awareness so that players are not having to quick-swap to avoid the constant dangers that there are. Also, being able to throw the bola without having to dead-stop would help a lot in chase sequences where stopping dead just to aim kills half the time.

However, does it tells anything about the story or presentation? To be honest puzzle-platformer part is not the strongest part of the game since objectives of some puzzles are not always easy to figure out and some puzzles feels a bit unfair in comparison with the rest which leads to quite a lot of deaths. There is no limit to how many times you can continue, though.\n\nBut I want to say it's a truly unique game and here are my reasons:\n* It's a traditional Inuit legend presented in a form of a game which is something really new. I can't recall even one another game based on Inuit legends and I really do hope that there will be more. Inuits living in an extreme environment which heavily affects their way of life and folklore.\n* The quality of music, art and animation both in the game and in the story intermissions really stand out. You will literally feel how developers loved the game which they made.\n* There are a lot of developer comments with stories about Inuits way of life and culture directly connected to the events in the actual game. They are implemented as collectibles, so you will really want to find them all. There are not so many and most of them are easy to find, though. Chapter select screen even tells how many you collected per chapter.\n\nThe only real issue with this game is the length. Unfortunately, it's really short and when you collect and watch all the cultural insights there are almost no replay value unless you have someone to play it in a local co-op.\n\nIs it worth to buy? I think yes, It's a masterpiece which provides the unique experience and that easily outweighs short story and a bit unfair puzzles.","February 22, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

It's insanely buggy.  Characters have gone through wall collisions on more than one occasion. Platforms sometimes don't trigger and the fox AI is really really dumb to the point where it's frusterating. The game also suffers from clunky player controls which in my experience is standard unity powered games (Is that the default player input script???). I want to support indies but make your game work!\n\nEven if the bugs were fixed, the gameplay is quite boring. The platforming elements are lackluster and the game lacks any other mechanics asides from the bola to solve 'puzzles'. There's no variety, there's no gradual and continuous introduction of mechanics to keep me interested. You get all the tools you need within the first hour of the game and that's it.\n\nThe Pros: The artwork and theme is pretty nice. The educational snippits saved the game. I had something to work towards. Rarely do I support breaking up the flow of gameplay, but the videos in this situation broke up the monotony.\n\nOverall, it pains me to say, but pass on this game.

Definitely for anyone who wants to relax a little and enjoy a story while also having to think through a few puzzles. The Co-Op also makes for a great way to spend some time with a friend to solve puzzles and just relax.\n\nCons: The AI just needs a tighter leash to the main player and more danger-awareness so that players are not having to quick-swap to avoid the constant dangers that there are. Also, being able to throw the bola without having to dead-stop would help a lot in chase sequences where stopping dead just to aim kills half the time. The only other issue I see is dropping boxes on the other companion doesn't KILL them but makes the boxes, which are already slightly glitchy and hard to move around sometimes, now impossible to move period.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10.

However, does it tells anything about the story or presentation? To be honest puzzle-platformer part is not the strongest part of the game since objectives of some puzzles are not always easy to figure out and some puzzles feels a bit unfair in comparison with the rest which leads to quite a lot of deaths. There is no limit to how many times you can continue, though.\n\nBut I want to say it's a truly unique game and here are my reasons:\n* It's a traditional Inuit legend presented in a form of a game which is something really new. I can't recall even one another game based on Inuit legends and I really do hope that there will be more. Inuits living in an extreme environment which heavily affects their way of life and folklore.\n* The quality of music, art and animation both in the game and in the story intermissions really stand out. You will literally feel how developers loved the game which they made.\n* There are a lot of developer comments with stories about Inuits way of life and culture directly connected to the events in the actual game. They are implemented as collectibles, so you will really want to find them all. There are not so many and most of them are easy to find, though. Chapter select screen even tells how many you collected per chapter.\n\nThe only real issue with this game is the length. Unfortunately, it's really short and when you collect and watch all the cultural insights there are almost no replay value unless you have someone to play it in a local co-op.\n\nIs it worth to buy? I think yes, It's a masterpiece which provides the unique experience and that easily outweighs short story and a bit unfair puzzles.","February 22, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

The gameplay itself is enjoyable and challenging although in some parts the controls were slightly off or lagging, but never so much to distract me from the overall immersive and fun storyline. Certainly some parts I had to replay a few times before I got it as it was challenging but you have to expect that from a game, and it certainly felt rewarding to complete each section.

Other games definitively answer that question beyond a reasonable doubt. Never Alone is one of the latter. Set in the Alaskan wilderness, this game is based on the tale of Kunuuksaayuka. Made in two and a half years, the developers worked with over 40 Alaskan elders, storytellers, and artists to bring this story to life. Narration is done completely in the Iñupiaq tongue, with subtitles in English, so it’s quite easy to immerse yourself completely. The soundtrack is minimal, but atmospheric. This allows the real barren brutality of the Alaskan wilderness to hit you with full force. Nature can be both friend and foe in this game, and no matter which side you end up on, you can always feel how tiny everything is in the grand scheme of things. Now, this is not a game without it’s flaws, but I think they were able to set a goal and meet it beautifully. With all that said, lets look a little deeper at Never Alone.\n\nThe first thing that will probably be noticed in the opening cinematics is the art style used, which based on the Inuit tradition of scrimshaw, and if you didn’t know that, the game quite kindly provides you with something to watch so you can learn about scrimshaw from the actual elders via a cinematic. The cinematics are quite unintrusive, but are still ready for you within seconds when you’re ready to break your immersion via the back button. Little things like this go such a long way for me. The immersion really is something else, as soon as you’ve heard the wind rip apart the background audio a couple times… Or enjoyed the solemn wind tones of an ice cave, you’ll be hooked. It’s not just the graphics or the atmosphere that has me so impressed, the gameplay is actually a ton of fun. As in most puzzle platformers, you will use the different attributes of the characters to traverse the levels. The fox can fit in tinier spaces, walljump, and talk to the animal spirits that sometimes appear to serve as platforms. Nuna can drag heavy objects, and toss a bola. The bola is your only source of damage, and everything kills both characters in one hit… But it’s not taxing. It feels like you’re being told a lovely story the entire time. Some puzzles can take a bit of braining, but the solution always feels so gratifying. Local co-op is amazingly fun, and how I assume the game is supposed to be played, but a fine job was done making sure everything is still doable in single-player.\n\nAside from the likeable characters, story, and immersive environments, there are the gorgeous graphics in which the environment (and everything else) was rendered. The wind feels alive as it rips at Nuna’s hood, water is rendered wonderfully with beams of light shining through the surface, Nuna’s bola also has it’s own physics, and will land differently every time depending what you hit and how. Again, it really is the little things. Possible faults might include the linear nature of the game, as well as minor bugs involve with jumping on ice you were meant to break with the bola (example on the intro to my video review). The controls could also use some tightening. However, there are a multitude of sincere and fantastic messages, so if you’re in the mood for a story game that leans more toward story, why not also learn about a complex and interesting culture that people don’t talk enough about?\n\nSummary: A casual co-op puzzle-platformer with fantastic immersion.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10 for gameplay, graphics, and immersion. 10/10 with difficulty increase.","November 23, 2014","true","1.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

At first I attributed this to typical Mac gaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but from other reviews it looks like this is a problem with all versions of the game.  The controls are unresponsive, which is unacceptable for a game that relies on quick platforming. The characters  constantly get stuck on walls, fall through the level, or just freeze in midair. This is a very linear game, and I  encountered the glitches over and over in the same spots... spots I needed to get through to progress.

Her and that litte fox intrigued me.  I *believed* her connection to that fox.  And that is why I decided to purchase.\n\nThe story follows an Alaska Native tale.  It feels authentic, at least the narrator makes it so.  The tale is detailed in Alaskan lore without being oversaturated with background information.  Storyline has some nice tension, but doesn't really grab me. At least not in the way I was expecting.  For some reason I was thinking I'd have more game dialogue and exposition.  It's mostly the visuals I enjoy and mini documentaries.  Truthfully, that is the heart of the game.  After some time, I felt less for the characters and just wanted to watch another documentary on Alaskan life.  The magic didn't quite sustain long enough between that fox and Nuna.\n\nPerhaps it was the controls.  A little clunky without co-op, although completely playable.  If you have a friend and a spare controller this game gets a lot better.  Single player wise, it can frustrate you about 2/3rds of the way through.  I would not call it game breaking, though.  Depends how much patience you have as a gamer because several parts are trial and error.  I found the controls had less in common with Tale of Two Brothers than it did with The Cave.  Except The Cave was more entertaining ( mostly ).\n\nSo it's a pair of enchanting characters in a beautiful game with what I presume is a  real native tale and tons of awards, yet the game is not amazing.  There is plenty of eyecandy and wonderful documentary bits, yes, but the actual gameplay is so-so.  I'd love to see something more action oriented...I kept thinking with all the nice visuals wouln't some Rayman Legends style platforming be more fitting?  Perhaps it is the two person controls that slow it down.  It's super original and I enjoyed it, but I didn't think the real guts of the game was great.  I'd say 6.5/10 overall.  I may go back and watch the documentaries again, that footage is gorgeous and the people are more enjoyable to watch than the rest of the game.","April 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Although it takes only around 8 hours to complete (including Foxtales DLC), Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is worth a buy for the experience you will have. Has beautiful story, illustrations, and soundtrack, but lacks smooth controls. Never Alone can be enjoyed in singleplayer (ironic, right? Never… alone?...) or co-op mode. This game is one of my top 10 favorites, and I hope it can be one of yours too.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game's rating: 8.5/10.

Story is of course set in Alaska. I will start off by:\nPros:\n- Adorable girl and an adorable little fox make the story all the better, the animation of the tail of the fox is hilarious and cute :')\n- Story is exciting, sometimes scary, sad and lovely all at the same time, with one great twist!\n- Both the fox and the girl are playable characters that you take control of either in single player or local co-op, as characters. as I said above, they make the story more impactful, but in gameplay terms it fails to deliver (see Cons)\n- Art style in-game is very lovely, wind effects are not only cosmetics, they impact the way you play the game\n- Cut scene art style differs from the gameplay but is very interesting and is indeed an art style of Iñupiaq people\n- Cultural insight videos offer a lot of knowledge about this forgotten community - I knew nothing about them, maybe a little, but now I not only know more - I am impressed by them and their culture!\n\nNow, with the cons:\n- Single player puts you in control of both characters, when you control the girl, AI controls the fox, and vice versa. The problem is AI isn't very smart and sometimes levels require quick reaction and cooperation that really requires you play with someone at local coop\n- Because these levels require that, you are encountered with frustrating deaths. A lot of them! In fact, the only game I died more at is Limbo. This really made me frustrated.\n- The game is short. Most of the time on my Steam clock is thanks to Cultural Insight videos, so 3 hours I think can be enough to complete it.\n** I played with Nvidia card on laptop, you must set manually in Nvidia control panel for this game to run on Nvidia card because it automatically sets itself to run on the integrated one and performance will be bad.\nAll in all, I do recommend this game. I had fun with it, learned a lot, had some frustrating moments, but a wonderful experience none the less. Also, the fox is a must play character in your career (that tail!) ! :)","March 5, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's part video game, part documentary film, with some 2D woodcut style animated storytelling in between.  It's also really short.  You'll finish in around 4 hours, but since it's like an interactive documentary, it feels like it's about the right length.  If you aren't sure whether the price is right for the product, wait for a sale.\n\nIn true platformer fashion, there is a good bit of "jump and die" in some spots until you figure out how to get around an obstacle, but the game never sets you too far back, so you can try it multiple times without having to repeat half the level.  The controls and physics feel good, but the bolo takes a little getting used to (using an Xbox 360 controller).\n\nThe in-game visual style is "soft textures" with frequent snow, which somtimes (appropriately) gives you the feeling of looking through a window on a cold day.  Good music and ambient sounds are interspersed with filmed interviews and documentary footage (if you choose to view them between game segments).\n\nFor a short, linear, story-rich, casual game with some puzzle elements. I vastly prefer 'Never Alone' over 'To The Moon'.  The visual style and game elements are much more engaging, and the documentary segments are a unique way to augment the story of a girl and her fox.","June 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It is quite short though, so do not expect a long game.  The game play really is faily simple, and the "puzzles" in the game are not too hard to figure out, though a few of them require better timing than others.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game through with my youngest daughter who is 8 years old.  Unfortunately while she loved the game, there was a part of the game that brought tears to her eyes, sadly this was an unexpected twist in the game that I did not see coming, so I did not get to prepare her for that.\nOther than that it is a game I could call PG, just a tiny bit out of the G range IMO.\n\nHaving it be a co-op game was enjoyable as I said, having my duaghter play this through with me.  It is however playable as a single player game as well.\n\nThe overall story was enjoyable, having been loosely based upon an actual "Eskimo fairy tale" was really interesting as well.\nThe in-game achievements were more or less video "lessons" of and from the Iñupiaq, a Native Alaskan people, as was the basis of the main story of the game.\n\nI understand that many will find this game perhaps a bit simple, if not simplistic, but I personally felt that the art style was gorgeous and the overall play was mostly quite fluid and ultimately was worth every penny I paid for it.\n\nThe replayablility is the only thing that suffers a bit, especially being such a short game, and a fairly linear one, there is little to do other than trying to complete the 15 challenges (or achievements), as well as to unlock all of the 24-25 videos in game.\n\nAt it's core, the game is more of an educational device to learn about the Alaskan culture as it is a game.\n\nRegardless if it's your cup of tea or not, I have to recommend this game if not for only the beuatiful visual style of the game alone.

To those that aren't familiar with multicultures and different societies, it is definitely an eye opener both in terms of education and spiritually speaking.

We spend most of our time enclosed in our modernized world, too busy and caught up to think of our next meal, our next job, and so playing this game for me was like taking a step back and appreciating the environment and our surroundings for once, if not all the time like them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zacharuni/recommended/295790/","zacharuni","Zacharuni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zacharuni/","448 products in account","I originally posted a review of this game unfinished due to what I thought were progress-breaking glitches and issues with the video viewer the program uses. I was contacted shortly after by a member of the team who assisted in showing me (incredibly politely!) that I forgot a fundamental system of the game and that there were no glitches. I have since finished the game and have watched 23/24 of the documentary videos.\n\nI have changed my review to a recommendation, and will strike out any issues I once had with a write up on what has changed. I will also add some new insights I've found playing through to the end while erasing or touching up parts where I feel my originally negative review has since changed.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nA fantastic game with an unbelievably charming story, an awesome art style, and a lot to teach. A truly special game that I cannot recommend enough.\n\nKisima Ingitchuna (what a beautiful name) is a story-based platformer that follows a young girl named Nuna and her fox to discover what has happened to her Alaskan village. A gorgeous canvas for a frustrating platformer that contians an incredible adventure.\n\nPros:\n+ Visually gorgeous, with so much detail using a simple color palette.\n+ An interesting, if not simple, story.\n+ Narration in the native (Iñupiat) tongue throughout helps to flesh out the world even further.\n+ The two player co-op option is a huge plus, and makes the game far more enjoyable.\n+ The documentary pieces they have are incredibly well done. Not only do they teach so much about the people and their culture, they also feed back into the game's world through the stories they tell. Every part of nature, every struggle -- every piece that is placed into this game -- comes from the people's stories and their culture. What I would consider to be the highlight of the package.\n+ STORY SPOILERS.  The single most tasteful and beautiful animal death in any medium I've encountered, ever. As an animal lover, I've never found animal cruelty/death in a story telling medium to add much positive weight to the lore. The way the death was handled in this game is remarkable in ways I have no desire to spoil further. Massive kudos to the person who thought this one up. :)\n\nCons:\n- I have had progress-breaking bugs twice and am not able to complete the game. After searching online during various sections, I have found myself stuck with no way to progress, even after a hard reset of my system.\nTurns out I had forgotten a fundamental system in the game. I have not found any issues like this at all.\n\n- Furthermore, the game comes with many documentary videos on the Alaskan people, which would have been fantastic to watch if they would load at all. Potentially an isolated issue, but one that left me pretty bummed. Will have to venture to YouTube to see them.\nSteam can sometimes not install the codec/viewer, and their support team had the issue resolved with a single email. I've added my thoughts on the videos to the Pros section.\n\n- The controls handle incredibly loose. Using a gamepad, I had trouble making consistent jumps, which led to many deaths that felt unfair.\n\nAfter completing this game and watching the documentary episodes, I cannot be happier with this game. Anyone who enjoys documentaries or thoughtful works will find much to love here. Easily recommended.","February 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

I watched all of the cultural insights (that I unlocked), and I even replayed several sections to locate insights I had missed the first time around. However, other than locating missed cultural insights the game has almost no replay value, I would still recomend this game, but not for the full price. Wait for it to hit a sale and then grab it, you may only play it once, but that one time will e worth it.\n\nI am still a little uncertain about how I feel about the checkpoints. You encounter checkpoints very often which I both liked and disliked. On one hand several of the areas required several tries to complete so the many checkpoints were handy so I was not having to redo a whole section just becuase I kept dieing to the Sky People. However, on the other hand it made the game feel a little repetative. It seemed like there was a checkpoint every 10 or so minutes so I would miss a jump and not have to worry about it becuase I knew that I would only be set back eight steps and then I could try the jump again. The game would have been more enjoyable from a gaming aspect if the checkpoints were further apart so failure carried some penalties rather than keep repeating the same jump until you get it right and then you will reach a checkpoint on the other side.","April 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PloCoon/recommended/295790/","PloCoon","PloCoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PloCoon/","141 products in account","Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna in the Iñupiaq language) is an indie platformer that transports you into two legends (as of the expansion) from the indigenous Iñupiaq culture of Cook Inlet, Alaska.  You take on the role of two characters: Nuna, a young Iñupiaq girl, and a white fox named... well, Fox (no relation to a certain Nintendo franchise).  In the core game, the pair go on a quest to find the cause of harsh blizzards that are devastating Nuna's community; while in the expansion, Foxtales, they set out to stop the rampage of a giant mouse destroying the countryside.  They might be regarded as "weird" storylines from the perspectives of a lot of gamers - but then, this doesn't come from the culture of most gamers, does it?\n\nAs a platformer, the gameplay is fairly standard.  There are single player and local co-op modes, but I haven't had the chance to do the co-op yet.  In single player mode, you switch back and forth as needed between Nuna and Fox to get through the various stages.  Apart from standard movement, Nuna can climb ladders, lift and throw objects, and throw a bola as a projectile weapon. Fox has a higher jump and can scratch his way some distance up a wall, as well as doing wall-jumps back and forth; he can also squeeze through tight spaces and move the spirits of nature around you to places where they can help you get where you need to go.  You can also crouch down to brace yourself against blizzard winds so you don't get blown back.  The difficulty level starts easy and gradually increases before a spike near the end, but it's nothing that anyone with patience and persistence can't get through.  You'll find yourself increasingly needing to switch back and forth between the two with good timing to get through some of the environmental puzzles, especially near the end.  I found several of these puzzles to provide a satisfying challenge, though it's certainly no Portal or Professor Layton.\n\nThe gameplay is, however, not without its flaws.  The responsiveness can be a tad laggy in some cases, which can result in running off a platform or missing the timing to get through a puzzle or boss - NOT a good thing when your characters' lives are on the line.  From time to time a character (usually Fox) would get stuck somewhere.  And sometimes the AI would make one character catch up to the other after you'd specifically put him/her in a particular spot.  I also noticed that in the more graphically demanding areas (particularly in the coastal village with the Northern Lights), there was a bit of slowdown on maximum settings.  This plus the glitches can result in a few moments of banging your head on the keyboard.  However, these are pretty much the only bad points of the game, and they are far from being gamebreakers.\n\nGraphically, it's not as "good" as a triple-A title, but it is still a very beautiful game.  The creators did their best to capture the feel of the remote Alaskan wilderness in platformer form, and for the most part it worked.  From snowy landscapes to riverbanks to the Aurora Borealis, this game delivers some real eye candy.  The core game is also interspersed with cutscenes done in a beautiful scrimshaw art style that really capture the cultural feel of the game.  The soundtrack is also quite good, with many ethereal tracks to complement the game environment.\n\nHowever, Never Alone shines the most in its other genre: edutainment.  This game was made to give the world a perspective on the Iñupiaq people - a group not often thought about by most - and in that regard it will blow you away.  Apart from the storylines in the core game and expansion, which come from traditional legends passed down through generations, you can unlock over 20 different videos with snippets of interviews with the Iñupiaq people talking about their lives in the Alaskan wilds and about the different cultural practices and perspectives. This was one of my favorite parts of the game as a whole, and as an anthropology major I ate this stuff up.  You can tell the developers did their homework in making the game, as many of the credited people are themselves Iñupiaq, and institutions like the Smithsonian and various Alaskan cultural groups are listed in the Special Thanks section.  And you know they wanted to reach as many people as they could with this game, because it's available in sixteen different languages from almost every continent. In the future I would like to see similar games about the stories and aspects of other indigenous cultures - perhaps the Navajo or Sioux for North America, just to start.\n\nOverall, the game isn't particularly groundbreaking in terms of gameplay, and there are flaws about which you will no doubt complain.  However, the main purpose of the game is to chronicle the culture of the Iñupiaq, and in that regard it gets it very, very right - and beautifully so.  As a platformer it's decent, but as edutainment it is truly a gem.  Even if you only play this one time, it will be a playthrough you will not regret.\n\nRATING: 8/10.

My only caveat (besides the flaming hoops to jump through loading it up the first time) is that this game would, I think, have played more smoothly had I the ability to plug in a second controller; there were moments  when I felt the game's design was a little punishing for a solo player hopping back and forth between the two characters.

You will have likely read this in the reviews, and I concur that it is a brief game. It could be said that it never outstays its welcome, and that the continuous new challenges introduced with an applaudable learning curve offset its short lifespan, but the fact of its brevity remains nonetheless true.\n\nIn addition, we played co-op and found it sometimes difficult to determine exactly where we were going; it was much more of a freeform, faster-paced Limbo experience than, say, a Portal type of deal where the objective is clear from the word "Start" in every room. Again, what offsets this is the impressive checkpointing that never fails to pick up and keep the pace good and strong throughout.\n\nNow, for what makes this game excellent is that it is, to be blunt, a cultural triumph. It makes me proud that this game even exists. It could have had far more flaws, it could have not been beautiful from start to finish, and it would have still been something tremendous. This is all without considering the fact that Never Alone was a joy from start to finish, on the eyes, the adrenaline and the mind.\n\nNever Alone is the modern-day, digital version of a scrimshaw; a carving and capture of a fiction deserving of preservation. It presents this as something skipped for the uninterested and something relevant for the curious - each Insight into Iñupiaq history becomes all too relevant once playing through the part after its found. As a capsule of cultural heritage it doesn't come across as a history book with a platformer attached; rather, the entire experience is one seamless package. The puzzles are of Trine descent, as are the visuals, but with two characters comes a sense of focus and flow that keeps the pace at a strong level throughout. No section drags on for too long, no mechanic is repeated too soon, but the difficulty curves upwards at a respectable pace.\n\nFor co-op, Never Alone has the applaudable quality of never making it feel as if I was stepping on my partner's toes. In fact the flow of the thing was almost enhanced, with two pairs of hands at the helm - a feeling that could have all too easily become frustration or annoyance but instead veered well away from them.\n\nOverall Never Alone is something that needed only the time it took to become something memorable both as an experience and as the story of a people's way of life. Whether or not you're interested in the latter, the game stands strong for any fans of puzzle platformers, but for those who might be touched by the tales the narrators have to tell the experience will be unforgettable.","September 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are among the coldest places in the world -where survival and community building goes hand in hand. This game is based on the folklore of the Alaskan people - passed down through generations - explaining the harmony of nature with the people and the origination of a blizzard. And if I were to describe it one word - I'd say it was- Beautifully Magical. (I know that's two but I hope you get the point.)\n\nI'm in awe of everything from the unbelievably good level designs - to the traditional style of narration in the native tongue - to the simple idea of having actual real life interviews of people currently living there explaining the background and their way of life. It was a journey that I will cherish right up there with games like "To the Moon" and "Limbo".\n\nThe soundtracks lend it a surreal feel and completes the whole childrens tale - fantasy like setting. The levels are not too difficult overall, but there are a few parts I had to repeat a couple of times. Like I said above, the game was a magical experience as a whole and hesitating to give it a shot would be travesty of blasphemous proportions.","September 28, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's part video game, part documentary film, with some 2D woodcut style animated storytelling in between.  It's also really short.  You'll finish in around 4 hours, but since it's like an interactive documentary, it feels like it's about the right length.  If you aren't sure whether the price is right for the product, wait for a sale.\n\nIn true platformer fashion, there is a good bit of "jump and die" in some spots until you figure out how to get around an obstacle, but the game never sets you too far back, so you can try it multiple times without having to repeat half the level.  The controls and physics feel good, but the bolo takes a little getting used to (using an Xbox 360 controller).\n\nThe in-game visual style is "soft textures" with frequent snow, which somtimes (appropriately) gives you the feeling of looking through a window on a cold day.  Good music and ambient sounds are interspersed with filmed interviews and documentary footage (if you choose to view them between game segments).\n\nFor a short, linear, story-rich, casual game with some puzzle elements. I vastly prefer 'Never Alone' over 'To The Moon'.

Nuna starts an adventure with an artic fox companion in order to find the source of the terrible snow storms plaguing her village.\nThe main core of the game is using your own tool (like the bolas you are given after clearing an early sequence) or the elements of the enviroment (like strong winds, wandering spirits and more) to advance in the levels and avoid dying. Never Alone has actually been envisioned as a co-op game and both characters must survive the various hazards and advance at the same time (else, it's a game over and time to restart from the previous checkpoint). There are also some trial and error elements, but they never get too obnoxious.\nWhile you can actually play the game as a single player, controlling one character at a time and switching when needed, the whole experience is actually a lot harder this way (namely, constantly switching between Nuna and the fox to solve the puzzles becomes tiring aftrer a while and sometimes one of them will die because you weren't there at the right moment to control it/her).\nSince the main purpose of the publishers (Upper One Games and E-Line Media) was to get the player now Iñupiat culture and traditions, you can find several owls scatterd around the levels. Reaching them unlocks brief educational movies called "cultural insights" for you to check.\nThe main design of Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is simple yet charming and could as well hook you up for the average three hours of gameplay","March 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As the game progresses, so does the difficulty.  The only negative to this game I found was the difficulty in playing both characters quickly enough in Single Player towards the end and some occasional bugs with that playstyle.\n\nFinally, Never Alone made me want to hear more folk stories read to me in the native languages of the Inupiat people.  There is something almost musical about their dialect and having the story read to me as I struggled my way through was my favorite part.

If you ever want a game you can point at when people claim games can't be art, serve no other purpose than mindless entertainment or violance - this is the game to point them at.\n\nIt's a genuinely moving at times, albeit mainly through the video segments that you unlock along the way. The story its self is interesting but for me this game's soul is driven by it's exploration of story telling through games, and opening up access to a culture you would otherwise move through life knowing nothing about.\n\nThat said, the game its self is far from flawless. The difficulty curve on the puzzles is random, and the controls at times are clunky. The most frustrating part, to the point that it becomes a distraction, is the companion AI. Some basic puzzles are made more challenging, and some hard puzzles made almost impossible by a random and sporadicly moving AI. The secondary challenge at times being where could you wedge your companion so they can't run off a ledge, or float off so the platform you're stood on dissapears beneath you.\n\nAs a medium, and as a piece of engaging storytelling this is pretty expectional and should not be over looked for it does and the message it carries. As a game it is solid, but challenging due to development flaws rather than the core concept. However, do not let that put you off...this is well worth having in your collection and will be 3 hours well spent.\n\n","December 8, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately the Never Alone doesn't do very much as a game. However, as an overall experience, the game still has quite a lot to offer. It is a game I can recommend, just with some caveats, as I do not feel it deserves a thumbs down.\n\nWhile Never Alone was for the most part somewhat enjoyable, I simply could not shake the feeling of mediocrity that I was left with at the end of the experience. Looking back, this game doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the 2D platforming genre, however, I don't think anybody expected that much. But ultimately, it ends up taking a few steps backwards.\n\nGameplay and Design:\nFor the first 90 minutes the platforming felt alright, but about halfway through the fourth chapter things began to fall apart. The true nature of the controls were starting to become more and more apparent. Controlling the characters felt clunkier, attaching to ledges properly sometimes took several tries. The bola stood out as being particularly awkward and could have controlled better to say the least. In a game that seemed to be aiming for simplicity, some of these factors definitely detracted from the experience as a whole.\n\nThe level design felt a bit redundant after a while as well, a lot of the levels or particular aspects of them began to feel the same or just too gimmicky, and for a game that can easily be completed in just over three hours this type of design isn't particularly welcome.\n\nExtra Content:\nThe cultural insights (documentary type clips) were the true star of the show and largely responsible for keeping me interested in the game all the way through. However, first and foremost, the game should be critiqued for how it performs as an actual game. The cultural insights and story are very nice touches but that alone cannot shape the entire experience. In this case however, the cultural insights are the glue that holds everything together.\n\nAll in all, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) has enough charm on its surface to make for a really enjoyable and educational journey. However, a lot of that enjoyment is lost in the boring level design and sometimes mildly frustrating controls that make for a mediocre 2D plaforming experience.\n\nWhile it is a game I recommend based on its cultural value. If you're looking JUST for a good game think twice before playing.","March 23","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not great. Decent. My main problem with this title is that I believe much of the praise given is due to the fact that the game centers its focus on the plight of a minority group. This is Dances with Wolves, the indie version. This is all fine and good - but it does not instantly make a great game on that fact, alone. It still needs to be innovative and be fun to play, right?\n\nMark my words: if they would have replaced the native Alaskan culture with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Twighlight, the game would have been largely dismissed.\n\nOther than some beautiful graphics (admittadly, alot them look to have significant improvements because of filters), the game is fairly underwhelming. It has all been done before. Seriously.\n\nPros:\n+Stunning graphics and ambience, although there is not much variation.

We didn't finish the game, but we got close, then we got bored.\n\nCons:\n-Nothing at all fresh with the co-op design.\n-A fair amount of repetition and uninspired puzzles (ie. the wind? C'mon its a time waster).\n-The story is cookie cutter.\n\nIts fine, but I would not necessarily recommend my Steam friends purchase the game. Watch some LetsPlays and decide for yourself.

You take the role of the protaganist in a story based on Alaskan indigenous tales.  She has a fox friend (who doesn't love foxes? ^_^), and you can switch between the two characters to solve puzzles (or play with a friend and control a character each).\n\nThrough the game, you can unlock "Cultural Insights" - short clips that talk about Iñupiaq culture, and story telling traditions, and give a better appreciation of the game's setting.\n\nThe art is simple and beautiful.\n\nGameplay - the game can be frustrating at times. Occasionally glitchy performance or bugs, but the difficulty level is about right.  No insanely difficult jumps, but tricky enough to keep you on your toes.\n\nI would like to see more games that give insight into interesting cultures from around the world!","January 5","true","9.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The artwork looked so beautiful, I wanted to see what this game was all about. Once it went on sale, I bought it to give it a try. This game gives you roughly 3 hours of game play, with the option of purchasing a DLC which obviously extends the story. I however did not buy the DLC, so my review will only reflect the actual game.\n\nNever Alone is a story-telling platform that gives you the option of playing in co-op or individually. Not only is this game a piece of art, it gives you insights into another culture you may not have known much about. The game switches between two different art forms in order to tell the story of a young girl and her new found friend. These two friends are inseparable through their journey to protect the girls village. Although this game can be difficult at times, it is an enjoyable puzzle game, that you will use trial and error as well as your problem solving skills to get you through.\n\nI suggest this game to people with all levels of gaming. I especially recommend this game for pairs of friends that have varying levels of gaming, because it allows you to help each other through the puzzles and platforms in many different ways. I myself do not consider myself to have high gaming abilities, but even I was able to help my partner with parts in this game. It has a little bit of something to offer to everyone that plays the game.\n\nOne last interesting thing that this game offers that I thought was unique are the "cultural insights" built into the game. Similar to the achievements that you will receive while playing through the game, you will be awarded these cultural insights. In the main menu, after you complete the game, you are able to view all of your insights and click on ones you find interesting to watch. These insights will give you more cultural background and extend the games premise if you really enjoyed it. Learning more about the events and stories that helped mold the frameworks of Never Alone is a great bonus for real fans of the game.","January 8","true","5.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

Nuna starts an adventure with an artic fox companion in order to find the source of the terrible snow storms plaguing her village.\nThe main core of the game is using your own tool (like the bolas you are given after clearing an early sequence) or the elements of the enviroment (like strong winds, wandering spirits and more) to advance in the levels and avoid dying. Never Alone has actually been envisioned as a co-op game and both characters must survive the various hazards and advance at the same time (else, it's a game over and time to restart from the previous checkpoint). There are also some trial and error elements, but they never get too obnoxious.\nWhile you can actually play the game as a single player, controlling one character at a time and switching when needed, the whole experience is actually a lot harder this way (namely, constantly switching between Nuna and the fox to solve the puzzles becomes tiring aftrer a while and sometimes one of them will die because you weren't there at the right moment to control it/her).\nSince the main purpose of the publishers (Upper One Games and E-Line Media) was to get the player now Iñupiat culture and traditions, you can find several owls scatterd around the levels. Reaching them unlocks brief educational movies called "cultural insights" for you to check.\nThe main design of Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is simple yet charming and could as well hook you up for the average three hours of gameplay","March 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It doesn't seem forced or begrudginly included, which is always the struggle for "educational" games. Though, I suppose since that's not what they were going for, that's what made it work. The information is OPTIONAL, and you can just choose to play the game with minimal time spent learning the history if you so choose, or you can go back later and watch all the information you've collected.\n\nThat being said, I found "single player" near impossible. Maybe I'm just awful, or maybe it's the game. I honestly can't tell, but I couldn't even get through the first level alone. I had to call over a friend and make her play it with me just so I could experience the game.\n\nIt was fun, sure, but the teamwork felt incredibly unbalanced. She, as the fox, seemed to be doing most of the heavy lifting, executing the strategies to get me, Nuna, from one place to the other. Add in the glitches we experienced, clipping through terrain, getting stuck, things like that, and it made for some incredibly frustrating gameplay. We could only manage it for about two hours before we went back to playing Ibb and Obb.\n\nNonetheless, I like the game.

Unfortunately the Never Alone doesn't do very much as a game. However, as an overall experience, the game still has quite a lot to offer. It is a game I can recommend, just with some caveats, as I do not feel it deserves a thumbs down.\n\nWhile Never Alone was for the most part somewhat enjoyable, I simply could not shake the feeling of mediocrity that I was left with at the end of the experience. Looking back, this game doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the 2D platforming genre, however, I don't think anybody expected that much. But ultimately, it ends up taking a few steps backwards.\n\nGameplay and Design:\nFor the first 90 minutes the platforming felt alright, but about halfway through the fourth chapter things began to fall apart. The true nature of the controls were starting to become more and more apparent. Controlling the characters felt clunkier, attaching to ledges properly sometimes took several tries. The bola stood out as being particularly awkward and could have controlled better to say the least. In a game that seemed to be aiming for simplicity, some of these factors definitely detracted from the experience as a whole.\n\nThe level design felt a bit redundant after a while as well, a lot of the levels or particular aspects of them began to feel the same or just too gimmicky, and for a game that can easily be completed in just over three hours this type of design isn't particularly welcome.\n\nExtra Content:\nThe cultural insights (documentary type clips) were the true star of the show and largely responsible for keeping me interested in the game all the way through. However, first and foremost, the game should be critiqued for how it performs as an actual game. The cultural insights and story are very nice touches but that alone cannot shape the entire experience. In this case however, the cultural insights are the glue that holds everything together.\n\nAll in all, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) has enough charm on its surface to make for a really enjoyable and educational journey.

It's a cautious recommendation for me, mainly because it's just so damn short! (3-5 hours of content). I got this on Sale for about $10.99 when it first came out and it's hard to say I got my moneys worth. Only reason that It would have been worth the money (for me at least) is because I played it Co-op with my girlfriend. So, that being said, I also have no judgement on how the AI reacts. Co-op, though, definitely does flow well and is pretty damn fun. Especially with the fox imo!\n\nTo be honest the 'Local Co-op' was the only real draw to me for this game, because there are so few of games that are worth playing that have this feature on PC! So when this was on sale I grabbed it... and even then I still can't say that it holds its weight in virtual tender. It's just such a short game for the price!\n\n\nDoes this make it a bad game?\nAbsolutely not, It's a pretty amazing game actually. Definitely visually entertaining\n\nDoes it make it worth the price?\nEven at half-off it'd be hard to justify spending that much for such a short and easy game...\n\nWith all that being said, I still recommend it. I know eventually it'll go on sale 75% or more as far as price is concerned. Also, It's just not a bad game in the least! It's pretty captivating and definitely gets you thinking for more than a few "puzzles" (for lack of a better word). You start to get emotionally attached towards the end, too.\n\n\nRecommended if:\n-You're looking for Local Co-op fun\n-You enjoy Side-Scrollers and Modern Platform-Puzzle Games (e.g., 'Trine', 'Limbo')\n-Love games with stunning visuals (Very stoner-friendly)\n-You got lots-o-money (Or is on sale 75% off or more)\n-Want an easy "Perfect Game" on your steam profile (Can 100% it in one run)\n-Are any bit curious about this SPECIFIC Alaskan tribe","January 31, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The AI of your partner can also be a bit frustrating at times, they will move when you don't want them to causing them to fall to their death, or move too far away causing a platform to disappear. I would honestly say I died maybe 10 times because of what I would consider my mistake, and about 150 from one of the above problems.

Also features co-op where one player controls the girl and the other controls the fox.\n- Fox Tales DLC is a nice addition that adds a few chapters where another story is told through the medium of the girl and her fox.\n\nBad points:\n- When playing solo the AI character can be a bit unreliable at times as they sometimes fall or miss a jump which put you back to the checkpoint.\n- While i really enjoyed it the game is a bit short.\n\nOverall this is a nice charming platformer whose native Alaskan influence give it a unique autentic atmosphere.

The controls are immensely frustrating (and imprecise in a way I can't really nail down), and several set pieces late in the game (involving rapid switching between characters) were utterly awful due to aforementioned control issues. Sometimes the AI-controlled characters would avoid obstacles, other times they'd commit suicide -- or get stuck on an obstacle, leading to: occasionally I would get trapped by the camera, unable to proceed or move whatsoever.\n\nIn short: magnificent work of cultural anthropology, but it's all snarled up in the nettles of a punitive, sloppy platformer. Oh, and my hours played is so high because I left it running for a few hours to get trading cards. The game and its DLC take about four hours, if you're into the whole "playtime" thing.\n\nAlso, neither here nor there, but if all the folklore was about a man finding the source of the blizzard, why is it a young girl in this game?

Nuna starts an adventure with an artic fox companion in order to find the source of the terrible snow storms plaguing her village.\nThe main core of the game is using your own tool (like the bolas you are given after clearing an early sequence) or the elements of the enviroment (like strong winds, wandering spirits and more) to advance in the levels and avoid dying. Never Alone has actually been envisioned as a co-op game and both characters must survive the various hazards and advance at the same time (else, it's a game over and time to restart from the previous checkpoint). There are also some trial and error elements, but they never get too obnoxious.\nWhile you can actually play the game as a single player, controlling one character at a time and switching when needed, the whole experience is actually a lot harder this way (namely, constantly switching between Nuna and the fox to solve the puzzles becomes tiring aftrer a while and sometimes one of them will die because you weren't there at the right moment to control it/her).\nSince the main purpose of the publishers (Upper One Games and E-Line Media) was to get the player now Iñupiat culture and traditions, you can find several owls scatterd around the levels. Reaching them unlocks brief educational movies called "cultural insights" for you to check.\nThe main design of Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is simple yet charming and could as well hook you up for the average three hours of gameplay","March 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Never Alone is artistically beautiful.  Never Alone is educational.  The unlocked cultural videos taught me about the heart and lifestyle of the Inupiat people (something I knew little to nothing about previous to the game).   Never Alone is challenging.  As the game progresses, so does the difficulty.  The only negative to this game I found was the difficulty in playing both characters quickly enough in Single Player towards the end and some occasional bugs with that playstyle.\n\nFinally, Never Alone made me want to hear more folk stories read to me in the native languages of the Inupiat people.  There is something almost musical about their dialect and having the story read to me as I struggled my way through was my favorite part.

It's a documentary made into a game. Yes, it sounds boring right? BUT... despite that, it is good. They made an educational game with good art and narration of their culture and story.

The Arctic and Antarctic regions are among the coldest places in the world -where survival and community building goes hand in hand. This game is based on the folklore of the Alaskan people - passed down through generations - explaining the harmony of nature with the people and the origination of a blizzard. And if I were to describe it one word - I'd say it was- Beautifully Magical. (I know that's two but I hope you get the point.)\n\nI'm in awe of everything from the unbelievably good level designs - to the traditional style of narration in the native tongue - to the simple idea of having actual real life interviews of people currently living there explaining the background and their way of life. It was a journey that I will cherish right up there with games like "To the Moon" and "Limbo".\n\nThe soundtracks lend it a surreal feel and completes the whole childrens tale - fantasy like setting. The levels are not too difficult overall, but there are a few parts I had to repeat a couple of times. Like I said above, the game was a magical experience as a whole and hesitating to give it a shot would be travesty of blasphemous proportions.","September 28, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was contacted shortly after by a member of the team who assisted in showing me (incredibly politely!) that I forgot a fundamental system of the game and that there were no glitches. I have since finished the game and have watched 23/24 of the documentary videos.\n\nI have changed my review to a recommendation, and will strike out any issues I once had with a write up on what has changed. I will also add some new insights I've found playing through to the end while erasing or touching up parts where I feel my originally negative review has since changed.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nA fantastic game with an unbelievably charming story, an awesome art style, and a lot to teach. A truly special game that I cannot recommend enough.\n\nKisima Ingitchuna (what a beautiful name) is a story-based platformer that follows a young girl named Nuna and her fox to discover what has happened to her Alaskan village. A gorgeous canvas for a frustrating platformer that contians an incredible adventure.\n\nPros:\n+ Visually gorgeous, with so much detail using a simple color palette.\n+ An interesting, if not simple, story.\n+ Narration in the native (Iñupiat) tongue throughout helps to flesh out the world even further.\n+ The two player co-op option is a huge plus, and makes the game far more enjoyable.\n+ The documentary pieces they have are incredibly well done. Not only do they teach so much about the people and their culture, they also feed back into the game's world through the stories they tell. Every part of nature, every struggle -- every piece that is placed into this game -- comes from the people's stories and their culture. What I would consider to be the highlight of the package.\n+ STORY SPOILERS.  The single most tasteful and beautiful animal death in any medium I've encountered, ever. As an animal lover, I've never found animal cruelty/death in a story telling medium to add much positive weight to the lore. The way the death was handled in this game is remarkable in ways I have no desire to spoil further. Massive kudos to the person who thought this one up. :)\n\nCons:\n- I have had progress-breaking bugs twice and am not able to complete the game. After searching online during various sections, I have found myself stuck with no way to progress, even after a hard reset of my system.\nTurns out I had forgotten a fundamental system in the game. I have not found any issues like this at all.\n\n- Furthermore, the game comes with many documentary videos on the Alaskan people, which would have been fantastic to watch if they would load at all. Potentially an isolated issue, but one that left me pretty bummed. Will have to venture to YouTube to see them.\nSteam can sometimes not install the codec/viewer, and their support team had the issue resolved with a single email. I've added my thoughts on the videos to the Pros section.\n\n- The controls handle incredibly loose. Using a gamepad, I had trouble making consistent jumps, which led to many deaths that felt unfair.\n\nAfter completing this game and watching the documentary episodes, I cannot be happier with this game. Anyone who enjoys documentaries or thoughtful works will find much to love here.

My only caveat (besides the flaming hoops to jump through loading it up the first time) is that this game would, I think, have played more smoothly had I the ability to plug in a second controller; there were moments  when I felt the game's design was a little punishing for a solo player hopping back and forth between the two characters.

Ugh, seriously, those spirits. Probably the most uninteresting, least fun mechanic in any platformer is the dragging around of boxes. So they decided to impliment that here everwhere, in the form of dragable spirits, as pretty much the main mechanic, only they made it floaty, directionless, confusing, vague, and unresponsive.

Graphics and playability were on point, but the game itself was very buggy.  As a QA Manager myself, I would have never allowed this game to go to Production.  Several times I had to hard reset the game as a character would get stuck or the level would simply not load.  I'm running a very serious rig and there should never be an issue to execute the most basic of scene transitions.  The game itself felt rushed and I'm sure there was an over-ambitious deadline for the Dev team to attempt to reach market readiness.  Would have loved to see a fully realized concept that not only respected the generational tradition of historical storytelling among the native North American tribes, but also a fun and engaging platformer with more freedom and non-linear decision making.

The difference is that the game is meant for two people so singleplayer requires a lot more coordination and retries than it should.\nFurthermore, at some point in the game you get new abilities, which change the control scheme and make the character move floaty and slow, which did not help playing solo.\n\nPresentation wise it's cute, and obviously a product of love. Primarily it's educational, but the videos are locked behind content that you have to collect as you play the game. Most you get automatically, others are easy to find, but if you're stuck like me - You won't see all of them.\n\nWhat I believe is the last level is also a little confusing. It's often unclear which direction you're supposed to go.\n\nOverall the game is pretty short but for the most part really fun (If simple), just gets a little frustrating in later levels.\n\nEDIT - Game is doable with a controler.

The fact that this game's collectibles teach you about the Iñupiat people and their way of life is a wonderful bonus. No longer do you have to worry about gathering collectibles for little to no reward other than an achievement or some gimmicky in-game costume piece. You actually feel like your efforts are being justly rewarded. The game mechanics are a little tricky at times and the AI got difficult to work with towards the end, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nThe simplicity in the art style and overall story helps sell this game as a must have. This game shows that there is no need for complex stories of betrayal and revenge. All you need to tell a good story is the combination of a believeable world and believeable characters. Never Alone exhibits these exceptionally with a warm and caring approach with the narration tracking the player's progress throughout the game. The stylistic approach is beautiful and the transitional sections provide a wonderful view into how stories are actually presented by the Iñupiat.\n\nI bought this game purely out of fascination for the Inuit people in general. I was curious to know more. This game did not dissapoint. If you want to know more about these amazing people as they etch out a living on the ice, be sure to get this game. You will find yourself falling in love with how beautiful their holistic way of life is. This game is a truly amazing experience and is worth every cent.\n\nNow for the scores:\n\nStory: 95/100\nVisuals: 95/100\nGameplay: 85/100\nSoundtrack: 90/100\n\nOverall Rating: 92/100","September 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I would really like to give this game more mercy points, but honestly I can't. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst programmed and most boring platformers I very played.\n\nYou made a bad game, when at least once you reminded yourself of infamous Sonic 2006 when playing it. Controls are that bad! They are completely unresponsive, sluggish and unreliable, leading you into pits of death and frustration constantly. Game isn't challenging in any shape or form, so my fight with those controls became the one of the only sources of any kind of emotions from playing it. Levels are extremely linear, flat and they don't provide any interesting mechanics and clever platforming. Bugs are everywhere. You can see yourself unnaturally teleporting, tripping, slowing down, merging with level's geometry, blocking progress for the next level section. No game is bug free, but there is a limit and Never Alone clearly surpasses it with flying colors!\n\nWhile playing you are constantly peppered with "Cultural Insings" - micro-documentaries about people and life at frozen Alaskan tundra. You aren't forced to watch them, but at least they are a bit interesting and they give some salvation from the horrible gameplay. That said, those aren't game's saving graces. It's pretty staggering how gameplay seems to be an afterthought to the initial idea and not a core focus of the game. There are many titles that mix interesing cultural knowledge with top-notch gameplay and they are better for it. Year Walk for example, where connections are subtile and gameplay is polished. Never Alone unfortunately doesn't do that. It plays it safe and does it poorly.\n\nI would also like to notice that in my opinion this game DOES NOT deserve any accolades and awards that you can see on the store page. Great, award-worthy games need to play well or be very engaging. I'm sadly shocked that interesting, but ultimately fatally executed subject matter is enough for many judges, while other games that are in real, pushing the medium forward with clever designs and ideas go unrecognized.\n\nThat 15 dollars price tag only adds insult to injury... and I didn't even managed to get all the Steam cards while completing the main game and it's DLC to 100%! Developers completely wasted their potential and created a game what it not worth your time, money and makes a great disservice for the interesting topics it tries to preset.","May 17","false","5.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a simple platformer game, where you control a girl named Nuna and the arctic fox, each with thier own unique abilities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chieflink/recommended/295790/","chieflink","ChiefLink or Chill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chieflink/","993 products in account","I originally found this game interesting because I had recently played Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Limbo some time ago.  I found that they struck me in unique ways.  Interesting and not overly challenging (since I am terrible at most platformers), and loaded with a story that I can really get behind.\n\nNever Alone strikes a different mark from the other games I compare it to.  It's not as emotionally striking as Brothers, nor is it as dark as Limbo.  Rather, it's exactly what you find in the description.  History and culture blend as one to tell a story that is both close to home and filled with imagination and wonder.  Throughout, the story has compelling twists and tense moments.\n\nThat said, I prefer the games I've played before.  Strictly from a gameplay standpoint, the game gets a bit clumsy and repetitive.  There were times I found myself baffled or frustrated by the controls (playing on a keyboard may be my problem) and occasionally not sure of my next step.  I also felt that the end was cut short.\n\nI digress, for all the negative thoughts I have are forgotten in the storytelling and opportunities to learn about a culture I wouldn't know about otherwise.  Plus, as I mentioned before, I'm not good at most games requiring coordination.\n\nI would consider this game to be a work of art for the way it portrays a fairy tale and it's significance to the culture.  The videos detailing the cultural tropes you see are fascinating to myself, simply because I love stories.\n\nI highly recommend the game for curious learners.","November 26, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","This review will include both the main-game and the Foxtales--rather one story--DLC. Considering at the moment there is a bundle deal for both items and the soundtrack, I would recommend getting that offer if the game does interest you.\n\nGameplay Bug Bears\nThere are plenty of outlets that have gone into great detail on the shortcomings of this game. Namely, the gameplay. I don't really think I can say anything else than this game is a platformer: You jump, you solve simple puzzles with either the environment (mostly spirit guides) or some sort of tool (the projectile or a box or something).\n\nI have heard from people like Total Biscuit that the KB&M controls are a pain to deal with, but I play these games with a controller all the time. Even on the controller, the gameplay can be stiff, especially when you are in a chase-sequence and you need to wind-up your projectile to knock an obstacle in-front of you under stress. You have to hold the aim-stick back, wait a second to charge it up, then fling the stick in the other direction to launch while running as fast as you can.\n\nAlso, I played this game solo, and yes, the AI will get stuck or get itself killed regularly, though I have found the AI fares better in the main-game now (but the DLC has the same problem). So the local cooperative play is perhaps your best way of experiencing this game.\n\nWhat might interest you about this game?\nWIth those issues put forward, now let me try to entince you to want to play this game. The main thing this game does excell in is its aesthetic. Not only do the models of the protagonists, the tundra landscape and other animals look beautiful but the mythical spirits and other supernatural elements fit so perfectly that even the natural landscapes almost seem dreamlike. And throughout the game the environments keep you to want to move forward.\n\nDespite how simple the puzzles are, the game does feel well-made for a simple coop platformer. Of course, not everything mechanical is flawless; bugs, glitches or the delay on the projectile are minor problems. But if you appreciate both the pace of a good 50 hour RPGs and the no-extra-fluff of a 2 to 4 hour title, then I think you'll enjoy the game regardless of its brief length.\n\nLastly, there is obviously a lot of devotion put into honoring the creators' heritage, and it shows through the story and the art-style. The best way I can recommend this game is to ask you to not think of this as another simple artsy platformer like Limbo or A Story of My Uncle; it's a game-adaptation of an ancient epic tale from another culture. Like something you'd read out of The Odyssey. You have a heroine relying on her own skills and her compainion, the Fox, to overcome the challenges of nature and to save her family and friends over the seflish interests in some people. That is at least how I see the game, an interactive epic tale--you might think otherwise.\n\nThe story isn't going to be groundbreaking to modern tastes, obviously, but the story they do have touches on timeless human nature themes: Altrustistic communities, the error in selfish pursuits, the afterlife within our natural world, supernatural forces, etc. I think the way the game handles telling these stories with only the narrator explaining what the protagonists are pursuing and thinking makes for a wonderful tale for adults. There are some dark tones in the story that makes it feel very mature, yet nothing is too graphic for kids if you want to play this game with a younger sibling or child, unless death is too morbid of a topic to handle.\n\nIntrusive Commentary\nAs much as I appreciate being given cultural context in the game, such as the projectile weapon or the beliefs of the creators, I rather wished the commentary didn't feel so shoehorned. You are not forced to watch them, but every menu screen will remind you of any unseen cultural insights. And the cultural insights are the only collectables to be found. Some of these clips do a good job in explaining what some characters, like the Owl Man, mean/represent and what purpose do they serve. Others I thought were too preachy or trying too hard to make the culture sound more original when they were using the same themes found in other cultures.\n\nAlso, some of the subtly is lost through these sometimes blunt explainations, and sometimes these explainations are reaching beyond what was shown to the player. For example, the introduction of the Foxtales is of the fox chasing a mouse and the girl following along--this apparently is the devs showing that the two are disrespecting nature by playing with animals and not hunting them. Is this clear to the player? Not really, not until the very last cultural insight are you told that was the moral of the story. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it does stand out compared to other cutscenes that tell the lessons of the story through actions and gameplay.\n\nThe DLC: Foxtales\nTotal playtime of the DLC with several deaths and all the cultural insight videos, 70 mins. I find it hard to recommend current players to buy this DLC at the current discounted price as the name of the DLC should have been "A Foxtale", unless the devs plan on making more side-stories with the two protagonists. A season-pass or some sort of bundle of these extra levels would be the best idea to purchase, if more are on the way. What you get with this DLC are three levels with new puzzle mechanics added in: there is a small boat, some spirit rocks and a new boss-fight. The puzzles are more complex, yet they're still very simple. It's a rather bittersweet bonus story.\n\nConclusion\nNo matter how much I have nitpicked at this game, and how there are legitimate issues with the gameplay, I still think I got my money's worth out of this game. Perhaps you might think the same if you give it a try.","July 29, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The animation is beautiful, the music is beautiful, but what I love most are the Cultural Insight videos that you can find and watch.\n\nThe puzzles can get tricky, espicially if, like me, you're not good at either puzzles or platforming games, so where it took most people only a couple hours, it took me around 11.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game (minus the very heartbreaking event that happens just before the end) is the fact that there are times when it's REALLY obvious that this was made for two people and then adapated to be played by one person. There were times when I had split seconds to change characters and then complete the needed action, be that jumping or in Nuna's case using the bola. All of the puzzles can be completed by a single person, but playing by yourself can sometimes get a little tricky when you need to change characters quickly.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8.5 out of ten.\n\nI very much recommend this game, frustrations and all.

With a playtime of about 2.5 hours, it is the perfect game to play with a girl/boyfriend on a cold, rainy afternoon.\n\nThe puzzles in Never Alone are nothing you haven't seen before, but it's still fun. The game has a certain feel to it that just makes you want to play it despite having more casual gameplay. Most of the controls work fine aside from aiming the bola being a bit tricky and spirit controlling being unresponsive at times. I played alone and I can say that the switching between two characters works well and is done perfectly (although this is nothing to worry about if you're playing local co-op).  This game is probably more fun if you have someone to play it with.

It isn't impossible.\n\nThe story line is great, although the story is short, I've really enjoyed the game. The only negative point for me is that I couldn't watch the culture visions because the game would crash. Maybe if I try some different settings, it may work for me.

There are numerous cutscenes and mini-videos explaining each of their beliefs and habits in detail, which are very well produced and beautiful. I really enjoyed watching them and was amused about the discoveries about their culture which I didn't expect.\n\nAbout the game itself, it is visually stunning, but lacks real difficulty, everything is quite obvious and only gets a little more complicated by the end, where the difficulty can be by the game itself or by the poor AI which fails to control the character you're not using, letting it die again and again (which was really frustrating).\n\nSo yeah, it's a beautiful game indeed, with a unique story and storytelling, but rather short (~2h30min to watch and do everything in game) and with zero replayability. It feels like a documentary or a short movie, not really a game and I recommend because I enjoyed learning about the Iñupiat, but could have felt the same watching a well produced video.","July 7, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It starts with a young girl her village is being devastated by a storm and she sets of to find and stop the storm. As you progress you unlock little clips about the people and its nice and interesting but ultimatlety very sad as their way of life is being threatened by changes in the climate.\n\nThe game itself is a very well crafted platformer and its lovely to look at. If you are playing on your own you do play a second character and on keyboard it can be a little clunky but it didn't spoil it, was just a bit more of a challenge. I would defintely put it up there with A tale of two sons and Limbo etc. Tale of two sons is tigher but for sheer magic its defintely with it for me. Obviously it isnt fantasy its more about nature the environment and spirituality and there is a documentary but as a game it stands up in my humble opinion.\n\n\nReally beautiful game. Recommended.\n\nJust a little update played through the dlc Foxtales and it was really good, very short but I thoroughly enjoyed it. You go on rescue mission for a little mouse who got taken away with the current and have to fight a big monster mouse. You have a boat to steer and your little fox friend is with you. Some interesting platforming. Again very beautiful in the same vain as the first I enjoyed it.","July 4, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Eskimos!\n\nThe more you play, the more you discover the lore told by younger and older people from Inupiat tribe.\nSo not only do you enjoy the game itself, you're also expanding your knowledge about something very unique.\nThe corelations of stories and the game itself makes this title one of a kind and very addictive within first minutes of starting it.\n\nThe game gives a child-like feeling, where you're the child and Never Alone is the adult who is telling you an exciting bedtime story right before you'll go to sleep.

Oh wait. Yes Never Alone is both a gorgeous looking game, as well as a beautiful experience. Based around myth and legend of the Iñupiat, a native Alaskan people Never Alone takes us on a wonderful journey. You play as a young Iñupiat girl and her arctic fox after they are thrust on an adventure together when her village is destroyed by a mysterious man. The story that follows is both heartfelt, thoughtful and challenging.\n\nVisualy I can't describe how stunning Never Alone looks. The soft snow effects, and precisely detailed backgrounds come alive with each step, sometimes literally. Snow drifts around you and your parka, and ruffles it's fur. Your characters react to changes in the wind, and lighting. Friendly Iñupiat spirits drift in and out of existence to help you along the way. The expressions on your character's faces easily portray emotion as you struggle on and sometimes die after a misstep. Each environment feels alive, even in what may seem a bleak barren land at times.\n\nBehind all the beautiful visuals, a solid, co-operative side scrolling platformer exists. You and your trustworthy fox must work together to traverse a multitude of different obstacles. While your main character is at first limited to running and jumping, your fox friend has several useful abilities. He can climb walls, or jump between them. He can also influence the various Iñupiat spirits around, which provide new platforms to use to get to different areas. Later as the puzzles become more complex you are gifted with various new abilities. A bola for the young girl, the powers of flight and spirit manipulation for the fox. These new abilities are doled out an even pace and give you new things to play with throughout your play through.\n\nThough there aren't a lot of major new concepts here, what is in play is very solid. Puzzles range from simple to challenging, and new concepts come at you regularly. The environments are imaginative, and their uses surprising. Boss battles can be tough, and you will die often as you figure out their patterns. It is very rare however that these encounters feel long, or get frustrating. Most of these tougher challenges involve you taking advantage of the environment around you. And they all make good use of the co-operative element.\n\n\nNever Alone is built to be both a cooperative or solo adventure, both are enjoyable. As a solo player, it is easy for you to switch between characters, and the AI controlled character is generally smart enough to go where they need to go. Running solo lets you take your time to soak in the rich environments and beautiful effects. Playing as a duo however requires a decent amount of timing and communication as to not die often.\n\n\nThe story in Never Alone, though starting on a tragic note is wonderful to discover. Each environment you enter into tells a story, and as you explore you are given insights into the Iñupiat culture. These are delivered through both video snipets you can view, as well as behind the scenes documentaries. Between each story break, you are treated to animated versions of traditional Iñupiat drawings. These are presented in storyboard format and connect each story and environment together. Your reward for completing Never Alone, is just as beautiful and tragic. It is truly a rewarding arc to follow.\n\nI can't state enough how beautiful an experience Never Alone is. It's visuals, unique setting, story and characters are all a joy to experience. The focal point on the Iñupiat people is both insightful and rewarding. With gameplay that is solid, though not groundbreaking it's very hard to find anything to critizise here. Never Alone is a game you should take your time to experience, and enjoy.","July 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm going to ignore the SJW's that tout this game as the be all end all example of representing cultures and hold it on high for other races about what they believe games should be about. Because I'll be as up front and candid as I can. This is not the example of a well put together product let alone some justification for whining about not being represented enough in games. (Not every character represents you, that's kind of the point)\n\nMECHANICS\nThis game is short, its under 3 hours. I was either bored to tears or frustrated because of clumsy, inconsistent controls the entire time. The puzzles are simple and unchallenging. Often the characters would not grab ledges, be able to interact with the spirit platforms or be perplexed when trying to decided to move regarding switching directions. The swimming is a whole other issue. At least on the surface, the player movement speed on the surface of water is excruciatingly slow.\n\nAs for the AI, I played this single player making me have to switch between the 2 characters playing proper co-op may have alleviated some stress though I still found the game unengaging. The opposite partner that I was not controlling consistently ran off of ledges or fell into some part of the world that would get me killed and I'd have to start over. This happened more than I'd like to admit. Not to mention they would at times decide not to follow me unless I switched back and nudged them along.\n\nThere is a twist regarding the mechanics about half way through. The fox is killed and becomes a spirit boy allowing for him to float and interact with the spirit orbs for Nuna to whack rather than just having the fox run along the groundI was genuinely surprised at this turn as I did not expect it. However the same tired mechanics were only briefly given new light.\n\nThe platforming itself along with the puzzles becomes boring, repetitive and tedious almost the instant the mechanics are introduced. The only saving grace I can say regarding this is the check-pointing is fairly frequent.\n\nThe other main mechanic is not even controlled at your own volition. The wind is something that both aids and impedes your ability to progress but what feels broken about this is that the game relies too heavily on the wind as a mechanic rather than actually creating a realistic and foreboding atmosphere which admittedly I would have preferred to having an additional thing to time jumps with. Its too fast and too sudden and is not consistent with how far it throws the character.\n\nOTHER STUFF\nThere are some fairly interesting videos that are unlocked explaining the culture the game is based on but they feel out of place. They should have integrated more into the game itself or had them be entirely separate.\n\nTHE GIST\nI'd skip this entirely. Watch the videos on youtube and donate some money if you enjoyed them because the game itself does a poor job of creating an interesting environment as well as explain the very thing that it claims inspiration from.","November 30, 2015","false","4.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm really pulled out of the experience when I miss simple jumps and die and then have to rerun the last minute of platforming.\n\nIt might just be my machine, but I have to give the game a poor review.","January 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Reading some of the other reviews, they say one of the main points of this game is more the videos that accompany the game and that you unlock with play. However, these themselves are not accessable to most of the games owners because the game itself doesn't have one of the crucial components to play said videos without crashing the game. Even then, sometimes the game will still crash after playing a single vdeo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarinn/recommended/295790/","sarinn","Sarinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarinn/","182 products in account","Never Alone is a simple platform game, which tells the story of one girl and her fox trying to find the source of a blizzard that is threatening her village & her people. Throughout the game, which takes about 2 to 2.5 hours to go from start to finish, the player will also be exposed to other bits of folk lore, from the Little People (a group of mischievous, super strong humanoids), Manslayer (a person who puts their greed and selfish desires before the community), Sky People, nature spirits, and more.\n\nAt times controls can feel stiff and there are a few moments where you will miss a jump or fall off a ledge due to this. Had they put in a little more work towards this, I think the game would have been much more rewarding to players and less frustrating.\n\nI think the art-style of the game was a very good choice. Cut scenes also mix in animated tribal art and figures, which help keep the tone and mood throughout the game. Living in the praries of Canada, we get our fair share of blizzards and wind storms, and Never Alone does a good job depicting the blizzard in the game in both animation and sound.\n\nOne of the things few mention about this game is that it also has mini-documentaries which are unlocked as you go through the game. There are 24 in total, lasting only a couple minutes each, and can be played in the middle of a game when you unlock one, or after through the main menu. I found playing these short documentaries during the game actually added to it, as they would have something to do with the lore of the level you were in. Some of these documentaries are about the lore of the indiginous people (such as about the Sky People), while others were more practical (like how skin of the cariboo from different seasons were used for specific clothing).\n\nIn the end, not only does one finish Never Alone feeling like they were just told a good story, but one also walks away feeling as though they have learned something.","December 26, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The tropical islands of the Pacific. Clear waters where you can see the bottom of the bay, warm temperatures year-round, palm trees, and the whole atmosphere.\n\nSo here I am trekking across the frozen wilderness of Alaska.\n\nNever Alone is a puzzle platformer (think LIMBO) based on the Inupiaq story of Kunuuksaaayuka, originally about a boy (a girl here) named Nuna  who investigates the mysterious unending blizzards that are plaguing her village and threatening her community. Along the way, she'll tangle with polar bears, leprechaun-esque creatures called Little People, a dangerous being called the Manslayer, and the aurora (no, seriously). She's not alone, as she has an arctic fox friend, who can scale walls, wall jump, crawl under tight spaces, and most importantly, aid in the use of spirits for platforming. Nuna isn't completely worthless, as she gains a weapon called a Bola she can use to destroy obstacles, can climb ropes and ladders, and...yeah, the fox is certainly more interesting to play as.\n\nThe scenery is great, as long as you can take tons of snow and ice. It does a great job creating the feeling of a desolate frozen wasteland. The Inupiaq art style is brought in with story segments shown in basic cutscenes (with an Inupiaq narrator with subs), as well as the animal spirits that help you on your travels. Also of note are Cultural Insights, live-action videos of Inupiaq Eskimos who tell of their culture and way of life (you'll need to find and view all of them for achievements).\n\nThere are a few downsides. The game is short. I 100%'d it in about 4 hours, but LIMBO was about the same length. Also, the game can get glitchy, especially in a long climbing segment near the end of the game.\n\nOverall, it's a good platformer with an insight into a culture that few talk about and is usually brushed aside as "Eskimos, ice fishing, and igloos". It's certainly worth checking out.","December 25, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Ran a lot, fought against evil and yes, success! But first things first: What a great atmospheric game! Loved the cute graphics and style. Sry Alaska, I´ve always wanted to visit you, but after playing that game... it´s too freezing cold there! ;)\nAn interesting fact is that the story is based on the traditional lore of the Inupiak people. You´re surrounded by magical spirits (helpful or not) and fantasy creatures. If you like you can get a lot of facts about their culture through the offered video sequences.\n\nBut even when there is a lot of light, there must be some shadows... In my opinion the game was too short, we just finished it in around 3 hours and we had to replay some scenes several times ;)\nMaybe because of my lack of skills or sometimes because of the lack of smoothness of the controls, who knows? There is definetly room for improvement.\nI liked the story but a little bit more content would have been great!\n\nI recommend this game for family gaming in Co-Op mode. The puzzles aren´t too hard to solve, gaming may lead to a better understanding of different cultures and it´s quiet amusing for a short amount of time.\n\nIf you would like to have a look at the gameplay, feel free to watch our Co-Op Walkthrough on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5QlyV8SBpA&list=PLMtMv3dUue7Xa9oathcppUTu0AoPq4Crb","January 16, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

For that reason alone, even playing this was unlikely, but this game looked so cute I just had to try it and now, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) can be added to this list.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG3SG2D6GaM&list=UUMc9vxo5NN-yMIkAecJ87Bg\nThis game is dreamy.  Beautiful graphics backed by a solid story give it something very few games of any genre posses.  I can imagine feeling the ice crystals whipped into the air, scratching at my face, when the blizzard blows and breathing in the cold arctic air as I run from danger.  The story is intertwined with the unique culture of the Iñupiat people and blends well with the atmosphere the game creates. I really think that these are the reasons I like it so much.\n\nAs a platformer, it has some fun mechanics, nevertheless it is nothing spectacular on this front, as many current games of the genre have much more depth of play.  I know I find games like this frustrating at times and rarely finish any of them but this is one of this gems that I may even play a second time.\n\nGameFace","March 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

By progressing in the game and puzzles one can unlock short (app. 2 min) pieces of documentary, called "Cultural Insight", that explain a little about Inuit life, the people, and the story you are in, following a small girl that decides to investigate the cause of the blizzard that's afflicting her village. On her journey she meets a snow fox she befriends.\n\nMost of the puzzles are fairly straight forward and not too difficult, with an occassional exception maybe. I've played it entirely single player mode on keyboard and mouse, which can be a little tricky sometimes, having to switch between Nuna and the fox, but the controls work fine. There's no combat involved in this game.\n\nYou'll be prompted about the Cultural Insights every time you unlock them or when you are on a loading screen, which may be intrusive to gameplay to someone who wants to focus on the game, but I didn't find it all too annoying and interesting to watch. You can watch them at any time (again).\n\nThe value of the game in regard to the price may depend on how much value you take out of the story, the documentary and gameplay really.","August 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Its controls are clunky with neither gamepad nor mouse/keyboard feeling particularly good; workable, yes, but not at all good. Its collision detection bugs out every now and then, getting the player character stuck in level geometry or having you miss a jump that you really didn’t miss. [Although, the other way around as well, so… yay?] Add the odd crash to the mix and you’d have a game I cannot recommend.\n\nYet: It’s a good game. And I’d even go as far as to say: an important game. When was the last time you played a game about something, anything related to Alaskan indigenous people? Never? Thought so. Having a window -- as small as it might be -- into a culture you probably don’t think about that often, if at all, is important in a medium and an industry which too often relies on the same viewpoints.\n\nIt’s a re-telling of an Iñupiat myth in form of a difficult [as mentioned, sometimes for the wrong reasons], not too difficult, and charming puzzle-platformer that has so much heart put into it. In short: It’s a flawed gem.\nAlso, one look at Nuna’s and the fox’s animations will put the biggest smile on your face and make you forget the game’s shortcomings.

The graphics are amazing, the story line is interesting and fun, it really gets you interested in this culture! The only problem I have with the game (whether it be from my own computer or just present in the game in general) is the controls. Yes, the controls are easy to remember but they are very slow and it's rather hard to control the characters for events that require good timing. For me, I just kind of get frustrated about the game after a while so I suggest this to anyone who has enough patience to do this at all.

That's usual, but even more so with this game. Taking the role of a Native tribe girl and also a spirit fox you must defeat polar bears, a bad man, and figure out where the blizzard is coming from.\n\nAs far as depicting a Native folktale, this was excellent. I had never heard the story before, not a surprise really, and playing it in game form was extremely well done and I hope opens the way for other tales from whatever culture makes you happy. I don't know how important or prominent this story is in this particular Native tribe, so maybe it won't affect as much as I'd hope.\n\nBut moving on, the graphics are good and listening to the tribe's language with English subtitles is also good. The biggest drawback for this game is, as with most indie titles, the price and the controls. For $15 full price you get 2 hours of gameplay, which is a better value than Gone Home but not quite that of a movie. Unless you like replaying puzzles you've already solved, there is next to no replayability unless you missed a few owls that let you explore some history. That alone makes it better than Gone Home. The puzzles themselves aren't that difficult, and anyone who thought this was a Limbo clone may be disappointed with how easy they are. You switch between the spirit fox and the tribe girl to do different tasks but nothing in this game had me go "hm" like it did in Limbo.\n\nThe controls were my biggest obstacle, and they really felt like they needed mroe work. Often I'd grab onto a cliff, fall to my death, then do the exact same thing again and grab on that time. I would try to turn quickly but fail and fall, I would try to aim the bola weapon with my arm pointing directly at the wall of ice but the bola would fly in a random direction, and the spirit fox felt extremely sluggish at certain times for no reason. It's a spirit, he shouldn't be that slow, but this was toward the end of the game. The worst problem I ran into was when the fox got stuck in a wall forcing me to restart the checkpoint, which brings up another point: when in the heck are checkpoints made? There's an indicator that I can only guess means loading, because sometimes I would respawn one step back and sometimes I'd have to redo the entire room. This made leaving the game a gamble, and probably 20 minutes of my 2 hours was spent redoing a puzzle I already did.\n\nBesides feeling like it could have used a little more work for getting published, I think its purpose was pulled off well and it's a game I would recommend to anyone who likes Native folklore or even indie titles with a real story and none of this vague interpretation garbage that we get with Limbo, Braid, and Gone Home. That reason alone makes me like it more than many indie games I've played in the past couple of years.","December 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It looked really nice and the atmosphere was very good. The storytelling style is original and interesting...\n\nAnd then the game was a completely unplayable mess. Glitches are completely constant, such as poor ledge collision detection, cameras not panning when they're supposed to, parts of the game where events are supposed to happen but didn't, and otherwise a mess that could have been something truly wonderful, but ended up being nothing short of absolutely infuriating.\n\nIn the game you play an Inuit girl who is partnered up with an arctic fox (I love foxes, just see my avatar) however, when playing, whatever character your aren't playing as gets themselves killed very, very frequently to the point that parts of the game depend entirely on dumb luck to see it through. Mix that with parts where the clumsy controls mixed with the original intended challenges of the game make parts that should be light and simple into a nightmare where skill isn't as important as hoping to whatever spirits or deities you pray to that the game's wonky system just happens to play to your favor...\n\nThis game may, with a number of bug fixes, be something really amazing. Right now as it stands it's a hopeless mess that's only currently good for a "rage game."\n\nI hope in time this game improves, I want to see more games with this type of direction and exploring other cultures. I do, however, wish that the game functioned a bit more smoothly, the controls were tighter, the collision and ledge detection worked better, and that the character you're not currently playing wasn't a suicidal yahoo.\n\nTo the developers, I love the concept, I really do, but please fix this game.

Don't expect it to be memorable.\n\nThe art-style is the best part: a combination of 3D cute graphics and 2D (hand-drawn?) cut scenes.\n\nThe first hour of game play is great, as new and interesting game mechanics are introduced. Beyond that hour, it's as if the creative team hits a wall, because the mechanics start to become repetitively annoying rather than novel. By the end, I just wanted the game to end. I honestly started nodding off at one point.\n\nThere are a number of bugs in the game that we ran into. Nothing major to note.\n\nThe added touch of Lirik appearing as the fox was neat. He also manages to get me killed, when I'm not controlling him.\n\nTotal game-time is about 3 hours, without rushing.\n\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless it was a part of the Humble Bundle or at least 50% off. Quite simply, you experience 90% of the game in the first hour.","November 19, 2014","false","3.4"," 28 of 63 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","28","63","0","1"

It's an actual folk tale, not just one made up for the game. Even better, it comes with deep context. I wasn't just avoiding green ghosts while platforming, I was hiding from the Northern Lights and the ghost children that wanted to play football with my head.\n\nThis game is probably most enjoyable for in-between gamers. Hardcore players might get frustrated that the characters won't turn on a dime, and very casual players will likely find the last few chapters frustratingly hard. If you're in the middle, and enjoy story, learning about culture, atmosphere, and animation detail, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a great experience. Personally, I think it's worth playing even you you never make it through to the end.\n\nSecond to playing the beautiful white fox, I found the "cultural insights" to be one of my favorite features of the game. I love collecting things in a game, and trying to find every single owl was a great reason to explore the game's settings thoroughly. Some of the insight videos were like mini documentaries, telling me things about how this native culture exists in the modern day. Many of the videos were stories: life and death experiences that had happened to the tellers or their family. Almost all provided depth and background to the game: I learned the traditions of the Northern Lights, I really felt the abandoned landscape of King Island, I saw how the art of the cut scenes came from on the style of real-world scrimshaw, and I got to hear several other traditional stories. I strongly suggest not waiting until the end of the game to watch the insights you unlock.","December 7, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a part where you need to do some stuff in a panic, but it counts for like 5% of the game. I like that, but I can leave other's to their own opinions.\n\nIt's a very educational game, no doubt. By this, I mean to say that it's agenda is to teach you about the real life of the natives of Alaska through videos. In game you solve puzzles; the game's story line is 100% off folklore of the Alaskans.\n\nI do have a problem regarding the educational video pop-ups, however. You go tend to get them a lot and while you can just ignore them, they're rather hard to do so at first. I almost always have a nagging feeling to press whatever button the screen tells me when I first play, but after some time this goes away and you just know when an educational video notification will occur. Another problem is when the scene cuts and you're moving to a new area, you actually have to say no to a video to progress. It won't start or anything, it just gives you the option to watch one right then and there or not. It's a little weird.\n\nI didn't think the controls were clunky, but there were a couple times when the AI controlling you're other half (you're either little girl or fox; you can switch) will suicide off a cliff and it's really annoying. Usually, though, the AI does a fine job of keeping up with you and you can usually predict what they'll do.\n\nFor whatever reason I had low frame rates and tried tinkering with it (I mean, it ran fine) the game just seems to require a lot of GPU for whatever reason.","December 7, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From what I've played so far the game is interestingly challenging especially in the later sections as you swap from the girl to the fox to solve multiple puzzles. The game can be very frustrating sometimes as you have to repeat several sections over and over again do to dieing alot. But the story is beutifull and the soundtrack is also. Also, the sound quality of the game and the voice acting of the narrarater is great! I found myself sunk into the story as I continued forth with my pet fox. "Did I mention I love foxes?" The game is far from perfect as I experienced some bugs here and there with terrain and some clipping issues but that didn't destroy the experience for me. Over all rating I'd give it a 10/10 because of the amount of detail there was in the foreground and background.

There are so many small-to-medium flaws in this game that completely overshadow the obvious hard work the developers put in. I'll start off with the pros:\n\nPros:\n- The artwork is beautiful: music, animations, visuals are all amazing.\n- The concept of the game is great: I really like the idea of following a Native storyline, and the plot is fun/cute enough that it's not boring.\n\nCons:\n- The controls are clunky, slow, and sometimes unresponsive. It makes even basic movements in the game (jumping, aming the Bola) really hard, and you tend to die a lot.\n- There are bugs a-plenty. I'm pretty sure the fox isn't supposed to be able to travel through some walls. Grabbing onto platforms, walking around, everything is just a little less precise, and it's hard to control your character.\n- The AI is not great: in single player mode, your partner character (controlled by AI) will sometimes die for no reason, sending you to your previous checkpoint at no fault of your own.\n- Gameplay logic isn't consistent: in the first zone, if you fall into the water, you die. Next zone- you need to swim. Hmmm...\n\nVisually this game is very pleasing, and it looks like the developers put a lot of work into it. I just don't think it's worth the price (even with the 40% discount). Otherwise, if the developers could iron out some of the bugs, it would absolutely be worth it.","January 31, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I suspect most issues go away if you're playing co-op rather than single player.\n---\nJust a heads up: I've noticed some co-op players mentioning unresponsive controls. If you're attempting co-op play on a keyboard, please look up keyboard ghosting. Many keyboards can't support enough simultaneous key-presses for keyboard-only multiplayer to be viable.]\n\n----\n\nThe biggest problem is that both characters need to be in roughly the same spot for certain things to happen, and that the second character AI's "leash" is too long to make that reliable. I've had many instances where I brought the girl to the next part of the level only to get stuck wondering what I'm supposed to do. Then in messing aronud, I find out the fox needed to take 3 steps forward for the next platform to appear.\n\nIt gets more complicated when the characters have to take separate paths, since the other one will just sit still until you move them yourself. For example, at one point the girl has to swing across two ghostly ropes over a spike pit, while the fox takes a tunnel above. The problem here is that the second rope for the girl only appears when the fox is at the half-way point in his path, and in singleplayer the fox will just sit at the start of his path. Since this is the first rope-swing in the game, I wound up making several suicidal jumps into the spike pit, since nothing hinted at the second rope even existing.\n\nThe camera tends to add to this type of problem, since it's one of those that will lag behind your character when running. Most of the time, you can only see a quarter-screen ahead of you, so it's hard to know whether you're going to jump into a pit or a ledge.\n\nAs for controls, it's really just a matter of animations sticking too much. Like if you want to stop running to use the bolo, you have to wait until the two "slowing down" steps finish after letting go of your direction keys, before it'll let you attack. Or how you have to actually turn around first, as a separate action, before jumping or attacking in the opposite direction.","January 31, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There’s a dime a dozen of these indie games and while I’m not saying that’s bad, these games do have to be pretty special to stand out from the crowd.\n\nWell Never Alone (Kisima Inŋitchuŋa) does stand out from the crowd. Upper One Games in conjunction with E-Line Media (entertainment and education publisher) and the Cook Inlet Tribal Council (representatives of the Inupiat cultural group – Alaskan natives) have retold an Inupiat folk tale in the form of a video game. The cut scene art design is taken directly from Inupiat art and the game is narrated in the native language (with subtitles).\n\nNever Alone has some unconventional game design that initially surprised and annoyed me turned out to be reasonably creative. The developers really made an effort to interweave mechanics, visual design, educational value and Inupiat culture into a well-rounded game.\n\nNever Alone‘s educational value didn’t really come from the game mechanics; if used in a supervised, classroom environment, Never Alone could be considered a rather entertaining learning tool. Partially because of its knowledge delivery, but also partially because it can be played co-op (team play is so much more engaging).\n\nSo is it worth the $15 you’re likely to pay for it? That’s still an easy yes. It is only a short game, taking me 3 hours to finish. But it was exactly the right length. While I did find some the gameplay a hindrance rather than fun, it’s not so hard that you can’t push through it after a couple of attempts. Some of the unique aspects of the game and live-action story telling makes this a game I can recommend to most people.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/12/28/never-alone-kisima-innitchuna/","January 16, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the past, I spent time in Alaska where I gained an interest in the Inuit language and culture. Seeing the videos with insight into the Inuit culture, along with following a story completely narrated in the Inuit language. The gameplay itself was also pretty fun. I enjoyed the fact that you had to use teamwork to accomplish anything, although it did get a bit annoying to switch between Nuna and Fox sometimes (especially when the non-controlled started doing things that hampered my progress). I really loved the setting of the arctic, as well as unlocking the videos as I made my way through the story.\n\nThe only real issues I had: throwing/aiming the bola was a pain, and a weird situation I where I'd control both characters at once with my controller. That proved to be an easy fix by saving a few lines as autoexec.cfg (fix is listed on the game's website).","December 22, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of patience. It's a platformer, but the focus is on the Inupiat culture and not the actual gameplay. The Fox is wonderfully animated and his AI is pretty good (and the sounds he makes are absolutely ADORABLE). The same can't be said for the little girl. Her AI sucks. Example: I'll be playing as Fox to do something, and she'll just kind of walk off a ledge while I'm trying to make a nature spirit approach her. It'd probably be a lot easier co-op, but you'll probably end up fighting over who gets to be Fox because he's more fun and more forgiving.\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's not interested in different cultures, because the gameplay's not all that tight. Sometimes, the game expects you to die (who expects a walkway to snap suddenly and throw you over a chasm?) and there's really no skill involved there, just knowing what's ahead. The story is a very old folk tale passed down generationally, and the game features lots of video clips of the Inupiat elders (skippable). Very pretty and artistic, but not worth the price, unless you're a culture buff. Recommended only on sale. 6/10","December 23, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It remains simple with a slowly building complexity that never really gets too difficult.  A few puzzles that took a short while to figure out.  But mostly the focus was on continuing along.  It's really short due to the checkpoint system, where you rarely have to repeat a series of objectives simply due to its frequent checkpoints.  The overall gameplay would best be summed up in style as a 2-D ICO.  It's about using both characters to get past objectives.  It's easy to swap between, or you can play multiplayer if you have two controllers.\n\nThe game is buggy, unfortunately it tends to have occasionally slow frame rates, and you can get stuck in walls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/recommended/295790/","redwolf29","RedWolf_29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/","145 products in account","What's it about?\nNever Alone (Kisima Ingithuna) is a 2.5D puzzle platformer based around Alaska Native stories and culture. You play as Nuna, a young Alaska Native girl, and Fox, her four-legged vulpine friend (I call him Pat) as they journey across the tundra and ice floes of Alaska in their quest to uncover the source of the savage blizzards that are threatening their very existance.\n\nHow does it play?\nAs previously mentioned, the game is a 2.5D platformer, by which I mean it takes place on a 2D plane with backgrounds in full 3D. It can be played in local co-op, with one player controlling Nuna and the other handling Fox, or single-player with the player switching between the characters at the touch of a button.\n\nThe puzzles are not too difficult, though they do take a few tries to get right, and they use the environment well. Each character has their own set of skills that you uncover as you progress through the game. Nuna can push heavy objects and throw a magical bola to destroy ice barriers, while Fox can scramble up high walls, perform wall jumps and get the spirits of the land to help you out.\n\nThe game has some AI problems, with the character you're not controlling sometimes doing some stupid things like casually hopping off a platform or forgetting to brace in the wind. These problems were apparently worse at launch and a patch has since addressed some of the issues, but it is not perfect. The platforming also feels a little bit heavy, which makes sense when you consider the characters are not superbeings. I prefer platforming to be more dynamic, but this is just personal taste. Nuna's bola is also awkward to aim when using a controller, since you have to tilt the right thumbstick away from and then towards your target. I didn't play with mouse and keyboard, but the game apparently works just fine with them.\n\nHow does it look?\nNever Alone runs on the Unity engine, so it should run just fine on any system. Its a lovely-looking game, with glistening ice and whirling snow bringing the harsh landscape to life, aided by good-quality textures. Animation quality is somewhat lacking, but the character models have a pleasingly cartoony look to them and fur is pretty well rendered on Nuna's coat and Fox's body.\n\nCutscenes between stages are animated in a traditional native art style, which made me think of shadow puppet plays. While I respect what they were trying to achieve, I ultimately thought that these looked a lot worse than the game itself, and actually detatched me from the experience. I think the cutscenes would have been better had they been done in the game engine but, again, this is down to personal preference.\n\nHow does it sound?\nThe narrator delivers the story in his native tongue (I don't know what it's called, forgive my ignorance) with a voice that seems to carry the wisdom of thousands of years. It is not reactive in the way that Bastion was, but does a good job of giving relevance to your actions and progress. The music grants the game a feeling of loneliness and isolation that makes me think of the Phendrana Drifts zone in the Gamecube classic Metroid Prime, and the howling winds of the blizzards are brilliantly realised. You can almost feel the biting cold as each gust of wind threatens to send you flying over an edge or aides you in crossing a wide chasm.\n\nLong story short\nNever Alone is a lovely game. It is only a couple of hours long, yet it seems to be just the right length; not outstaying its welcome but not leaving the player gagging for more. The AI could have done with just a little more tweaking and a couple of glitches could be fixed (there were a couple of times when I clipped through a wall or across a gap), but the experience of the game is one to savour. There are several videos that give you some insight into the Alaska Native culture, which you can view ingame after finding them (I recommend you wait until you've finished the game before viewing them). Overall, Never Alone is by no means perfect, but is a heartwarming tale, ideal for the cold winter nights ahead.","November 29, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Pros/Cons Below)\n\nNever Alone is best played with two people, but still plays very well solo since many of the puzzles only require one character to do something at a time, and the ai controlling the other character is intelligent (for the most part). The dynamic between the two characters is worth mentioning, since both have different but complimentary playstyles; the fox being more nimple at climbing or crawling through small spaces, whereas the girl can climb ladders, move objects, or use her weapon to break ice.\nIn addition, Never Alone shares the Iñupiat culture in a tasteful and powerful way. Short cultural videos - that display the beautiful alaskan landscape, and the lifestyle of the Iñupiat people - can be unlocked in-game by encountering lore owls. The gameplay/storyline itself is also rich with Iñupiat folklore; such as spirits helping you traverse perilous terrain or dwarf-like characters causing mischief.\nAll in all a beautifully done game which is not only fun to play, but teaches you something in the process.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPROS:\n----------\n- Smart & intense gameplay\n+ Interesting and moderately difficult puzzles\n+ Occasional fast-paced action sequences\n+ Minor map exploration elements\n\n- Great for co-op\n- Stunning visuals\n- In-depth cultural experience\n\nCONS:\n----------\n- Occasional gameplay/graphical glitches\n- Short storyline\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------","November 30, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely wonderful art and audio direction paired with Inupiat-language subtitled narration is transportive in a way that actually deserves the word. I grew up in the northern plains of the US (Minnesota) and the feel of cold, winter, and blizzards are conveyed in Never Alone in a way that I've never experienced in a game before. It's worth the ($15) price of admission for that alone.\n\nThe platforming, on the other hand, ranges from "reasonable" in the dead-easy first two-thirds of the game to "unbearably janky" in the final three sequences. I made it through thanks to a checkpoint system that would be generous to a fault in a game with mechanics that aren't actively offensive, but I would have gladly hit an autoplay button to experience the story and the ambiance so as not to have to suffer through the awful gameplay in those later sections.\n\nThat said, I'd recommend playing it through rather than watching it on YouTube if only to enjoy the production values and to be put into the story a little more, at least in the early sections. Plus you unlock "cultural insights" which are slickly produced live-action segments that illustrate some fashion of Inupiat culture, history, lifestyle, and suchlike.\n\nIt's not long (~6 hours it took me, maybe?) and best enjoyed with a co-op partner (switching characters during timed-platforming sections is one of the larger issues with the gameplay, though it's not quite as irritating as the unresponsive movement and janky collision).\n\nDefinitely recommended, though I can't fathom the universe in which this gets a 10/10.","November 30, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To call it a platformer would be accurate, but it fails to illustrate the way I feel about this game. I feel like I want to hide this game away as a keepsake to give to my grandchildren. I don't feel that way about many games, this is one. The cultural videos play like a well made documentary. The game itself plays like an extremely tight platformer. The music and sound in general is beautiful and fitting for every moment. The emotional bond between Fox and Nuna is instant and effortless. When one fails the other feels terrible, but the game doesn't make you dwell on it for too long. I don't see anything annoying or glitchy about it so far. If you have two controllers you can play local co-op to enhance and share this wonderful game. I think it is well worth the full price.

There are so many small-to-medium flaws in this game that completely overshadow the obvious hard work the developers put in. I'll start off with the pros:\n\nPros:\n- The artwork is beautiful: music, animations, visuals are all amazing.\n- The concept of the game is great: I really like the idea of following a Native storyline, and the plot is fun/cute enough that it's not boring.\n\nCons:\n- The controls are clunky, slow, and sometimes unresponsive. It makes even basic movements in the game (jumping, aming the Bola) really hard, and you tend to die a lot.\n- There are bugs a-plenty. I'm pretty sure the fox isn't supposed to be able to travel through some walls. Grabbing onto platforms, walking around, everything is just a little less precise, and it's hard to control your character.\n- The AI is not great: in single player mode, your partner character (controlled by AI) will sometimes die for no reason, sending you to your previous checkpoint at no fault of your own.\n- Gameplay logic isn't consistent: in the first zone, if you fall into the water, you die. Next zone- you need to swim. Hmmm...\n\nVisually this game is very pleasing, and it looks like the developers put a lot of work into it. I just don't think it's worth the price (even with the 40% discount). Otherwise, if the developers could iron out some of the bugs, it would absolutely be worth it.","January 31, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I suspect most issues go away if you're playing co-op rather than single player.\n---\nJust a heads up: I've noticed some co-op players mentioning unresponsive controls. If you're attempting co-op play on a keyboard, please look up keyboard ghosting. Many keyboards can't support enough simultaneous key-presses for keyboard-only multiplayer to be viable.]\n\n----\n\nThe biggest problem is that both characters need to be in roughly the same spot for certain things to happen, and that the second character AI's "leash" is too long to make that reliable. I've had many instances where I brought the girl to the next part of the level only to get stuck wondering what I'm supposed to do. Then in messing aronud, I find out the fox needed to take 3 steps forward for the next platform to appear.\n\nIt gets more complicated when the characters have to take separate paths, since the other one will just sit still until you move them yourself. For example, at one point the girl has to swing across two ghostly ropes over a spike pit, while the fox takes a tunnel above. The problem here is that the second rope for the girl only appears when the fox is at the half-way point in his path, and in singleplayer the fox will just sit at the start of his path. Since this is the first rope-swing in the game, I wound up making several suicidal jumps into the spike pit, since nothing hinted at the second rope even existing.\n\nThe camera tends to add to this type of problem, since it's one of those that will lag behind your character when running. Most of the time, you can only see a quarter-screen ahead of you, so it's hard to know whether you're going to jump into a pit or a ledge.\n\nAs for controls, it's really just a matter of animations sticking too much. Like if you want to stop running to use the bolo, you have to wait until the two "slowing down" steps finish after letting go of your direction keys, before it'll let you attack. Or how you have to actually turn around first, as a separate action, before jumping or attacking in the opposite direction.","January 31, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Its gameplay consists mostly of well-crafted puzzles, using a few simple concepts (the basic actions of each character and the later addition of a magic bola) in interesting ways. Switching between Nuna and Fox for single-player was breezy and effective, although I imagine the game would be much more fun with a second player. A few bugs and unclear objectives brought the experience down, but the gameplay is quite good overall.\nIt's the presentation that really sets Never Alone apart, though. The game is up there with the finest in terms of atmosphere, with beautiful music elevating the immersion. The graphics are well-done, although the scrimshaw-styled cutscenes outshine the real-time graphics of the game. I wish they'd gone all the way with the art style, like Okami or Muramasa, but the spirits that appear in the game do use the scrimshaw style, and look beautiful and eerie against the more realistic backgrounds. Even if you're unfamiliar with Iñupiat lore, the game does an excellent job of drawing you in, even providing interviews with Iñupiaq people (called Cultural Insights) to explain some of the legends and inspirations behind the game.\nThe experience is hurt by its simplicity and short length. However, it's still a great experience overall. It's a great idea, and one worth supporting in the hopes of seeing more games follow in its footsteps, bringing indigenous legends to the world in a brand new way.

Girl and Vulpine must work together to navigate tricky environments, escape from some enemies and defeat others.  Levels are interspersed with story cutscenes and narration, and there are so many cultural 'tidbits' tossed into the game you could even justify it as educational, though the education never gets in the way of the actual game. With smooth visuals and fairly clever design, as well as an interesting story, this game has a lot going for it.\n\nThat said, the game does have a few flaws.  Control, I would say, is it's biggest.  I played single-player with a keyboard, so how it would fare with a controller or a second player I cannot say. But there were times when the game simply did not seem to respond to my keystrokes, usually in the worst possible places, leading to my imminent death or frustration. In some areas of the game, having to rapid switch my control from Fox to Girl and back again required almost insane split-second timing, and really didnt add to the fun for me.\n\nLastly, though its mostly in the tidbits, there is a somewhat preachy and blame-y undercurrent to the game.  Climate change is introduced as a story element, and I note that 'The big bad' of the game looks suspiciously light-skinned. Though probably intended as a means to bring awareness, there is a faint whiff of 'We're very one-with-nature and you are not, you have to deal with the problem you caused, its not our fault.'  Which can seem a little hypocritical when paired with pictures of gasoline powered snow-mobiles, stories with cellphones in them, and mentions of whale hunting.\n\nAll in all though, I actually enjoyed this game and recommend it to everyone.","December 25, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By this, I mean that I love when a dev team has done good, thorough research and highlighted a game with rich streaks of culture. If you enjoyed the mythology behind Year Walk, you'll love this game. It doubles as a documentary of sorts, with unlockable video blurbs about the Inupiaq culture the game is based off of. I love the various art styles and the elderly, throaty voice narrating the tale is downright outstanding! The music during the chase scenes is intense as well! There is a two-player option in which someone can control your travel companion, otherwise it's up to you to control him!\n\nMy only complaint is that the controls seem a little clonky, so some of the more meticulous puzzles can take some time to solve. Once you get the mechanics down, the rest is just timing it right. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with the game and got all available achievements pretty easily.

The game doesn't take a great amount of time to play and may not hold much replay value, but the beauty, story, emotion, and the cultural insights are remarkable and more than make up for the few snags I ran into.

It's a pretty by-the-numbers pair puzzle platformer, though the option to play co-op at any time is nice. I encountered some glitches here and there and it was sometimes difficult to trigger the right action for the game to progress, but what made this game shine was its identity; it's all about the stories and culture of native Alaska. In this respect, it's the best edutainment game I've ever played.\n\nA lot of focus and effort has been put into steeping this game in native Alaskan culture and it was immensely satisfying to learn so much about a people I had known nothing about while playing the game. While the game is not pushing any boundaries graphically, it is stylistically a very pretty game.\n\nIt's a short game (I completed it with all achievements in 3 hours in no particular rush) and not one with much replay value once you've found all the collectibles, but the price is well worth it just for the culture/history lesson on its own.","November 23, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are very interesting and definitely worth watching, but would destroy the atmosphere were they played automatically.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a basic two-character platformer where both characters are required to solve the puzzles presented to you. Most of the time, the puzzles are quite simple, though sometimes you are distracted by surplus platforms or an unfortunate view prevents you from seeing the solution. Later in the game, the single-player difficulty rises significantly, as rapid switching and accurate control of the characters is required due to timers in the scene.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pichuscute/recommended/295790/","pichuscute","pichuscute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pichuscute/","13 products in account","Never Alone is a gorgeous game. It looks great, sounds great, and was an utter joy to play. Never in my life have I played a game, or even been interested in a game, that was meant to actually teach you something. But, this game does just that. The narrative comes straight from stories told by the Iñupiat people. At first glance, it's just an interesting legend-like story that could've very well originated from just this game, but when you realize this is from and about an actual culture, it becomes even more captivating. In addition, you can unlock mini-documentary minute or two long videos throughout the game that explain even more about the culture and the parts of the story. They are very well done, and are short, and so easy to watch (I actually began to wish there was more!).\n\nNow, as far as gameplay goes, the game is an atmospheric platformer. I played entirely in single player and finished the game in one sitting in about 3 hours. They nail the atmosphere perfectly, and the world is a joy to look at. It feels alive. As far as gameplay goes, though, it doesn't stray too far from standard platformers. The girl can jump, move around blocks, and use a throwing weapon to break ice. The fox can wall jump, run up walls, and interact with spirits (which act like moving platforms) that appear throughout the game. Later in the game, the fox's spirit abilities become much more in-depth, too. Personally, I found this to work very well. While not being the most unique gameplay, it was fun and the level design difficulty was scaled well. The later levels can give you quite a bit of challenge (in single player especially), too.\n\nHowever, I did run into a couple glitches while playing. There was a moving platform section of the game where the platforms would squish you if you weren't quick. However, when jumping from one to the next at one point, you would sometimes just go through the platform. This glitch was compounded with the fact that the AI would lag behind your movement and often fall into the platform when you hadn't, forcing you to redo it. There were a couple other small collision glitches like that, but they weren't nearly as bad. Thankfully, the game is very generous with it's spawn points, and I never had to redo much when I died in the game (which was admittedly often). In addition to glitches, there were a couple places where the AI would do things that were frustrating. Thankfully, I only ran into AI issues a few times, and since you can take control of the AI if need be, it only caused me frustration once or twice, when it actually resulted in a death.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to everyone who enjoys video games. It's charming, tells a very real story while making it actually interesting, and, most importantly, it's very fun. It is a bit highly priced for the length, but I'd say it's worth supporting so we see more games like this in the future. This game is a fantastic experience.","January 20, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The cultural videos unlocked through play give the story a grounding I have never seen before.

It's an actual folk tale, not just one made up for the game. Even better, it comes with deep context. I wasn't just avoiding green ghosts while platforming, I was hiding from the Northern Lights and the ghost children that wanted to play football with my head.\n\nThis game is probably most enjoyable for in-between gamers. Hardcore players might get frustrated that the characters won't turn on a dime, and very casual players will likely find the last few chapters frustratingly hard. If you're in the middle, and enjoy story, learning about culture, atmosphere, and animation detail, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a great experience. Personally, I think it's worth playing even you you never make it through to the end.\n\nSecond to playing the beautiful white fox, I found the "cultural insights" to be one of my favorite features of the game. I love collecting things in a game, and trying to find every single owl was a great reason to explore the game's settings thoroughly. Some of the insight videos were like mini documentaries, telling me things about how this native culture exists in the modern day. Many of the videos were stories: life and death experiences that had happened to the tellers or their family. Almost all provided depth and background to the game: I learned the traditions of the Northern Lights, I really felt the abandoned landscape of King Island, I saw how the art of the cut scenes came from on the style of real-world scrimshaw, and I got to hear several other traditional stories. I strongly suggest not waiting until the end of the game to watch the insights you unlock.","December 7, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a part where you need to do some stuff in a panic, but it counts for like 5% of the game. I like that, but I can leave other's to their own opinions.\n\nIt's a very educational game, no doubt. By this, I mean to say that it's agenda is to teach you about the real life of the natives of Alaska through videos. In game you solve puzzles; the game's story line is 100% off folklore of the Alaskans.\n\nI do have a problem regarding the educational video pop-ups, however. You go tend to get them a lot and while you can just ignore them, they're rather hard to do so at first. I almost always have a nagging feeling to press whatever button the screen tells me when I first play, but after some time this goes away and you just know when an educational video notification will occur. Another problem is when the scene cuts and you're moving to a new area, you actually have to say no to a video to progress. It won't start or anything, it just gives you the option to watch one right then and there or not. It's a little weird.\n\nI didn't think the controls were clunky, but there were a couple times when the AI controlling you're other half (you're either little girl or fox; you can switch) will suicide off a cliff and it's really annoying. Usually, though, the AI does a fine job of keeping up with you and you can usually predict what they'll do.\n\nFor whatever reason I had low frame rates and tried tinkering with it (I mean, it ran fine) the game just seems to require a lot of GPU for whatever reason.","December 7, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd pay full price to support devs, but you may want to get it on sale\nTraditional Rating: 7/10\n\nNOTE: I haven't incountered any of these "game-breaking" bugs other people have mentioned in their reviews; I'm playing on a fairly old mid-range quality laptop from 2009/2010 for digital art and photography editing, but not gaming (it overheats and shuts off while playing Portal, to give you an idea).\n\nLadies and gentlemen, public school boards and teachers, THIS is how you get people interested in learning about different cultures. This game brilliantly excels at what the public education system in North America ultimately fails to do.\n\nIf you live in North America, I know you definitely spent at least 9 years of your public education focussing on Indigenous cultures. In all honesty, the specific focus of "social studies" class didn't change from first grade to ninth (I believe tenth through twelfth focused a lot more on politics and world affairs); it was boring, preachy, repetitive, and about as unengaging as a class can get. Until I tried playing this game, I had a bit of a preconception that all attempts to teach Native American cultures would end up being snooze-a-thons. I didn't even ask why it had to be that way. There is absolutely nothing boring about this game. Not once did I find myself thinking "Will you shut up? No one cares!" In fact, I found myself intentionally seeking out the little documentary-like video clips to watch, and trying to make sure I didn't miss one bit of information from this game.\n\nOutside of that, the main characters are the most loveable cuties in the whole wide world. If you see reviews complaining about the AI being dumb, they were probably written before the patch (and not updated). There is a two-player co-op mode, but for those of us who hate social interaction, rejoice in the not-terrible AI. There are still a few issues, but that's totally okay, it doesn't make the game unplayable or too rage-enducing. That said, some of the controls are so finicky I just about quit. I would recommend stepping away for a bit if you can't get a specific part or going on youtube for the solution (some of them aren't really that obvious).\n\nAll in all, a wonderfully executed concept, fun gameplay (albeit with annoying puzzles at some points), and touching story.","December 7, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of patience. It's a platformer, but the focus is on the Inupiat culture and not the actual gameplay. The Fox is wonderfully animated and his AI is pretty good (and the sounds he makes are absolutely ADORABLE). The same can't be said for the little girl. Her AI sucks. Example: I'll be playing as Fox to do something, and she'll just kind of walk off a ledge while I'm trying to make a nature spirit approach her. It'd probably be a lot easier co-op, but you'll probably end up fighting over who gets to be Fox because he's more fun and more forgiving.\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's not interested in different cultures, because the gameplay's not all that tight. Sometimes, the game expects you to die (who expects a walkway to snap suddenly and throw you over a chasm?) and there's really no skill involved there, just knowing what's ahead. The story is a very old folk tale passed down generationally, and the game features lots of video clips of the Inupiat elders (skippable). Very pretty and artistic, but not worth the price, unless you're a culture buff. Recommended only on sale. 6/10","December 23, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an actual folk tale, not just one made up for the game. Even better, it comes with deep context. I wasn't just avoiding green ghosts while platforming, I was hiding from the Northern Lights and the ghost children that wanted to play football with my head.\n\nThis game is probably most enjoyable for in-between gamers. Hardcore players might get frustrated that the characters won't turn on a dime, and very casual players will likely find the last few chapters frustratingly hard. If you're in the middle, and enjoy story, learning about culture, atmosphere, and animation detail, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a great experience. Personally, I think it's worth playing even you you never make it through to the end.\n\nSecond to playing the beautiful white fox, I found the "cultural insights" to be one of my favorite features of the game. I love collecting things in a game, and trying to find every single owl was a great reason to explore the game's settings thoroughly. Some of the insight videos were like mini documentaries, telling me things about how this native culture exists in the modern day. Many of the videos were stories: life and death experiences that had happened to the tellers or their family. Almost all provided depth and background to the game: I learned the traditions of the Northern Lights, I really felt the abandoned landscape of King Island, I saw how the art of the cut scenes came from on the style of real-world scrimshaw, and I got to hear several other traditional stories. I strongly suggest not waiting until the end of the game to watch the insights you unlock.","December 7, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a part where you need to do some stuff in a panic, but it counts for like 5% of the game. I like that, but I can leave other's to their own opinions.\n\nIt's a very educational game, no doubt. By this, I mean to say that it's agenda is to teach you about the real life of the natives of Alaska through videos. In game you solve puzzles; the game's story line is 100% off folklore of the Alaskans.\n\nI do have a problem regarding the educational video pop-ups, however. You go tend to get them a lot and while you can just ignore them, they're rather hard to do so at first. I almost always have a nagging feeling to press whatever button the screen tells me when I first play, but after some time this goes away and you just know when an educational video notification will occur. Another problem is when the scene cuts and you're moving to a new area, you actually have to say no to a video to progress. It won't start or anything, it just gives you the option to watch one right then and there or not. It's a little weird.\n\nI didn't think the controls were clunky, but there were a couple times when the AI controlling you're other half (you're either little girl or fox; you can switch) will suicide off a cliff and it's really annoying. Usually, though, the AI does a fine job of keeping up with you and you can usually predict what they'll do.\n\nFor whatever reason I had low frame rates and tried tinkering with it (I mean, it ran fine) the game just seems to require a lot of GPU for whatever reason.","December 7, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd pay full price to support devs, but you may want to get it on sale\nTraditional Rating: 7/10\n\nNOTE: I haven't incountered any of these "game-breaking" bugs other people have mentioned in their reviews; I'm playing on a fairly old mid-range quality laptop from 2009/2010 for digital art and photography editing, but not gaming (it overheats and shuts off while playing Portal, to give you an idea).\n\nLadies and gentlemen, public school boards and teachers, THIS is how you get people interested in learning about different cultures. This game brilliantly excels at what the public education system in North America ultimately fails to do.\n\nIf you live in North America, I know you definitely spent at least 9 years of your public education focussing on Indigenous cultures. In all honesty, the specific focus of "social studies" class didn't change from first grade to ninth (I believe tenth through twelfth focused a lot more on politics and world affairs); it was boring, preachy, repetitive, and about as unengaging as a class can get. Until I tried playing this game, I had a bit of a preconception that all attempts to teach Native American cultures would end up being snooze-a-thons. I didn't even ask why it had to be that way. There is absolutely nothing boring about this game. Not once did I find myself thinking "Will you shut up? No one cares!" In fact, I found myself intentionally seeking out the little documentary-like video clips to watch, and trying to make sure I didn't miss one bit of information from this game.\n\nOutside of that, the main characters are the most loveable cuties in the whole wide world. If you see reviews complaining about the AI being dumb, they were probably written before the patch (and not updated). There is a two-player co-op mode, but for those of us who hate social interaction, rejoice in the not-terrible AI. There are still a few issues, but that's totally okay, it doesn't make the game unplayable or too rage-enducing. That said, some of the controls are so finicky I just about quit. I would recommend stepping away for a bit if you can't get a specific part or going on youtube for the solution (some of them aren't really that obvious).\n\nAll in all, a wonderfully executed concept, fun gameplay (albeit with annoying puzzles at some points), and touching story.","December 7, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There really needs to be more video games with this kind of style, allowing you to learn something new while playing.\n\nSurprisingly short, which is disappointing since the game is a joy to watch and listen to. There are some very frustrating parts of the game that tipped uncomfortably in the negative direction of the fairness scale, mainly due to some scripted events and imprecise controls.\n\nNot a 10/10 like everyone's claiming, but a solid 8/10. Without the intriguing Inupiat storyline this game wouldn't be notable at all, as many other games have come along and done platformers much better.","December 9, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If that's not your cup of tea, a pass then, or wait for a sale.\n\nPROS\n-Beautiful (though at times a bit repetitive) graphics.\n-Sound and "music" works well enough for the game.\n-Interesting premise and original story\n-Lots of cultural info\n\nCONS\n-Camera can be a bit slow.\n-Companion AI is at times...lacking.\n-Mid-Late game puzzles repetitive.\n-inconsistencies\n-Some issues with plot vs what's happening on screen.\n\nI'll try to make this brief. Overall the game is fun to play, and looks great. The main characters are enjoyable (at first anyways) and there's a lot of interest built on the culture and stories of the Inupiat people, and it's worked well into a game, for the most part. The game mechanics work well together (for the most part) though they're a bit overused in parts.\nMy major grievances with the game are really mostly minor. First, the camera can lag behind the characters at times (particularly when sliding or climbing) leading you to slide completely off the screen. Normally it wasn't a problem but I did die once or twice from this, as I slid off the screen and fell into a pit of water.\n\nSecond, let's talk about that pit of water... one issue that rather irks me is the overall inconsistency. You barely touch water in the first part of the game and you die. The next part of the game... you're swimming all over the place. After that? Water kills you again. I understand that they want to make certain parts of the game challenging, but mechanics like that just kind of kill immersion or enjoyment since it feels very forced. In this same vein there's some issues with what's being told in the story not showing up on screen. Not to give anything away, but let's just sayif you tell me my character is supposed to be carrying some big object, I expect to see that, not just her running around like normal.\nIf I'm "inside of an area" *cough*not spoiling it*cough*  that logically would not be full of ice caves, why does it look like ice caves?\n\nThe partner AI generally doesn't pose too much of a problem but there were some times I was getting rather irritated by it, and in fact a few times where it killed me.\nFinally, my last issue with the game is that mi-late game (about 60-70% through) The "puzzles" start looking pretty much the same. They start to become more tedious than anything else, and they're setup in such a way it kind of breaks the flow of the game.\n\nAs I stated though, despite my explaining them out like this, the problems weren't really that major. I did enjoy the game a lot, and would recommend it, though the game's a bit short. My play time lasted a little over 2 hours.\n\nIf you're on the fence about it I'd suggest waiting until it's on sale, but it's still a pretty decent game overall.\n\nFor those of you who like ratings, I'd give it about a 73%.\n\nYoutube Play:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412836881","March 23, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is in my personal indie game of the year list.  I very much enjoyed this game.  This is a side-scroller game with simple controls.  The background of the game is that you play as an native Alaskan Inuit girl who is on a quest to try to save her village from an evil spirit man.  Along her journey she befriends a fox who you the player, can switch between to help along the journey.  The graphics are very nicely done as well.  Another aspect of the game that I personally really enjoyed was the short video clips explaining real life experiances and daily life of the Inuit people narrated by them.  There are minor movement bugs but this does not take away from the game experiance at all.  Overall I had a great time playing this game and learning the culture of the Inuit people, I would recommend this game to anyone.","February 16, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game caught my interest, only a short time before it came out. And I do not regret getting it. It was a great experience, so yes, I do recommend it. However, it still has a couple of flaws, that I would like to shortly highlight.\n\nPros:\nThe story, oh, the story. This, I feel, is truly the shining strength of this game. In it, we follow Nuna and her friend, the fox. It's a Iñupiat tale, widespread over the entire Arctic, made into a beautiful game. The story draws you in and truly captures your heart.\nThe music is absolutely wonderful. It's subtle enough not to get in the way at any point, yet it still draws you into the story. It's wonderfully crafted, and I found myself every now and then just stopping up to listen.\nAesthetically, this game overwhelmed me. It's so incredibly beautiful. The art of the actual game is lovely animated and visually pleasing, whilst the cut-scenes appear like the Iñupiat bone carvings. A joy to look at!\nCo-Op. I cannot stress this enough - Team up with a dear friend of yours with a passion for learning new cultures, and you will have a -blast-.\nThe cultural insight surprised me at first, but it's incredibly educating and very fun to listen, as you're told about the Iñupiat culture, other than just this legend.\nThis game has been very lovingly created, and it shows. Throughout the entirety of it, you can sense the developer's joy in sharing their stories. It translates into a very enjoyable experience.\nWhilst it's mostly a story/adventure game, I would like to point out that it often have very challenging puzzles. Now, while I realise that this can be a con for some, it made it more enjoyable for myself. There were times I had to truly sit back and think about how to proceed, as they often utilises the mechanics in the game in refreshing ways.\nThe cultural insights in this game are unlocked by various owls "hidden" in the world. Although, not truly hidden - most are easy enough to find, whilst about a fourth or third require you to explore a little. All in all, a nice way of gathering collectibles.\nCons:\nThe AI can, at times, be troublesome. While it seems to have been mostly fixed, there are still times where you will find it going off doing strange things (such as Nuna jumping in the water when switching to Fox). I rarely encountered this problem, however.\nSome of the jumping mechanics can be... Difficult. I encountered a particular spot, where I had to sit for 20 minutes to get through. This isn't because of the actual jumping, but rather, because of the wind. It can be very hard to calculate how far you will go, depending on how much the wind pushes you.\nThroughout the game, you will find times where it's not quite obvious where you are going, especially around the middle of the game. This might cause some annoyance, but keep calm - and head right. As it's a side-scroller, you'll usually try to go towards one direction, though sometimes in different altitudes.\nThe replayability with this one is... Not very high, sadly. If you have gone through it in single-player, then I can definitely recommend trying out the co-op.\nThis game is incredibly short. It has a total of 11 chapters, excluding the Pro- and Epilogue. Depending on how good you are at puzzles, you will probably find it doesn't take long to complete. I personally hope that they will continue on the story, perhaps with some other tales from the Iñupiat people.\n\nSo, it comes down to: "Should I get this game?"\nIf you enjoy a good story and a lot of cultural insight, yes you should. However, if you're one to play purely for the gameplay, this might not be the game for you. It shines in it's story and atmosphere, but that is of course not for all.","February 20, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really bad.

The controls are unresponsive, the bola control is just awful, hitboxes can be wierd and platforms despawn if the fox drifts of too far.\n\nIt's also slow, so when you die through no fault of your own, you get to sit through a slow death animation and get to slowly plod back to where you were. It's never that far, but it happens so often that it becomes a chore to play anyway. It gets even worse after the fox spirit thing.\n\nFinally, the game can't even keep its own rules. Sometimes water kills, sometimes she can dive forever. Sometimes falling kills, sometimes it does nothing. Sometimes wild snow means wind, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nI can't really recommend playing it.

Without smooth platforming mechanics a platformer becomes at the very least frustrating, boring, or unrewarding and at the very worst unplayable. It is very clear that this game was made as a vehicle to teach people about a culture through adapted folklore and as a result the platforming mechanics have taken a backseat to storytelling. The platforming mechanics can get clunky and cumbersome at times and swimming portions can become down right irritating.

The visuals and storytelling are beautiful. The attempts it makes to educated the gamer on Inupiat culture is admirable and ultimately well done. The game play could be a little glitchy but I found it worked far better when I turned the resolution down slightly, it still looked stunningly beautiful and the mechanics worked far better. I played solo and did run into problems when Nuna would be on a spirit and fox would move too far away causing the spirit to disappear and Nuna to fall to her death, which was incredibly frustrating but would be fixed playing with a friend. Also I found that when I turned off the game when I came back it would go back to the beginning of the level rather than to the last checkpoint, starting back up at the last checkpoint would have been far preferable. Still a beautiful game and there were at least a few achievments and easter eggs that I didn't get the first playthrough, giving it some replayability.","April 27, 2015","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game starts off as a fairly simple platformer, running, jumping and avoiding gusts of wind, but as the story progresses you get more actions for both characters adding very interesting movement puzzles. I played this single player and to that end it's limited as the AI can get troublesome in addition to have to switch characters rapidly between timed events. I would highly recommend playing this with someone else as that is where the game shines. Figuring out the puzzles together and working with different abilities is very fun and rewarding.\n\nThe story is also very engrossing like an old fairy tale. You also get glimpses into the native Alaskan lifestyle both past and present with "Cultural Insights" which are unlocked minute or so segments which tell you about their history and culture. These usually have to do with part of the game you unlock them in and I found interesting and not distracting from the game itself.\n\nGraphics and sound are both spot on. The art syle looks amazing and creates some very beautiful landscapes.

The narrative is told through several different methods. Traditional native art and animation, an amazing co-op and single player platformer, and Iñupiat documentaries. The films are used as extras and not only make the tale more authentic, but they add some cultural education to the experience. The Narrator speaks in Iñupiat and then it is translated into english subtitles keeping the true dialect in tact.

Really bad.

The controls are unresponsive, the bola control is just awful, hitboxes can be wierd and platforms despawn if the fox drifts of too far.\n\nIt's also slow, so when you die through no fault of your own, you get to sit through a slow death animation and get to slowly plod back to where you were. It's never that far, but it happens so often that it becomes a chore to play anyway. It gets even worse after the fox spirit thing.\n\nFinally, the game can't even keep its own rules. Sometimes water kills, sometimes she can dive forever. Sometimes falling kills, sometimes it does nothing. Sometimes wild snow means wind, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nI can't really recommend playing it.

This game caught my interest, only a short time before it came out. And I do not regret getting it. It was a great experience, so yes, I do recommend it. However, it still has a couple of flaws, that I would like to shortly highlight.\n\nPros:\nThe story, oh, the story. This, I feel, is truly the shining strength of this game. In it, we follow Nuna and her friend, the fox. It's a Iñupiat tale, widespread over the entire Arctic, made into a beautiful game. The story draws you in and truly captures your heart.\nThe music is absolutely wonderful. It's subtle enough not to get in the way at any point, yet it still draws you into the story. It's wonderfully crafted, and I found myself every now and then just stopping up to listen.\nAesthetically, this game overwhelmed me. It's so incredibly beautiful. The art of the actual game is lovely animated and visually pleasing, whilst the cut-scenes appear like the Iñupiat bone carvings. A joy to look at!\nCo-Op. I cannot stress this enough - Team up with a dear friend of yours with a passion for learning new cultures, and you will have a -blast-.\nThe cultural insight surprised me at first, but it's incredibly educating and very fun to listen, as you're told about the Iñupiat culture, other than just this legend.\nThis game has been very lovingly created, and it shows. Throughout the entirety of it, you can sense the developer's joy in sharing their stories. It translates into a very enjoyable experience.\nWhilst it's mostly a story/adventure game, I would like to point out that it often have very challenging puzzles. Now, while I realise that this can be a con for some, it made it more enjoyable for myself. There were times I had to truly sit back and think about how to proceed, as they often utilises the mechanics in the game in refreshing ways.\nThe cultural insights in this game are unlocked by various owls "hidden" in the world. Although, not truly hidden - most are easy enough to find, whilst about a fourth or third require you to explore a little. All in all, a nice way of gathering collectibles.\nCons:\nThe AI can, at times, be troublesome. While it seems to have been mostly fixed, there are still times where you will find it going off doing strange things (such as Nuna jumping in the water when switching to Fox). I rarely encountered this problem, however.\nSome of the jumping mechanics can be... Difficult. I encountered a particular spot, where I had to sit for 20 minutes to get through. This isn't because of the actual jumping, but rather, because of the wind. It can be very hard to calculate how far you will go, depending on how much the wind pushes you.\nThroughout the game, you will find times where it's not quite obvious where you are going, especially around the middle of the game. This might cause some annoyance, but keep calm - and head right. As it's a side-scroller, you'll usually try to go towards one direction, though sometimes in different altitudes.\nThe replayability with this one is... Not very high, sadly. If you have gone through it in single-player, then I can definitely recommend trying out the co-op.\nThis game is incredibly short. It has a total of 11 chapters, excluding the Pro- and Epilogue. Depending on how good you are at puzzles, you will probably find it doesn't take long to complete. I personally hope that they will continue on the story, perhaps with some other tales from the Iñupiat people.\n\nSo, it comes down to: "Should I get this game?"\nIf you enjoy a good story and a lot of cultural insight, yes you should. However, if you're one to play purely for the gameplay, this might not be the game for you. It shines in it's story and atmosphere, but that is of course not for all.","February 20, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tells a traditional Inupiat (an Alaska Native people) story and the narrator actually tells the story in Inupiat, which really helps to ground the game in the traditional culture. In between stages, you unlock short documentary videos about different aspects of Inupiat life and culture. The game itself is a fairly standard puzzle platformer. It has some interesting ideas and mechanics, but it also has some jankiness and some annoying trial-and-error gameplay. Overall, though, the gameplay is fun and checkpoints are plentiful, so even if you hit a rough spot you're back in the game immediately.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l0up/recommended/295790/","l0up","Special Snowflake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l0up/","80 products in account","Never alone\n\n\nNever alone is an Indie 2D platformer adventure game that features local Co-Op and a unique storyline developed with the Native Alaskan community that tells the story of a young Iñupiat girl and her Arctic Fox champion. Never alone takes you to the harsh landscapes of Alaska where you will encounter various dangers and helpful spirits. The game also incorporates documentaries about the Iñupiat people and their culture through the game in between levels which adds a nice touch to the law behind the game.\n\nNever alone is a beautiful game centred around the relationship of the two playable characters Nuna the young Iñupiat girl and an Arctic Fox. You will find yourself solving problems and puzzles that requires the use of both characters skills in a way that Limbo fans would find enjoyable. The player will find themselves running away from Polar Bears, battling winds and jumping from collapsing ice blocks. Both characters have unique abilities that will need to be utilised to overcome obstacles and puzzles. The Fox is able to scale walls and summon spirits for Nuna and itself to get over obstacles. Nuna has a magical bola which she can use to break ice, attack enemies and activate spirit markings for the Fox to summon.\n\nThe games art style is beautiful and has a very nice 3D art style in a side scroller that makes the game look very clean with it use of colours. Even though the game is set in Alaska it sets the scenes beautifully with the backgrounds adding the vibrant colours and the foreground showing the Alaskan wilderness. Even though the use of whites is quite abundant the use of the blues in the ice and the dark water breaks it up well. The game tells the story in an old cave painting like art style that complements the games setting well and doesn't feel out of place.\n\nThe games mechanics are very similar to a game like Limbo but adds another level with the inclusion of the two playable characters and local Co-Op. The local Co-Op is a nice addition to the game that is rarely seen in many modern games. Because the game has a very casual experience it is a game that would be good to play alongside a younger audience. Its puzzle mechanics start of very simple to get the player use to the mechanics but get harder and requires multiple teaming of the mechanics to overcome. An interesting part of the game worth mentioning is the winds that you can encounter, sometimes you will have to brace for the winds so you will not get blown back into your possible death on the other hand it can also be used to help you scale obstacles. This is an interesting inclusion plays very nicely into the environment set up by the game.\n\nNever Alone is a very artistic take on the platformer genre that offers a unique story and playstyle that when teamed with local Co-Op it makes the game a very enjoyable experience. The environment is harsh and unforgiving but you can't help but love the art style, it really pulls you in and makes it enjoyable to look around at both the background and foreground. A younger audience will love this title and will find playing with their friend or parents an enjoyable experience.\n","March 17, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game starts off as a fairly simple platformer, running, jumping and avoiding gusts of wind, but as the story progresses you get more actions for both characters adding very interesting movement puzzles. I played this single player and to that end it's limited as the AI can get troublesome in addition to have to switch characters rapidly between timed events. I would highly recommend playing this with someone else as that is where the game shines. Figuring out the puzzles together and working with different abilities is very fun and rewarding.\n\nThe story is also very engrossing like an old fairy tale. You also get glimpses into the native Alaskan lifestyle both past and present with "Cultural Insights" which are unlocked minute or so segments which tell you about their history and culture. These usually have to do with part of the game you unlock them in and I found interesting and not distracting from the game itself.\n\nGraphics and sound are both spot on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjschultz0/recommended/295790/","tjschultz0","Tj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjschultz0/","172 products in account","This game caught my eye during a summer sale. I was browsing through some new releases and decided to purchase it. And as usual, it sat in the back of my steam library until I dusted it off, installed it and started playing.\n\nMy first impression of the game was the title screen, with its dark, snowy camp site. And then the title fades in on the screen. Kisima Ingitchuna. I was exited. The actual game begins with a story told through a traditional art form, which is a nice way to start off. In fact, this game itself is basically a story, told through the means of a platformer-style game.\nI will not spoil the story here, because it is a good one, and you should hear it for yourself. :)\n\nThe game allows you to control two characters. Nuna and the Fox. It can be played with two players (similarly to Brothers), but I was playing it by my self, so I just switched between the two. Nuna can climb ladders and move heavy objects, while The Fox can crawl through tiny spaces and inch up walls. The Fox's biggest feature however, is that he can communicate with spirits. The spirits take form of something in the level and help you traverse the level as Nuna. The contrast of the two make for good gameplay. My only complaint with playing by yourself, is that the AI can be tricky sometimes. The computer-controlled character might jump off and force you to restart the puzzle. While it only happened occasionally, it was still annoying.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. It has a fitting soundtrack that picks up with certain effects, depending on what your doing in the game, which is a nice touch. The graphics have a nice contrast of white and dark, following very closely to Alaska. There are places in the game where colors pop! For example: in one section of the game the Northern lights come down and take the form of little worm-like spirits. They look really cool in the dark of night, and serve the game well.\n\nSo, this game has a great soundtrack, nice graphics and solid gameplay... What more could you ask for? Well, the only REAL downside to this game is the amount of bugs. There are some movement bugs and graphical hiccups throughout.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nPros:\n- Good Story\n- Enjoyable Gameplay\n- Clean Visuals\n\nCons:\n- Minor Bugs\n- A bit Short\n- $15 Price Tag (I would wait for a sale)\n\nThis game is very good. I enjoyed myself throughout, and have very small complaints. I recommend it to everyone.\n\nTj's Score: 7/10\n\n\n-Tj\n\nEdit: I have completed this game 100% and have all the achievements and collectables.","April 24, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've got your trusty bola, your adorable fox, and your mad platforming skills. There's a beautiful world to explore as you progress through the game, but an even more beautiful culture to learn about as you overcome obstacles and discover secrets.\n\nThe scenery and graphics are phenominal! When I saw that sheen on some ice in the foreground I was hit with an immediate sense of awe. The wind, snow, water, trees, use of blur on elements in the background which directly affect elements in the foreground—everything was done just so well!\n\nThe premise for the game allows for the puzzles to be very interesting and very reverent toward the culture Never Alone is trying to represent. None feel cheap or lazy, but there are some minor bugs that can sometimes cause you to believe you aren't on the right track, when, in reality, you were actually a step away from the solution.\n\nThe storytelling is extremely well done! There are so few games that really put your journey into perspective like this game has. It makes you realize just how far you've progressed, making the ending all the more rewarding.\n\nNever Alone is an example of how to create a telling experience without sacrificing the integrity of technical expectations from modern video games. It provides genuinely enjoyable platforming while making you ponder and admire the world, story, and culture it's established and portrayed throughout your adventure.\n\nKudos to anyone to finds this game in their library.","December 27, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story itself is relatively simple: It is about a girl, Nuna, and her fox companion traveling to find the source of a mysterious blizzard, Since it is based off of a commonly told story, it's understandable there wouldn't be a strong emphasis on story twists or even on character development. It really does shine in incorporating a lot of different aspects of the Inupiaq culture into the game, however, and with this artistic choice it sets itself apart from other puzzle platformers. I enjoyed seeing a female protagonist, and a protagonist from a culture you would not usually see within video games. The art inspiration they drew from the art of the Inupiaq is also very apparent and delightfully different from what you might usually see.\n\nGameplay-wise, as a puzzle platformer you control either Nuna or the fox (with one person controlling each character in co-op). A lot of puzzles will require coordination of both, and the use of the spirits added a very interesting element to the gameplay by allowing you to manipulate and change how to traverse (this is apparent later in the game). I played with a controller, and the input felt very smooth, though I heard that keyboard users may find it a bit more difficult to play. It can be a bit confusing playing by yourself and forgetting which character you're controlling, but this is very minor compared to the overall scope of the game. However, when I was not controlling a character, they sometimes moved unfavorably, resulting in my having to restart from the last checkpoint, but to my understanding a patch was rolled out prior to this review that fixed this. There were also some glitches where characters got stuck in walls, which I think may have been fixed, but as of the time of this writing is something to keep in mind before purchasing.\n\nI enjoyed my experience, and if you like learning about new cultures and some neat art design and puzzles, then I recommend picking this game up. If anything, it allowed a brief but insightful look into the culture of a people normally not represented in many works.","November 23, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as Nuna, a young Alaska Native girl, and Fox, her four-legged vulpine friend (I call him Pat) as they journey across the tundra and ice floes of Alaska in their quest to uncover the source of the savage blizzards that are threatening their very existance.\n\nHow does it play?\nAs previously mentioned, the game is a 2.5D platformer, by which I mean it takes place on a 2D plane with backgrounds in full 3D. It can be played in local co-op, with one player controlling Nuna and the other handling Fox, or single-player with the player switching between the characters at the touch of a button.\n\nThe puzzles are not too difficult, though they do take a few tries to get right, and they use the environment well. Each character has their own set of skills that you uncover as you progress through the game. Nuna can push heavy objects and throw a magical bola to destroy ice barriers, while Fox can scramble up high walls, perform wall jumps and get the spirits of the land to help you out.\n\nThe game has some AI problems, with the character you're not controlling sometimes doing some stupid things like casually hopping off a platform or forgetting to brace in the wind. These problems were apparently worse at launch and a patch has since addressed some of the issues, but it is not perfect. The platforming also feels a little bit heavy, which makes sense when you consider the characters are not superbeings. I prefer platforming to be more dynamic, but this is just personal taste. Nuna's bola is also awkward to aim when using a controller, since you have to tilt the right thumbstick away from and then towards your target. I didn't play with mouse and keyboard, but the game apparently works just fine with them.\n\nHow does it look?\nNever Alone runs on the Unity engine, so it should run just fine on any system. Its a lovely-looking game, with glistening ice and whirling snow bringing the harsh landscape to life, aided by good-quality textures. Animation quality is somewhat lacking, but the character models have a pleasingly cartoony look to them and fur is pretty well rendered on Nuna's coat and Fox's body.\n\nCutscenes between stages are animated in a traditional native art style, which made me think of shadow puppet plays. While I respect what they were trying to achieve, I ultimately thought that these looked a lot worse than the game itself, and actually detatched me from the experience. I think the cutscenes would have been better had they been done in the game engine but, again, this is down to personal preference.\n\nHow does it sound?\nThe narrator delivers the story in his native tongue (I don't know what it's called, forgive my ignorance) with a voice that seems to carry the wisdom of thousands of years. It is not reactive in the way that Bastion was, but does a good job of giving relevance to your actions and progress. The music grants the game a feeling of loneliness and isolation that makes me think of the Phendrana Drifts zone in the Gamecube classic Metroid Prime, and the howling winds of the blizzards are brilliantly realised. You can almost feel the biting cold as each gust of wind threatens to send you flying over an edge or aides you in crossing a wide chasm.\n\nLong story short\nNever Alone is a lovely game. It is only a couple of hours long, yet it seems to be just the right length; not outstaying its welcome but not leaving the player gagging for more. The AI could have done with just a little more tweaking and a couple of glitches could be fixed (there were a couple of times when I clipped through a wall or across a gap), but the experience of the game is one to savour. There are several videos that give you some insight into the Alaska Native culture, which you can view ingame after finding them (I recommend you wait until you've finished the game before viewing them). Overall, Never Alone is by no means perfect, but is a heartwarming tale, ideal for the cold winter nights ahead.","November 29, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dynamic between the two characters is worth mentioning, since both have different but complimentary playstyles; the fox being more nimple at climbing or crawling through small spaces, whereas the girl can climb ladders, move objects, or use her weapon to break ice.\nIn addition, Never Alone shares the Iñupiat culture in a tasteful and powerful way. Short cultural videos - that display the beautiful alaskan landscape, and the lifestyle of the Iñupiat people - can be unlocked in-game by encountering lore owls. The gameplay/storyline itself is also rich with Iñupiat folklore; such as spirits helping you traverse perilous terrain or dwarf-like characters causing mischief.\nAll in all a beautifully done game which is not only fun to play, but teaches you something in the process.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPROS:\n----------\n- Smart & intense gameplay\n+ Interesting and moderately difficult puzzles\n+ Occasional fast-paced action sequences\n+ Minor map exploration elements\n\n- Great for co-op\n- Stunning visuals\n- In-depth cultural experience\n\nCONS:\n----------\n- Occasional gameplay/graphical glitches\n- Short storyline\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------","November 30, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely wonderful art and audio direction paired with Inupiat-language subtitled narration is transportive in a way that actually deserves the word. I grew up in the northern plains of the US (Minnesota) and the feel of cold, winter, and blizzards are conveyed in Never Alone in a way that I've never experienced in a game before. It's worth the ($15) price of admission for that alone.\n\nThe platforming, on the other hand, ranges from "reasonable" in the dead-easy first two-thirds of the game to "unbearably janky" in the final three sequences. I made it through thanks to a checkpoint system that would be generous to a fault in a game with mechanics that aren't actively offensive, but I would have gladly hit an autoplay button to experience the story and the ambiance so as not to have to suffer through the awful gameplay in those later sections.\n\nThat said, I'd recommend playing it through rather than watching it on YouTube if only to enjoy the production values and to be put into the story a little more, at least in the early sections. Plus you unlock "cultural insights" which are slickly produced live-action segments that illustrate some fashion of Inupiat culture, history, lifestyle, and suchlike.\n\nIt's not long (~6 hours it took me, maybe?) and best enjoyed with a co-op partner (switching characters during timed-platforming sections is one of the larger issues with the gameplay, though it's not quite as irritating as the unresponsive movement and janky collision).\n\nDefinitely recommended, though I can't fathom the universe in which this gets a 10/10.","November 30, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked Limbo, you'll probably like this, The gameplay, controls and puzzle designs aren't as polsihed in this game, but they're similar, and everything that I love in Limbo, the environment, art style and story, are all really strong in this game as well. The controlling of two characters mechanic is fine, and at least for the first half of the game I found it quite enjoyable, but without spoiling much, it changes about 1/2 to 2/3 of the way through where it suddenly for me became a lot more frustrating and I died a lot without really feeling like I was to blame because of poor controls and just irritating design choices, and that's really my biggest critisism with the game. I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it, not strongly, but the art, environment and story are good enough that I would say you should experience the game for yourself.","May 3, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
