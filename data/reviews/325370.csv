Since then I haven't been involved, but am still good friends with the team.\n\nAlthough I perhaps shouldn't review a game that I worked on the prototype for, I just wanted to write a little recommendation, because I'm so happy that the finished game lives up to the initial vision we had and the mixture of turn based and real-time mechanics comes together to create a really unique puzzle/strategy game. This is especially true of the later stages, as things become more and more hectic, and both your puzzle solving skills and reactions are tested to their limits.\n\nThe gameplay is both fun, deep and frantic, the hand-drawn 2d art beautiful and distinctive, and it's backed up with a soundtrack that fits the mood perfectly. It's also one of the more polished indie titles I've seen. Absolutely recommended.\n\nNote: This isn't really a fault with the game, but although controllers are supported and work perfectly, I don't recommend the xbox controller, because the terrible dpad will drive you crazy as more real-time elements are added later on.","September 7, 2015","true","3.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","24","32","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalDanceman/recommended/325370/","TacticalDanceman","Danceman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalDanceman/","592 products in account","Very cool game. At first it felt like a Roguelike, a beautiful one I most add. Mixes turn based with real time mechanics. Your in some kind of cybernetic world and you meet characters on your journey. There's also exploration which you find hidden chambers and try to find new powers.\n\nAs you play new mechanics appear. Which later on you start to remember section you could get to before but with theses new power you earn, you can now get to new places.\n\nThe levels aren't random generated, there's no perma-death, so it's not what I thought it was, a roguelike. Almost all deterministic which makes it more of a puzzle-like but you have mechanics that makes it tactical like unit dodging, lasers, time shifting, grid jump, etc... I love how you dodge and the unit's mouth that snaps at you and misses, so cool. But still it does look like a roguelike so it should appeal to some roguelike fans. Let's call it a roguelite, which has some roguelike elements.\n\nLet me see, so it's a "turn based roguelite tactical puzzle game with real time elements", LOL, wow\n\nIt has a score system at the end based on turns and time, what you want is to do the perfect run. I should come back and do reruns to better my score.\n\nOh, It's a fast paced turn based because it runs as fast as you press the keyboard (each key press is a turn which also seems to be your score and perhaps your replay motivator) but the real time elements makes you move a bit faster which breaks the pace and makes it interesting.\n\nIn some ways this game reminds me of the Cybernoid series (1 and 2) on the C64/Amiga/ZX Spectrum, but this one was all real time but had this puzzle like feeling.\n\nGreat game!","August 25, 2015","true","11.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

And also it's not a small / short game -- even if you are really good at its puzzles it will still take roughly 10 hours to beat for the first time, if you want to optimize the turns or find secrets / achievements it's easily doubled. Some good humor and references (albeit not very easy to understand for non-native English speakers) in game as well. Also loved the art style & music -- as an indie game it's very well produced, without having that generic 'indie' feeling (8-bit sounds + basic pixel art, not that I am against this, it's just that I think it's worth noting that this game is doing something new and doing it pretty well in this regard).

A great blend of turn based strategy with brief moments of twitchy panic - just enough to keep you moving at a comfortable pace, rather than agonizing over every move.  It's pretty unique; a mix of puzzle, action, and strategy.  There are a lot of game mechanics being introduced over time, and each one is cool and new and unexpected, and adds more complexity to your decision making!\n\nNevertheless I've found it very easy so far.  I've gotten partway through the second major area (about 2 hours of play), and the only real puzzling I've had to do is to find a couple of the secrets, and I am typically passing up on the majority of health pickups.  However, I still have a lot to explore; even of the areas I've completed, I intend to go back to get those secrets I missed, and to try to decrease my time/turns spent (since they show global ranks for those stats).\n\nP.S. so people are calling it a roguelike?  I would noooot call this a roguelike.  Only resemblance to Rogue is that it's tile based.  No procedural generation.  No permadeath.  No randomization of any kind.","August 31, 2015","true","6.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I had some enjoyment with the game. The mechanics work out fine and it is some kind of action-strategic-puzzle game. You maneuver your ship turnwise. It sounds weird, but with each turn, your enemies move as well, so it is not comparable with a Pokemon game or Civilization by any means. It plays out conveniently and the idea is nice. There is no story though (until now) and only once in a while a sentence of dialogue at best while you are rescuing a scientist or the game introduces a new game mechanic to you - whether a weapon or a hostile target. This game feels like a PC game but suits a phone a lot better. You do the same thing over and over with a few twist and turns maybe, a new enemy type or so. The game works well and looks really nice, but I doubt I will play this a lot longer. 15 bucks would not be worth it in my opinion.","April 8","true","0.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It has a cool mechanic where it mixes turn-based and real-time and all of the enemies and abilities make the most of this mechanic.  The time mechanic, mixed with these unique enemies and interesting abilities, lead to interesting combat encounters and environmental challenges.\n\nOn top of this, Nova-111 is EXTREMELY polished.  The art style and animations are great, as is the music and overall tone of the game.  I also haven't run in to any bugs at this point.  This polish makes the game a pleasure to play, and the entire aesthetic package makes me feel good while I am playing.\n\nNova-111 looks good, plays good, and utilizes interesting mechanics.

An unusual, but very decent, mix of both real-time and turn-based gameplay. Every move you make (there is a button to 'wait') advances a turn. Enemy movement is also limited to 'when you make a move'. Hazards like explosions, however, are real-time. The result is that this is actually a sort of "fast paced turn based game".\n\nLevel design is pretty decent, making most of the upgrades you find along the way. These also tie into the overall goal of the game and help to tackle more complex situations and puzzles (in a way, the game is more a puzzle than a platformer or a tactics game). Still somewhat unfortunate that the game only saves at the end of a zone, so you can't "just" complete a single level. But that's not much of a gripe.\n\nVisual aesthetics and sounds are good but nothing all too special. The story is pretty below-par and even tacked on. There's apparently something with space-time, but the how, what or why is somewhat forgotten about. There's picking up of scientists and some scripted remarks by one of 'em, but the attempted humor falls flat (British humor doesn't work that way) and the game hints feel more like unneeded handholding. But at least it doesn't get in the way.\n\nStill: it's all about the gameplay. And that's very solid: good level design, great AI, good controls. All in all: worth checking out.","April 7","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That said...\n\nWhat becomes immediately apparent from the initial stages is the interconnctedness of real time and turn base strategy that permeates throughout this game. It's a fresh and funky idea that hasn't been thoroughly explored until now. You control the Nova spaceship and transverse through space and time to unlock the mystery and the aftermath of the Great Experiment.\n\nThe game plays out in a level by level fashion where you explore a 2D grid and utilize precise and timed movements complete each stage. Each stage adds a new level of complexity that enhances your toolkit as you progress forward.\n\nWhat I like about the game is that you can play the game in bite size pieces, squeezing in a level when you have a moment but also replay stages to unravel all of the secrets for the completionists out there. Not only that, I really appreciate how this game pays homage to the classics that preceeded it (wouldn't want to spoil anything for the avid gamer).\n\nUnsurprisingly, I'm a huge fan of Nova-111, from the conception of the game, watching it come to life through beta testing and demos and now being able to fully play through it.

With a level editor you could build really hard and challenging levels. This would also be easy to implement, since all things are blocks. Just give the ship 1 life and the users a level editor, then there will be tons of cool puzzles. But now as it is, it's just a cute and easy adventure. Therefore I cannot recommend it. But if the devs put a level editor in it, it will change everything and also my rating.","May 29","false","6.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are able to stop and think how best to deal with any given situation for as long as you need (most of the time), which adds an interesting tactical layer to the puzzle solving. SOME enemies and objects move or activate in real time however, and this can lead to some strange situations in which stopping is not an option.\n\nAs the game progresses there are not just enemy creatures to contend with but complex environmental designs and hazards as well. You will also unlock various abilities you can use to move through or manipulate the environment in different ways.\n\nMy personal problem with it is that I just simply didn't particularly enjoy the time I spent with it. I found the "stuff moves when you do" idea kind of sucks the life out of the game. Enemies are thoroughly predictable by design - you lure them into moving in a certain pattern to defeat or get past them over and over again. There is variety in this when you encounter enemies in strange combinations, but the whole thing feels somehow stale and dull. As the game progresses the difficulty increases, as you would expect, but an increase in the level of challenge was not really enough to inject any energy into the game.\n\nThere are leaderboards for each level, but I have never cared about leaderboards in single player games before and this is not a game in which spending time to place highly seems even remotely worth it.\n\nI appreciate the ideas the game is based around, but for me they do not amount to a fun experience and as such I can't recommend it.","April 29","false","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played a short bit of it as a review (I received a free copy!) and enjoyed the short time I spent in it. It's definitely smooth to play though and easy to understand from the get-go. So if you're like me and not used to turn-based games, this is an excellent introduction into that type of game without feeling like you're being spoken down to. It's also got an interesting catch-and-rescue story where you're recovering lost scientists. Did I mention you're also navigating the cutest spaceship ever? Because it's the cutest freaking spaceship ever.

Both you and most enemies move and attack using a turn-based system. However, some enemies and environmental hazards operate in real time. You can use these elements to progress through the various areas.  For example, lure a turn-based enemy underneath a stalactite to trigger it to fall (in real time,) causing it to kill the bad guy with 1 hit.\n\nI really like this mechanic and it's implementation but I feel that, at least for the first few levels, there isn't a lot of need to use the unique mechanics that the game introduces. Enemies are fairly easy to defeat by dodging/bumping them normally.\n\nOverall I do enjoy the game as I really enjoyed the real-time vs turn-based elements.","January 25","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A turn-based/real-time hybrid with mind-bending, time-twisting progression. I got this originally for Vita whilst it was on a price drop, with mixed feelings towards its look and style, after unlocking all the ship's responses, my opinion changed and I was amazed at how well the creators pulled it off. To totally understand this game, you've gotta play it yourself, it's pretty tough to explain through words.

I know plot and characters aren't incredibly important for this type of game but I appreciate caring a bit more about progressing.  Finally I would have prefered if the game had just stuck to turn based.  The real time portion feels like innovation for its own sake.

Secret parts of the level that you discover by repeatedly bumping into walls (while every move is counted against your 'grade' at the end). An unknown number of scientists to be rescued. Hit the exit to early? Aww you missed those 4 scientists who were missing and we didn't tell you about.\n\nNo checkpoints, no saving. If you want to play a level and not have to repeat any part of it (they are broken into 3 stages), you must play it completely. I suppose this wouldn't be so bad but the levels do feel like a chore after the first time through.\n\nSpeaking of which, the absolute worst design choice was the very last level. It took what enjoyment I had found in the game, threw it in the dirt and used its cloven hoof to ground it into non-existence.  Finishing became a chore instead of a goal.\n\nI feel like the game changed its personality mid way through. At the beginning, we learned the mechanics of the game, Everything moved like clockwork, see, plan out your moves well! Then we run into some elements that aren't bound by this rule, hmmm.. curious but we can work around it, and even use it to our advantage. Soon enough, there's  fires raging, enemies exploding, and immunity from step-time seems to be a crutch that the game uses to ramp up difficulty. There are times when they teach you about a elements and enemies and there are others where they kill you to teach you and you restart the level.\n\nThere are some clever puzzles that make use of the elements and weapons in the game. I think that was the most satisfying part for me, but as the game evolved it became less enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, great graphics, sounds, controls. The levels are well designed and I didn't run into any game breaking bugs that forced me to restart a level. However, lack of checkpoints or free saving and repetition seem to be a way to artificially extend the play time, particularly on the last level.\n\n6/10 - pick it up on sale.\n\n","June 1","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
