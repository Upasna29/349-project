You seek to either remain in power or take power of your country. How you do that is your decision, and boy howdy do you have LOTS of decisions.\n\nThe game, first off, feels really cheap. I don't mean in love from the creators, but in the UI interface (Mispellings/mistranslations, Menu's disappearing or appearing out of nowhere) as well as the voice acting (Which is ironically a plus, as one of the advisors sounded just like Optimus Prime). In all honesty, charging 50 bucks for this is really asking a LOT, and once you go through the start menu, you feel like you made a big mistake.\n\nOnce you get through that, you have three options to start with: Already be in power of a country, be a democratic opponent of a power, or be a resistance group (AKA terrorist group) of a country and try to set it free. I first tried to be a terrorist group in North Korea, and the key to success is courting and schedualing as many diplomats, terrorists as well as associations in the country and finding ways to get money, weapons as well as support for international interference. The best way to describe it is a cheap dating sim, but the balance of your group could hang in the balance.\n\nThe second time, I became the leader of the United States, and since I was NK crazy, I attempted to make myself the dictator of the USA. And this is where the game shines: simulating the entire world going crazy. Riots begin to happen, diplomats and head's of state question and put down my decision to have a statue of me in every classroom. It progressed from simple riots to outright terrorism acts and my cabinet demanding I change it or resign.\n\nWOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: NO\n\nThis game is charming and obviously has a great frame to hang itself on, but the price is just too high for something this cheap...If it were cheaper, heck yeah I would be saying buy it! It has a great amount of charm in it, as well as a interesting representation of discord and anarchy that hasn't been tried by a lot of Global Political simulators.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR DEVS:\nLower the price or make the UI a lot cleaner and flashy. RIght now it just looks like an Alpha instead of a finished product.","May 27","false","2.2"," 164 of 179 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","164","179","5","9"

But that's as close as it gets to good, in my opinion.\n\nThe game feels unintuitive and the tutorial feels like it was given up on halfway though and they said, "♥♥♥♥ it, just slap the end right on there."\n\nI really, really wanted this game to be better, but it's just such a mess. This, by the way, comes from someone who plays Dwarf Fortress on a regular basis. Where it is now, I'd say the game is worth no more than nine hard earned dollars. Or maybe, like, nine you found on the ground. And the only reason I give it that much is because I played an hour of it before I realized how disappointed I was, and I get paid $9/hour. It seems like it could have a few diamonds in that rough, but definitely not $50 worth.","May 28","false","1.1"," 71 of 87 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","71","87","4","4"

That was pretty cool.  But my popularity and that of my opponent were the same.   I could not get any unions or anyone to do demonstrations.   They just would not.  Perhaps they were content.\n\nFinally I decided to just attack with the 10k soldiers and 2k rockets I had.  I did not have aircraft, ships or tanks.  YET, I was able to attack the capital, destroyed many of the enemy tank units, and captured key places and stormed the capital's bunker.   Not a single aircraft came to attack me.  It was a walk in the park.\n\nThen I was the new head of government and popularity actually went up.\n\nBut that is where I got stuck again.   Not a single person, not even family would join my government cabinet.  I made reforms, lowered taxes, and yet kept losing popularity.  Then an "advisor" asked to setup the cabinet members for me.  I agreed.  Stupid.   The advisor basically stabbed me in the back, had me executed and took power in a coup.\n\nThat quickly (2.5 hours) I went from a rebel, to a country leader, to basically dead in a coup.  I lost the game.\n\nThe whole thing was fun... but confusing.  I don't know where I went wrong.   And that is a big issue with a big game like this.  If you like detail this game has it.   But if you start a rebel and cannot setup govt.  cabinet you will not be able to get far.  You can't run a country by yourself.\n\n\nEDIT: I still like the game for what it is supposed to be and what it promises to do, BUT, Maybe the speed of the game is too slow... and as a player I am impatient.  When you do get to bribe someone or outright ask for money you have about a 25% chance or less of getting some money, but it appears to be a one time donation and if you ask again you get turned down.  Not sure why there is not enough game feedback.\n\nAs a revolutionary I want to see more choices.  Why can't I assasinate opposition leaders or a trade union boss that would not help me?  Why can't I start a small rebel uprising on the main map in the rural areas or attack infrstructure?  Why can't I be given more choices about cities to attack... most smaller third world countries with more than one city you cannot attack anything other than the capital (Honduras for example).\n\nAlmost every leader is willing to introduce you to someone else BUT once you do get power they won't talk to you.\n\nGranted I played a few months only of the game in moderate speed and sometimes skipping a day or two.  Perhaps we have to wait longer to get more choices???  In about 2-3 months as a rebel you can recruit quite a lot of additional troops over the starting 10k number, buy rockets and hire mercenaries.  None of the protest options seem to work and advisors over rule you every time... wish I could shoot the advisor... but I digress.\n\nAbout the only choice is to (as originally stated in my description above) attack the capital.  It doesn't matter that the country (enemy) has tanks, armored cars, etc.  Some countries SHOULD also have a solid air force and navy, but it doesn' matter, your forces win.  And then you are the leader of a country with lesser popularity than the other dude had and probably get ousted.\n\n\nHOW DO I RECONCILE THE FAILS OF THE GAME FOR A POSITIVE REVIEW:\n\n1) It's pretty much the only game out there with this scope, and as it follows the series (I think this is the 4th version), there are some improvements and new scenarios.  While it is pricey and may not appeal to everyone, there is a lot of depth to the game in laws, decision making, i.e. running a country.   IF you do run a country, any country even a small one, you do get to see how different political decisions affect other areas, and for that alone it is a pretty good game.\n\n2) The game just came out and likely some bugs are not entirely worked out, and probably needs a lot more feedback.\n\n3) You can mod the game and/or create new scenarios so for those wanting depth or changing things it does have those options.\n\n4) I didn't play too many game months in the game... so not sure if more choices become available later or if the overall game mechanics evolve or anything new pops up.  As one who likes to rush things (maybe I have ADD), I just wanted to see the rebels in action and take over a country.  In that aspect, above all, the game's promises are delivered.  You do get to be a rebel leader if you want and you do get to take over a country.\n\n\n5) This is not Minecraft, or some other simple game.  Or even a SIMS game.   But it does have depth.  Perhaps it needs more tweaking.  Perhaps it needs more fixes.   Or it can as simple as playing out a longer game, maybe be a rebel leader for 1-2 years and get more popularity.\n\nAll in all, while recognizing that the game has some issues, I still give it a thumbs up... IF I could give it thumbs UP and DOWN, I would... it sort of in the middle, but in my case I still felt worth the buy and the playing.  Pricey... YES.   But again, nothing out there remotely close to it.","May 26","true","4.9"," 82 of 117 people (70%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","70","82","117","20","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/467520/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","5 hours into the game I can definitely see a lot of things I like and a lot of things that can be worked on. Keep in mind I'm not overly familiar with the previous games of the Geopolitical Simulator games because the only one I've played was Rulers of Nations, however, I play lots of Geopolitical games like Superpower 2, Supreme Ruler Ultimate, Rogue State, Democracy 3 etc etc. Due to the amount of topics I could talk about and my desire to keep it brief and to the point, I will provide a bulleted list and a "gameplay" video where I explain everything in more detail.\nGameplay Footage and Video Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWL6BvnDdw\nPros:\n-Real Time sim where you play as a "Random" World Leader of any major power in the world today.\n-Lots of customization in terms of legislation that you can pass. (Wide variety of laws that will appease or ♥♥♥♥ off your populace ranging from freedom of expression, legalization of marijuana or even appropriate rules of war)\n- A "Minigame" that involves you controlling either rebels or police units and putting down revolts either violently or through arrests.\n-Information is conveyed through "video" format. Cabinet members will explain a situation by "conference call."\n-It's fun to mess around with the various budget controls in an attempt to keep people happy but to also maintain a positive balance so that your country isn't swimming in debt.\n-It's actually really cool to read the papers and see what people are saying about your administration. After a while, you'll start to see the same things repeated but in general it's interesting how many unique lines have actually been written for the various events or actions in the game.\n-It's actually fun to role play a certain play style. For example, become a hugely popular leader and then start to build a cult of personality around your leader... you can be a Stalin-esque character within a Democratic society.\n-Terrorism is a major part of the game. Whether you're funding it or a victim of it. Power structures of whole countries can be affected by it and it's shown in a way that few games have... a highly destructive, hard to stamp out pest. Terrorism can lead to the death or injury of your cabinet members, or even full blown wars.\n\nCons:\n-User Interface is rather clunky and the tutorial isn't the best at explaining the various features of the game. I ended up quitting due to a visual glitch and just jumping into the game itself where I learned everything from trial and error.\n-Graphics are rough. While it's done well enough to convey it's purpose, it would've been nice to have a cleaner World map. Low res retextures look really weird... especially when some of the cities look like copy/paste bird's eye views of cities.\n-THe voice acting is all over the place. Some of it's good, most of it is okay and some of it is comically horrendous. It, surprisingly, doesn't kill the vibe of the game but can definitely use some work.\n-50 dollars? Sheesh. I would price this at 30... MAAAAAYBE 35. There is a huge amount of content but the presentation doesn't automatically qualify it as a full priced game.\n-The game sometimes lacks solid feedback. For example, an advisor can tell you that by infiltrating a terrorist cell, the percentage of destabilization will increase by 3.78% but what other repurcussions can that have? I can assume that there is a chance of getting caught? Is that chance high? How ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will a country be if I fund terrorists that are working against them? How does a country feel about me in general? Feedback like this is sorely lacking and I believe the game would benefit greatly from adding it in.\n-Some of the music is a bit off too. Not game breaking, mind you... just feels like it's in the wrong game.\n\nIn summation, I've really enjoyed my time with this game. I can see myself putting in a lot more time as I learn more of the in's and out's. I will say that the actual "combat" portion of the game, I've yet to see as I've played a purely peaceful and entirely democratic leader... looking for peaceful solutions, even if it undermines my authority. However, with what I've played and how much fun I've had, I feel like I must recommend this game. However, if you're anything but a fan of the series or you're never played a Geopolitical Simulator game before, you might want to hold off until there is a modest price drop.","May 30","true","3.1"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","27","40","3","1"

If you love politics you'll love this game.\n\nTo showcase why this game is like no other I'll highlight my first time playing GPS4:\n\nI started as one of five opposition parties in South Africa and as a centre-right party I often criticised the government for any new taxes.\nMy anti-union party ironically became the main ally of all the labour unions of South Africa after much political flirting.\nAfter some fluctuating successful protests by my party the ruling party used their two thirds majority in parliament to push through legislation that extended the president’s term to 8 years. The president’s approval rating dropped to 8%.\nA sit in at the capital was organized by our party with nearly 500 000 people attending. After much persuasion a couple of labour unions and other political parties joined in.\nOur sit in became an uprising and the president was deposed by parliament.\nAfter a tense election campaign our party won 37% of the national vote and became the biggest and ruling party.\nA reform program to privatize many of South Africa’s industries and services led to huge economic growth and unemployment dropped to below 5%.\nGrowth and spending sky rocketed and inflation reached 700%.\nThe stock market crashed, rebels took over the capital and I am now in hiding.\nThis all happened within two game time years.\n\nThis game does not have the best graphics, sound or UI.

In English, of course. I remember then, that I\'ve been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because of so many crashes that I didn\'t wanted to play these series at all. That\'s what happened - I filled for refund and received it.\n\nBelieve it or not, my PC was acting crazy and like the thunder from the clear sky, I\'ve got a PC as a gift from my parents, well, you know, just in case the old one would broke. Then I realized I could check how GPS4 is working on my new PC. First, I wasn\'t as happy as I wished I\'ll be. Same crashes were happening again. I found a way to overcome it - been saving week by week, month by month and a year or so in-game, I\'ve noticed it doesn\'t crash anymore. There comes the other thing, looking for bugs.\n\nAs far as I\'m concerned, no housing bug was found by me. I mean, all manpower was returning in time and I was glad with the result. It\'s probably because some people choose to fix 200k dilapidated houses by splitting it over the country. I haven\'t checked it, since I like managing a lot and do improvements region by region on my own.\n\nSome people are complaining about UI. What can I say, I actually like it. It\'s like a remembrance to Commander in Chief. Also, the text now is way more readable when in Masters of the World or Rulers of Nations. I like it. I guess, some colours could be changed, e.g. in the tab of promises (that red and blue, ugh, nooo). But all in all, it\'s pretty good.\n\nNew features like opposition, revolutions and a new system of peace treaties (I\'m talking about the right to demand your enemy to pay you money for years) are brilliant. Well, some things can be done better but as far as I see, it\'s good.\n\nI really like the fact that inflation is no longer linked with the growth rate. In previous versions it was killing me and my spirit to play the game. From now on, my economy can suffer deflation and yet it can have a growth of 3-4% per year. Great improvement! What else, ah, treasury. I\'ve been waiting for it since Masters of the World. Unfortunately, there\'s no such thing yet. But it was re-done as if it\'s there and it works. If you\'re in a huge surplus, you don\'t need to worry anymore of getting deposed because of using money a country don\'t need (just make sure you aren\'t wasting it, like building unprofitable roads and etc).\n\nSo, I guess I sort of liked this game. I\'m not sure if it\'s brilliant in general (lots of improvements and possibilites can be implemented yet, especially regarding to new and in-game organisations, regions managing, currency and stock exchange), but it\'s clear that lots of work has been done from Masters of the World. Personally, I\'ve recommend to play it. Unfortunately, the price is a little to high as it still has many various places to improve. All in all, I say 7.5 is pretty accurate rating to this game.\n\nBye.","June 1","true","35.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

However, if you want to experience these actions without a ♥♥♥♥-ton of bugs then it is not. Everism is that company that you want to love because they have an idea for a grand strategy game that you think is great but when it comes to delivering it they fall short. But then you tell them how they can fix it and they don't really listen very well. Let's be clear this game is fun but OH MY ♥♥♥♥ it is buggy. To this day I still haven't mastered how to not run a deficit eventually. I can tame it for a while but eventually it comes back. I understand this paragraph is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of information so let me be more organized below.\n\nDIPLOMACY: The diplomacy is alright in this game. Lots of different actions you can take towards other countries like Non-aggression, Support, and full blown alliance. You can also negotiate building bases in the countries you have an alliance with which is pretty cool. You can do many actions through the United Nations like request help with terminating terrorists, defending a country under attack etc. You can also create your own international organizations and invite countries to be in them. For example, I played as Brazil and created a South American producing organization of Automobiles where we controlled the price and eventually dominated the world market. [8/10]\n\nWAR: War, war never changes. But you can command units yourself or just let the AI command them for you. You can declare war on a country and occupy them until they love you again, (c'mon Iraq we did this because we love you) and you can completely annex them or colonize them, which if you've ever played Supreme Ruler it's basically the same as that. I will also mention espionage which is probably the best out of all other grand strategy games. Way too many options here but you can do so many things with agents: You can approach terrorists in other countries that you hate and fund them or you can dismantle them which will make the country like you. You can assassinate people in your own country and abroad. You can even conduct industrial espionage and sabatoge important economic aspects like nuclear plants. War: [7/10] Espionage: [10/10]\n\nGRAPHICS: [5/10] It's 2016 and if I can't see good ol' Mr. Vladimir Putin's passive aggressive angry face complete with the veins on his forehead in 4k resolution then you aren't doing graphics right. Nah, but for real if Bill O'reilly was doing a review of the graphics in the No Spin Zone it would get a big fat "This game ♥♥♥♥♥IN SUCKS!" from him. Not good but graphics aren't everything.\n\nUSER INTERFACE: [5/10] Alright the interface makes me want to die. If I had to choose between navigating this clunky ♥♥♥ interface and watching Dom die in Gears of War 3 for the first time over and over again I would choose the latter, and that ♥♥♥♥ MADE ME CRY when I watched it. (RIP Player 2's everywhere). But in all seriousness the interface is slow, buggy, and gets pretty tiring after a while. It's not too game breaking but I can see if people hate it enough to not play it.\n\nBUGS: DID I ♥♥♥♥ING MENTION THE BUGS? SMH [4/10] It's probably the most stable geopolitical simulator out of the series and it's still buggy af.\n\nPRICE: [4/10] 1.) Take out student loans from the government. 2.)Profit... orrrr debt? Yeah this shouldn't be a 50 dollar game, wait for sale or become a pirate and take yer' booty mate! ARRRGH.\n\nOVERALL: [7/10] I know like the last four review titles really trashed it but I love grand strategy games and this one I still like despite all the errors that could be easily fixed. There is just something so satisfying about starting as Nicaragua and spamming the Whereismyslushfund! cheat until my GDP is 3 times the size of the rest of the world's GDP combined and I launch a program to obtain nuclear weapons illegally while simultaneously annexing all the countries in Central and South America. Ahhh good times.","May 28","true","21.1"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","30","58","2","0"

Old bugs from GPS2-3 were diligently ported to GPS4: refugees do not come back to their rebuilt cities, your $10k oil sale tax won't have any influence on the state's economy, you'll only receive profit from it, besides of it, your advisors will accidentally turn into skeletons. You wanna set unemployment benefits in African countries more than 1 percent of the last salary? Pfff, never.\nBrand-new bugs also included: Simferopol and Sevastopol are now in Khersonska district, but don't be so disappointed, there is one more Simferopol' in Crimea. You'll never build railroad through Mongolia, even if you fund 100% of it's cost and have very good relations with them, they already have sufficient infrastructure.\nIf you're a fan of MoW or RoN, you'll like it.","June 3","true","54.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is everything on it. But my problem was, that it always crashed after 2-3 playing weeks.\nI asked for a refund because it is actually not possible to play like that. It is a shame because as I said, the games offers a lot of options.\nUnfortuantely, the manufacturer has just email suppor. No answer yet.
