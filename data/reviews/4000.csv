"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarHawk0/recommended/4000/","StarHawk0","StarHawk0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarHawk0/","176 products in account","Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n"Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_","December 22, 2014","true","101.1"," 1,357 of 1,461 people (93%) found this review helpful 354 people found this review funny","93","357","1","354","30"

Go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it.\nWant to watch youtube videos in a theatre? Go to a Gmod theatre server.\nWant to live a life in a game? Go to a RP server.\nWant to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits? Go to a dayz server or another end-of-the-world server.\nWant to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent? Or be said traitor? Find a TTT server.\n\nMy point is, you want something? there's probably a mod for that. If you have a friend that can play with you on a LAN server or just a private server, get creative in sandbox. you could make something, you could create scenarios, you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots, or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards. The choice is yours!\n\nOverall, this game gets an 8 out of ten from me\nThe mod is the limit in this game, but unless you have friends. The servers can be hostile. (especially the TTT and DarkRP servers, you can get pretty paranoid in TTT )\nAnd singleplayer is only so much fun, you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer.\nI'm a bit on the un-creative side so give the game a try yourself, just make sure to bring a friend.","June 11, 2013","true","314.7"," 472 of 531 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","472","531","0","2"

I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world.\n\n**10/10 buy** Great gift for kids!\n\n\n(EDIT March 29, 2014)\nYour comments make me lol. I might as well make a legit review.\n\nYes I bought this game for only $2.50 but if you ask me, It is so much more worth it. It may not be the most graphical intensive game but I've never had so much fun. It is packed with hundreds of hours of pure laughter and randomness. You never know what you will find in this game. Keep this in mind though, this is a MOD and it is mostly just community made content so it may have it's bugs. But what game doesn't? Only thing I can complain about is the ability of making a joinable server. I never could make one. Oh well, I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. A true **10/10** game.\n\nP.S. you should probably buy CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) while you're at it. Many of the servers require it. Have fun!

Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed.\n\nGameplay\n\nGarrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items.\n\nMods\nGarrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community.\n\nTTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town)\nTTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person.\n\nSandbox\nSandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people).\n\nSingleplayer/Muliplayer\nSo if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends,\n\nIf you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy.\n\nRating\nPros\n+ fun alone or with friends\n+ many gamemodes to enjoy\n+ massive amount of creative and fun mods\n+ overall great community\n+ highly enjoyable\n\nCons\n- rdmers\n- will end up overloading computer with mods\n\nFinal Thoughts\nGarrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting. The mods are just so amazing that I salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun.","June 20, 2015","true","210.1"," 156 of 168 people (93%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","93","156","168","29","1"

This is one of Aperture's most advanced testing grounds, complete with flying objects, weapons, and even movies! Yes, we'll let you watch a movie while we clean the hazard liquid off your portal gun, because testing must go on. Enough of that though, without further ado, let us begin explaining the testing grounds of this facility.\n\nTesting Chamber 001 - Sandbox\n\nSandbox is the most basic of these testing chambers. We will monitor you as you explore the environment and well, do whatever you please. We will request you to build objects with a list of items we've given you, and also throw around some of those objects at high velocities to get the full effect of this test. On top of that, we would like you to not only build, but also INVENT... FOR SCIENCE! Invent the best flying machine you can possibly think of! Wait one moment... *Can they invent 'flying machines' with tires?! ...Ok ok sheesh.* YES, THE BEST FLYING MACHINE YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF... AND MORE!\nPLEASE NOTE: - Multiple zombies and other living organisms may be hurt in the making of this test. -\n\nTesting Chamber 002 - Trouble in Terrorist Town\n\nIn this test chamber, we will be modifying your brain waves so you and many others will have the same thought processes. You will all run around and try to have normal social interaction.The twist to this test is every once in awhile your brain waves will have slight fluctuations, changing your thought process. Maybe you'll be a bloodthirsty killer, or a detective?! WHO KNOWS?! Don't worry, no harm will come with this test... it's just a test! Maybe even a trust test...\n\nTesting Chamber 003 - Prop Hunt\n\nFor this next test, you will be trying one of Aperture's new inventions, The Hand-Held Possession Gun. It may sound alot like the Portal gun, but rest assured it is much different! We will fill the test facility with items and trash such as cans, papers, old buckets, a book, etc. etc. etc. As the test subject, you will use your Possession Gun to take over these items and hide. Hide, you ask? We will be searching for you in the name of... Science. We must see how sell the gun works after all! Don't worry if you wear screams and spontaneous explosions! It's for the name of SCIENCE!\n\nTesting Chamber 004 - Death Run\n\nJust like our previous test facilities, this test chamber you must find your way to the other side to continue into the next chamber. However, you must run for your life! We will have many of Aperture's best inventions in this test, maybe even throw in some propulsion gel for extra speed, since you're running for your life and all. Watch out for those traps GLaDOS set up, actually in this test chamber, GLaDOS likes to be called death.\n\nTesting Chamber 005 - Cinema\n\nThis is the final test chamber we will be explaining, don't want to give out to many spoilers! Here we will use our fluorescent calcium to monitor neuronal activity... and while we do so you can sit with your friends and watch some movies, on the house! We even have popcorn included, oh wait... popcorn acts up with the fluorescent calcium. Maybe you should skip the popcorn today...\n\nANYWAYS! Those are the only test chambers we will be explaining today. Don't worry, there are at least 29 more chambers to check out! Wait... this just in... *What? THESE AREN'T CHAMBERS? ... THESE ARE GAMEMODES ON A VIDEO GAME? No... that's okay. We can still use this for testing... FOR SCIENCE!* It's okay everyone! We will now be playing a video game today, Garry's Mod! It has many gamemodes and will definitely help your brain and benefit science!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT: Garry's Mod is a very fun game that is one of my favorites. It has many gamemodes (I've counted 29!) and because of that, it never gets old. It also has very nice workshop items, and some of those many workshop items include Portal, so you really can have your very own testing chambers! As I said, there is a very wide variety of things to do in this game, with all of its gamemodes and workshop items. The only complaint I have about Garry's Mod is some of the community members can be really big jerks, but there is also really nice people so I don't judge it on that. I give Garry's Mod 9/10 bagels, and if you don't like bagels, make it tacos. Yes... 9/10!","November 27, 2014","true","762.4"," 167 of 190 people (88%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","88","167","190","58","17"

You are able to use a wide variety of tools to construct intricate structures with which you can kill other people for 'lulz.' If building isn't your thing, you can join screaming children and their feeble attempts to carry out a decent roleplay on the DarkRP servers. If getting stomped by minges such as myself isn't for you either, you can always try Singleplayer.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game as a result of its unique abstraction. However (queue adhominem), Garry Newman is one of the least intelligent game developers I have ever come to know of (the least intelligent of all time being PHIL_FISH.) On top of this, facepunch.com (the game's website) is run almost entirely by tea drinking monkeys each wearing a tuxedo and holding a glass of fine '67 Chateau Latour. It is indeed possible to get banned for absolutely anything, but here is a short list of my favourite reasons.\n- Using internet memes\n- Inquiring as to why another user has been banned\n- Posting a joke.\n\nIf you do buy Garry's Mod, do not sign up to Facepunch.","November 8, 2014","true","153.8"," 169 of 201 people (84%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","84","169","201","20","4"

I have been playing Garry's Mod for 5 years now and with the current hours I have now, it shows I put 1 hour and 45 minutes into the game everyday for the past 5 years. It feels like you can do anything. One day you can be a counter-terrorist in the midst of a town of "innocent" terrorists and find sadistic ways to kill them all secretly. The next you can be a mob boss in a group of your friends as you try to take over the city from the government in a dark roleplay gamemode. After that you can imserse yourself in the essence of a glass bottle trying to flee from the hunters who wish only to break you. Or be in a remenant of humanity defending yourself from a hoard of zombies in a fight for survival. This doesnt even cover half of what you can do in the game as I havent even mentioned all the diffrent forms of roleplay from being a clone in The Grand Army of the Republic or a occupying member of The Heer in 1942. And this still isnt even the end of it and I havent even meantioned all the great people you will meet from playing the game and all the friends and bonds you'll make. There is no possible way to "beat" Garry's Mod. The only beating you will do is beating yourself up for not buying it sooner. To put it simply, theres something for everyone in Garry's Mod, and its one of the greatest games ever made.","September 1, 2015","true","111.7"," 103 of 112 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","103","112","19","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/4000/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Garry's Mod is a sandbox game.\n\nYou have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own.\n\nBut the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play.\n\nA few I would recommend are:\n\nTrouble in Terrorist Town.\nA group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience.\n\nMorbus.\nA group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them.\nThe humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens.\nOverall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends.\n\nDarkRP.\nDarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring.\n\nIf you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. I spent about 350 hours experiencing this, and I would not recommend it.\n\nOverall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 4 years ago for £5.99, and have since put almost 600 hours into it.\n\nOne of the best purchases I have ever made.","March 20, 2014","true","608.6"," 122 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","122","139","0","7"

The very basic singleplayer itself is fun, but lacking in parts as a sandbox game. However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.","December 5, 2013","true","942.5"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","93","106","0","0"

Where to start\n-\nWith a decent amount of hours in this game I can say I am able to write a fair review.\n-\nWhen some people see garry's mod they only think about the sand box aspect of the game and nothing else. Well they do not know garry's mod. Garry's mod has 100's of amazingly built gamemodes into one game. Yeah sure sandbox is fun and it's a great starting point for a newbie to Garry's mod but there is just so much more to offer\n-\nGAMEMODES\n-\nSANDBOX\n-\nSandbox is great. You get to build whatever you want and upload it so people all across the globe can use it. It gets a bit repetitive over time, I just wish they added more tools such as precision and stacker to it without having to download a whole entire mod. But mods. Oh that changes sandbox. You can be spiderman in a Delorean that travels through time (From BTTF) whilst running over a bunch of Halo Elites and your friend trying to gun you down with a epic sax guy saxaphone that explodes anything in sight.\n-\nTROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN\n-\nTrouble in terrorist town is a great gamemode that is fan made. I have not played much TTT but the parts I have it was really fun. Yeah it's fun playing online with random people at times besides when people scream " RDM " " HOWD YOU KNOW I WAS A TERRORIST?! ?! " " BANNED BY OPERATOR ". Playing with a bunch of friends can be a blast, all join a Teamspeak server or a giant Skype call and you will have a bunch of fun.\n-\nJAILBREAK\n-\nJailbreak.. Where do I start... Jailbreak is basically a gamemode where a bunch of prisoners have to either listen and do what the gaurds say and play a bunch of "FUN" games to be the last prisoner alive. Or you can be a sneaky prisoner and rebell, you could sneak out of your cell and sneak into the armory where all the guns are kept, then you start a REVOLUTION to kill all the gaurds and win the round. Jailbreak does get a bit sketchy when you join a server and people arent playing right, or there is always that gaurd that runs around killing all the prisoners (RDM), Random death match) and people saying " recorded " " getting admin " But when it's played right it's a blast.\n-\nDARK RP\n-\nOh god. I have played a bunch of RP and it really depends on the server, You get to choose your job, you can buy a house and do whatever you want. My friend and I made a drug empire and became loaded, we got every car and it was just fun. Then we had enough of that so we made a gang called The Bloods to fight against our rivals the Crips. We recruited a bunch of people and had a gang war and to be honest, it was one of my greatest times in Garry's mod. Dark RP is a pain when you have to explain your self to an admin every two seconds on how you didnt RDM this citizen or how you didnt mean to go back to the place you died, but if it runs smooth it is just fun.\n-\n-\nI hope you enjoyed this reveiw, it took about 20 minutes to think up and write so it would be appreaciated if you thumbs up this review :) thankkkkkks <3\n-\nMy rate - 9.5/10","December 28, 2014","true","617.1"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","76","82","11","3"

The exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future.\n\nBecause the program, which is known as "Garry's Mod" was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project.\n\nI advise you to avoid Garry's Mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects: Withdrawl after play, Major Obsession, Self-Neglect, Self-Mutilation (typically when the game crashes), Emotianally Distant, and sever Cravings.\n\nDo not let what happened to me happen to you.

However I say this based on what gmod has always been, now however there are times it barely even works, thats thanks to the dreaded "13" update.

Garry was no ordinary man. He made a mod. That mod was called Garry's Mod. You see? Pretty clever right? Since this game is in fact a mod, and that mod is made by Garry, he named it Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is therefor obviously made by a man named Garry. But what if this game called Garry's Mod is not in fact made by a man named Garry?! Then what would that mean??! That he is a man who likes to lie about his name? Or perhaps he just wants to conceil his identity? That might be the answer. Identity theft is a common thing you know. If that is his reasoning behind calling Garry's Mod then that is indeed pretty clever. You can never be too careful these days. It's like that time when Garry bought a teddy bear, which he wouldn't confess was meant for himself and said that it was a gift for his niece in Spain. Although he thought to himself that it was a pretty clever lie, it really wasn't.\n\nYou're most likely asking yourself, how did we end up in this situation?

The game is overall perfect, you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits (and that of your computers hardware) and has a very strong player base. Anything from hide and seek, to Role playing in a deserted world. This game more or less has it all. With mods a plenty, customizing what your character looks like from almost any game, movie, tv show ect (as long as you or someone modeled it). Its great fun with friends and just random people.

In case you're wondering why I'm so quick to jump on this "kids run this game lol" schtick, you need to understand that every single server you play on will be moderated by someone who hasn't nut yet.\n\nThere's really no point in me getting into the visuals or sound design for Garry's Mod. Chances are if you're interested in this game at all, you aren't exactly concerned with either- considering that most of this game's base assets are over a decade old. The only thing cutting-edge here would be the polygonal geometry.\n\nThat aside, Garry's mod is home to a ton of great times you can have, whether you're playing by the rules or not. The average player is gonna spend about 99.8% of their time in multiplayer, with that remaining .2% being where you mess around in sandbox mode after your initial purchase. Get a couple friends together and buckle up because you're in for one Wesley Willis-tier hellride. Once you and your crew's decided to move onto the bulk of the game, you've got a number of modes to choose from. Popular ones include DarkRP, Deathrun, Cinema, and of course, Trouble in Terrorist Town.\n\nThat's... about it. I mean this is all I can really say about the base game itself. So you may be saying to yourself "hrunghfhfhguaa?? this is a positive review?? this is telling me that i should probably devour an entire cask of lead before i touch this??" Well, make no mistake- the best part about Garry's Mod is the Mods within it. Let's cover a few of them, shall we?\n\nTROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN - Generally considered the magnum opus of the game modes, TTT drops players in the middle of a 3-way standoff. The detectives, the innocent, and the traitors are all chosen at random. This is a great party game with friends, as well as a brilliant attraction for trolling. There's a "karma" system implemented to prevent that, but it's basically the equivalent of putting layers of grip tape on a knife blade. It's functional, it's fun, and i definitely recommend at least trying it.\n\nDARKRP - Ever wonder what it would be like being a cop? Would it include smacking civvies in the street, chasing people carrying money printers to benny hill, and cybering with a hobo? Why would you expect it any other way? DarkRP is something that allows you to escape real life by imitating real life with the added bonus of crippling depression, if you haven't already gotten that covered. Be a radio DJ, be a shopkeeper, be a cop, be a criminal, be whatever! You're among friends! Just like the ones in your head!\n\nDEATHRUN - Disguised as a game mode, this method of torture was previously used in Nazi Germany as a way of escapism- breaking their captives to ease the pain and strife knowing that they were not going to progress any further through the Russian tundra, and that their own corpses were now the ones piling up in Stalingrad. This twisted take on the famous children's game "press the button and live"(™ Milton Bradley) is taken to the extreme, and allows you to murder both friends and strangers alike in new and exciting ways. And if they're trying hard, they can murder you too!! Wow!!\n\nCINEMA - You watch videos with your friends in a virtual theater. This is as exciting as it sounds.\n\nNow that I'm finished completely alienating you from this game, hopefully you can see why I recommend this game. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, except you're a passenger on said train, and xXxGUNtheHEDGEHOGxXx is still trying to get you banned before the impact. Wouldn't have it any other way. God Bless.","February 24","true","604.8"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","93","37","40","28","5"

I mean, seriously. I have 3000+ hours in it. I really, REALLY like this game.\n\nThe reason why I don't recommend it is because of the community. If you like playing public multiplayer, don't bother. 90% of the community is made up of kids from the age of 5-14. Not even joking. It's rare to find a 15+ year old on this game, and even more rare to find a mature one. You could always play singleplayer, but the problem is that singleplayer gets  boring quite quickly. Actually, it's pretty hard to find someone who is truely mature in this game and doesn't have anger issues or has a voice which can break a wine glass.\n\nOf course, if you don't mind little kiddies, or you are one yourself, go right ahead and buy this game. I'm sure you'll have fun with it, I know I did. But if you want a mature, respectable community? Don't bother.\n\nIf the community was better, I would totally recommend this game.","April 7, 2015","false","659.8"," 861 of 1,392 people (62%) found this review helpful 278 people found this review funny","62","861","1","278","240"

We've got tons of player models for admins only, a bunch of poorly coded guns(M9K), and just a lot of unneeded addons clogging up loading time. Admins are super biased and abuse often. Yet, they still beg for donations after a week of the server's opening. And this isn't coming from me raging from one server. 95% of DarkRP and 50% of TTT servers are just like this.

The problem with this however, is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn't Trboule in Terrorist Town/TTT (Murder mystery), DarkRP (Roleplay) or Sandbox (Sandbox) then the best of luck finding a local server. Also, with the 198,000+ items in the workshop to date, it makes it the second biggest workshop on Steam. If you're looking for a particular thing, such as charcter models/skins, then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course.  It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say "Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun.\n\nTHE UGLY\nIf you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure, then there won't be very many people playing it, if you can even connect to the servers. Also, the amount of rubbish in the Steam workshop is appauling. To be clear, they do no give a proper description of their item, they make it unoriginal and generally trolly. This raises another problem, some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this.\nBut those are just nitpicks. The WORST thing about this (In my opinion) is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game. You will need Couter Strike: Source for TTT, Half Life 2 + Episodes for DarkRP, and so on.  It feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it, and the devs make you pay for the patch. You can feel cheated, and your wallet will feel lighter.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nGmod by itself is about $10 US. The pack that includes CS:S is about $25 US. If you would prefer not to have all the errors, play TTT, use player models from CS:S then I would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it. However, if you are willing to save X amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that, that will work as well but it will take up more of your time.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Think of a game. Any game. It's most likely been covered in Garry's Mod. That's how expansive this is.\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","November 29, 2013","true","242.2"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","43","54","0","5"

You don't play to win, you play to have fun.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to review Gmod due to its unique nature and everyone's playstyle is different to which I am not excluded from.\n\nUnlike my other reviews, I made this concise to make it easier to read but preserving the important details.\n\n\nThings to do in Gmod:\n\nYou can spawn props, ragdolls, etc to make a scene which can be funny or depicts art, download add-ons from the workshop to fire new weapons, explore a map, or enhance graphics, and even make action scenes by setting off chain explosives or start a firefight among NPCs. Upon being bored with singleplayer, you can join an online server and do roleplay, survive in a zombie apocalypse, and compete with other players.\n\nThere are also tools created by others to help with whatever actions one partakes in Gmod. Improved photo-taking management, better face-posing, the list goes on.\n\n\nProblems:\n\nSome major issues I encountered was it's not easy to play co-op (and what I mean by that is you only want to play with a couple of friends in an isolated server). You have to use Evolve to do that or some other method.\n\nDownloading too many add-ons, like I did, can make the game sluggish to load and it may take a while for it to load a map. Moreover, if an add-on conflicts with another, it will crash the game.\n\nGmod doesn't include all the materials and resources from other Valve/Source games, thus they must be purchased to enjoy the game fully. If not, errors can occur and they are most abhorred.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nGmod is a game that everyone must play. It is adjustable to anyone's preferred method of enjoyment and  it's hard to not have fun.","February 21, 2015","true","648.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","26","30","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCheeseStrider/recommended/4000/","RealCheeseStrider","Theracter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCheeseStrider/","37 products in account","I'm going to recount my entire GMod experience onto this.\n\n\nIn the beginning of GMod, Gmod 12, I always played with this thing called the Toybox. We always used it, and it was basically the dupes and addons combined, where they downloaded while you played, and spawned them in.\nFast forward a little to where I played the first version of Extreme Football Throwdown, where we still used the legacy browser, and I'll just say it was a BLAST.\nFast forward to the GMod 13 update, they removed the Toybox. This meant that we had to start new, and clean. There was absolutely no mods on the workshop, and everyone played vanilla GMod. We still had fun, though.\nEventually, I was hooked onto HL2RP, a serious Roleplaying Gamemode.\nDo. Not. Try it. It is addictive. I've played nothing but GMod for 2 years because of it, and my cousins that were new to steam saved me from it. Read below if you want to know my entire HL2RP Experience.\nI had played this gamemode for quite a while, with no friends to have understood. Eventually, I found a server named something like Cracked Reality or something like that. I had made friends with the server creator named Kingo. Eventually, this guy named Horse had played on the server too, coding for Kingo and all that jazz. Kingo did not pay him, one day, and Horse had gotten so outraged, that he made his own RP server. I basically got stuck between the two, having to play with the two that are now enemies, even though Kingo had no beef with him. I was made the DvL of the CPs in HL2RP of Kingo's slightly populated server. This forced me to play more with kingo, as I had more of a responsibility. I made a crap load of friends and eventually each server I went to on HL2RP, someone knew me. Now, I had gone to Horse's server, who now named himself Jeremy. Jeremy had a friend named Chubbger, who I quickly became friends with. With the help of Chubbger, and my Cousins, I had left the HL2RP Insanity. Seeing that Jeremy was still in it, he repeatedly invited me to several spinoffs of HL2RP, such as Star Wars Nutscript RP, along with the CW counterparts. At last, the last thing he became, before he left me, and dissipeared from my friends list was, he started up a discord server, yeah? Well, he started one, which was in fact, warframe rp. If that wasn't low enough, he downgraded his steam name to be Rule 34 Warframe, and had warframe porn for his profile pic\nIn short, basically that gamemode is more addictive than krokodil, and only your friends can save you. GMod is a good game, take it in healthy doses, and hopefully you don't get addicted like I did. If your addicted, try getting someone into steam, by getting them a starter game like TF2 or CSGO. That'll force you into playing with them to keep them interested. GMod is dangerous, I'm lucky that most of my friends left HL2RP.\n\nThank you for taking the time to reading this review, have a good day.","May 17","true","114.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","23","25","12","4"

If it doesn't, well, here's a review, now gluten bias free and better than ever.\n\nTL:DR:\nGarry's Mod is a nice first person sandbox, combining addicting gameplay to ever-growing content availability. However, if your interest is more on visual art, try SFM. It's somewhat more complex to use but the control over scene building is definitely superior.\n\nOverview\nGarry's Mod is, if anything, the definition of the sandbox genre at its core. Exactly what it says on the tin, you don't have a preset objective other than finding something to do with your game. Whether you are looking to make NPC battles among zombies and soldiers, building a robot out of everyday objects and mechanical constraints, passing time with creative imagery making or creating mods for no less than a mod at its core, it is up to you.\n\nOf course, you can make it all at the same time as well. Or, not. I'm not telling you what to do.\n\nSingleplayer Mode\nThis game has as one of its main factors the single-player experience. While Garry's Mod might commonly be mistaken for a first person shooter due to its wide range of weaponry to chose from stock rifles to user-generated what-have-you-launchers, players with larger foresight will be focusing on the tools and models that the game and community content offer. Even if the player isn't interested in the persaying artistic section of the game that range from simple character portraits to full-fledged animation videos, one can very well perform physics experiments with contraptions and machinery and mess around, having some fun with constructions and stress-testing their machine's physics processing capability.\n\n--NOTE--\nMost of the time I spent in GMod was in singleplayer, with rarely if ever a few occasions with multiplayer. It should be kept in mind that if your interest is mainly creating scenes and visual artwork then Garry's Mod may be a stepping stone for you, whereas Source Filmmaker is a much more powerful and precise tool for visual artwork.\n\nMultiplayer Mode\nMultiplayer is a differentiated, varied experience depending on the player's choice. From fighting zombie hordes to the classic "Trouble In Terrorist Town" and some sorts of RP modes, players can play a variety of game modes. Racing, shooting, survival, and of course, aimless multiplayer sandbox. Be mindful of the following, though: most game servers and addons used in multiplayer require at least one of the Source Engine games installed and 'mounted' content into Garry's Mod itself, meaning content that you don't have will appear as errors; however, servers have been recently using more of their custom content, that don't require many of Source games mounted. Check requirements for each addon and server for further instructions.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay in Garry's Mod is a matter of specialization for each kind of game mode, though it is mostly no more than expanding possibilities upon the core:\n\nSandbox: Create things and scenes, make pictures, contraptions, or physics experiments.\n\nZombie Survival: Exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nTrouble in Terrorist Town: Slightly similar to the 'Mafia' party game; Uncover concealed hostile players among innocents before the end of the round.\n\nDarkRP/RP: Generally, roleplaying, taking place mostly in cities.\n\nCinema: Virtual movie theater.\n\nThere's obviously more game modes. A quick look around the Workshop should help.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphical experience of the game is heavily dependant on your computer rig and your investment into addons. While it doesn't require a heavy rig to run smoothly at high graphical configurations, it will require progressively more potent graphical processing power as user-content improvements and overhauls to visuals are installed. Visual results vary, though here is one of my personal favourite pictures from my gallery. Note that this literally isn't the final form as even better graphical results can be achieved with special configurations to the game. It is in no way comparable to Source Filmmaker, but it is still nice to the eyes.\n\nSound\nThe sound system to the game is familiar to players of other Source games, with few audible glitches and issues. Improvement packs are widely available for higher quality and custom sounds for anything since player death sounds to general sound overhauls.\n\nThere is no native music in the game, though I believe some servers have background music and music player addons.\n\nContent Creation\nWhile not a factor to the game itself, content creation is not a simple process. Being in the Source Engine, there's some barriers around content creation. Likewise, many of the changes done to the engine itself rendered a few of the official creation tools inoperable, though new ones are developed to replace them. It's not an easy task, but it is likely the reader of the review is mostly interested on just downloading content and exploring possibilities before trying to create their own content.","April 7","true","128.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","0"

As you try and move into this new world and explore the opportunities placed out there for you, you don't get sprayed with perfume like in the show, you get ambushed by the worst community ever, comprised of (Worst being first); Toddlers who are still learning how to speak (who either scream or cry into dollar tree mic's), Furries (That are just utterly terrible), FNAF Autists (who are autists), Bronies (Most of which take a game too seriously many others are down right annoying), and Anime nerds (A group that is neither good nor bad as there are some mature people within the group where the good ones are meh.. But the bad ones are BAD.)\n\nIt is a rare occurance to find an actual nontard man/ woman (age 16+) who doesn't throw a fit over a game, drop a ban hammer if questioned, or has the ability to squeal so loud into a mic it breaks the sound barrier and sends the listeners off to the gates of hell to be annally massacred by the spirit of the Autist himself/herself until a new PewDiePie vid comes on of him screaming into his monitor while he watches Diners, Driveins, and Dives, where then you are given the chance to crawl on all 4s out of there and back to your home.\n\nBrowsing the Workshop is also just like the perfume department. Every page is loaded with the exact same content for FNAF. Let me repeat that... Exact... Same... FNAF content. Often there will be some anime/brony/furry things but all together aren't as oftenly seen as FNAF autist stuff. Let it be known if you can make it through all of that cancer, there is a nice variety of content waiting for you.\n\n\nYou will mostly see all of this stuff jammed into multiplayer like Cinema (loaded with the bad anime nerds), Jailbreak (loaded with autists in general) or Simon Says as i would like to call it becauase you know... Nothing says Jailbreak like Simon Says. It doesnt even make sense but for some odd reason the kids who run these servers find it enjoyable to just play simon says for hours upon hours in a jail ment to be broken out of. The rp servers are a joke. You are hit with the same community and you should expect to be kicked or banned a lot quicker than usual, and TTT which is loaded with coppies of the fat kid from sandlot who love to butter themselves up to the mods.\n\nOnly few make it out in one piece, that being me. You think I always looked like this? This is the face a person who survived the impossible and made it out with all most of his brain cells or atleast enough to type this all up. Do yourself a favor and only get this game if you want to just sit in sandbox mode with a friend or two and make stuff for fun. But do not do what i did and go into multiplayer because you might not make it back out the same.\n\nIts funny, it really is, just to sit back and watch a bunch of kids yell incomprehensibly at eachother.","April 21, 2015","false","480.4"," 379 of 654 people (58%) found this review helpful 204 people found this review funny","58","379","654","204","99"

The game only went downhill by that point. For some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea. Those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time? Nah, we're just going to remove them for you. Got some pesky bugs in your single player map? We don't care since Gmod is played Multiplayer more than Singleplayer. You used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from e.g. garrysmod.org, but sadly that is now no longer possible.\n\nObvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes, but Singleplayer just ain't what it used to be anymore.","February 8, 2013","false","866.8"," 49 of 75 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","49","75","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigantic/recommended/4000/","gigantic","frostey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigantic/","131 products in account","I'll make a honest review about this game.\n\nGarry's Mod is a sandbox game, so there aren't really any goals in this game but you make your own goals on what you want to achieve in your sandbox. They give you enough tools for constructing a bunch of things that come up from your mind like rockets, vehicles, catapults, robots and a lot of crazy things. This game isn't really all about imagination or constructing things, there's also many unique and fun multiplayer gamemodes to play such as; Trouble in Terrorist town, Prop Hunt, Hide and seek, Cinema, darkRP, Elevator: Source and many more. Some gamemodes require a game to avoid missing/error textures, but that doesn't mean you need to buy the required game. You can download game files and place it in the garrysmod folder but however I still recommend buying the games.\n\nOne of my favourite features about this game is the workshop, where you can subscribe to many different addons and gamemodes. I also highly suggest you don't download too much addons as it can lag the game and sometimes break it. Another thing I like about this game is that you can make posters and screenshots of ragdoll poses which can be also fun.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that it's worth your money buying this game. Pay once, and have hours of fun. The thing is that I didn't buy the game myself, but a kind and generous person bought it for me when it was in a huge deal. I would also like to thank that person for purchasing this game as a gift for me.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this game. If you don't own the game yet and you're reading this, please do buy it now if you want to have loads of fun. If you can't, you don't need to. This isn't really related but I felt really shocked. Anyway, a famous youtuber who has made many Garry's Mod films and shorts by the username of Kitty0706 has passed away on 1/25/2015 after 2 years of fighting leukemia and he was one of my favourite youtubers of all time. He has inspired me to type all of these. I expect a few downvotes but it doesn't really matter as this is how much I love Garry's Mod. If you have read all of these, I would like to thank you for using your time. I'm sorry if my review had any gramatical errors, but if you're reading this I hope you have a great day.","January 30, 2015","true","680.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","7"

Do I think it is worth the price? Hell yes.\nI would be willing to pay around $40 for this game.\n\nI would reccomend buying this with keys from a game dealer on steam, or buying it during the Steam Summer Sale, just because it has dropped all the way down to $2.50 before.\n\nAs I said erlier, this is my favorite game, and definantly worth the price.","October 1, 2014","true","482.0"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","1"

When you play it like it this I agree that it can be fun but it's more fun if you play other gamemodes.\n\nFirst of all, there is Trouble in Terrorist Town.\nIn this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents. That's a really short describtion but it's basically it. TTT is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time.\n\nSecondly, there is Prophunt.\nIn Prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props. This gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as TTT.\n\nLast example is Deathrun.\nLike the name says, this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death. Deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often. Nevertheless, it's fun!\n\nOf course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with.\n\nSo if you want to play funny games with your friends and only buy one game then get Garry's Mod","October 9, 2014","true","72.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The amount of poorly made content on this game is abysmal, from the same but retextured "roleplay" gamemodes to the increasingly restricted sandbox servers, what some people define as fun seems mind boggingly boring to many users.95% of the admins you'll find yourself playing with are unsociable and impossible to negotiate with. Of the many gamemodes available, the only ones that actually provide something consistently fun are GMTower and some of the few servers run by actual humans capable of empathy.\n\nI used to play and was a staff on an obscure but fun gamemode called EconRP. The concept was that you wouldn't recieve money out of thin air (most DarkRP servers) and that there's an actual economy and money has to flow for things to work. There were unique jobs and even a Trello page for users to submit ideas for the developer, some staff and the community to decide on. Only a hefty percentage of the many users who joined actually bothered to try to learn a bit about the jobs and play on the server. 6/7 of the staff (including me) were really fun to play with and many of the users felt alien to the admins who actually tried to resolve things logically and others felt quite happy with it. But one of the staff was an absolute brute to some users and seemed interchangable with the typical big shot authoritarian admins.\n\nIn the end though, the server didn't get enough money from donations to stay up and was eventually shut down. The people behind EconRP were really fun to play with and quite optimistic, and it's a shame such a good idea didn't prosper for more than a few months while the constant mess of horribly managed servers and gamemodes continued it's stream into the pond of community made creations that is Garry's Mod. There are quite a few good gamemodes that I haven't mentioned here, and some people might be happy with servers the way they are right now. That's fine, but for those who are on the other side of the coin, we can only hope that quality prospers in the face of the undying horror that is the many gamemodes and servers brought by the indifferent owners and developers of what makes this game.\n\nWhat I want the readers of this review to take from it is that, TL;DR there are few servers worth playing on, depending on the user. Most may or may not be for you. Zuthar13 is a good channel to check out if you want some video examples of the ridiculous servers and situations he just happens to find himself in. Would I recommend this game? Yes and no. That's not really an option though, is it? So here's the verdict - if you can find your way around the issues above, or if you're in mostly for the singleplayer, this game is for you. However, if you think that because the majority of the community made content is abysmal and the community is something you don't want to be a part of, you can give it a pass. The game is just 10$ after all, and was on sale when I got it. I'm happy with it just for the occasional singleplayer sandbox or private game with my friends every once in a while, sometimes GMTower or I'll go searching for servers that might have something different in store for me. The game really is fun once you've dug through the dirt and find the gold behind it.","May 29","true","159.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","2"

It is easy to see how hugely it succeeds in this aspect, as its community creates an unfathomably massive amount of custom content, including entirely new gamemodes (Prop Hunt is my personal favorite).\n\nThe potential this game has to inspire people to be imaginative is huge; there is nothing you can't do in it. I have spent countless hours building insane things with my friends and I think that has furthered my career in programming thanks to how fun it is to make your own mods. Thanks to Garry's Mod, I have made countless friends, and become a better developer.\n\nThis is the best $10 you'll ever spend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butdachiken/recommended/4000/","Butdachiken","Old Petrovac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butdachiken/","43 products in account","Garry's Mod, an incredibly popular half life 2 mod that worked its way up as a standalone game. One reason for Garry's Mod's popularity is its lack of any real goal. Causing people to create gamemodes, contraptions, roleplays, screenshots, and more.\n\nThe first gamemode players are likely to first play on is sandbox. The undisputed gamemode that has no purpose. People build contraptions, go to war with players, roleplay, have large npc fights, even make wallpapers and screenshots, and anything in between. Sandbox pretty well is the description of Garry's Mod.\n\nTTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) is a fairly fun gamemode but it can be hard to find such a server with a decent admin, or any at all. Within the gamemode, all the players spawn on a medium small map. The majority of the players are usually "innocent" and are essentialy normal people. The second group of players look exactly like the innocent, but there goal is to kill everyone who isn't one of them, these people are called: Terrorists. The final group is a single person who can tell the difference between Terrorists, and the innocent, can trace murders, and all that stuff. He is called: The Detective. Oftentimes he is chased down by the terrorists as a high priorty target to remove. Which is why the detective should travel with those he knows are innocent. The game is all about deception, but is usually full of RDM due to a lack of admin. Innocent gun everything down saying, "I thought you were a T!" And cause the structure to fall apart. However, if you find a good server, then you'd better value it. And not be one of the 12 year olds that ♥♥♥♥ it up.\n\nProphunt, is a very popular gamemode in which players spawn as a T-Posed Dr. Kliener, and can taake on the form of any prop they see. The remainder of players are armed with weapons and hunt down the props. Its simple and fun. However, like all servers; there are bad ones. I've seen ones where a prop turns into a gun and kills all the hunters. But you shouldn't find such a server often.\n\nRoleplay servers (Most popular being DarkRP) are servers where people take on lives and live in the city they spawned in. There is a wide array of roles and varients of roles on these servers. People have taken some servers and made them different. Adding zombies, combine, raids, Anime... Furries... Eugh. Each has there own way. The most popular servers are well maintained and always have people in them. But if you decend into madness you will find some ♥♥♥♥ servers.\n\nThere are many other gamemodes that I havent listed because they are fairly self explanatory. Sledbuild, Spacebuild, Pedobear Escape... Zombie survival, etc. Im amazed you actually read this, or just scrolled down a bit. Regardless thank you for reading, now just get this game already.","November 15, 2014","true","260.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","1"

Games like Murder and Slender are fairly new gamemode.Oh and dont forget the Workshop! The community is great. Which, is actually where you install some of the game modes. Also, the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game. From the workshop, I can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few NPC's to test it on.

Sandbox is where you can explore maps from Valve games like Team Fortress 2 or some fan made ones found within the Workshop on Steam. I usualy play around in this mod a lot and brainstorming ideas to make Gmod Videos, which are very common on Youtube or on the fourms. Gmod videos are very similar to stop motion videos such as Nightmare Before Christmas, with a lot of practice, work, and a HUGE amount of patience, you can create smooth animation, which is what I have yet to accomplish. Tools are very handy for videos such as Easy Bodygroup which changes the different colors or styles of a model, Bone Merger is useful for TF2 items to properly weld things together, Face and Finger poser is what they are for, posing the facial expressions and finger gestures. Or if you get tired of single player, there is a lot of Multiplayer with tons of different mods. Deathrun is where you survive a series of traps, Murder is where the buystanders have to kill the murderer by collecting clues, Flood is more for advancd players where they build a boat out of junk, and have to take down other peoples boats in a flooded room, then you have the classic Prop Hunt where a group of people disguise themselves as props and the other team has to track them down. I have experienced some issues with Gmod, some of the textures still maintain that purple and black checkered color and some maps have errors and issues. You'll need to have Half Life 2, TF2, and Counter Strike: Source to have th maps and props appear, but sometimes that's not enough. I also have no idea if you can favorite random servers cause I have played some fun servers and the completely forgotten what they were. Managing the addons from downloading content from the Workshop can be a real hassle, it would be easy if you were ableto create folders to orginize your modles and props, like say I made a folder to stash all of my Sonic Modles into 1 folder. Another downside would have to be their website where most of the props and other things originated, nowadays they're all out dated and impossible to load into Gmod with all of this complicated file dragging and all this other stuff. But other than that, Gmod is fun to play around with and create random snapshots of characters and props. If they can make TF2, and Left 4 Dead 2 free to play, why not do the same for this one? Well than again there is some gory stuff and some sexual stuff that can be thrown into Gmod. So in other words, is it worth a buy? Yes it is, as long as you have most of the content that requires you to be able to play this properly.","January 8, 2014","true","325.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Than I awoke to become a salami, a salami who had an Olive inside of him. You see I was a pregnant salami. The olive came out of my little white holes to be gobbled up by the National Animal of Scotland, thats right the Unicorn! As I grieved for my digesting son I felt a ripping sensation than I looked up to see Wood, the wood of George Washington's teeth. As George Washington began to chew me, I saw it emerge from his throat it was the ghost of former Conservative Prime Minister and ultimate bachelor Edward Heath! As I bowed down to Heath he entered me through the nostrils, I than became the slightly eyebrowless but still amazingly awesome Edward Heath. Than I escaped and was in a pair of dark trousers filled with pink marshmallows and as I bounced on their bounciness I saw something familiar it was my so, the one who was inside me my Olive! As we came together we hugged as the pants around us exploded from a gastronomic fart. I made it, my son did not as  I was being stitched together by a strange man known only as the doctor I cried out my inner fatty oils, and I laid still, he than handed me the deli meat stone. I than evolved like a Pikachu to Raichu on touch, from my regular Plain flavoured Salami to Ultra Spice Salami. I than became the best deli meat no one ever was surviving a cooking from Bowser and some strange pills from Dr Mario.

The story is very well written. At moments it's very sad, at moments funny, but in the end it's very heartwarming and the ending was just... so satisfying! As I said it's a very linear game, to the level where the only things you can do is go down a corridor and kill enemies with just one weapon. Nevertheless the story made me ignore the clumsy controls and very restricting gameplay. Sadly there's no way to play with your friends. Neither in co-op nor online multiplayer is present in this game. Gladly this game is still fun to play alone, as the story's not very long. You can finish the whole game in about 2-5 hours. 7 if you're planning on finding all the collectibles and doing all achievments, though there's only a couple of them in the game. On the optimisation part, this game is very good. It never crashes, no bugs are present, and even on the scene where there 50 enemies charging right on you, the FPS stayed within a stable ratio. Sadly this game has no mod support and thus no possible way for user content being created for this game. Too bad, I always wanted to shoot 20 CT's from CSGO with a rocket launcher while giant Heavys from TF2 are flying all throughout the map making weird faces.","January 13","true","2.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","78","14","18","20","3"

Its limitless, you can do whatever you want, its amazing.\n2. Fun to play with friends.\n3. So many gamemodes to try out.\n4. Addicting.\n5. Steam Workshop. Can make your own mods or try out others in sandbox or such.\n----------------\nCons:\n1. Okay, here is my biggest issue with the game... The community, everyone is screaming at eachother and majority of the people are kids. Lots of racist and homophobic people honestly. I'm not even gay yet I think that there is nothing wrong with someone being gay.\n2. This is basically part of the community aswell, but the admins. Lots of admins of the servers are either abusing power, or being lazy and not helping anyone out. I been in lots of servers with good admins, but also alot with lots of corrupt people.\n----------------\nRating: I rate 3 out of 5. I love everything about the game but the community takes the fun out of it, so either play solo or don't play. I am no longer gonna be playing this game. I would recommend the game, but still watch out from the community...","July 23, 2015","true","518.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","4"

You can create and build to your hearts content. There is a lot of content and option in the game to play around with so that you will never get board. The combinations to what you can build and play with are endless. The game uses physics which is entertaining when playing with friends and killing the AI that you spawn in the game. The graphics are crisp and great to look at. People can get addicted to this game rather quickly when you get the hang of everything this game has to offer. The online portion of this game is very active and fun to play around with friends. There is a single player mode were you can get used to building so that you don't look weird when playing with friends online. This game is highly recommended for the great gameplay and endless possibilities to use your mind and creative side.

A more simpler easier-to-navigate interface would have been prefered, but that's my own opinion as a mature gamer. For instance, there is a LOT you have to learn before you can even figure out what you 'have to do' to play this game.\n\nMy advice is find a friend who knows how to play the game or the basics at least, and take it from there. Remember, you have to own and have installed any game with the source engine, be it Halflife2 Counter strike source etc (there is a bundle on offer at the moment for CS Source + Gary's Mod.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone who is into round-based, team deathmatches and the like.

I’m going to presume that none of you have ever had sex before (why else would you be here, sitting in front of your computer reading reviews of a game released in 2006). I’m also going to presume that, at some point in your life, you want to have sex, but let’s be frank here, you're probably never get to have it. Well now, thanks to this game you will no longer need to as this game is EASILY comparable to sex.\nI have owned this game for well over a year now, and I have had over 2691 ♥♥♥♥♥♥s purely from playing this game. The only complaint I have about this game is the fact that there is no way to get “physically intimate” with this game (and the fact it occasionally gets compatibility issues with out of date workshop mods) but other than that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. So on that note, I shall wrap up this review before I go on to much about how bootylicious this game is, or how much of a sex pest this game has made me, or the fact I had to replace my computer because my cooling system was so full of ♥♥♥♥♥. So in conclusion, if you don’t get this game you will be guaranteed to die a virgin (although this game won’t change that fact, it means you won’t be bothered by that fact, as playing this game is just as good, if not better than sex! ) So buy this game now or you’ll never know the true meaning of pleasure.\n","September 12, 2014","true","369.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game is filled with gamemodes, maps, weapons and gadgets, all made by the community. Installing new content is as easier than ever before with the Steam Workshop, find a mod you want and press a button to download! No hassle!\n\nYou can do whatever you want in Garry's Mod. Want to build a car powered by thrusters that can fly? Go ahead.\nWant to roleplay in a city run by players? Sure, you can do that too.\nDon't like to do any of those things? Well, you can create your own gamemode, and map as you see fit.\n\nMy personal favourite gamemode is Trouble in Terrorist Town "TTT" where players are chosen randomly to be an innocent, detective or a traitor. The detectives and innocents must find out who the traitors are before they kill everyone with the help of their gadgets. This gamemode is a blast with friends, and a great example of the shenanigans that occur in Garry's Mod.\n\nGarry's Mod is filled with practically unlimited possibilities, this game offers so much content that it is A STEAL for the price!\n\nIf you don't already own this amazing game, I can't recommend it enough.

Garry's Mod provides its players with all of the tools to practically do whatever the heck they want, when the want to do it. In Garry's Mod, you may either choose to play singleplayer and screw around with things, or you may play the multiplayer of the game and participate in one of to 100+ gametypes to choose from. These gamemodes themselves also provide plenty of servers for you to choose from.\n\nIn the Sandbox gametype alone, the servers can range from being a simple, peaceful environments where players can gracefully construct whatever their hearts may desire without harm being brought upon them -- to a sandbox server with frequent violent occursions while some players are building -- to an extremely hecktic sandbox server where players are fighting for their own lives to even TRY to build.\n\nIn the innovative DarkRP gametype, you have servers that can range from realistic, good-sporty experiences -- to a serious roleplay server where gangsters cower away from the patrolling police instead of jumping out like freaking lunatics -- to DarkRP servers with very frequent unjustified shootouts, random death-matching, spawnkilling, and propkilling -- to roleplay servers where there is a perfect blend of chaos and serious roleplay -- to Half Life 2 roleplaying servers in which you try to roleplay as a citizen during the combine oppression(this actually has its own gametype, Clockwork) -- to other roleplay servers that include vicious, mindless, blood-thirsty zombies that come out to try and murder you while you attempt to properly roleplay in a wasteland environment.\n\nThere are also other popular gamemodes such as Jailbreak, Flood, Zombie Survival, Trouble in Terrorist Town(TTT), Deathrun, and Prophunt just lying out there waiting for you to join right in and participate in the uniquely fun experiences that each of them has to offer. Don't think that Garry's Mod would be a waste of your $10(will be less on Steam sales), because Garry's Mod will provide you with enough gaming entertainment to last you up to several years. The only issue about Garry's Mod is that some maps in the game(most of the maps are customly created by players), along with some weapons(M9K is a popular custom weapons pack), entities, SNPCs("Scripted-Non-Player-Characters" or "AI") that are customly made, and vehicles(SCARs is a popular custom vehicle pack) require you to own:\n\nCS:S(Counter Strike: Source) http://store.steampowered.com/app/240, DoD:S(Day of Defeat: Source) http://store.steampowered.com/app/300, HL2:EP1(Half Life 2: Episode 1) http://store.steampowered.com/app/380, HL2:EP2(Half Life 2: Episode 2) http://store.steampowered.com/app/420, TF2(Team Fortress 2) http://store.steampowered.com/app/440, Portal http://store.steampowered.com/app/400, and Portal 2 http://store.steampowered.com/app/620 -- in order to see the textures of the corresponding custom files. You may still be able to download the textures from these games from the internet without actually purchasing the game itself, however.\n\nAll of that mess aside, Garry's Mod is definitely worth your $10, if not even more. This game will offer limitless entertainment to just about any age groups(but please no 8 year olds). You will have the world of physics at your fingertips if you purchase this game and that world will be worth everything you put into it. It offers you the freedom of using your imagination in order to do whatever the heck you want, when you want to do it, and all you have to know how to do to make that happen is -- well -- to know how to do it.","June 3, 2014","true","754.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Unless you want an immersive game to delve into, half of the time its in minigames. Sometimes also, communities are gone in a week. You join an amazing server and the next thing you know, its gone.\n\nBut! This is only 30% of the whole game, I have spent many an hour to play various gamemodes which pop up frequently, if not everyday and each offer hundreds upon hundreds of fun, even more with a friend! You can even have a Roleplay server aka you roleplaying in Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Fallout, and even more!\n\nAgain, this game is a must have, its spectacular in everyway, even if there are some bad apples, but its a good game.\n\nNOTE : Do buy this as a bundle with CounterStrike: Source, it saves you a bunch of money.

In Garry's Mod, the tale starts out with you, Margaret, waking up in a strange city, not remembering what has happened in the past. The city seems quite empty and quiet despite the constant screams of pain coming from all corners of that area of torture, doom, and loneliness. Along the way, you help a man, Garry, who seems to be suffering. You agree to take him along with you, although you're unsure of what to do next. You both share a mutual agreement to leave the city. Along the way, you may get jumped by some thugs. Garry and Margaret share about themselves, in spite of Margaret not knowing much. Once Garry has been informed of her lost memories, he says he'll help her. Margaret slowly remembers as they venture parts of the game, inside and out of the city. She begins to wonder if she wants to remember anymore. The game has many fantastic twists. It'll make you feel very genuine emotions. The story and gameplay is spectacular. Nothing is too predictable, and nothing is too over-the-top ridiculous. Everything is so moving, and it portrays the growth of Garry and Margaret's relationship perfectly.","March 14, 2014","true","242.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

The people who play this game are as varied as its gamemodes. Compared to triple A games, where everyone "parties up" and plays competitively, this game puts a whole new spin on the concept of gaming with others. Imagine you are in a room with three other players in game. You all have guns. In any other game, you would instantly shoot each other. Some people would rage quit; others would cuss and scream into the mic. This is not so with Garry's Mod. In this game, the people would talk to each other (either via text or mics) and create their own scenario that has nothing to do with the way the game is meant to be played. They would mess around, have some laughs, and make friends. It is no longer simply about the game objectives. It is COMMUNITY. It is about FRIENDSHIP. If nothing more, it is about LAUGHS. No matter what you look for in a game, this game has it all. If you want to be competitive, you can be (though I don't recommend it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cotwa/recommended/4000/","cotwa","Wooper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cotwa/","226 products in account","For a game that will only run you $9.99, Garry's Mod is one of the most popular Steam games, and the best sandbox game, ever to be created in my opinion. The game has sold millions of copies, and trust me, I wouldn't think any game that's so cheap, money-wise, would sell that many.\n\nThe main point of Garry's Mod is to build contraptions and make them work. These can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do. To build these you use props, simple models that were taken from existing games. Speaking of existing games, the other main idea is that you collect as many Valve games as you can so that you can use it's resources in the game. To start you off, you get quite a lot of stuff from Half Life 2, such as NPC's, weapons, models from the game and ragdolls. My personal favourite category is the HL2 Vehicles section, where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side. Garry's Mod also has it's own range of pre-made models, such as jet planes, railways, trains, rollercoasters, and even has it's own mascot: G-Man.\n\nSometimes building can be easy, other times it needs a little bit of perfecting. For example, to make sure a train doesn't go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards. If you're making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs, which can go ape if you're not careful. You would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad. Wrong. You have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you don't want it to drift. But it's fairly easy once you know how to do it.\n\nBesides Sandbox, there are also a plethora of other gamemodes. One or two of them have you live in a city, get a job, eat food etc. or it could be a simple deathmatch. Obviously I can't list every single gamemode that exists, so lets skip to the next part of this review.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. The lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed. The water deserves a real praise, it is absolutely beautiful.\nThe player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general. Well done Garry, well done.\n\nThe game was completely made to be multiplayer, but you can also go single-player if you want to. The community obviously varies depending on what gamemode you're playing. For example, sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff. DarkRP players can be a little out of order, otherwise they're generally ok. Overall, the online is A-OK.\n\nThe game has completely realistic audio. All of the props have their own material, so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something, or when they get hit. Glass props will shatter like glass, metal clangs when it collides. If you die, you hear a heart-monitor sound that decreases to a long beep. If you get killed by an explosive, you hear a high-pitched sound as if your hearing got damaged. When you're underwater, the sound is modified to fit exactly that. Even the voices of other players are changed. NPC's get voices too, though all of the HL2 humans call you Gordon since they think you're Dr. Freeman. I love how the zombies sound like, especially the Fast Zombie and the Manhacks. The audio is again up to perfection.\n\nThe controls are really easy to handle. You can walk, run, sprint, crouch and jump. You can also fly around using the V key. This is called "noclip" and it makes you able to go through almost anything. Though strangely, bullets can still hit you so watch out. When you have a contraption going, such as a helicopter or car, you can control it like an RC toy with your numpad. Or you can hop in (if you added a seat) and can drive it. The handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it. Other than that, everything is great.\n\nBeing a game that can be expanded by the many Valve games out there, it obviously takes every resource from any Valve game you have in your Steam Library and allows you to use it to your taste. If you have Team Fortress 2, you can pose a Scout ragdoll in any way you want. Though some of Garry's Mod is original, such as having it's own models, otherwise it's a real resource user.\n\nWith all the game-modes, maps, add-ons and various other stuff you can add to the game, this game shall never end up being defined with the word "old". Though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build, but that's a different story entirely. It's guaranteed that you can play this game forever.\n\nGarry's Mod is the best sandbox ever created, as I said earlier. Most of it's features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old. I'm still quite new to this game and already I've joined communities about certain servers on the game. It's definitely a great game in all it's might.\n\nIf you're a PC gamer, you have to at least try this game. Especially if you're on Steam. It's one of the most popular Steam games, and I would completely recommend it to every gamer I meet. I love this game so much. I can't see who wouldn't.","January 29, 2014","true","31.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Often, if using the right graphics card, a picture can look crisp, clean and even outperform Source Film Maker in terms of quality.\n\nHowever, there is one massive downfall that Garry's mod regularly faces, this downfall is its addons, not that the content is bad, a large majority is awesome to say the least. But, the real downfall is that there seems to be NO MEANS of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes. That's what really makes it fall down MASSIVELY.\n\nAs an example, you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly, WHAM! A bolt of pure inspiration hits you, you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true! But then, you load up Garry's Mod and check to see if all your mods are there...\n\n...You see that it says "NO MODS FOUND!" it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself,  and it's rather dull without the mods, as you have very limited resources to play with, even if it's a sandbox game. Truth is, the game is still confined to all the items within the Source engine, these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary Source textures.\n\nSo you're probably wondering... why the hell would someone buy a game that's so plain, boring and buggy?\n\nWell, let me give you an answer, the community.\nThere are literally BILLIONS of mods for Garry's mod that exist as of this current moment in time, there is also a random peice of information that I happen to know and it's the following:\n\nAt least one thing is submitted to the Garry's mod workshop every 0.5 seconds at least.\n\nThis means that the workshop is still growing, even now whilst you are reading this. But that's not all that's on offer, you have the whole internet at your fingertips (trust me, google is your friend). If you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff, it'll be incredibly enticing to buy Garry's mod.\n\nOverall, I'd say YES to reccommending this game, but I'd attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere... it's not bad, but it's not exactly value for money either.","May 22, 2014","true","459.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

This thing has game modes coming out every year or so, it's crazy I could log 1000 hours into this by a year If i wished to.\n\nIt is addicting you start you can't stop, some game modes get repetetive you don't know anything about this game. Even the people with 1,000+ hours probably haven't explored all the games full possibilites. Also this gives you a new code LUA!

That is not an exaggeration.\nA positive of the game is that it is essentially an engine where many other games can exist, so while I have played this game the most out of any other game I have ever owned in my Steam library, it is really a game with many smaller games inside of it so it never gets "old". For it's price it is an amazing game which you will play for years to come but after playing this game for over 1000 hours I can begin to see it's faults.

Missing textures, missing maps, 1 hour load times for servers. I would say 20% of my Gmod play time has been loading screens. That is not an exaggeration.\nA positive of the game is that it is essentially an engine where many other games can exist, so while I have played this game the most out of any other game I have ever owned in my Steam library, it is really a game with many smaller games inside of it so it never gets "old". For it's price it is an amazing game which you will play for years to come but after playing this game for over 1000 hours I can begin to see it's faults.

This game is addicting, mainly the multiplayer portions, where you have quite a few minigames, each you'll invest about a week of gametime into, or more or less, depending on your taste in games. Even if you dislike all of the games somehow, you can create your own mod or map using the sandbox on either single player or multiplayer. This game gives you everything you might want to do in general terms, and the only negativity you may recieve may come from unfortunate minor glitches or perhaps being in a messy server.

While Garry's Mod of course! As the name suggests, Garry's Mod was orignially a mod, and still is - in some regards. The mod was originally created by Garry Newman with not much more help than the Source SDK. Once the mod reached a certain point of interest among the players, so did it over att Valve. Being that Valve is very good at taking mod-makers under their wings and helping them to reach it's full potential - for a cut of the cake of course. Therefore Valve naturally became the publisher of Garry's Mod, and the game could remain the rights and to accumulate profit. Profit!\n\nUnlike some other not-originally-valve-projects (Such as Counter-Strike, Portal and Left 4 Dead), Garry's Mod actually got to remain an indie game. Somewhere around here, Garry founded Facepunch Studios and released an actual game - Garry's Mod 10. This time they could charge money for the "mod", as valve was getting a share of the sales income. The game has always been pretty cheap and has been on steam sales at least a billion times. So everyone and their cats have this game, rightfully so.\n\nIf you have other source games on your Steam account, you can link them and add some of it's content into Garry's Mod, giving even more stuff to balls around with. Garry's Mod is the perfect game if you want to kind of pretend to be a game designer and just PLAY around with the Source engine, which is an awesome engine for this I might add. Build your dream doll-house featuring all your favorite source characters, Tank, Gordon Freeman, Terrorist, Demoman, G-Man etc. Then blow them into pieces.  Garry's Mod 11, a recent free update added even more stuff to the game.  You can do endless stuff in this game, you might want to look up som tutorials or guides on how to use all the different tools and such.\n\nI never got too deep into Garry's Mod, I dipped my toes in the water and tried the basic stuff. Everything from just flooding the place with NPC, to building airborne vehicles. I am always amazed about the sheer amount you can do in this game, but I will probably never get there myself. I am hoping that this game will move on, live to see Source 2 and to get more stuff ported over to it. Everyone likes Sandbox games.\n\nYou already have this game, so why are you still reading?

Online slowly filled itself with Thousands of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DarkRP servers , aswell as poorly made Sandbox and the list goes on. The online of this game became or completely unfunny or boring (which is pretty much the same when I think about it). Many people might tell me that I'm wrong though.\n\nI can't blame too much the graphics since it's on the Source Engine , it's old but not bad. Although what I can really blame is the updates. The game isn't updated enough so you sometimes stay with poor glitches that are almost never fixed.\n\nAddons also have their part , since no support is given to them (which I completely understand) , your game can crash for no reason. And once you have one broken addon , good luck fixing the problem especially if you have more than 30.\nTalking about crashes , the game can corrupt files , I am not joking , sometimes Garry's Mod can corrupt files from many games such as Half Life 2 or Left 4 Dead and other games. Fixing this can take a while and is annoying , sometimes forcing you to uninstall the game completely. Rare corruption will sometimes crash your Steam , and then ...... It'll be the turn of your PC. No joke that happened to me more than 5 times.\n\nI don't want to write a book about what's wrong or what's right so I'll end it there. Buy this game if you want to play with friends or on Solo , but multiplayer is not a fun place to go , you have my word on that.","April 5, 2013","false","721.3"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","25","42","4","2"

Dozens of diverse game modes gives variety to what you do, so you will not find yourself uninterested.\n> Unlike most games, Garry's Mod is not all about pointing guns at others and pulling the trigger! (Though if that is what you find yourself enjoying, it is indeed something you can do.) You may create machines to demolish others' hopes and accomplishments, or the players themselves instead!  If you are not the destructive type, building things to assist others is an option as well.  But hearken- the game is not all about creating and destroying, though it is an ultimate sandbox.  The opportunity to watch videos, push buttons, create art, fool around, and many more fascinating activites-- such as staring at a wall-- are offered.\n>   Posing ragdolls and props to create scenes/pictures is another activity available with this game, and thanks to Steam Workshop and Garrysmod.org, you may download custom models to bring more choices to what you make!  If you don't like being limited to Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike, and Half Life models you may download player-made models from other games as well.\n> This game is a must-have, great for people of all ages/interests that will indubitably captivate you and is easy to play for hours on end.","December 17, 2013","true","686.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Never once have I regretted buying Gmod. If you're looking for anything long term, or just something to waste time on, look no further! The base game itself is a sandbox game. You could spend your time building amazing things (or not so amazing things, there have been a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ rockets built o.o). But if you aren't into building things, worry not! There are plenty of gun packs to buy, preset vehicles to have fun in, and much, much more! As for multiplayer, there are a lot of different things to choose from. There are the simple and well known things such as Murder, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek, but there are also more complex things such as roleplaying and survival servers (having different themes such as zombie, post-apocalyptic, or just general surviving.) I would definately recommend buying this game, because it is honestly loads of fun. If you're more if the social type, bring a friend, or friends! This is one of those games where it is quite easy to make memories of awesome, and hilarious all-nighters with your buds. But if you're more if the lone wolf, you can easily still make as many memories of amazingly (or horrendously terribly) built devices of your imagination.

It was unique, special, but its steam simply ran out.\n\nThe most important reason is the now incredibly outdated source engine. Everyone who creates content like models and maps is moving onto new engines. This could be neglected when source was 5-6 years old, but now the very core on which the engine is based on is 10 years old and severely limited, not to mention ugly. Thats relatively speaking, of course.\n\nFurthermore, the base content is also about 10 years old and I for one am sick and tired of it. Yet any attempt to use other content fails naturally because of large download sizes and horribly low percentages of people who own for instance episode 2, let alone left 4 dead.\n\nFinally, gmod wasnt popular because of sandbox but because of other gamemodes. The people who once made gamemodes for gmod (because it was relatively easy to do so) are now making standalone games for new engines like unreal and unity that make the process dead easy compared to engines about 5 years ago and are amassing huge communities too.\n\nThere were always many kids playing gmod, but it is the old guard that simply moved on. Its only natural because gmods limits have been reached. There can be new ideas, sure, but most avenues have already been explored and seen.\n\nIt was a nice ride and we still can hope for a couple of years of stagnation. But in the end like all good but old games gmod will be played by about 100 or so loyal fans living in the past.","April 11, 2015","false","943.0"," 82 of 151 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","82","151","10","11"

All are not equal, but you're sure to find at least half a dozen mods that will entertain you for dozen hours.\nAmong my personal favourites: Prop Hunt (1 team incarnate daily-life objects, other team has to find and destroy them), Trouble in Terrorist Town (x terrorists, >1 traitor, many possibilities), Melon Bomber (exhilarating Bomberman clone), Bomber Barrel (1 explosive barrel hidden among many, infinite spawn, has to kill all humans in imparted time -killed humains become barrels too), Deathrun (try to run to exit while avoiding traps), Stranded (like Rust or DayZ), Stalker (one powerful alien against marines team) etc...\nSome gamemodes even propose some "serious" (aka time-investing) roleplay.\n\nAll of this juicy, thrilling, exciting and foremost unique experience for a mere few bucks. And it's Linux-compatible to boot. Really, what are you waiting for? Join us in the fun already!!","April 22, 2014","true","72.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However, Garry's mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a Garry's mod server, it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time. I mean, creating a Hoboville in a Role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate; who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist - is pretty memorable.\n\nRole playing servers are not the only servers though, no, there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general. So you just need to play a little of each, see what you like, and get some friends on. Garry's mod gametypes, such as prophunt and murder, are very popular on Youtube at the moment, so there is likely to be an influx in players buying Garry's mod in sales - where it can drop down to as cheap as £1.49. (~$2.44 )\n\nOverall Garry's mod is the ultimate 'screw around' game, and if you don't pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu.","January 4, 2014","true","473.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It allows control to finally rest with the player as long as they are willing to learn LUA, scripting and other forms of basic programming.\n\nRarely does a game teach me new skills while also imporving old ones and giving me the freedom to do whatever I feel.  Despite the trolls, I wouldn't trade being able to run my own server and custom gamemode for anything.  The schema's for roleplay such as ClockWork and NutScript as well are impressive and a well run RP server is the last forefront of serious roleplay on the internet.\n\nThank you Garry for setting the sky as the limit and to Valve for allowing us to have all the Source Engine as our playground.","February 28, 2015","true","982.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is the best thing I have. If you don't know already, it is a game that is based off of mods and random things. Like for an example, Darkrp is a mod for Gay's Mod, it's suppose to be real life role play but filled with little kids. Then there is another called HL2RP. Very serious role play and fun if done correctly. If your not into role playing, then go to sand box and create random anything. Cars, mess with ragdolls, fly around, make props fly, ect. It's loaded with randomness random of fun","December 10, 2015","true","326.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ralfdinglebert/recommended/4000/","ralfdinglebert","Benji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ralfdinglebert/","165 products in account","Garry's mod, one of the most fun games I have ever played.\n\nPlaying alone, Garry's mod is a good game as you can meet many people across a variety of different servers and gametypes that want to just mess around and have fun. However, Garry's mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a Garry's mod server, it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time. I mean, creating a Hoboville in a Role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate; who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist - is pretty memorable.\n\nRole playing servers are not the only servers though, no, there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general. So you just need to play a little of each, see what you like, and get some friends on. Garry's mod gametypes, such as prophunt and murder, are very popular on Youtube at the moment, so there is likely to be an influx in players buying Garry's mod in sales - where it can drop down to as cheap as £1.49. (~$2.44 )\n\nOverall Garry's mod is the ultimate 'screw around' game, and if you don't pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu.","January 4, 2014","true","473.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"
