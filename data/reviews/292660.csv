"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shubeyash/recommended/292660/","shubeyash","Ati","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shubeyash/","880 products in account","When I first started up this game, it felt surprisingly old. Well, that's probably because it's from 2009, not 2014 as the steam page incorrectly says. But okay, it's not like hidden object games have made a lot of progress recently.\n\nSo with that out of the way... I still wouldn't have liked this game 5 years ago. It seems to be aimed at girls age 5-7 or something like that. Most of the puzzles are overly simple, and some are even more illogical than you'd expect from this type of game, like "let's make a potion to cure this room!". Erm, no thanks. Also, I completed it in less than 2 hours despite getting stuck for a good while because I missed a room and couldn't figure out how to move on as only rooms you've been in are marked on the map.\n\nThe one good thing this game does is marking a room as clear once you've found everything in it. Unless you enjoy searching for pixels everywhere when you get stuck, I suppose.\n\nBut yeah, there's so many better hidden object games for a similar price. I see no reason to get this one.","April 15, 2014","false","2.8"," 71 of 84 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","71","84","0","13"

The game was developed by Gogii Games in 2009, and its age does little to worn out the naive beauty of the setting and the unconventional gameplay. It still is a very good purchase.\n\nCrown princess Isabella returns to Castle Greystone for his marriage to Prince Adam, only to find the castle in ruins, all rooms cursed and the royal family trapped in mirrors! She is quickly joined by her fairy companion to investigate the matter, while collecting pieces of mirrors to save royal family and undo the curse if possible. All witnesses speak of a vile witch visiting the castle and putting a curse over the land, yet torn pages from our mother's diary indicate another forgotten secret to be uncovered. As being a trained magician herself, Isabella travels within the castle, solving puzzles, collecting mirror fragments and lifting curses over rooms. Will you be able to face the witch and save your family in the end?\n\nPlot explanation aside, this game is a classic for the HOG genre. Art works and character designs are a beauty, even though they've been aged in the digital era. Voice acting is more than decent, bringing a vivid side to the whole setting. The storyline is actually curious, with a nice plot twist by the end. Sadly, the Steam overlay doesn't work, and the game has no achievements or such due to its age.\n\nGameplay is basic HOG; collecting items and solving puzzles. Neither HOG scenes nor puzzles are actually challenging, but there is a logic presented in all HOG scenes - which was new at the time. We use most of the items we collect through HOG scenes, either for puzzles, or concocting potions to lift curses. The ending scene is unique in the HOG genre, by presenting a boss battle - a timed HOG challenge between you and the AI - which was never used in any other game aside the series in the genre. Map has a teleport function and you are declared when you complete all there is to do in a room, marking it as cleared. By the end, the game presents you 2-3 hours of clean cut fun.\n\nPrincess Isabella - aside being a bit fluffy on the tone - is a good purchase for all casual gamers and a must have for all HOG lovers. The last game of the series, Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir has just been remastered by Artifex Mundi, possibly upping the quality of gameplay a couple notches. I strongly recommend the series as a whole.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 13","true","2.8"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","4"

Many of its features like the map system are still used with almost no change in the original formula. If it ever received an update on the old low-resolution graphics and the photo cut-out hidden object items, it could be a fresh new hit even with today’s saturated HOG market.\n\nThe storyline too is in line with most HOGs: we play as the titular princess, who arrives home to a desolate castle, where she has to solve a series of puzzles and challenges to lift a curse and save the residents. She has a fairy helper to act as a hint system and to keep company: her presence is a welcomed addition, as she is far from annoying, and she adds some life to the otherwise empty castle rooms.\nThere is even a boss battle, believe it or not: the last challenge is a hidden object duel against the computer– a fun minigame  that surprisingly no other HOGs (except the sequels) copied.","November 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Engaged to Prince Adam, she is ready to marry him but upon returning to her castle, she discovered it cursed. It's up to her to find who did that and why. And save the prince in distress.\n\nIt's a nice litte HOG: visuals are good, soundtrack is good and the idea to dispel the curse of each room in different ways is also nice. The little faery that escaped the evil fate helps you and can gain abilities that will be needed for going forward and the fact that you need to rebuild mirrors to free people is also a nice addition. While the puzzles aren't hard, the HO scenes are a little hard: indeed, you don't always see what you need as it's really well hidden in the screen.\n\nIt's a good promise for the rest of the series.

Probably best suited for kids as the puzzles are easy and the fairy helper easily hints/solves the puzzles if you're stuck.\n\nThe player controls princess Isabella after she came home to her castle, which was cursed in her absence. Move from room to room and remove the curse in each room. There is some backtracking, but as the map lets you jump to rooms, this is not a problem. Your fairy companion gains abilities as you progress through the castle.\n\nI encountered one bug only and it was getting 2 of the same item as I clicked too fast to pick it up. It did not change the game in any way other than having that extra item in my inventory.\n\nThere is some seriously flawed logic in this game; of course the normal magic/fairy, but also "lighting this fire will remove the curse from the room because warm = not evil" while in another room"putting out this fire will remove the curse from the room". wut. There is no punishment for missclicking in the hidden object games other than not being able to click for a few seconds. The fairy will help you complete if you're stuck.\n\nDecent graphics, music and voice acting. Very Disney-like in sound effects. I had to turn down the music and sounds as there are too loud compared to the voices on default. A lot of small cutscenes, but all are skippable by mouse-clicking.\n\nRecommended for younger players, really cute game.","May 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You play a magical princess whose castle was cursed by an evil witch. To lift the curse, you have to click on lots and lots and lots of things to make potions, scare off ghosts, and reassemble all the locks and clocks and musical instruments that people hide ♥♥♥♥ing keys in for some ♥♥♥♥ing reason. Let me say up front that this is a perfectly serviceable 2-hour game, with lots of stuff to find, lots of simple puzzles, and some lovingly pre-rendered backgrounds. I get the impression that this is aimed at younger players, because none of the puzzles are very challenging at all, even the ones I am traditionally horrible at like sliding blocks and solo noble. Technically it is less than impressive, seeing as how the resolution only goes up to 800x600 and the Steam overlay is busted, so don't expect to post lots of goofy screenshots for your friends.\n\nThere's a weird, childish naivete to these games that I really like, and this game has it in abundance. In this one you get a fairy sidekick who gains powers like fire and wind to help you interact with things. The first power you get is a rock, which you use to smash fine china and vases to find trinkets within. Your companion signals these with a very excited "This could break!" before smashing the hell out of them. Many of the rooms are cursed with some kind of "evil", which often takes the form of skulls, snakes, and menacing garden statues to click. Some ghosts you feed ghost food or drive off with dance music, others you set on fire or shoot with a crossbow (worth mentioning that I am 3/4 for "crossbows essential to hidden object game"). Near the end your fairy friend cheerfully encourages you to capture a bunch of fireflies and then burn them alive in a jar to "release their evil". It's like someone asked a 5-year-old to tell them a story about a princess battling evil and then made a game out of their 40-minute rambling.\n\nMy favorite part is the "plot twist" about the witch, which I won't spoil here. Instead, I'll mention that this game has a very unique feature for hidden object games, that being a boss battle! The final room is an INCREDIBLY dense hidden object scene, and you're racing to find spell components on your list before the witch finds the ones on hers. She even has an AI pointer so you can see where she's looking! It was a super cool feature and I'd love to see a hidden object game that did more with it. Overall a fine, low-key clicking experience with enough charm to make up for looking like something made by an edutainment company in the early 00's.","September 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Get it on sale and the cost-value makes it an apparent worthy choice if you like hidden-object puzzle games. The hidden-object elements and the puzzles are not overly complicated, and both in terms of interface and theme/plot I would rate it as a children's game. Still, even for adults it is what you might call a "cute diversion."\n\nThe audio effects are acceptable if sometimes arcade-ish, and the music score is decent if not great. The interface is simple yet functional. The graphics are about on-par with my experiences with other hidden-object games - not mindblowing, but not ugly. Functional system all around. There is a (mostly, see below) unlimited help/hint system, and the game has the feature of a map that lets you move to any area without having to transition through the various screens normally associated with travel in adventure games. Neat feature.\n\nThere is one puzzle toward the end of the game that is "real-time" action-oriented and basically an arcade-style click-fest - not my idea of fun or something I think belongs in an otherwise relaxing adventure game - but people from the console generation might not notice as out of place. I could not finish the game because of it, but as I picked this up for a dollar and for that it was a few hours of mindless entertainment, I cannot rate is as "unrecommended" because of that flaw.\n","April 15","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Perfect for perhaps playing with kids. Some of the puzzles are surprisingly difficult considering the age of the market that the game seems to be aimed at and younger players will need assistance in places.\nOverall, the game is nicely presented with strong voiceovers, sound effects and music. The graphics fit the setting and my one gripe is that the HO scenes seem to be lower definition that the rest of the game, making finding some objects more difficult than need be, due to low detailing.\nHaving said that, if you can deal with the "Disney Princess" theme and story, it's a solid HOG, even for more experienced players.","May 7","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It isn't that it's a bad game, although it should be specified that it's mostly a game for a younger audience.\n\nOverall an OK HOG, the puzzles are really varied which is good, but really easy, just not enough of a challenge for me, but would be perfect for my oldest kid who's 11 years old.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would recommend the game for younger player. The price is pretty fair for a game of that lenght.","July 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm not sure what the other more critical reviewers were expecting.  I would have to give this game an 8/10 rating.  the scenes were beautiful, the background music was well done, and the puzzles were challenging, but not so much that I was frustrated to the point of quitting.  it has a very good fairy tale feel and the fairy helper in the game is a pleasant touch.  If I had to make a real constructive critisism of this game, it would be that I wish it had been longer... more puzzles, more types of puzzles.  Not to say that there weren't plenty of puzzles already, But it's like a good book.  Where at the end of the book, you kind of don't really want it to end.  Might not recomend this game at full price, but if you catch it on sale it's deffanitly worth your money.  So are the next 2 in this serries but again, also catch 'em on sale.","May 4, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
