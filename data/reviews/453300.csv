Lord knows it's a thankless job, necessary in any successful party yet never the hero always the scapegoat should things go wrong and you're unable to keep your tank from dying as he charges face first into the nearest swarm of enemies. Why any sane and rational person would do it, much less enjoy it, is one of gaming's great mysteries and yet here we are. The few, the proud, the possibly stupid, the career white mages, medics, clerics, and priests. I've always liked being the healing classes in mmorpgs and class based shooters, so A Healer Only Lives Twice instantly caught my eye upon being released. Rather than being the knight as in virtually every other video game created, you play as his stalwart support, and it is through your careful spell management and item use that the hero survives and the game progresses.\n\nA fairly straightforward game of fighting monsters and progressing forward through levels, AHOLT never the less manages to feel engrossing with a sense of urgency laying thick upon you as your Knight's limbs slowly get torn apart by wave after wave of your standard slimes, bats, and tree monsters, Managing your MP along with your Knight's health in tandem  was exciting to me. Leveling up my skills and being better equipped to keep him alive remained a satisfying experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend trying the Trial mode a time or two to get used to the game play, item management, and controls as the game does lack a proper tutorial and therefore can become bewildering upon first starting, but once you get the hang of things AHOLT is a charming take on the classic dungeon crawler that forces you to embrace and appreciate the challenges of being a Healer and possibly treat your raid party's white mage with a bit more TLC the next time you boot up your favorite anime rpg.\n\nAll in all, the best thing about this game is it gives me a chance to play my favorite archetype in games without being yelled at for not sacrificing my life for some twerp with a God Complex over a X Box microphone and boy is that nice.\n\nIt's rough out here for a Healer, it's about time we got to shine a bit.","June 4","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm glad someone else with better game development skills thought of it as well :). Anyways, I think there is room for improvement such as multiple party members and more bosses, but i still absolutely love this game and can't wait to see what else the author will do with it!\n\nAlso: This game desperately needs audio settings. It's not a huge deal for me, but it's a very obvious lacking feature.","June 3","true","3.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","12","21","3","2"

As a healer your job is to buff, shield and (obviously) heal your party, this game covers all those aspects and also manages to make you 'panic' or 'stress' as all healers in games do.  Early levels we're a bit dull but over time enemies get tougher, stressing the fact that you need to manage all your resources - mana, crafting ingredients and cooldowns - very carefully or else.  Only criticism is the torches, burning fuel does almot nothing to increase torch time and most of the time torches are at the very back of the tier so if you focus on the wrong column you're pretty much dead by the next wave... A seperate mode with infinite torches would be nice.\n\ntl;dr - It was a very nice game; torches limit the experience though.","June 4","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There's basically no explanation of what to do, but you treat each part of the knight as a different party member choosing what to heal/shield based on which limbs are being attacked by the mobs.  You also get to choose which mob the knight is attacking with lb and rb which I didn't notice at first.  It's basically pure resource micro management, kill the most important mobs first, heal the limbs being attacked, burn items to keep your torches lit and keep crafting more resources to keep going.","June 4","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I thought this title sounded exciting and well, perhaps with it's simple UI / graphics, I could still find the engagement and excitement from being the healer who saves the day.  Sometimes, I am just a bit too optimistic.\n\nThe gameplay is very clunky.  The controls didn't seem clear, the inventory / crafting didn't make sense.  The potential upgrades for the character didn't seem exciting to work for.  I dunno, I only put 15 mins into it, gained a few levels and then died, but I am just really not interested in going back.  Requested refund.","June 4","false","0.3"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","3","22","0","0"

Certainly worth the price point.\n\nYou play as a healer, trying to keep a warrior alive so you can both get out of a dungeon, and so must fight waves of enemies to get to the end.  The gameplay mainly consists of using the right ability in the right circumstance; should you put a wall up so a limb won't die from that next attack, or just heal? Should you bump up the damage of the warriors next attack?  Do you have enough mana stored to use your increase exp ability, so you can level faster and get stronger abilities?\n\nMost importantly though is understanding the torch and red orb mechanics.  There are two ways to die in the dungeon; either all the limbs of the warrior are critically injured, or you run out of torches.  You "can" replenish the torch with items, though I haven't ever had enough to actually use that ability; the main source of torches are from the waves themself.  Each wave has one torch and one red orb.  You want to find these as soon as possible, and then comes decision time: do you use the orb as soon as you have it, or kill some more of the wave to get more exp?  Every wave you complete (whether by killing the whole wave or by using the orb to clear it) will decrease your increased exp modifier by 50%, so clearing a wave is an important decision.  You have to balance your level growth, your mana and the warriors health, and your time.\n\nDifferent mobs have different annoying abilities, but I'll leave you to find those for yourself.  Discovery!\n\nYou are not meant to win the game in the first run, just get as far as possible.  You gain currency (PP) to spend on the upgrade page on the menu depending on how far you got, and what level you got to, which can be spent on a variety of upgrades (increasing the potency of an xp buff you can cast, gaining more reagents, increasing the level cap of abilities, xp buffs contingent on particular contidions, being able to start later in the dungeon, etc).  You can reset your profile to try and get to the end with less buffs from the options menu.\n\nFor a cute little $5 game, I certainly got more fun out of it than I thought I would.  Plus, always good to show people that playing support roles isn't as easy as they might think it is!","June 4","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
