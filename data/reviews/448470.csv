"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/448470/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","A nostalgic celebration of early computer programming that turns the modern puzzle genre into a programmer’s logic dilemma.\nGameplay:\nGameplay consists of turning off a screen/ field of tessellating geometric figures that are in a “steady state,” or fixed repeating pattern. Here, you simply choose how many and where you want to place the shapes and then start the program running to see if it works. I started in Hard mode, because there is only Hard and Harder, or the Simulation mode which works like a sandbox. Of course, after struggling with that for a few minutes, I moved to the Simulation mode where you have more freedom with where you can place the pieces on the field. It was there I began to really understand the game.\n\nBasically, you have a marked segment of the field for dropping in shapes on the Hard mode, and they must be placed in such a way as to have an effect on all the figures already on the screen. On the other hand, the Simulation mode allows you to interact directly with the figures already on screen, to see how they are changed when a figure you place hits them. This directs your thinking.\n\nYou turn on the game and before long you find yourself mesmerized with just watching the effects the shapes you add to the field have on the whole process. After some time and experimentation, you realize you’ve actually begun to see how the program is “thinking.” It’s a definite lightbulb feeling.\n\nBacteria is an incredible game! I spent 4 hours in a single setting on this. It has a lot to offer for people who like to just jump into a puzzle with no preconceived ideas or splash screens. And, the achievements drop pretty quickly once you figure out the idea. I got the first four of six achievements in the first four hours.\n\nNarrative:\nNormally I've felt like a game couldn't do without words... text... but I have to say in this case the wordlessness is a major asset. There is nothing to get in the way or distract from the simple concept of the geometric patterns and the AI’s plan. In that way, it is similar to logic and/or strategy games, like Frozen Synapse, where you make your moves and then see the results, then try again.\n\nIt's an awesome game... one that I will probably spend quite a bit of time in I can tell already. And, the card art is definitely original and something I’ve enjoyed collecting. And, right now at $0.88 it’s well worth the price.\n\nGraphics & Sound:\nThe graphics are presented on an interface that resembles the old cathode ray tube (CRT) design monitors, with a convex screen. The puzzle pieces look something like pentomino figures, being simple geometric shapes. The music is ambient space age music, very relaxing. The dlc includes the soundtrack and a selection of various bacteria backgrounds, as well as a mini game that takes you further into the “Game of Life” idea Bacteria is based on. I’ve enjoyed it so much, I grabbed a couple of copies of the game and dlc to give away over on Steam Gifts, so look for the giveaways on my page as soon as they add them. http://www.steamgifts.com/user/EdenStarGazer\n\nPros:\n* Presents an array of difficulty choices to make the game accessible from the start.\n* Nostalgic look of old DOS screens\n* Reminiscent of Games programmed in BASIC language\n* Nerdy geometric component of recreational Math\n\nCons:\n*No narrative\n*No words\n*Not even the sound of your own inner voice :D\n\nI recommend this game for those who enjoy hacking games, deciphering, or programming type puzzles. If you like pattern mathematical games like pentominoes, or Izzi , or if you spent hours  trying to decipher a coding language, or just love the way computer AI “thinks,” then this open puzzler is for you.","March 23","true","10.2"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","30","35","2","0"

If your neighbors are too fat you must die\n2. If there are no neighbors you cannot have sex\n\nThe results are still fascinating until today. Lifeform shaped patterns like crabs, flowers or butterflies begin to pulse, flash or to explode. There are stable patterns like bubbles or bars which must be destroyed. In the end if nothing helps you can erase each of the cells with the one block tool.\n\nI enjoyed very much the chillout soundtrack of this game and the binary stacked levels. Two gamemodes: colored and monochrome (which is apparently harder and like the original "LIFE") But sometimes I wished I had a bigger rubber ...","April 30","true","3.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","1"

In the 1970 's british math guy Conway created this algorithom pattern game dealing with the simulation of cellular automation.  WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN ????!!!! Basically you have a blank screen and you use patterns and diffrent cell combinations to create and destroy life/cells. There is rules and help/simulations with a link to Wikipedia... that I actually think you need to AT LEAST glance over so you have an idea what is going on. There is basically the rule of life or rule of 3. IF there is more than 3, then your cells overpopulated and die. IF there is less than 3, than your cells cant populate and you die. SO, click on the screen and see what happens and click click and watch. ALOT. One click you are winning and close to the blank screen or the life/dead cells you are trying to get rid of are almost done, then BOOM life exploads forth as you tighten your grip on your mouse and start all over. The music is kinda hypnotic and soothing, but the game itself even though called relaxing.. isnt really. Have fun and actually learn a real science math concept. Life is hard. and Life finds a way and yeah your mind goes to all the awesome quotes about life while you do reliaze, its not as easy as it seems.","May 15","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/448470/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1476 products in account","IntroductionBacteria is a casual puzzle game that has a retro/nostalgia feeling to it. The game itself consists of a few game modes, and 2 types of difficulty Hard mode and Harder mode. There is also another game mode called Simulation mode which is basically a sandbox mode to mess about with and see how things works.\n\nGameplayWhen I first entered this game and started playing Hard mode it was rather confusing at what my actual object was, and what I actually had to do. There is no tutorial on how to play this game, only a link to a wiki page which explains how the game works. I am not one that really likes to read a lot of text before playing the game, so me being me I just went straight into the game with no knowledge of what I had to do or whatnot. So upon entering the first level I really wasn't sure what I had to do. I assumed that I had to make the unstable cells back to normal cells in order to progress. So upon hitting the unstable cells it split and it just caused chaos, and it caused more unstable cells to multiply and such. I guess the point I am trying to make with this first time experience with this game is that people don't really like to read a wiki on how to play as game. Possibly add a small tutorial to explain the basics on how the game works, this should be shorter than the wiki. Then if people are still confused redirect them to the wiki. From what I gathered from my first playing experience and reading the wiki the gameplay works as follows. It consists of a set of unstable cells that you need to be able to get them back to a stable state, or if you can't do that get them to a fixed repeating pattern. You have a specified area where you can plant your cells to direct them to the unstable cell and hopefully make them all stable again. Although, I really appreciate the simulation mode, it help me understand the game a little more and how each cell works. The game has some really relaxing music to complement the game itself in it's retro styled form.\n\nPros+ Very nice retro feel to the game\n+ Nice relaxing music\n+ Trading cards & Achievements\n\nCons- No in-game tutorial (have to read wiki)\n- May be confusing when you first start playing\n\nResult / Final thoughtsBacteria is a fun casual puzzle game that requires you to think about where you are placing each of your cells in order to make the unstable cells stable again. It's a very immersive and interesting game to play, which requires a trial and error way of playing, or just keep producing cells until they are all stable.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 27","true","5.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

Yeah, that sentence nails it. I agree with them, what I don't understand is why they thought this and then gave e positive score to this game. When I play a puzzle game I need to know what I'm doing, or at least what I should achieve, that's the heart of puzzle gameplay!\nThis game leaves you alone, it gives you no clue, it just shows you some levels, you start one of them, and you have to figure out what your goal is. This first step is actually easy: there are these unstable shapes on the screen and you have to stabilize them. How? Here it gets tricky. You have to design other figures in a shape so they can move towards the unstable ones and stabilize them. How? I honestly don't entirely know. What happens felt random to me, but I'm sure there are patterns you can recognize and use to complete the levels, I'm also sure the game isn't compelling enough to persuade me to make an effort to fully understand how it works.\nI think this is always a mistake: when you design a game that asks people to struggle in order to understand how it works you will always lose the interest of those who aren't dazzled by the game from the start, meanwhile what are the benefits of this design choice? I can't find a convincing one, maybe deceiving the player so she won't immediately notice the gaps of the game?\nI love puzzle games based on logic but what is a total deal breaker here is that you have to throw the shapes you create from one side of the screen to the other one in order to hit the shapes you have to stabilize. To do this you have to guess the right trajectory and cross your fingers, and logic here pretty much dies, because you will always loose cause of bad aim.\nSo go play bowling, at least it's honest about what it asks you to do.\n\nConclusionsA bowling game disguised as something smarter which doesn't gives you any clue about what to do in order to keep hiding its true identity.\nA lot of people won't say this is a bad game cause they feel stupid doing so. How can I say I don't like this just because I didn't understand this? People will think I'm stupid! I will say I love this, because smart people love smart things! Duh!\nSo, if you think you are cool when you struggle understanding step by step boring things other people don't understand, you will love this game, otherwise skip it.","March 25","false","0.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","7","17","3","9"
