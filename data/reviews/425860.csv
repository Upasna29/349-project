The scrolling is rickety, the enemies boring and the design is completely unoriginal.\nIt features such wonderful bugs like "Unable to shoot after pausing the game" and "clearing a stage doesn't unlock the next one" but to be fair: the developer does seem to care as there have been fixes to past problems. Hopefully the others will be fixed too.","May 28","false","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

It's similar to Geometry Wars, but not nearly as deep at this point.  Also, it has some bugs.  It's currently worth a shot on discount or in a bundle.","June 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
