Good voiceacting with lots of spooky stories because you play the super spook detective Kate Reed!  The hidden object puzzles are real creative, instead of looking like a flea market threw up they fit the scenery for item hunting.  There is a hint button, and the puzzles arent too difficult, but you cant stuck because if a person wants to just throw their life away they can hit the "skip" button bringing shame and dishonor upon their family.    A helpful map indicates areas of interest because with 1000's of doors a map is kinda critical.  ooOOoooo the artwork is so nice in this game, everything looks so spooky and the objects in the Hidden Object Games are very crisp and clear so people shouldnt struggle to much.  This game plays like a book, its a very exciting page turner, where instead of just one story there are several stories to free the ghosts trapped here on earth.  The house can travel through space and time, so who knows where you might end up!\n\nThere is a bonus game after the main game that lets you solve some additional mysteries.  More than just a mere room its a whole series of events, puzzles, and more hidden object games so this game is a good value at the price.\n\n(A concept art gallery would have been nice because the art is very good, seeing how it came to life would be nice.)\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99","July 10, 2014","true","19.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","1"

Remember those Highlights magazines or I Spy books as a kid? Its kind of like those, but throw in some puzzles too. Its nothing too hard though. So if you are looking for adventure or a challenge I'd say look elsewhere for this is for those who enjoy the journey and story and its not how fast you can get through to the end. What it is, is simple problem solving and a whole lot of finding things that are hidden beyond others.\n\nTo put it simple it's a Point & Click. You go about the house pointing and clicking, sometimes "dragging" (rarely). Most doors and objects of intrest are locked. Sometimes you can go and find the key, other times you play a mini Hidden Object game (which you can hop in & out of fairly easily without losing what you found so far, which is a plus). Upon completing the mini HO game you are always awarded a object that you will need (its worth noting: usually the object awarded in question is one of the objects found in the mini game). Aside from the hidden objects sprawled about the house, there is a great deal of puzzles that must be solved to obtain other items of intrest. Also there is a tie-in with ghosts and such; you help ghosts sovle mysteries based upon themselves. In doing so, you resolve their need to be at peace.\n\nSuch is how this game is played. I find it soothing. Relaxing. A quaint little title (or not so little, but still) It's not an adventure, its an experience. And I enjoy it.\n\nThis game gets a "Yes" from Awsome Weegee.","November 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I don't know why, but the HOGs seem much more difficult than the ones in other games.  Plus, the "go fetch" puzzles needed to progress through the game seem much "deeper" than I've run into (some run from almost the beginning areas of the game to near the end).  Also, this is my first HOG without Achievements.  I expected not to like that.  But, it turns out to be more rewarding to just play the game instead of worrying if some stray mouse click or publisher design decision will lock me out of an Achievement until I make a second run through the game.\n\nAs far as mild negatives:\n\n- the "story" feels like it's picking up in the middle (perhaps this is a sequel?),\n- there are two or three instances where an object you've found is not the object you're looking for (i.e., you need a lantern, but the one you've found isn't the right one).\n- the HOGs all contain objects that are hidden, but they're not color-coded as being hidden (objects that have to be manipulated or are physically hidden are textually red, but those that are in a container that just needs to be looked into are textually black).\n\nOther than that, it's pretty much standard HOG fare:  decent graphics, acceptable voice acting, tolerable story.  I got about 7.3 hours of game play out of the main game, and an additional 2.3 hours out of the Bonus Chapter (totaling 9.6 hours).  So, I'd say the list price is pretty close to being worth it.  But, as usual, look for a deal (right now, there's a Sinister Stories Bundle (that includes this game) that costs less than just the list price of this one game).

There are a lot of special actions to do in the HOG scenes (using a scissors, drawing something, etc) and a lot of interactions outside the HOG scenes. The mini games are well done, some being quite originals. There's morphing items to collect. The cut scenes are numerous and well done, the music is nice.

"The Palm of Zoroaster" being the fourth.  If interested the other two can be found on Big Fish Games (yes, shamelss plug there, and hopefully I will not be banned).  This game is layered with an overall mystery storyline running above the "adventure" cases.  It is engaging, fun, intuitive, and easy to play. (All Big Fish collector's editions include strategy guides, bonus features, and extra chapters, so well worth the money spent.) One of things I like best about this particular HO game is trying to figure out where all the inventory items go.  Some items get picked and used later in a different unrelated "adventure" chapter, while others stay with the player for nearly the entire game and act as red herrings or McGuffins throughout.  Some of the puzzles at the start of the game are unsolvable and can only to be solved as the game progresses or near the end.  It tests the memory and creates "ah-ha" moments throughout the game as "Oh that is where that item goes" and "Oh this is what I need to solve that puzzle".  Of course the end is always satisfying (at least for me).  The "boss" (who or whatever it is) is easy to "defeat" and the overall storyline mystery is solved conclusively.

Partially this was a matter of game mechanics.  (For example, hiding objects inside of objects, or having to repair or transform them for them to 'count' for your search.  Half the time this was figuring out the hotspots within the puzzle screen, and less about actually seeing a hidden pattern inside of a larger picture.)\n\n[Update:  I recommend other users play this on 'Casual' difficulty setting, as this will minimize the interface level issues.]\n\nHowever, I really did get into the whole idea of the House of 1000 Doors itself.  That part tying the whole game together across space/time/afterlife was very interesting.\n\nThere were aspects of the quest/story that just went ... nowhere.  (i.e. What are the Beyond Objects for, and why can't I see my progres, or lack thereof, anywhere within the game interface?)  The original game ramps you up to make an interesting choice, and then suddenly ENDS ... without actually giving you an oppurtunity to choose your final outcome at all!\n\nHowever, I did really enjoy the Collectors Edition content.  (Extra Chapter/Myster to solve, Strategy Guide included with game, and Wallpapers, etc.)\n\nI recommend the original game at 3/5 Stars, but I'll give it an extra star with the Strategy Guide, etc. contect included.  It was enjoyable, and I did play it all the way through, but it was not compelling!  I was slightly disappointed, even for a casual/hidden objects genre game.\n\nFinal Rating:  4/5 Stars  (With Collectors Edition content bonus)\n\nValue for price?  I think this is worth the $10, but this is definitely a game I'd recommend if you can catch it during a Steam Sale.\n\nUpdate:  I did NOT consider the value of the Steam Collectible Card drops when I originally reviewed this.  If you merely trade them away for cash in your Steam Wallet, these are worth $1-$3, each [at the time I sold mine].  Expect up to 3 to drop while you play this game.

I played the entire game and endured the bugs and crashes only to find the cards did not drop. I then installed it on my PC and had to complete the entire game (3 hours on 2nd playthrough) a second time for the cards to finally drop. On PC there were no bugs for me.

Item-based puzzles (find objects, then use them to solve various tasks).  Most of the solutions are fairly straightforward, although it is easy to miss items if you are not being thorough.  My only issue was the game's level of redundancy (i.e. needing two different buckets of water, a million keys, etc.)\n2. Traditional hidden object screens of the "pile of junk that doesn't really belong together" variety.  These were challenging, but never frustrating; the artwork was clear, the labels were accurate, and items were overlapping but not obfuscated.  I would actually say these were some of the best HOG puzzles I have seen in recent memory.\n3. Bonus hidden "beyond" objects that appear in the background art.  There are 35 total to find in the main game (approximately one per screen).\n4. A handful of incredibly easy mini-games (rotating discs, dragging lines, rearranging components, etc.) that provide a break from the main gameplay.  Some of these felt like remedial versions of classic genre mini-games, although others were new and creative.  Unlike other HOGs I've played recently, the mini-games complimented, rather than overshadowed, the hidden object sections.\n\nThere is quite a bit of backtracking, but since there aren't that many screens it doesn't feel like a slog.  There isn't even a map because you really don't need one.\n\nOne thing I found surprising is the fact there is only one level of difficulty (medium).  The game is very casual, with good puzzle feedback, a hint system that points you in the right direction if you need a nudge, and a built-in walkthrough (including all "beyond" locations) if you need a push.\n\nA note to the faint of heart: the game does contain blood smears and references to death; however there isn't any on-screen violence, nor are there any jump scares.\n\nWhat I wished this game had done better:\n- Most of the voice acting is atrocious.\n- The plot gets a bit lazy and convoluted at times, with the maguffin being almost forgot about during the main game (they do explore it in the bonus mission).  It just seems like they wrote off any inconsistencies with "because ghost house."\n- There is no incentive to find all the "beyond" objects other than personal pride.  Other games I've played will let you unlock either gallery images or additional backstory notes.\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8/10.  The story might not be the best, but the puzzles are strong and plentiful, and the atmosphere is satisfactorily creepy.  If hidden objects are your thing, you will not be disappointed.","December 21, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It plays like a mixture between classical point and click adventure and HOG, the HOG Part though has not the impact that often goes with such games.\n\nThe game plays very casual, which is in fact quite refreshing if you played a game with a lot of heavy thinking for days over. The HOGs are very good rendered and localisation was done by people who are in knowledgeable (ever had the trouble finding a piece because you didn't know what the description really meant? I had it on some of those games.), voice acting in the in game cutting scenes was also quite good - only on the bonus part there was some glitch in one of the voice-actors part.\n\nThe riddles are easy, sometimes way too easy - but that isn't really bothersome, because the side-stories in the game make up for this.\n\nThe graphics are good, well rendered. The HOGs work perfectly into the game, and the searchables are very easy to distinguish and find - though not too easy, you still have to search the whole scene for some items to find them.\n\nI can recomend this game on my own game experience, it is good for some relaxing hours. Though the price of 9,99 € seems a bit high for this kind of genre. So I have to narrow the recomendation for Fans of this genre, it is worth the price - all others are likely to be a bit dissappointed, that in about five to six hours the game is over.","February 23, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(And of course this also means that a significant portion of the game is nothing but backtracking, especially in the bonus chapter.)\n\nAs for the story, it can be considered a really high point or a mediocre one. The voice acting (except for the child actor) is good, and the plot is a series of well-written short ghost stories. But the overall tone maybe has a wee bit too much spiritualist preaching in it instead of the usual supernatural fantasy elements.","November 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/286500/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","A mysterious house of secrets appears and disappears at random locations with little warning, an author with writer’s block finds herself in its walls searching for clues about her family and a host of ghosts are begging for help. If this sounds interesting to you then it’s time for you to play House of a 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets! Step into the shoes of Kate Reed as she visits the house to clear the good name of one of her ancestors, only to be introduced to life-altering supernatural experiences. It’s up to Kate to help the residents of the house and make her way out before she becomes one herself.\n\nThe story starts you off by saying Kate has to go to the house to clear the name of her ancestor, Margaret Fox; however, most of the game is spent instead helping ghosts and residents of the house. Many of the ghosts you help have met tragic ends and can’t pass on without your aid. Despite having nothing to do with the main reason you went to the house, I found each story very interesting as well as the characters you meet. In fact, the game is full of a large cast of colorful folk except for Kate; despite being the protagonist, Kate is very dry and unrelatable. Another issue I had with the story is that it isn’t really given a proper wrap up until the bonus chapter. The entire main game is spent helping others with little to no mention of Margaret Fox until the epilogue and you don’t get to know more about her until the bonus chapter which is odd for a game about “family secrets.” If you’re playing a version of the game without the bonus chapter the story might even seem incomplete to you. The story of the main game seems more about Kate proving to Gabriel, the mysterious caretaker of the house, that she has what it takes to join the residents and live there permanently.\n\nMinor complaints aside, the story is well done and fun. The game is also a very solid hidden object title, offering many scenes as well as some mini games. Most scenes will be played twice, however some get hit three times and a certain one even four or five thanks to the bonus chapter. I personally dislike when a hidden object scene is used more than twice, you get too used to it and where the objects are. Another thing I disliked was the lack of a map; this game was very backtrack heavy and it was time consuming and slightly irritating without a map. Aside from those two points, I highly enjoyed the game. Voice acting wasn’t bad and the music was nice as well though the game could have used a bit more variety in that department.\n\nA game so good I played it twice, a good addition to your collection of hidden object games. The length is solid, about four hours with the bonus chapter and it isn’t too difficult. The puzzles ranged from easy to moderate usually but there are no achievements so if you’re ever stuck you can always skip. There also semi-hidden items called “beyond objects” to find around the game, you can try to collect them all for fun. The game does have trading cards, however, so if you’re a collector of badges you’re in luck. House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets isn’t perfect but it’s an overall good experience that I recommend giving a try.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","November 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But the atmosphere and the sound is great, the voice actors are quite mediocre, though. The graphics are also pretty nice.\n\nI needed nearly 6 hours to finish it while sometimes using the locating-option (the game allows you to click a question mark symbol to show a marker where you have to go or which item you need to use) for the item-finding puzzles, which are pretty annoying after you made them at the same location several times.\n\nI honestly do not think it's worth 8 or 10 bucks, but if you can grab for 5 bucks you'll have a funny time.","April 10, 2014","true","5.9"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","15","34","0","0"

The story is engaging; it's almost styled like an anthology with a number of substories scattered throughout the main story.  As such, the plot doesn't drag on forever since you're moving from one plot to the next as you help each spirit find rest.\n\nPuzzles are moderately challenging.  Hidden object scenes are also moderately challenging.  Veterans to this game type will have no issues with the puzzles but they won't blow right through them either.\n\nThere is a convenient skip function for puzzles that are tedious or if you get stuck.\n\nThere is also a convenient location jump so you can essentially teleport yourself anywhere that you've already been.  This is where some games get extremely tiresome, with endless back-and-forth travel, but with the jump feature (which has no cooldown and can be used over and over) the game avoids that mindless "travel for eighteen screens to get an item and then backtrack another twenty screens to use it" problem that can ruin the experience.\n\nI clocked in at around five hours of gameplay including the bonus chapter.  This makes the game one of the longer HO/puzzle games that I've played, especially recently, and makes the ten dollar price tag less painful; however, I tend to feel that the average price of these games is generally too high for the amount of gameplay (even with a longer game), so I personally recommend waiting for a half-off sale or a bundle.

Now you can only choose easy or expert - and expert only lenghtens the time for hints to recharge and removes glitters pointing out active areas. The mouse cursor (even if selecting system cursor) gives away all collectable stuff, intractive objects and places.\n\nScenes & HO areas are very well made, but person animations and voice acting is outright terrible. Sadly this seems to be quite a norm among hidden object games.

The graphics are simply amazing and the atmosphere is even better. You'll find yourself in this huge ghost house (and if you're wondering, no, it doesen't have 1000 doors. just a dozen) hunting for clues and speaking with your friendly ghost hosts. Everything just flow smooth and simple, in the right place.\n\nLet me tell you, it'a a beautifully crafted product that will keep you entertained and relaxed between your super meat boy sessions.\n\nthumbs up!!!","April 9, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or maybe she doesn't—the plot gets a little confused towards the end, although that will be addressed in a moment.\n\nFirst, the HOG criteria:\n\nCriterion 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nThis isn't one of the genre's shining moments, by any means. Every item collection screen is full of random nonsensical clutter, along with a fair amount of trick items that can only be found by assembling other pieces of clutter or finding a secret sub-screen within the main area. To the game's credit, finding these items is made far easier by the fact that complicated items are highlighted in the list. The game also has a better explanation for the clutter than most. After all, if this house really travels through time and space, who's to say what random garbage it might pick up?\n\nCriterion 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nNot especially. It's bog-standard design right down the line on this front. Players move through a series of screens, unlocking doors and solving simple puzzles (or skipping them with the aid of an extremely fair hint system) until they find that they're missing a certain item. Suddenly a previous area is bathed in a magical glow, and it's time to find that item! (Along with twenty other arbitrary knickknacks.) Not especially disappointing, but the developers certainly weren't going the extra mile this time around.\n\nCriterion 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors is something of an odd case, since the story that the player finds themselves participating in has very little to do with the plot they're promised at the outset.\n\nAfter a chilling opening movie, the main character is contacted by a ghostly relative, and told that the only way to clear their family's name is to go to the house. So the player does, and finds herself tasked with traveling to the sites of a variety of murders—all involving a tragic death in the past (some more gruesome than others)—and solving puzzles to put the ghosts involved to a peaceful rest.\n\nThe bizarre part is that the main character's relative isn't mentioned. The nature of her scandal never comes up, and by the time the end of the game rolls around I'd almost forgotten what the point of the whole endeavor was supposed to be in the first place. It wasn't until the main character mentions in her final monologue that she'd gotten the evidence she needed to vindicate her ancestors that I was reminded of the game's purported storyline—and mildly annoyed, since nothing like that had actually happened.\n\nAfter beating the game I discovered that the main story—really the entire central plot of the game, is entirely dealt with and resolved in a bonus unlockable chapter that's included only in the "collector's edition" of the game. Luckily the publishers were kind enough to provide me with that version for review, but I worry that anyone playing the standard game would come away completely disappointed (and somewhat baffled) by the utter lack of a resolution.\n\nWith all the ghosts, murders, and tragic histories one would expect from a gothic melodrama, House of 1000 Doors does a great job of finding an eerie tone for the game and giving players a consistent level of challenge as they explore their way through it. It definitely loses marks for the bizarre mishandling of its plot, but beyond that, the mechanics are solid, and it's successful at everything else it attempts.","February 7","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Except for the bit where there weren't actually a thousand doors.  That would've been pretty awesome, though I guess more like a room escape game than a hidden object one.  Which is a genre-smush I didn't know I wanted until I just wrote that sentance, but wow.  Does it exist?  If it does, someone let me know!)\n\nPlots were terrible, but because there was a bunch of sub-plots tying into an overarching big plot, they didn't seem so bad - I mean, some things were are-you-SERIOUS?? level dumb, but that's pretty normal for the genre, so I can't dock it too much for that.  A few things that didn't come up AT ALL in the cutscenes but were actual vital parts of the plot, which you could only find out by reading the diary, though.  Made things kiiiinda confusing at times.  Devs, even if you're not going to invest in quality writing, just... don't do that.  It's a terrible mood.\n\nKeyword choices were also pretty good!  There were a few things I was ???? about that I think were just dialect differences, and a few reaaaally obscure terms (one I ended up googling, and the fourth or fifth result was a walkthrough for the game, soooo yeah, obscure), but there weren't any mistranslations or coding errors, which puts it a couple of steps above most games in the genre I've played.  There was one instance of having two things in a HO scene which were classified as $keyword, and only one counted, though.  That was pretty frustrating.\n\nMinigames were pretty good; nothing amazing, but nothing bad, just solid little puzzles.  Art was nice, VAing - well, terrible, but again, that's not unusual. A few places where I wasn't sure what to do next, but there was a map with action-avaliable highlighting and warping, so I could usually figure it out before too long.  There were a couple of places where you had to use a specific tool even though you had something else that would actually be better for it, or would work equally as well (pots of water being just as good to put out a fire as a bucket of water, for example), which was annoying but, again, pretty normal (and probably really hard to code differently unless you completely redesgined the entire game, to be fair).\n\nConclusion: solid game of its genre!","January 1","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you wanted to work your way through with no hints would take a very long time since everything you need is always on the complete other side of the map.  Good game though and if you don't mind using the hint button then it's pretty fun.  Good for some mindless clicking.","January 17","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Storyline is a bit "Mary Sue" but it's workable and fluid, and stays on theme for the entire game. The cut scenes aren't painfully long and the movement from one location to another is acceptable; none of that "clicking 18 times to get back to the place where you need to use the shovel" nonsense. The hidden object challenges are executed via clutter rather than ghosting images into the scene, and the puzzles have a hint button that will instantly solve them, should you be stuck or uninterested in that aspect of the gameplay.\n\nFor $5 and 6 hours of playtime, it's a decent deal. If you can get it for under $3, it's a steal.","December 29, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a fun game with an interesting storyline. None of the challenges are too hard. Not bad for a beginner and with the hint system you can't get too stuck. I have already gotten the next House of 1000 Doors game. I might replay it to find all the "beyond objects," (hidden objects throughout the rooms that have no impact on gameplay). I definitely recommend getting it if you see it on sale. Average deal when not on sale.","January 31","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Artwork is really beautiful. The soundtrack could be a bit better, because it's too repetitive (think it's basically the same theme playing during the entire game). If you like hidden object/puzzle games, I surely recomend this game if you buy it on sales.","February 22","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It felt like I couldn't take 5 steps in the game without having to trudge through yet another HO scene.\n- The plot is somewhat fuzzy and difficult to follow.\n- The NPC cast is about 3 times as numerous as in other similar games, with multiple very similar characters, so they don't really have any depth, and are easy to mix up.\n- The plot also has several bizarre and gory elements. Eg. someone being decapitated by leaning out of a train window; someone else decapitating his lover's corpse, and incorporating the skull in a statue; people literally dying of anguish or humiliation.\n- The built-in Strategy Guide inexplicably only unlocks after finishing the game.\n\nI still recommend the game, it gives a few hours of entertainment and nice visuals & music & sound effects.\n\nScreenshots (with spoilers)\nExamples of nice scenes:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418375043\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418375621\n\nWeird stuff:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409606824\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=411040510\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413467742\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=416845754\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418975452\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413467403\n\nJust morbid:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413468855\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=416845197","March 20, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a bit let down that I couldn't play the minigames after finishing the story and the bonus story... The enviroment graphics was quite good but the video scenes kind of not suited the game (the heavy half-still graphics of them not quite fitted into the mood). I'm looking forward more stories of the game, since the 1000 doors allow/has a lot of gameplay possibilities :)","June 4","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
