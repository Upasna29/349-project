The gameplay is a cross between a racer and shoot em up where you control a steam powered buggy and have to contend with a variety of enemies as you try to make it to the finish line without running out of steam...literally, if you dordle or allow one too many enemies to escape you'll not have enough pressure to keep your buggy going and grind to a halt.\n\nAfter a race you have the option to spend any coins collected to upgrade your buggy with a variety of weapons, tools, rams and a beefier buggy and while it doesn't really change how the game plays, the upgrades are very much required to progress and even on Normal Difficulty, you may hit some challenging spikes in difficulty. This isn't helped by seemingly being unable to redo won races during the campaign to collect more coins for upgrades - at one stage, I had to sell all previous unlocks in order to buy the parts needed to give me a fighting chance.\n\nLevels are largely similar, hold accelerate and fire and hurtle towards the finish line, boosting when available. Of special note are the few 'boss' levels which I found very enjoyable and changed up the pace of things enough to keep the game engaging.\n\nThe presentation is lovely and the couple of cutscenes are humorous. It controlled well with an XBox Controller and was certainly playable, though slightly clunky with keyboard controls and the entire game can be played in local co-op and although Online Multiplayer is an option, at the time of playing there were no servers available.\n\nPressure is rather enjoyable but very short, crossing the finish line at around three hours to clear the campaign races. It's certainly hard to recommend this game at full price as a result of this, but what's on offer is well polished and fun - if you want a game to play with your kids and you happen to see this game on offer, I'd say give it a go!","April 5, 2014","false","3.0"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","44","58","0","5"

You play as Morgan, a young man in his steam-powered attack vehicle, racing across the land battling evil minions to get the lake's water back from Count Soap II, who stole all of it to force the inhabitants to use his spa facilities.\n\nPros: Nice game for all ages with colorful graphics and humoristic characters. You don't race against time, but instead against the loss of pressure you vehicle has, which is replenished from fighting off other wacky vehicles and passing check points. You have a multitude of upgrades you can purchase between races, whether car chassis, bumper, main weapon and secondary weapon. There's a long list of varied levels with little repetition, and an increasing variety of baddies to shoot, some straightforward and some requiring specific tactics.\n\nCons: There is no story development to speak of (not that the game needs any). The game's focus isn't on the racing itself, but on completing the levels while killing all baddies and picking coins, so once completed there is little incentive to go back just to beat your time. The campaign mode doesn't allow to play back other levels, so you can't use your progression to do better in a past level.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nAs far as arcade-style games go, this is a fun one to play. Levels are quick, so you can hop in for a few levels and leave, great for young gamers, casual gamers, or anyone looking for short play sessions. The game is exactly what it advertises to be, so if it looks interesting to you, knock yourself out!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","July 5, 2015","true","12.2"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

It's also very hard. We got to the second map and had a hard time beating it, it was on normal, still didn't beat it. You constantly run out of pressure before you get to the 3rd check point, and since you don't have enough coins to upgrade your vehicle, you will be stuck repeating the same map over and over. There is also an issue with losing connection from the server. I recommend this for the 99 cents sale that's going on now, but not for full price.","January 17, 2015","false","3.6"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

It's a game where you drive your car "from above" while trying to shoot whatever shoots you. It has really nice coins to pickup along the way (if you're from Mars and never played super mario, picking coins is good) and you can destroy stuff just because you missed your target and the bullets have to go somewhere.\n\nNow, let's us be serious for a moment:\nThis game is funny and has a nice gameplay but it's ordinary and not original. I only recommend it because it's very well made and it's not really bad at all. I played for a bit and after a while i found it boring so i just waited for the trading cards to close it.

You can only shoot in the direction your car is facing, which means you can either drive where you want or shoot where you need to—never both.\n\nAs you are constantly being attacked by enemies pulling alongside you, the experience of the game is one of irritation as you are forced to point your vehicle every which way but where the road turns, swerving left and right like a drunken lunatic forever waving at flies.\n\nPressure doesn't challenge you; it harrasses you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astarav/recommended/224220/","astarav","Sinaea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astarav/","667 products in account","The controls for this game are really wonky. You'd think that a controller would be the best way to go with a game like this, but it really isn't. I found the controls much more intuitive with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nThere is no map of the track, and the isometric view means you can't see much of the road ahead of you. At first I was like, "What kind of crappy racing game is this?" but then I realized that it's more of an arcade game than a racing one.\n\nYou zoom through the game, avoiding obstacles and shooting bad guys. I'm not particularly great at either those things, but I am good at one thing: crashing. So I upgraded my car with a bunch of armor and some spikey rams, and I crashed into my enemies to my heart's content.\n\nThe graphics are very cool, the soundtrack is fun, and (once you get used to the weird controls) the car controls respond quite well to your commands.\n\nThe game was extremely fun at first, but it got very repetitive very quickly. The first boss fight was interesting. After that, there was a bunch more of the same ol', same ol'. Second boss fight: different and interesting. Then more boredom (oh but this time they removed most of the walls on the sides, so I actually had to pay attention to where I was driving instead of crashing into the sides, hee hee).\n\nThere are new enemies introduced gradually, but they don't really change the gameplay very much. You still just zoom around, shooting or ramming them.\n\nYou collect coins as you progress through the game, which you can then use to upgrade your vehicle. This process is a familiar game mechanic but is also confusing. None of the upgrades tell you what exactly you're buying. I bought a new gun, and only after using it was I able to say, "Ahh, I see. This gun is way more powerful but has a slower rate of fire." But nowhere does it tell you if the power on the basic version of this gun is equal to or better than a fully upgraded version of the previous gun. I'm not much of a number cruncher, but I would still like to know the basic stats of the equipment I am buying.\n\nIf you want to go back and re-play levels (to get more coins or get a better score or something), you select "Free Play" from the single-player menu. I mention this because the campaign mode shows the entire map and doesn't let you go back to previous levels, which at first led me to believe that you were unable to revisit them.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode, which I presume would be fun to goof around in like a party game.\n\nIt only took me about three hours to buy the best equipment for my car and complete the game. I might go back and try to get a better score on previous levels, but in all honesty, the game has little to no replayability. The repetitive gameplay might be okay if there were cool new paintjobs you could buy for your car or something, but as it is, I've already bought everything in one imperfect playthrough. This game needs something, anything that would give the player an incentive to pick it up and play again.\n\nIf you can buy this game very cheap, it is definitely worth it. I had a coupon and picked it up for $1, and I definitely got more than a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it. I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that though.\n\nIf you want a good-looking, fun little arcade game to play in short sessions, you will probably like this game.\n\nIf you're expecting anything more than that, don't buy it.","March 3, 2014","false","5.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

With silly lines and a rediculous story Pressure is the type of game that really pushes you at every turn.\n\nStory:\nPressure, despite its low Metascore and rather dull describing reviews it’s actually quite a riveting game. Not too long, but fun till the end. Pressure has a rather funny, but very simple story. Pressure is about a young man who lives by a lake awakening to all the water being stolen. Who is the culprit you may ask? Well none other than an evil Sauna genius who decided to charge all of the community to use the lakes water from his sauna. In order to retrieve this water back from the depths of the evil sauna you must race through rivers, cliffs, mountains, buildings, and railways in order to defeat the evil geniuses waves of monsters.\n\nGameplay:\nThe levels are not timed with an actual timer, but rather a pressure gauge. As time moves on, the more you are hit, or as you progress through the course you gain or lose pressure. If the gauge goes to zero your car conks out and you lose the match. On the other hand if your car gets too shot up it can take extensive damage and blow up. So in order to win the race you need to go fast, avoid the bullets, and kill all the enemies. The game allows you to boost unlimited times, with each car offering different boost lengths, shoot unlimited ammo with many different guns, and use power ups. This game is like a blood bath, minus the blood and adding water.\n\nResults:\nThe game isn't very difficult; it just has some interesting concepts which until you figure out how to properly use the game it seems rather difficult. With constant boosting, unlimited ammo, and nuclear weapons Pressure is a shoot 'em up racing game. Pressure offers a small campaign with multiplayer experience and brilliant high pressure (hah) action that keeps you on your toes. Don't be fooled you won't be racing against opponents in this epic as you'll be too focused on destroying everyone and everything in your way. If you like games where you can sit down for a short session and not have to dedicate too much time this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Smooth, easy gameplay\n+Smart difficulty curve\n+Simple but pleasant graphics\n+Friendly story with simple characters\n+Fast shoot 'em up gameplay\n+Loads of upgrades that allow you to customize and further boost your car.\n+Funny little story that isn't in any way inappropriate.\n+Lots of interesting baddies and boss fights to keep you interested.\n+Unlimited boosts and ammo, so you don't feel like you have to hold back.\n\nCons\n-Not a racing game\n-Enemies seem to repeat themselves after you complete the first world\n-Hints are not given randomly, but rather as you progress throughout the game\n-You cannot go back and play an old level in the campaign to grind up your car (if you are having difficulties)","February 14, 2014","true","10.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It's like eating the food that looks nice, but has a really bad taste, so people end up giving it a few bites and throwing away. Here is why I think this game is not worth your time and money.\n\nYes, I must say it's fun to shoot the enemies, but the game is made that way so you can't see anything beyond your vehicle. You just don't have time to look at your HP or Pressure which is located in the worst place possible. I have also found the main story quite rediculous as well as the rumor. I have played the game on several occasions with each session no longer than 10 minutes.\n\nLet's see what the navigation through the game is like. The mouse behaves like someone is constantly pushing it forward and making you misclick pretty much all the time. The main menu looks fine, but as soon as you progress to your garage menu everything changes, literally. The main menu is just a simple menu with the text inside the buttons. However, the garage menu goes full 3D and there is no text anymore, you may as well click everywhere to try and find the correct menu. It actually has only 2 useful buttons, so I can't see any reason why developers would make it so complex.\n\nThe graphics are interesting so is the art. I enjoyed seeing all the explosions and other stuff, everything looks belivable. Couln't see much effects on what thought. On the other hand, I have an average computer and this game gives it a lot of trouble. I am not sure why this game overheats my graphics card more than CoH2 for example, but that's how it is. What about the sound? I found music really annoying, but it's still bearable. The sound effects of explosions and the vehicles are fine. Although the characters make the sound like they are about to have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everytime they are hurt.\n\nI would say that if you do have this game, then you will probably play it about once a month for no more than 30 minutes at maximum. This is not something you want to go back to in a long time.\n\nTo sum up this whole thing, I'd say that this game has some nice art and visuals, but the gameplay is on major down side. If not on sale (80-90% off) then I would not recommend buying it, it's likely that you will regret it in the first 10 minutes of your gameplay.","January 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","3"

Game is well optimized for this (keep in mind we played local coop, with controllers connected to the same pc), game automatically picks up if another player connects, controls are never an issue with hand-held controllers, and it was simply a great coop experience!\n\nGameplay wise Pressure is lots of mindless fun. There is no racing here, the game is rather a "chicken invaders" kind of game but with cars. You upgrade your car, weapons, ram through gold earned after each race-fight, and there is enough variety. Game can be challenging, but rewarding once you pick a strategy of weapon combos and destroy everything.\n\nThere is a short story to provide a background with some cut-scenes, which are made with a light sense of humour and charm.\n\nDefinetly recommended, especially for a local coop experience.","April 21, 2014","true","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

She's not much of a gamer but we had a lot of fun with this game. There isn't much of a story but whats here is quirky and adds to the charmy style of this game.\n\nOn easy we failed. A lot. Not because the gameplay is challenging but because the pressure system is very unforgiving even on easy. Even with the many failures we could always beat a level by just replaying it and we never had to grind past levels for upgrades which I would assume is more prominant on higher difficulties. Also I should not that we didn't die from damage ever except for a few times near the end of the short game.\n\nOverall I liked this game and I got it very cheap in a weekly sale. BUT there is one con here. The gameplay is super repetitive. Even with the different weapon types and abilities it still was very repetitive. It never got to the point of the repetition being tedious or annoying, just a con.\n\nI would only recommend playing this with a friend because that's what makes this type of game enjoyable. I feel that playing by yourself will make the repetition more evident. So yeah, pick this up on a sale and play it with a friend it was a  lot of fun and there is a lot of potential difficulty here.","June 14, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It feels so slow paced. I played the first few levels and found myself bored because of the repititious level design. It's a weird vertical scrolling shooter, and you can control your own pace to even go backwards, so it feels the player is given too much power. Your most common death will most likely be from losing all your pressure from some "suckers" that steal your pressure.

Its a fun little game to waste time on, where the focus is more on killing enemies on the race track than being an actual racing game. You have health of course, and since your enemies can shoot you, you can obviously die. But, in keeping with the funny steam-punk theme, you also have pressure, which is basically your turbo, so you can speed ahead and ram enemies. You can run out of it though, so you have to keep it up by killing enemies and passing checkpoints. The different weapons, rams, power-ups, and car-bodies you unlock are pretty fun. So, overall, a fun little game...buy it if its on sale.","June 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What you see is pretty much what you get, except that's pretty much it for the whole game.  You fight a "time limit" while trying to compete in a pseudo-score attack environment while staying alive, and all of that together combined with the chaos of the hordes of enemies swarming around you is great, at least for a while.\n\nThe only thing that really changes throughout the game is how much health your enemies have and your environment.  With the proper couple of upgrades, I found myself nearly invincible and mostly just annoyed at how much health (on the enemies) that was thrown at me.  Little strategy was needed in just slamming my face into the enemies over and over to destroy them as quickly as possible, and I even binged on offense and used a low grade of defense for over half the campaign in terms of upgrades.\n\nThe camera angle doesn't allow you to effectively gather the coins, so picking those up is mostly luck.  Got an "all-ages" thing going with the pretty cringey sense of humor and honestly lame scenarios, aside from the "grand plan".  Can't say I've ever seen that before.\n\nBottom line, it's certainly worth a look and a single (pretty short) playthrough, but it doesn't have much staying power or any outstanding moments.  The 10 dollar price tag is iffy, but at least the game feels like they tried.","December 22, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sure enough, I was not disappointed when I gave it a shot myself.\n\nYou can get my first impressions of this title in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Pj8m9jle8\n* Warning: Steam though it would be a good idea to break all stereoscopic videos. Head to YT to watch it, make sure you are using Flash, not HTML5.\n\nFirst off, maybe I'll get lenient because the game works very well with Tridef Ignition in stereo-3D using the driver's 2D+depth feature (Power 3D). The game simply looks excellent with added depth perception and given its nature, it adds all that much more to the experience, even going as far as helping the game play a lot!\n\nSome can give it criticism for not having enough varied shmup features while others can find the lack of actual racing elements  sort of a letdown, for its price (even more so when it lands on sale) it actually falls very well within my expecations and the 10$ range sort of opens up tolerance for elements that may lack, but do not bring down the gameplay itself in a notable way.\n\nDon't be too surprised - this is in NO way a racing game - rather a different take on a shmup, this one being loaded with SPEEDING elements. You won't beat anything by passing rather you have to speed through the levels and defeat the enemies with your gun, not your driving. In fact you're encouraged to drive THROUGH enemies, not around them (which I find quite satisfying; the ram mechanics are funny).\n\nMy only valid criticism could be on that aspect. I see this game as a sort of buildup to what it would've actually liked to be. This is sort of the beginning of the genre and I hope they can build a sequel and attempt to experiment more with an ACTUAL racing / shmup balance. This concept would definitely benefit from more actual race-like elements and maybe a POV that gives you more of a forward view.\n\nNeedless to say, this game is definitely a lot of fun. When it comes to a Yes/No scenario - a much easier type of review to do than an actual SCOCRE - I have to give this one a "GO".","June 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The other possitive pedagogical message it teaches kids is "use the preassure in life to push yourself to sucsece" which i think its a rather better message than the understanding of the commonly used  frazes "ive been on a lot of pressure recently"  and "Quit putting pressure on me! "-which use the term preassure in a negative way.\nBut the action in the game is allaround hardly to control and doesnt require skill but looks fun. An excelent game to play with your kids and little cousins. The quests are actually made so they can be read by grownups to children and the humor is on a non verbal level which i really like cause it can be understood internationally since it uses only blabering and comic releifs. Besides kids love car-crashing games -allthou that may be the only negative conotation in the game.\nI recomend this game in the sense above.\n\n;-}\n\n\n","March 5","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/224220/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Pressure is a very polarising game. While the game mechanics itself is simple: you have this "steam" car and you need to reach the end of the course without running out of steam, and there are bazillion enemies to get in your way out to make sure you don't finish... but you can shoot them. What does that have to do with foiling a criminal mastermind's plan to create the ultimate spa by sucking up every drop of water in the river? Almost nothing.\n\nThe game plays a bit like River Raid / 1942 and similar genre with vehicles that can overtake you, vehicles started from the sidelines, stationary turrets and obstacles (that slows you down if you hit them) and so on. There are even occasional "bosses" (super-large vehicles). The only change from the formula is basically the road curves this way and that, and you need to turn, and it's isometric / top-down hybrid view.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/224220/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Pressure is a very polarising game. While the game mechanics itself is simple: you have this "steam" car and you need to reach the end of the course without running out of steam, and there are bazillion enemies to get in your way out to make sure you don't finish... but you can shoot them. What does that have to do with foiling a criminal mastermind's plan to create the ultimate spa by sucking up every drop of water in the river? Almost nothing.\n\nThe game plays a bit like River Raid / 1942 and similar genre with vehicles that can overtake you, vehicles started from the sidelines, stationary turrets and obstacles (that slows you down if you hit them) and so on. There are even occasional "bosses" (super-large vehicles). The only change from the formula is basically the road curves this way and that, and you need to turn, and it's isometric / top-down hybrid view. Your vehicle shoots only straight ahead, so aiming is a bit of a problem as you must turn the entire vehicle to aim. You do, however, have a good selection of weapons... If you managed to soak up enough gold coins on the course to afford them.\n\nThere are a lot of different things to upgrade on the vehicle, from type or grade of weapons to speed / agility of the vehicle to ramming power, and much more.

Yes, this game type has been done many times before, but the developers managed to capture enough nostalgia and fresh fun to keep things interesting throughout.\n\nYou could purchase the game early in the morning and finish at least one of the modes of it by lunchtime or early afternoon, which makes it a great thing to play if you're looking for something that you can easily get from beginning to end in a short time. Again, it has the feel of a Crash Bandicoot style game with its overt zanyness and fast-paced gameplay.\n\nThe worst thing I can honestly say about this game is that it seems to be aimed toward a certain age group and there are certain things that may be considered inappropriate for that age group. As something that can be a lot of fun for people of all ages, I did find myself being somewhat overwhelmed by the "cute" factor at times. Is this a drawback? To some it may be, I found the use of adorable artwork and funny characters to be charming in one way, and irritating in another.\n\nThe other major critique I have is in regards to the music in the game. With very little variety, you're likely to be putting the volume of it on mute and listening to your favorite album(s) in the background while playing the game itself. While this may not seem like a big deal, a soundtrack can lend a great deal toward my overall interest in replaying a game\n\nIn short I would give the game a 6.5 out of 10, and would bump it up a star if the soundtrack weren't so amateurish and irritating. The voice acting is funny, but it would've been nicer to have something interesting to listen to while actually inside of a level, and maybe some minibosses toward the end of each level, I don't think that other than the major bosses there's anything that could be considered a "boss" or what have you.\n\nAbout as much fun as you could pack in to 4 hours of gaming, even if repeated playthrough is a bit unlikely because of the structure and overall repetition of the game. I noticed very little difference between play modes other than getting slightly more irritated with the same things you have to keep an eye in on all of them. .","March 6, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerwanstar/recommended/224220/","kerwanstar","Kerwanstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerwanstar/","75 products in account","This is a game that your children would enjoy... provided they can learn the controls. I haven't gotten very far into it, but from what I've seen, you play a mad scientist inventor type who enjoys his life in a lakeside cabin. The game begins with an overly cartoony cutscene showing that the bad guys have drained the lake for their evil purposes. Being the only one who cares about the lake, your character rushes out to battle in a steam-powered buggy -- which is ironic due to the fact that all the water (the source of steam) has been stolen.\n\nStory aside, this game has a lot of irritations. (I wouldn't call them flaws -- the game is certainly playable, but it has minor annoyances that make the game unattractive.) The artwork is quite nice, but the humor expressed through the animation is slapstick and childish. Again, this would make a great game for children.\n\nA major irritation (at least with keyboard and mouse) is the akwardness of the controls. For one, hard turning is impossible without getting disoriented. Also, you can't shoot and drive in different directions. Your aim is locked forward, which means that you can either finish the level within the time limit or with max kills.\nSecondly, you're constantly being pushed forward. If you stop for a collectible, the enemies pass you, you can't catch up to them, and you're stuck with no pressure (fuel) and no powerups to attain more pressure.\nThird, every level is more or less the same. I understand that most games (especially level-based games like this) can't stray too far from the original concept without making the game incredibly difficult to play or incredibly difficult to program. However, it seems as though you just have to shove your way through (battering ram is the only useful upgrade) while holding "w" the whole time for every single level.\nLastly, and, arguably, most irritating, is that you can't replay levels. There comes a point in the game when you just can't go any further without upgrades. At the same time, you don't have the money for the upgrades. The only way you can get money is by completing levels, but you can't replay them. Not to mention that if I just thought level 7 was cool and wanted to replay it, I wouldn't be able to. Sorry, you can't try for a better score. Sorry, you can't gain more coins to spend on upgrades. Sorry, you can't just play through a previous level for fun.\n\nAll in all, this game can be fun if you don't get irritated by all the little nuances that make it difficult to enjoy. If you're anything like me, however, this game may provide half an hour's worth of entertainment every month or so.","August 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If there was was a 'Maybe' option I'd take that but with just a Yes/No its got to be 'No'.\n\nThis game is OK.\nIts not great, its not bad... its just kinda meh.\n\nThe game itself is quite simple: there is a single track with a few places to fall off a few ramps, jumps that down't really do anything and lots of enemies to shoot. You have 'pressure' in your car's steam engine that you use up gradually as you race down the track and you get it back again by passing the checkpoints or by killing enemies.\n\nWhere this game falls down is in driving down the course... quite a serious issue for a driving game. Its hard to keep the car going in the direction you want which is emphasized by the boosting system you need to use to be able to make the end of the track. All of this is before you add in the enormous amount of ordnance being fired by both you and the enemies. With some of the weapons there is so much flying about the screen that its really hard to keep track of where your car is and seeing turns before you get to them is almost impossible... add in enemies to that mix and I often found myself thinking I was one of the enemies.... don't get me wrong, its fast paced and fun just like a good arcade game, but like an arcade game chances are you'll only want to play it for a short time before you move on to something else.\n\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of this game is the upgrade system. Items have short 'fun' descriptions which don't really give you any idea of how worthwhile they are going to be and there is no chance to see what they do before you have committed to buying them. You can sell items later but you lose 1/4 of their worth so each time you change your mind you make the rest of the game that much harder. If only you could sell items for the same price you bought them for you could chop and change as much as you wished to try all the different options and make the best car for each track but as it is I felt button-holed into using one particular set of equipment and maximising it. After finishing the single player campaign I think I'd used 4/10 main weapons and 3/10 secondaries.\n\nIts definately a good start to a game, but more options, a greater variety of enemies and the ability to change your car at will would make this game so, so much better. I'd still get confused by the chaos on the screen but that's a forgivable flaw in an arcade style game and is probably part of the fun.","September 13, 2014","false","5.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This game is just not fun. First off, you hold down right trigger to accelerate but you also have to hold down A the entire time to fire. That would be fine, but you have to hold down A with the middle of your thumb because you have to, get this, press the X button every few seconds the entire race to get a boost, otherwise you will never make it to any checkpoints. Holding down both right trigger and A and pressing X over and over and over and over and over again the whole time kills this game dead. And that is pretty much all you do in the game and it is just not fun at all. That and the fact that you need pressure, or gas, to keep going and you get it from killing enemies. Problem is that the slightly larger enemies take way too many hits to kill so they stay on screen and shoot you for way too long. You get flooded with dozens of enemies and they have pin-point auto-aim accuracy and never stop firing. They also barely give off any pressure (gas) at all so if you don't die before a checkpoint, you run out of gas. I couldn't beat the 4th race so I said fk this. Sure with practice I could beat it, but the problem is that the game is just not fun and has poor gameplay like I described. The only good thing about it is the graphics. The music is the most stock generic awful up-tempo elevator music that you could imagine. It is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nThis game is a perfect example of the abuse of the steam rating system by complete ret@rds who don't know what a good game is.\n\nSucks/10","October 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"
