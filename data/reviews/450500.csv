Turn the seas red. Give it at least an hour; it'll reward you.\n\nIt takes some time to get to the meat of this thing. It's a very japanese affair. The translation is the best kind of bad, but it is bad nonetheless.  The menu controls eschew a lot of common convention. That said, they do work once you get used to them. Conversely, the controls during the actual game are just fine. Most of the confusion comes from the fact that a squad of aquatic laser food is inherently unintuitive.  Once you develop crustacean instincts the controls will click.\n\nThe squad mechanics are surprisingly elegant. Likewise the AI is better than you might expect. Trust your school.\n\nIf you're shopping for a squad based, 4X, seafood shooter you could do a lot worse.\n\n\n\n","April 12","true","4.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","33","39","11","0"

DO YOU NEED MORE EXPLINATION?!\n\n...Fine, I'll go into more detail.\n\nThe game is mostly about taking over reefs to expand both how many resources you can have, and increase your fish capacity. Once you have all reefs you'll be challanged by enemy schools of fish who will try to take reefs from you.\n\nthe controls can give you a bit of grief, having no way to go up or down without turning. I'd say this is its biggest shortcoming.\n\n\nCombat is tactical, its best to know exactly what you're going up against and how to approach it. You may want a large number of 'charger' fish, such as salmon, or the bulkier tuna. or you may want to bring a great white along for its massive health pool to tank. not only that, but formation matters too. Should you surround the enemy? keep your allies around yourself? if you don't even know where they are, you might as well go with 'fire at will'.\n\nSuitable for wasting a little time, like passing a lunch break, or if your in the mood for something more longterm than the little rouge-lite you normally play. (Note: I'm not saying it takes a lunch break to complete, I'm saying its probably going to hold your attention for 15-45 minuets at a time.)","April 8","true","7.2"," 100 of 177 people (56%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","56","100","177","46","1"

How could a game where you play as a laser-fish get a positive review? So naturally (with Steams refunding as backup) I gave it a go. Somehow I immediately fell in love with it: it's laser-fish! What seemed stupid at the time became the greatest thing about the game.\n\nI kept playing, and the more I played, the more I enjoyed it. Some madman (or woman) has come up with this idea and found the backing to create it (and something this silly that's no small feat!) The effort that has been put into this was amazing, dozens of times as many species to discover, murder with laser-fish-eyes, and become; and an ocean far bigger than I still give it credit for, both in width and depth. (A delightful surprise when I killed a certain squid and entered the reef it guarded!! Still wrapping my mind around that!!)\n\n\nOnly problem I have, and the problem is miniscule compared to the many, many good things I have to say, is that the movement could be a lot smoother, with some easier way of moving up and down in the water. Trying to turn to blow up a crab with homing missile laser things and finding that your school has already killed it can get a bit repetitive.\n\n(And maybe an expanded upgrade system? Like you don't start with all the weapons you do? Or can unlock new ones? Something like that anyway but don't worry if not, just a tough.)\n\n\nAll-in-all, this game was..... IS.... a delightful surprise and I really do reccomend it; it's just the right kind of stupid that everyone can enjoy at some level so big, BIG thumbs up from me.\n\nEnjoy :)","April 11","true","3.5"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","8","20","3","0"

But I played a good hour or two while at a friends house.\n\nSo what is this game? Well. You start by choosing an animal that represents you. A sardine... A salmon... Or the mighty crab. You go around with your squad of fish, shooting lazers at your enemies and taking over their reefs. When you kill enemies you gain different types of materials that you can use to breed different types of animals for your group. Each type have different stats and weapons, so theres a reason to try out different combinations of creatures.\n\nIt's a fun silly game. Reminds me a lot of Tokyo Jungle but in the sea. The complaints I do have though is that, since the game is REALLY Japanese. Some of the translations are bad and the controller support isn't great. The performance of the game also seems pretty poor with how basic of a game it is. Other than that.
