Of course, you’re paying a fraction of the price here, but it’s important to know that the amount of enjoyment you’ll derive from it will take a hit as well.The game is an entry-level platformer that will appeal more to younger children with its simple design and, with the exception of some challenging final levels, it's quite easy. I would quickly and wholeheartedly recommend this game anyone from 5 to 55. But for others looking for something a little deeper and more challenging, you may want to continue searching.","October 29, 2014","true","1.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","0"

Loading Screens - on PC the game starts up in a mere 3- 4 seconds. Wii U it takes almost 15 seconds.. even being at 720p while 1080p on PC.\n\nProblem #2. Better Controller on PC - The Xbox 360 Controller is a little tighter than the Wii U Gamepad does in some parts But if you use the Pro Controller while playing it feels better.\n\nProblem #3. Glitches on Wii U - Certain very weird glitches on the Wii U version happened to me alot. One of them was when touching a certain part of the sky leaves would be falling. Leaves only fall from a tree in the game but there was no tree insight or close enough. PC Has no such problems when you go through a tree leaves fall and looks good.\n\nProblem #4. Cheaper on PC than Wii U - PC version only costs (as of 10-26-2014) $6.79 while on Wii U it charges you another $1.00 for tax while still being $7.99 so over $9.00 for the game. Nintendo please stop charging for TAX on a game Steam Sony and Microsoft do not charge TAX on anything on there stores please stop charging for TAX.\n\nOtherwise fun game very easy but anyone can play it and think of Little Big Planet and Paper Mario mashed together.\n\n8/10","October 26, 2014","true","0.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

It's certainly one of the better looking games I've seen this year and I love the art style and theme. It delivers everything you would expect from a classic platform game and more. - Worth checking out!","October 28, 2014","true","0.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I was failing tutorial.  And my fails brought me to bug in tutorial. There is red mushroom witch should help you to jump over abyss, but if you fail you might start 'never ending fall'. Its not fun at all to bump in such bugs.\n\nSo i played more, skiped tutorial. And found out that falling through floor while jumping is pretty common. Somethimes it hapens to specific places, somethimes it happens when you start at check-point, it just falls through. At this state, for me it is unplayable :( pretty sad. I cant recommend this game even if its graphic is pretty enjoyable. I guess devs didnt found enough time to polish it.\n\nI wish devs will look into it.","June 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","8","16","3","0"

The game is essentially a combination of Super Mario platforming gimmicks with the art style and music of LittleBigPlanet with the storyline of Sonic.\n\nIncidentally from Mario:     in each stage, there are three big collectables you can get\nthere is an overworld that links the stages\n100 buttons makes a life\ngrassland, water land, ice land, lava land, etc.\nyou stomp on enemies to remove them\n… and MORE!\n\nThe near non-existant storyline is that Dr. Robotnik Bowser? is turning innocent wildlife into monsters and Sonic the nameless box protagonist is going to stop him.\n\nFurthermore the game has a lot of bugs which makes it very frustrating to play. In the short time I’ve played this game, I’ve encountered numerous bugs which demonstrates a lack of testing. The most popular being the sudden absence of the health bar which renders your character immune to death. Several times, the protagonist will be able to pass through pipes (the warp area) and end up in the void. I’ve also encountered a bug where the stage wouldn’t end because the game wouldn’t recognize that I was in the end area.\n\nSo really the only cutting that the creators of Papers Monsters Recut have done were the corners of ingenuity, originality, and game design.\n","July 18, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

But after having played the terrible platformer "clash of puppets", having a platformer that works was welcome. Tight controls. Levels use similar layouts and mechanics. Uses same music over. Enemies all look the same, lack of variety. Hub work confusing and unorganized. Hitboxes can be somewhat off. Cute look and asthetic.

That time was when every game wanted to be the next Super Mario. The is not inherently a bad thing. There's monsters to jump on coins errr....buttons and paper clips to collect.  A very nostalgic blend of running, jumping and discovering hidden areas. The contolrs are tight and sometimes require precision jumps but hey it's a platformer, right? The look is a blend of Sonic's Green Hill Zone, Super Mario level 1-1 and Little Big Planet.  It's simple, it's charming and it's like your favorite pair of jeans. Sure they have some holes and the legs are fraying at the cuffs but they fit and they still lookl preety cool. Paper Monsters Recut is pure, simple fun.","January 13","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
