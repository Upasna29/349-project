It has the dated charm of the 00's and lacks the impressive graphics of later Total War games, but it is my contention that this game is a great one in its own right.\n\nOne might think that the only reason to get the game is for nostagia's sake. And there is no denying that a significant percentage of the purchases will probably come from old players. The advantage of this copy compared to the old one that you might still own is that it is now compatible mith modern operating systems. I am personnally using windows 7 and have had no problems playing a few turns in the campaign and winning a custom battle. Moreover, the price tag is quite reasonable.\n\nThe game is 13 years old and the graphics are no longer up to today's standards. They still have a certain charm to them and it does not prevent having fun at all. In addition, the game offers 4 different campaigns - 3 European ones, set at different starting dates and a viking campaign set in the Britich Isles, whichs allows considerable replayability.\n\nHowever, the game is much more than just a means to satiate your nostalgia, which is why I spent hundreds of hours playing it in the first place, more than ten years ago. The game is different from all Total War games that would follow (only bearing resamblance to its predecessor Shogun), mainly regarding the campaign map. It uses a Risk-like campaign map, which means that movement is much more restrained. This allows for totally different campaign dynamics and really gives a fresh feel to the campaign, at least for Total War veterans who are not used to this campaign-style. One of the main advantages of this system is that it is much simpler and the AI can therefore cope with it significantly better than with the totally open campaign of later iterations. This makes the campaign both fun and challenging, as defeat becomes a very real possibility.\n\nRegarding battles, the principles applied in later iterations were already present in Medieval and the most interesting feature is that there are lots of historical battles, grouped in different historical campaigns (100 years war, Saladin, Lionheart,...). Playing those historical campaigns gives a nice sense of progression and is quite rare in later iterations (Fall of the Samurai being the only later game to have a historical campaign).\n\nAfter explaining the pros and cons of the game, I hope that I could convey the particular feel of this game, and I can only commend this game to those who want a different Total War experience!","June 26, 2015","true","10.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","2"

Let me list a few events that were odd:\n\n1. Managed to declare a crusade against the papacy. I was excommunicated, but rewarded by el pope when I won.\n\n2. I destroyed france, but one of the princes escaped and rebuilt the French kingdom. In Cyprus.\n\n3. The peasants of scotland revolted, but the garrison in my small hillfort consisting of 100 fellow peasants held out for four years.\n\n4. My young daughter Elizabeth kept trying to get married, but every prince in europe denied her hand. So she was married to a welsh lord I bribed to join our kingdom and forfeit wales. I made him prince of wales, but his son started a civil war for the crown and I let him win. England is now ruled by the welsh.\n\n5. The Kingdom of england grew to encompass nearly all of france, germany, britain, and north italy, but we were still only the english kings.\n\n6. My best king was Stephen II, who took the crown at 15 and ruled for 47 years. He was a fearsome and dreadful ruler, who sacked Paris and Rome in his lifetime, as well as destroying the French, Spanish, and German peoples. He was rich and beloved by all people, and died at the ripe old age of 62. His son, William III, took the crown at 28 and ruled for 4 years before he died of disease. So ended the line of Stephen II.\n\nOverall, my best game has to have been as the english in the high middle ages start. I made King John a great king rather than an evil one, and he managed to bring the french to the point of extinction, and pummeled the excommunicated germans in a bloody crusade for Burgundy, which they had taken from French hands. My only ally at this point is Denmark, which only hold the three scandanavian provinces, but remain staunch supporters of the English monarchy, though we are very close cousins who inbreed constantly to maintain the alliances.\n\nSo yeah a fun game I guess","December 21, 2015","true","19.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","18","19","13","0"

For its price, I think it's a good deal of fun, and there are plenty of features in it that I wasn't fully expecting to be there, given its age and how CA keeps altering features from title to title; for example, you can already ambush units on the battlefield and ranged units on higher terrain have increased range here.\n\nThe only thing that can be a bit iffy to get used to - other than the aged but nevertheless stylish graphics - are the controls, as you can't drag-select troops, placing troops on top of each other occasionally means you instead select the wrong unit and you use left mouse button both for selecting and giving orders like move orders. Another plus I liked, is the music and the battle sounds, like the screams and squeals in the melee sound like very genuine horror. I was also able to have it in 1920x1080, which is nice.","July 6, 2015","true","13.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Changing it to virtually any other resolution (on the strategy map) stopped the crashes.\n\nThis was kind of an unexpected solution since I assumed the crashes were being caused by invading armies.  The reason I assumed this was that you could get it to "put off" the inevitable crash by changing your mind on an invasion and withdrawing your troops, or using them to invade another province.  After a while, though, it would crash even if you hadn't moved to invade at the end of the turn and there was no way you could delay it.\n\nOver the moon that this game is finally available on Win 8.1!","July 25, 2015","true","77.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/345260/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Medieval: Total War is a game I spend hundreds of hours on in my gaming youth. For the time, the graphics were amazing (and are still charming today), while the game-play was addicting. Up until a few months ago, I still had the disc version installed on my computer, and knew a number of tricks and hax to get the game to function without crashing every other turn. So when I saw that the game had been released on Steam with the promise of new patches and upgrades, I had to get it and see for myself if there were any improvements.\n\nSo how does the game run? Very well. Load times are massively reduced. Ten hours in, and not a single crash (auto-save is enabled). Wide-screen resolutions actually work; the game plays flawlessly in 1080p . A slight downside: the on-screen text gets REALLY small at higher resolutions; the game also ran flawlessly in 1440p, but the text was so tiny I was worried about eye-strain. Also strange: if you select “wide screen” in the options menu, the battles play out with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. If you select “full screen”, the black bars are gone and the battlefield takes up the entire screen (which is what I wanted anyway).\n\nThe Medieval: Total War is one of the classic strategy titles for a reason. You'll build your armies and manage your economy, while trying to establish an empire – one faction to rule them all! There are a lot things Medieval: Total War does that the sequels (starting with the very next Total War game, the first Rome TW) simply don't have. Like faction respawning. Think you've wiped a faction from the map? Not likely; the next rebellion  may spawn several massive armies in your heartland with a message like “A long-lost heir from a faction presumed destroyed is trying to reclaim his throne.” Even better, if a rival destroyed a faction, send in spies and assassins to wreak havoc and cause a revolt, in the hopes of the faction respawning in your enemy's territory, giving you the perfect opportunity to strike. Other factions emerge at specific times, like the Burgundians and the Swiss; each field some new troop types that cause a variety of problems. Putting an effort into building trading routes pays dividends, awarding huge amounts of cash if you can protect your trading routes. Conserving money and investing in the right technologies at the right time can produce an unstoppable army; spending too much too soon may give you powerful troops, but no cash to pay them. Loyalty will decline, and the troops might even rebel. Failing a crusade or jihad, or your king dying will seriously impact army loyalty - at least until the new king shows himself to be a strong leader.\n\nThe battle AI is actually smart, trying to flank with cavalry, or keep you at a distance to pelt your army to death with arrows. Say you've struggled to beat most of an Egyptian army; there's just four more units located on the other side of that sand dune. Your now-exhausted troops trudge up to the ridge, ready to turn and run at the first surprise, and... those four units are all Ghulam Bodyguards. Well, you're screwed. Your own greed will defeat you time and again in battle. Balance your armies, choose good defensive positions, attack with careful timing, and send your troops in pursuit of a fleeing enemy with prudence. A sudden influx of enemy reinforcements could rout the units you sent in pursuit, which could turn the tide of the battle against you.\n\nThe Steam version of Medieval: Total War is exactly the game that I remember from before, now with faster load times and wide-screen resolutions. This might be my nostalgia talking, but the game stands as one of the greatest and best Total War titles, despite its age. Don't hesitate to grab this one.","November 27, 2015","true","22.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I haven't experienced a single bug or crash with this setup.\n\nMedieval 1 is, for me, the best of the Total War series. The risk-style campaign map offers the best strategising compared to the 3D campaign maps in the follow up games, which the AI never managed to properly make use of.\n\nHere, it is a cutthroat, tense battle of wills at each end of game turn as you wait to see if a faction sends their giant army stacks into your territories. Many tough decisions have to be made when it comes to balancing your forces. It's perfectly streamlined and never gets bogged down.\n\nThe battles, too, are superior to the follow up games. Units take their time climbing hills, slowly whittling eachother down in combat, allowing proper tactical changes during battles. You truly feel like a general directing a battle, unlike the 5 minute mass brawls of Rome/Med2 which ended up resembling some Benny Hill inspired, fast forwarded mess.\n\nThe game engenders that feeling of intrigue and epic storytelling more than any other TW.\n\nSo, if you feel your PC setup can get it running properly, I heartily recommend picking this up. It's arguably one of the very best PC games of all time and still holds up remarkably well.","April 12","true","29.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Saved games work in the new resolution.\nNow on to a very quick review since I'm mostly just posting a fix for the crashes\n\nEdit: deidaraakatski was kind enough to let me know that checking the disable tool tips from the pull out menu on the campain map also helps. Before I did that I was getting some game crashes before larger battles. I've had no crashes since I changed that option.\n\nI am not a huge RTS fan and find the total war games from Medieval 2 on to be more mob rules then real strategy. The battles of Medieval are slow compaired to newer titles. You start with oponents very far from one another allowing you to adjust and readjust formations before the armies clash. This won't be everyones idea of fun, but I enjoy the challange of trying to win the tough battles or even just keep my sides casulties down.\nThe main negative for me is the naval battles that seem to be random chance. Bigger navy, better odds. Otherwise a game that I greatly enjoy. The small details like the names of the ruling houses and the generals, and the historical events that happen during play give the game a very nice feel.","March 22","true","175.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steelofballs/recommended/345260/","steelofballs","Osse Rota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steelofballs/","278 products in account","Sometimes superficially compared to Risk because of its use of "Regions" and armies that occupy them in the strategic aspect of the game; Medieval: Total War is, like Shogun: Total War before it, a very unique sort of game. You play as a sort of "animating spirit" of a nation and guide it on to glory, honor, and conquest across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Gameplay involves two main aspects: the Campaign Map and the Battles that are fought to resolve military actions on campaign.\n\nIn the Campaign Map you have armies, agents, regions, and the castles in regions.\n\nYou make economic choices such as the risk management of the unrest that higher taxation causes, which buildings are most beneficial to a region's income and whether or not you can protect the investment in that region, and whether you want to leave your titles of land to the men who are most loyal, leave them to the men who can manage the agriculture the best, or wait for the uncommon man who fits both criteria and will be a true asset to your rich interior regions.\n\nBut along with economy and land come those who covet it, and war that claims lives and land is part of the game. Your military infrastructure permits your recruitment of navies and armies, and your military strategy regarding the movement of those armies is just as important as if not more so than your military tactics regarding battles. To defeat an army of your strength in a clean victory that pushes him back to another region is one thing. To completely outmaneuver him, annihilate the majority of his forces in detail, and leave his pathetic remnants holed up in their keeps in lands they no longer control is another, and the difference is when and where you fight your battles.\n\nIn the real time battles things are much more straightforward: you have your men, they have theirs, and not everyone who enters the battlefield is leaving it.\n\nAnalyze your troop composition, analyze their composition, analyze the terrain near yourself, analyze the terrain near them. Do you wait for them to make the first move, and act upon what they are committing to? Do you take the initiative yourself, hoping for (or in the best case, assured of) getting an advantage that will take you a step closer to victory?\n\nYour units have their own varied personalities. Sometimes they fight you. The impetuous feudal knights who charge home into the enemy may plainly refuse to disengage on your order or, in the worst case, attempt to and fail as they are cut down because only a portion of them followed the order. Highlanders ready and willing to slaughter are themselves not so stiff of character and from just a volley or two or archer fire may break and flee as their pathetic discipline proves to be their downfall. After you lose this battle, those very same highlanders may prove themselves to be your greatest asset as the enemy pursues you and your men charge downhill out of the woods, slaughtering and turning the enemy mass in the face of such raw force.\n\nTo conclude, Medieval: Total War is certainly a unique game and a satisfying one if you appreciate a test of both your strategic and tactical skills. I recommend if you play this game to avoid savescumming every turn to outmaneuver enemy armies. It takes a lot of the challenge out of the strategy when you know exactly what your opponent is going to do next when he cannot do the same with you.","March 30","true","176.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game had a ton of bugs on newer OS's and hardware becuase it just didn't support the new stuff rendering the game unplayable for some. I was so happy when I saw this game added to Steam this year and I bought it thinking they have updated it to work on Modern day OS and hardware considering the system requirements on steam are Windows vista, 7 and 8 when the original requirements were something like Windows 95 to XP.\n\nAnyway I got this game after reading steams reccomended specs believing it will work on my system...nope exactly the same problems as the original game I bought on CD all those years ago. Alls they have done here is copied the original CD and added it to steam and lied about the system requirements...I contacted Sega support since the game would not work for me and they told me these system requirements on steam are wrong becuase the game was developed before the release of Vista, 7 and 8 etc and has not had any updates since the release of these OS's therfore they do not officially support this game since I'm using an unsuporrted operating system for this game. The most they would do is tell me to run it in compatibility mode for Windows XP or earlier, which is unnacceptable since I already bought the game full price all those years ago, then read the steam system requirements believing it has been patched and bought it again a second time to find out it's pretty much identical to my old copy... sorry sega, but I'm going for a refund.. Please we just want one patch for this game which makes it support the newer OS's and Hardware.\n\nI know some people have played this game with success still and no errors...but unfortunately some get these bugs like me becuase of the combination of unsupported hardware and OS which can either make the game unplayable or ruin your experience. Just keep this in mind when considering this game.\n\nI would reccomend this if Modern day hardware and OS was supported and it didn't cosntantly crash or bug out becuase of that... even though I got it to work, I feel I need a refund still as the next Driver update for my GPU or OS update could easily break this game like it did on my last system when I got the old cd copy to work :/","November 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(CDs got scratched up, lost or borrowed and never returned) That alone is a good enough idea of how good this is. Invested at least a few thousand hours over the years, and I can't say that for any other total war. It's no where near as stylish as the new ones graphically, but, that's to be expected.\nThe gameplay on the strategic map is the best. Possibly one of the best ai that they've made. They will send a lot of assassins after your agents, sneak spies around and try to take away a general teetering on the edge of rebellion and make some surprising attacks. The pope is kind of , to put it mildly, the brown eye in everybody's rear. He'll excommunicate you in a heartbeat. The early game consists of mass stacks of peasants and archers, eventually leading to pretty diversified armies later in the game. The ai is prone to making "specialized" armies on occasion, however, in those situations they're usually attack with 3+ armies. The viking invasion expansion is a smaller campaign that's just as good as the early, high, late period campaigns with some different mechanics/building trees and some different standard of units.\n\nBattle controls come off as aged compared to this day and age, but you won't be losing many battles due to clunky controls. You may run into path finding issues, which has always been a problem with the series for the most part. Seiges get epic later on in the game with you having to breach several layers of walls under archer/early musket fire. Artillery is really only effective during sieges until about mid way through the game when you start to get the more impressive pieces of machinery. Armies are generally well balanced, however, an army of gothic knights with crossbows/archers can just wreck face left and right if used properly. It can still be countered, just with a more specialized army.\n\nOn the modern systems, this will run quite well. I have windows 7, never had a problem with the disks and I don't expect any problems on here. I will say, 1920x1080 resolution makes the interface incredibly small and a bit laggy. Best off played at 1280x800 or so just to have the interface and text be able to be read without having to get right up to the monitor. If you played it back when it came out, you won't notice a difference in much of a performance from then compared to now. If anything, battles are more stable when there's 4k units battling it out compared to how it was way back.\n\nFor 10 bucks, you honestly can't go wrong for a great classic strategy game. If you still have the disks, buy it anyways just so you won't have to worry about it being gone forever.","July 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

How many? 15. Crazy, right?\n+ Sure the graphics are pixelated and old, but it doesn't strain the eyes that much.\n+ Vices and Vurtues are actually important (unlike in other TW games).\n+ Stomping around the campaign map is like hardcore chess.\n+Autosaves. I'm listing it because 1) crashes (see below), and 2) old games didn't always have these.\n\n- Random crashes, although when I reload they sometimes happen again when performing the same action. Dunno why.\n- Map can get cluttered, especially in small provinces.\n- Can sometimes be difficult to figure out what's affecting a province's faith/happiness/income in which ways.\n- Occasionally annoying ocean movement (no indicator if you can/can't ferry troops across the sea).\n\nIf you never played TW, it may be a bit obtuse at times but its honestly not that hard.\nIf you've played the newer ones, this sure as hell ain't like those.

For me, it required a resolution change.\n\nStill my favorite of the Total War games.\n\nThe map in this one (and the original Shogun) functions more like Risk than later games.

It works brilliantly on my computer and I changed the resolution straight away after reading other reviews.\n\nWhat a stroke of genius updating this game for modern computers. I was annoyed when I finally could not play this game due to Windows updates. I still have the original boxed game complete with instructions and technology tree. They have not just made it work but they have added some extra features too. For instance, when you besiege a castle you will now take casualties if you dont assault it.\n\nNo point going on about the graphics, its an old game. I spent hours on it years ago because the strategic element is what it is all about. Think of it as a board game  and it will satisfy you. I bought Rome Total War when I could no longer use this but it just does not measure up to this in my opinion.

So happy to see it on Steam.\n\n\nPros -\nThe setting is fascinating and really well implemented. Every faction, region and unit type has a unique personality that is reflective of actual history.\nThe music and sound effects are pretty simple but nonetheless do an incredible job of establishing the setting and really add to the game's personality and charm.\nI love the 'Risk' style campaign map.\nThe core TW gameplay is as enjoyable as ever.\n\nCons -\nThe interface has not aged well, it's usable but hardly intuitive, hotkeys are lacking and WASD navigation of the campaign map isn't possible.\nThe graphics are obviously sub-par by today's standards, this is particularly noticeable in battles. On the campaign map I personally I think the muddiness of it all adds to the medieval charm :-p\n\n\nI highly recommend this game, the minor flaws are completely outweighed by the huge number of positives. I have encountered no stability issues thus far but I'll be sure to update this review if I do.\n\n\n","June 30, 2015","true","30.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For any players who played MTW2, you would really want to press the emergency escape button and stay in MTW2.

But by the same coin, I don't think there is another game that I can say is better than it.\n\nWhat the original MTW does really well is the campaign. I don't care much for the battles, as later Total War games have greatly improved on them (particularly the first Rome), so I personally never do battles manually in MTW. But the beauty of the game is that it is a lot of fun without doing the battles at all. I am sure that there are many who love the battles, which is fine, but this review is from the perspective of a pure campaigner.\n\nOne reason you can skip battles is that the autocomplete is very fair - if you have the superior army, you will win, and casualties will be reasonable. If you have similar armies, it is a dice toss. This is different from later Total War games, where even a battle between 1000 men against 100 men needs to be resolved manually, because higher difficulty settings will attribute unreasonable losses against the human player, even though the battle would be trivial and boring to do manually.\n\nBecause of the fair autocomplete, you do not need to do dozens of repetive unbalanced battles, which seem to bog down each successive Total War Game more than the last. MTW is much more fast-paced, and if you do want to manually complete battles, you can focus just on the interesting ones. If you don't want to autocomplete battles, then the game becomes one of pure campaign strategy, which is fast-paced due to the lack of interruptions from manual battles.\n\nAdding to the fast pace of the game is the fact that you are moving armies from province to province in the same way that you would move around pieces in checkers. It is not as realistic as in later Total War Games, but it makes things a lot faster - no slow 20-turn marches across the Russian Steppes to take a minor settlement, as in newer TW games. And you are less likely to return to a save file if you get defeated, because you don't need to go through the same tedium again.\n\nAnother aspect that makes the game fast is that you can move an army from a province with a port to any province in the world that you have an uncontested line of naval control too. This greatly speeds up the endgame, and gives you the most tangible reward for naval power in any TW game. There are some kinks in the mechanic (I'll talk about them later), but it is a fun and interesting mechanic if nothing else.\n\nOk, so what I have gotten to so far is that the game is designed to be fast-paced, and playable just on the campaign map. The map itself has a very clean and attractive aesthetic for what it is, and I never bore of staring at it while I play. The music is excellent. There is a well-developed building tree, and a very good economic structure. It is balanced enough so that a good player playing at the appropriate difficulty setting for his skill will be neither too broke nor unreasonably wealthy.\n\nThere is a large variety of units that are available, though you will probably focus on recruiting a particular type of mid-range infantry if you are concentrating on auto-battles. This is a possible weakness of the game, because you are essentially building basic armies in the same way you do in Risk, since the auto-complete give little consideration for spear-beats-horse type combinations. But this doesn't matter much if you are not doing manual battles, and it is fun experimenting with the building trees of different factions to determine the most cost-effective and technically feasible main battle infantry to try to build recruiting buildings for.\n\nWhat is perhaps best about the game is that the weighting of the difficulty settings is done very well. An amatuer player on medium can probably complete the campaign in just a bit more time than an experienced player can complete expert difficulty. In many other games, increasing difficulty means slapping more health bars onto the AI, or removing your resources, or do any one of many things that just makes the game more annoying. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that MTW simply gives more resources to the enemies, so that they can expand more aggressively. They feel more and more human, so it is more satisfying to overcome them.\n\nThere are some things about the game that will really put some people off at first. In particular, it is notorious for having a number of mechanisms that can put your whole empire into rebellion with little notice, especially near the end of the game. You will have everything in hand, then you will realize that half your empire wants to rebel (you hold shift for a summary of public order, and half the map has gone from green to red!). You try to settle things down, but a number of provinces rebel. But many of the rebels are not ordinary rebels - they are factions you have defeated reemerging, usually with 4 massive armies that are going to need a concerted effort to defeat. In an instant, all is lost, and it is frustrating because it seems random.\n\nIt isn't random though. An expert player knows all the tricks. The main culprit is usually your king's influence. The closer the line of communication between your king and a province, the higher the public order. Influence can take a shortcut across oceans if you have a pure line of naval communication. So if you control all the seas and your king is at a province with a port, there will be a big public order boost almost everywhere. But if that influence is broken for a second, everything can fall apart. If your king dies, the heir will pop up in your most important city, which may no longer be your capital. So if you capture Constantinople and it has no port, then your king dies, your heir will probably appear there, and you will have a public order crisis until you can get him somewhere better. Another possibility is that you start a war with a small nation that has a navy. Even if your navy is vastly superior, if there are any contested waters breaking your line of communication, expect rebellions. So if Spain has one ship in the straights of Gibralter and you have a dozen when war breaks out, you are still going to have rebellions at least until the next turn when you sink that ship. And since they might be building another ship that will appear next turn, or maybe the ship they have is fast and they intend to move it to the next province before you can hit it, it might not be so simple to solve this problem. You can also have the same naval problems if a storm sinks one of your ships, so it's always good to have at least 2 in every sea. A final problem too is that some factions have a tendency to split in two when an heir rebels, even if your empire is healthy, so you may want to keep your heirs in the same army as your king, just to be safe.\n\nThe above issues are frustrating, but there are always ways around them. Some of them are a little cheap (I shamelessly go back to a saved game when I lose too many naval battles, because they are more luck-based, and I don't want it to affect the main game), but most of them are just being careful (keep your king in a good position, don't overextend your navy, aggresively take down nations with strong navies, etc), and there is a certain degree of pride when you can overcome all these challenges.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is an excellent game. It's challenging and fair, and it's one that I never tire of. I start playing this game again at least once per year, every year, and I am glad that it is finally here on Steam!","November 2, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zero problems with the game. I just put the resolution up in the graphics menu and that was that. The AI is one of the best in the Total War games, especially with the introduction of the Vikings in Viking Invasion. The atmosphere is brooding and the contours of the land are very nice on the eye. The units look a bit dated now but once you get fighting then you forget that.\n\nYou can easily get beaten by the AI on the batttlefield as you come across superior troops, more men, and crazy berserkers. It can be a little arcade-like at times with 300 peasants fighting 6 berserkers but you need to apply good battlefield strategy to overcome these problems...\n\nThe enemy AI is very reactive - unlike in Rome/Medieval 2 whereby troops will just sit and take archer fire, in this game you will get charged off the field more often than not as the enemy tries to counter you quite forceably. Very good fun and every battle can be significant and is often decided in one moment..\n\nPS The other great thing about the game is how you can fight two different armies on the battlefield like the Vikings and the rebels. Trying to position yourself in the right way while taking on two different enemies is really exciting. You often don't have a clue how the battles are going to turn out.","September 6, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before a time when the series became so bloated and feature saturated, we had a game where every fundamental Total War mechanic was present and made sense. Battle map speed, AI and morale. Campaign map immersion, music, elegance and clarity.\n\nYou can assign titles to generals and develop them as characters. You can manage an entire empire by dragging and dropping chess-like strategy pieces with maximum overview. Want to invade a region? Just pick up your armies and put them on the enemy's territory. And with an extremely satisfying "BOOM" sound effect too!\n\nThe AI works better in this game due to not having to manage pathfinding on a vast map like in Rome Total War and onward. If the enemy has troops in a province or attacks you, those are the armies you have to fight - every time. No micro stacks wandering about aimlessly. MTW allows massive battles to take place thanks to its very structure.\n\nBattle mode looks outdated and clunky, but has several things going for it that other Total War titles often lack. Proper collision between troops means that a heavy and formidable unit can push back and scatter an inferior peasant militia. Arrows have a proper physics system that's based on elevation, line of sight and unit depth - archers should be placed in 2-3 ranks and given a clear line of sight to their target.\n\nThis is on top of the atmosphere that gives the game an ominous medieval feel that fits perfectly, and that perhaps only Total War: Attila comes close to out of all the games in the franchise.\n\nThere's even mods!\n\n10/10 a true classic.","October 12, 2015","true","51.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And you are less likely to return to a save file if you get defeated, because you don't need to go through the same tedium again.\n\nAnother aspect that makes the game fast is that you can move an army from a province with a port to any province in the world that you have an uncontested line of naval control too. This greatly speeds up the endgame, and gives you the most tangible reward for naval power in any TW game. There are some kinks in the mechanic (I'll talk about them later), but it is a fun and interesting mechanic if nothing else.\n\nOk, so what I have gotten to so far is that the game is designed to be fast-paced, and playable just on the campaign map. The map itself has a very clean and attractive aesthetic for what it is, and I never bore of staring at it while I play. The music is excellent. There is a well-developed building tree, and a very good economic structure. It is balanced enough so that a good player playing at the appropriate difficulty setting for his skill will be neither too broke nor unreasonably wealthy.\n\nThere is a large variety of units that are available, though you will probably focus on recruiting a particular type of mid-range infantry if you are concentrating on auto-battles. This is a possible weakness of the game, because you are essentially building basic armies in the same way you do in Risk, since the auto-complete give little consideration for spear-beats-horse type combinations. But this doesn't matter much if you are not doing manual battles, and it is fun experimenting with the building trees of different factions to determine the most cost-effective and technically feasible main battle infantry to try to build recruiting buildings for.\n\nWhat is perhaps best about the game is that the weighting of the difficulty settings is done very well. An amatuer player on medium can probably complete the campaign in just a bit more time than an experienced player can complete expert difficulty. In many other games, increasing difficulty means slapping more health bars onto the AI, or removing your resources, or do any one of many things that just makes the game more annoying. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that MTW simply gives more resources to the enemies, so that they can expand more aggressively. They feel more and more human, so it is more satisfying to overcome them.\n\nThere are some things about the game that will really put some people off at first. In particular, it is notorious for having a number of mechanisms that can put your whole empire into rebellion with little notice, especially near the end of the game. You will have everything in hand, then you will realize that half your empire wants to rebel (you hold shift for a summary of public order, and half the map has gone from green to red!). You try to settle things down, but a number of provinces rebel. But many of the rebels are not ordinary rebels - they are factions you have defeated reemerging, usually with 4 massive armies that are going to need a concerted effort to defeat. In an instant, all is lost, and it is frustrating because it seems random.\n\nIt isn't random though. An expert player knows all the tricks. The main culprit is usually your king's influence. The closer the line of communication between your king and a province, the higher the public order. Influence can take a shortcut across oceans if you have a pure line of naval communication. So if you control all the seas and your king is at a province with a port, there will be a big public order boost almost everywhere. But if that influence is broken for a second, everything can fall apart. If your king dies, the heir will pop up in your most important city, which may no longer be your capital. So if you capture Constantinople and it has no port, then your king dies, your heir will probably appear there, and you will have a public order crisis until you can get him somewhere better. Another possibility is that you start a war with a small nation that has a navy. Even if your navy is vastly superior, if there are any contested waters breaking your line of communication, expect rebellions. So if Spain has one ship in the straights of Gibralter and you have a dozen when war breaks out, you are still going to have rebellions at least until the next turn when you sink that ship. And since they might be building another ship that will appear next turn, or maybe the ship they have is fast and they intend to move it to the next province before you can hit it, it might not be so simple to solve this problem. You can also have the same naval problems if a storm sinks one of your ships, so it's always good to have at least 2 in every sea. A final problem too is that some factions have a tendency to split in two when an heir rebels, even if your empire is healthy, so you may want to keep your heirs in the same army as your king, just to be safe.\n\nThe above issues are frustrating, but there are always ways around them. Some of them are a little cheap (I shamelessly go back to a saved game when I lose too many naval battles, because they are more luck-based, and I don't want it to affect the main game), but most of them are just being careful (keep your king in a good position, don't overextend your navy, aggresively take down nations with strong navies, etc), and there is a certain degree of pride when you can overcome all these challenges.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is an excellent game. It's challenging and fair, and it's one that I never tire of. I start playing this game again at least once per year, every year, and I am glad that it is finally here on Steam!","November 2, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bottom line, this game may or may not work on your windows 10 system.\n\nThat being said, I think this game is a classic. It far simpler than some of the newer Total War titles, but it makes it easier for RTS newbies such as myself.\n\nThe elephant in the room of course, is the ancient graphics. All troopers in the 3D battlefield are 2D sprites, but always changing/angleing to the camera to give the illusion it's all 3D. It doesn't do a bad job of pulling it off, but it isn't nearly as good as, say Total War Medieval 2. (I suppose that goes without saying :D)\n\nAs far as the campaign goes, the map is not a 3D world, but more of a traditional paper looking map. It's more colorful than the first TW game, Shogun, and it's personally my favorite style.\n\nThe goal of the campaign is to start in a country, build your armies, and then INVADE! Invade other countries, but beware: as your army grows, and you have more to manage, some generals may rebel. (When my generals are about to rebel, I like to send them by themselves to figth a HUGE enemy army. It gets the job done well. )\n\nOverall, I think this is a fun game, and well worth the few dollars.","February 10","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But by the same coin, I don't think there is another game that I can say is better than it.\n\nWhat the original MTW does really well is the campaign. I don't care much for the battles, as later Total War games have greatly improved on them (particularly the first Rome), so I personally never do battles manually in MTW. But the beauty of the game is that it is a lot of fun without doing the battles at all. I am sure that there are many who love the battles, which is fine, but this review is from the perspective of a pure campaigner.\n\nOne reason you can skip battles is that the autocomplete is very fair - if you have the superior army, you will win, and casualties will be reasonable. If you have similar armies, it is a dice toss. This is different from later Total War games, where even a battle between 1000 men against 100 men needs to be resolved manually, because higher difficulty settings will attribute unreasonable losses against the human player, even though the battle would be trivial and boring to do manually.\n\nBecause of the fair autocomplete, you do not need to do dozens of repetive unbalanced battles, which seem to bog down each successive Total War Game more than the last. MTW is much more fast-paced, and if you do want to manually complete battles, you can focus just on the interesting ones. If you don't want to autocomplete battles, then the game becomes one of pure campaign strategy, which is fast-paced due to the lack of interruptions from manual battles.\n\nAdding to the fast pace of the game is the fact that you are moving armies from province to province in the same way that you would move around pieces in checkers.

Zero problems with the game. I just put the resolution up in the graphics menu and that was that. The AI is one of the best in the Total War games, especially with the introduction of the Vikings in Viking Invasion. The atmosphere is brooding and the contours of the land are very nice on the eye. The units look a bit dated now but once you get fighting then you forget that.\n\nYou can easily get beaten by the AI on the batttlefield as you come across superior troops, more men, and crazy berserkers. It can be a little arcade-like at times with 300 peasants fighting 6 berserkers but you need to apply good battlefield strategy to overcome these problems...\n\nThe enemy AI is very reactive - unlike in Rome/Medieval 2 whereby troops will just sit and take archer fire, in this game you will get charged off the field more often than not as the enemy tries to counter you quite forceably. Very good fun and every battle can be significant and is often decided in one moment..\n\nPS The other great thing about the game is how you can fight two different armies on the battlefield like the Vikings and the rebels. Trying to position yourself in the right way while taking on two different enemies is really exciting.

I honestly do. I have just experience the dreaded End Turn Crash. I was hopeful, I really was, that Steam would have fixed this problem, and that all the reviews were just old. No.. No that is certainly not the case. Nothing has been fixed, it crashes as soon as you end turn, and apparently, there is nothing you can do about it. I hate having to say I just wasted my money..but I did waste my money.","May 31","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was the second total war game ever released, and when you play it it becomes obvious how it started such a vast franchise.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the total war games that came after it.  It has inferior graphics and it's UI is slightly less intuitive.  This is balanced by the fact that the campaign screen is much more interesting with more strategic depth.  Everything sticks to a great, weird, "dark-medieval" theme, from the character portraits to the art etc.  None of the other total war games maintain this kind of unique theme.\n\nMy one complaint is that it frequently crashed on the default resolution setting, and I had to play around with the resolution settings to get it to run without crashes.  Not sure why.  If you're experiencing crashing try changing resolution.","June 6","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
