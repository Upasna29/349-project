Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is a visual novel about an awkward protagonist that finally realizes his lifelong dream of going to Japan. A very novel idea that was not given away at all from the title. AwkProtag says that he is going to be staying with two friends that he met over the internet while in Japan. Thinking they are male friends, he is very surprised to find that the friends that he has been talking to over the internet are actually cute Japanese girls! What's better is that the house they're going to stay in doesn't have any parents in it because of the convenient "emergency business trip" excuse that is so popular in these kinda stories. AwkProtag is now happy that he is staying with these girls, especially since they are both very attractive to him. Makoto is the older sibling with big breasts and a nice temperment. Akira is your typical flat-chested tsundere. There's literally no more depth to these characters, except for the fact that they know ridiculous amount of trivia of Japanese history/landmarks. Of course, you have the option of falling in love with either of these girls. For the first (and only) playthrough, I ended up with Makoto. I didn't enjoy this game really and was only fun for the sheer ridiculousness of AwkProtag and the scenarios that he would get into. Eventually AwkProtag goes home and that's the end of the story.\n\nAlso, this game has very liberal usage of elipses. Like, I'm talking whole dialogues where the only thing the characters say are ".........." to each other. Like, literally the use of these were so ridiculous that I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to quit so bad. This was a hellish experience and something that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~" is a "choice adventure game" in which the protagonist, which is a foreigner admiring Japan, experiences the life in Japan and tours famous tourist attractions during his homestay with the older sister Makoto and the younger sister Akira (tsundere) that he met online.\n\nIt is originally made for foreigner otaku who have an interest in Japan, the UI is in English, but the speech lines can be displayed in Japanese and English at the same time, which lets people learn the language at the same time too.\nThe amount of CG is small, it doesn't stop at only being a guide to Japan's tourist attractions, it also introduces manners like saying "itadakimasu" before meals, how to eat Japanese food, how to use SUICE and PASMO, the toilet seats with functions, and even small details like the obviousness of how Japanese people are used to vending machines and konbini operating 24-hours per day in Japan. But there is too much info that I found it boring.\n\nThe StoryThe protagonist heads off for a week’s stay in Japan with two friends he met online, who show him around the sights. one playthrough you get to choose 3 destinations to visit out of a total of 6 options, plus you have a trip to Kyoto, and a trip outside of Tokyo on your last day with whichever girl whose route you’ve ended up on. Then after the credits you get a cute bonus scene with your return to Japan.\n\nVisual and Music elementsSightseeing Album where you can look back on the places ypu have visited and read up on them. I liked the animation during the train journeys which created a real sense of motion.\nAs for the music there is nothing too fancy and I have nothing to say here.\n\nTo sum upI think that anyone whose dream is to go to Japan will enjoy it, but personally I found it boring and if you are intrested to learn about Japan and its culture, then this would be the game for you because it is very detailed.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","December 6, 2015","true","10.0"," 80 of 85 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","80","85","6","1"

As one of the most popular VN's on steam, I had to give it a try since I got it in some weeaboo game bundle. I was not disappointed.\nYou play as a hopeless 'murican Otaku who is born with a horrible facial disfigurement, that causes him to have no eyes, and his mouth to be skewed to the right side of his jaw. He learns to overcome his disfigurement, and also finds true love.\nHe learns many valuable life lessons along the way, including:\n\n1. Dragging a 12 year old Japanese girl straight to the Hentai section of a Doujinshi store in the heart of Akihabara makes an excellent first, second, or even third date.\n2. Girls with big boobaru's find peeping tommery irrisistable.\n3. That green stuff isn't pesto.\n4. When a girl tells you she isn't angry, it means she is just a liiiittle bit ABSOLUTELY LIVID.\n5. Girls with small boobaru's like a guy that can chug a coffee loaded with enough salt to cause a hypertensive crisis.\n6. Whenever you find yourself alone with 2 sisters, it will always lead to them desparately clambering for your jank.\n7. The more incapable you are at talking about your feelings, the more attractive girls will find you.\n\nOverall I say give it a chance if you are even a little bit interested in Anime, Manga, and/or Japanese culture. I think it's probably a good intro for some people into the world of Visual Novels, even if the dialogue can be laughable at times. Protip: As long as you don't care about spoiling one of the most heart felt moments in weeaboo entertainment media history, watch part 13 of the Game Grumps playing the game on youtube (start watching at 12:28). https://youtu.be/ck1YiXiHci0?t=12m27s\n\n10/10 would walk in on a 12 year old girl undressing again.","July 11, 2015","true","4.6"," 141 of 173 people (82%) found this review helpful 154 people found this review funny","82","141","173","154","6"

Go! Nippon! ~Squiggly Lines~ is probably the most known cheesy visual novel on steam. I'm talking about cheesy ones, not actually good ones.\nYou play as Randomerican, some otaku from america who has been interested in japan ever since he watched an anime. One day he finally gets the chance of his life and goes on a trip to japan where he can stay with two japanese friends he met over the internet. Upon arrival you notice how the hero barely cares, seeing how he was expecting the two friends to be males instead of females. In my honest opinion he should probably be more careful with his decisions or he might aswell would have gone to japan and never get back home. And to his luck, the two girls are home alone while you are staying at their place. What a cooiincideeence. We all know where this is going.\nAs you stay with your one week waifus you get to learn about japan and it's culture. Yay! This is actually not too bad of an idea, but the execution is not the best. At all. If the main character wasn't acting like the average tourist all the time (WOAH! A TRAIN!) the novel would be way more enjoyable. But on the other hand it might just be a better idea to just go to a nearby tourist office, grab a brochure about japan (if they have those, I don't visit those) and be done with it. But I guess this game has a story. Somehow?\nDuring the game you get to make your own decisions. Sometimes. And instead of just being there like in Sakura Spirit they actually affect the ending. It adds at least some sort of diversity, but it's literally either love girl one or love girl two.\nAnd don't forget, like every poorly translated anime visual novel, you get your daily dose of random fap material. Like really, the two moments where that happens have no relation to the story at all. It's just there to beg for your curiousity.\nRamen/10.","September 30, 2014","false","3.8"," 214 of 283 people (76%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","76","214","283","20","11"

I have gone to Japan many times before and this game reminded me of my guide as a service i had in 2010. They showed me many of these areas before and provided their share of interest. Playing this game also reminds me of the different foods though. Thoroughly a good game guide to a basic level. however I recommend that if you do travel choose between Kansai and Narita. The one in 2010 took Narita as It does say here. It provides a nice insight to the areas many do want to visit and obviously quite nice they put the USD Converters to Yen because it is that helpful. Believe it or not, this game is great. At a good price. I recommend it 7-9/10 in it's own way. I just wish there were more travel locations and foods. The game mentions the usual attractions and a story between you and these two. However replayable is necessary due to limited days. Locations include popular shrines, Akihabara, Shibuya's Hachiko, and Mt. Fuji. In it's right, it's worth the buy and on average it's short but educational. Plus those who want to take a look into Japan, this is a more accurate version with the matters of scenery, travel, and places. If you do go and don't know anyone, grab a guide and trust me you won't regret it. Just remember though don't think too high and bring a lot of cash. Trust me this game may keep the rate the same but in RL, the exchange rates can change so fast during hours of the day. If I were to give it a score. 6.4-8 due to it's playthrough, limited area, good story, dialogue, but it lacks location, extended travel days, and covers one area. Yet as it is a game, I can say it did it's job right with the guides. So for in total the average would be a 7.5-7.8. Although this game was released in 2011, adding it here will help those who didn't know much. Either way enjoy the game for what it is. I know I did, just wished that we had another version, different guides, different area, you know. Needs that litle extra. Still good in it's own right.

Writing this, I’ve not quite gotten over the shock of the sheer abhorrency of its dialogue, the dryness with which random geographical trivia spills out of its characters mouths, and the painful lengths it goes to pander to its audience.\n\nArriving from overseas to spend a week in Japan with two almost complete strangers you met in an online chat room, Go Go Nippon greets you by laying all its perverted cards on the table. We meet Makoto, the cheerful, ditzy airhead whose only defining feature are her enormous, perfectly framed breasts and cooking skills so poor her concoctions very nearly kill our protagonist (if only we’d been as lucky).\n\nThen there’s Akira, the bashful would-be-tsundre who exists for the purpose of manufacturing drama when she’s not reciting tourist guides and blushing profusely every time your character speaks. And what a character are globetrotting protagonist is, taking seemingly every chance to point out the varying ways Makoto and Akira are and aren’t cute, and missing no opportunity to walk in on them changing and proceeding to engage in lengthy small talk instead of swiftly exiting the room.\n\nThe character interactions in Go Go Nippon are so self indulgent and excruciatingly bland that I began to feel real, physical pain at every new line. I’ve never cringed so hard at any piece of media in my life, and now feel it will be weeks before my facial features will be able to recover from the image of pure disbelief and disgust that has been carved into them by this game.\n\nI can’t imagine what sort of person Go Go Nippon is actually for, as it fails at being a history lesson on Japan, a well written drama, or even sufficiently perverted enough to satisfy a crowd looking for that kind of fix. It’s a shallow regurgitation of facts wrapped in excruciating dialogue that goes far enough so as to be immensely uncomfortable and unapologetic in its sexual pandering, but without even a molecule of tastefulness or purepose. Playing it made me hurt. It made me want to scream. It made me feel like I needed a shower. If there’s a universe where this game is worth your time I hope I never find it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 195 of 274 people (71%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","71","195","274","67","8"

I feel as if I understand the characters emotions on a cosmic level. Even though I have known the two sisters in this game for such a short time, I feel as if I have known them for 2 years, possibly 2 years and 5 months. The writting in this game is shrektacular; it's as if Hideo Kojima himself came down from the heavens and blessed this game with his awe-inspiring writting ingenuity.\n\nThe visuals in this visual novel are also quite breath-taking, I've never seen such brilliant stylizations since Crysis. Already you're immersed in the lives of these two sisters that you're living with for a week as they tell you useless and useful information about the various regions of japan.\n\nMy 10 years of experience in anime could not prepare me for the level of kawaii I was about to witness; a ground-breaking visual novel that gripped my heart one moment, and shattered it the next.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beabosaur/recommended/251870/","Beabosaur","420SmokingWeedWithFreddieBenson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beabosaur/","183 products in account","It was a harsh, unbearable day of summer; one of many I’ve experienced, and one of many to come.  July 8th, 1968.  I’ve been fighting in the Vietnam War for four years at this point, and the Viet Cong had started to invade our shelters frequently.  With each time I flee from oncoming attacks, I grow more and more ready for the end of my life, ready to accept it with open arms.  With each raid from the north, I get slower, weaker, and less determined.  Today was the day I truly felt I would die.  I thought to myself, if it’s not this ungodly heat that kills me, it’ll be the rifle of one of those commies being stuck right into my mouth, finally giving me a sweet release from this cruel life.\nSirens and gunfire blare in the distance.  They’re coming once more, I can feel it.  As civilians and even some cowardly soldiers surrounding me flee for their lives in the opposite direction, I drop my weapon, slowly walking out towards this disastrous storm of an army with my arms spread, ready to embrace the pain they inflict upon me.  This is it, I thought. This is how my life if taken from me – with mothers and children screaming in each other’s arms, villages burning down, and hundreds of guns pointed right at me.  I shut my eyes tight, ready to hear one last sound of gunfire before I drop to the ground.\nBut… it stops.  The sound of silence is so peaceful, you could hear a pin drop from miles away.  The sound of flames suddenly eases itself, and I can hear a bird chirping in the distance.  I open my eyes slowly, suddenly appalled with what I’m witnessing right before me.  Each and every soldier previously rushing towards the base was now face down in the mud, covered in blood, their soulless bodies resting peacefully.  My eyes flutter as the sun peeks over the clouds and makes a blue sky.  That’s when I see it; a heavenly figure emerging from the great beyond, smiling sweetly, cradling the dead bodies and letting them turn to dust in her divine little hands.\n>ohshititsmakotomisaki.jpg\nSuddenly realizing my embrace is still open, Her Gorgeousness graces over too me and wraps me in her lovely arms, caressing every last fear in my body.\n“Now, my child…” she whispers sweetly, “Finish what I have started, and you may be granted my presence once more.”  Without another word, her beautiful hourglass figure floats back into the heavens, fading into nothingness.  The United States sure as hell didn’t win the Vietnam War, but I’ll be darned if that didn’t bring back to me every last ounce of motivation I had ever had.  I slaughtered every last commie to come my way, was awarded the Medal of Honor, and finally returned home to my beautiful country.\nDecades have passed since then, but I never forgot what happened on that truly blessed day.  From that day onwards, I would pray to Makoto on every occasion I got to show my undying love for Her Gracious Lady.  I pray every night to thank her for a wonderful day, before every meal to thank her for her plentiful supper, and every morning to thank her for even giving me the opportunity to wake up and experience a new day.  I was neglected and laughed at for my beliefs, with people dismissing me as someone who obsessed over a fictional character.  What fools, Lady Makoto won’t save their ungrateful selves when they're burning in anime hell.  My faith remained unchanged, as I knew one day she would come back to me and reward me.\nMost people ask their deities for a sign, but I never asked mine for one.  I got mine in Vietnam, and I know that’s all I needed to know she would potentially reward me with a heavenly eternal life to grace right beside her.  Yet, through Our Precious Savior’s undying kindness, she did reward us with another sign – a sign in the form of a game known as “Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~”.  The most beautiful and greatest being in the history of all mankind now has physical proof of existence, and I could not stop crying tears of joy upon discovering it.  She promised me I would be granted her presence once more, but never in a million years would I have guessed it would be before I meet my due date.\nThis game changed my life.  It makes me more excited for the day My Makoto determines I have done enough for the world, and blesses me with the chance to live alongside her and her followers in the afterlife.  Until that day, I feel unbelievably privileged to have the opportunity to experience Her Gracious Lady at any time I wish to feel closer to my maker (under limitations of dialogue, of course, as no mortal being can withstand the greatness of Makoto at her full potential).\nThere are no words to describe how beautiful she is,\nor how special she is, or my love for her.\nTo put these things into words would be to define them,\nTo quantify them, which means to limit them.\nThere would be a beginning and an end.\nThere is no definition fitting, nor any limit,\nnor beginning or end to her beauty,\nor to how special she is, or my love for her.\nMake me your soldier, Makoto, for I am willing to serve you unconditionally.","May 3","true","330.9"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","88","36","41","29","4"

My curiosity was aroused though when I found out that during my virtual visit to Japan I would be accompanied by two young girls. They looked fresh-faced, despite the comedically large breasts/short skirt that one of the girls sports. The desire for love and to get a virtual waifu compelled me to give it a go. Who knows, perhaps I would enjoy a threesome with said sisters at the end of the game?\n\nSo, I started it up and lo and behold ran into my cute little senpais. My boner and willigness to play this game slowly evaporated though as Makoto spent at least 10 minutes explaining to me how the Japanese public transportation system works. I was getting more and more confused as she droned on about PASMO (http://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/ for more info) and the difference between that and SAIKU cards. Apparently PASMO cards can only be used in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.  As she droned on and on I slowly got more frustrated and bored. After she explained to me the wonders of the card, in that you can scan it at the ticket machine without taking it out of your wallet (no I am not kidding, they acted as if this was the most amazing thing in the world) I decided to give up. I shut the game down, turned on incognito mode and watched Tentacle Fest 9 and I am the happier man for it.\n\nA boring game with a misleading premise. Avoid at all costs, lest you too get sexually frustated and incredibly confused about the inner workings of Japanese public transport.","March 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 106 of 157 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","106","157","3","13"

Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ you are a young male tourist visiting Japan and the two dudes you met on the internet that said you could stay with them in Tokyo end up being two gorgeous girls. In between sightseeing, there are opportunities for flirting, and also awkwardly walking in on the girls in various states of undress.\n\nWhere this visual novel fails is in the novel part. The characterization is super shallow, and so much of the "dialogue" is in the form of long pauses indicated by elipses or spelled-out awkward noises. There isn't much here in the way of choices or decisions, other than to pick the part of the city you visit for a few of the days, which determines which of the lucky young ladies you end up with. And a lack of Steam achievements makes it not even worth playing through again to see the parts of the city you missed (and end up, presumably, with the other girl).\n\nIt wasn't a total loss, there was some sort of interesting information about Tokyo (and Kyoto) in there, but you can find that — and probably also pictures of cute anime girls showing their panties — for free online without the tedious dialogue and mouse-clicking (or tweaking the auto message speed) so you might as well keep your $10.","May 31, 2015","false","3.7"," 134 of 206 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","134","206","8","0"

Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~\nThe premise sounded interesting, the fact that it would tell you facts about Japan was also interesting, and I thought perhaps it'd be a fun little story that would give you some knowledge of culture and such as you played.\n\nFirst, what I liked:\nThe part about Japan facts was interesting, not everything was new to me, and half of the stuff you'd already know if you ever opened, you know, a brochure for Japan or watched an anime... but it was still interesting.\nThe graphics were nice, background as well as characters were well drawn.\nI loved the idea for the VN, and loved that you could actually have it with Japanese text too.\nThe idea of having expenses added was interesting, but badly done and underused.\nI guess if you're getting ready to visit Japan this would be cool.\n\n\nNow, what I disliked:\nWhile the graphics were nice, they were poor. Half the time you had sky shots with music/sound/text that would be like "Oh, the train arrives~! Let's get on it!" like they couldn't find the image of a train or something, which was slightly annoying. But I could overlook that, or could have, if the story had been actually interesting.\nIt wasn't.\nSo you play as this guy who realizes is life long dream of going to Japan. Only unlike any normal human being, he makes no research whatsoever of who he's actually going to be staying with ("friends" from Japan whom he never exchanged pictures with and he thought were guys but are really girls. Yay, score for him, right?... yeah), and just hops on a plane. Lets assume I can suspend disbelief enough to think this really smart guy couldn't have found out before hand that his "friends" were really girls.\nWe move on in the story and find out that the guy whose long life dream was going to Japan has apparently never even watched an anime (or read about the place he wanted to go to), or even stepped foot outside his own home back in his country. He knows none of the basic things an anime fan would know, or that someone who cared about the place they so wanted to see would be aware of, or basics about the culture. Basically: he's highly unprepared. He seems to even be amazed at the dumbest things (train, shopping mall, everything! Ooooooohhhhhhh, I've never seen a shopping mall before! - I grant you Japan ones are probably impressive, but probably not like this.)\nThen, you spend most the novel on invisible trains. I say invisible trains because, as mentioned, you get most the time a sky view as the girls proceed to explain everything about how the train system works while you travel to and from places. And it's not a lot of places.\n\nAll the while you're supposed to "choose" one girl for the love story that's behind all this... only you don't really know which you're picking (each girl shows you a different place out of the few that are to be seen, but you don't know which girl will show you which until you've picked it).\n\n\nDo I recommend this VN? Well... no.\n\nIf you want this for the culture shot - don't get it, watch any anime instead.\nIf you want this for the hentai/ecchi - don't get it, there's none.\nIf you want this for the story - don't get it, there's also none.\nIf you want this for practicing Japanese - go ahead and get it if it's on sale.","July 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 68 of 97 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","68","97","9","4"

This VN is more focused on being a tourist guide and it did a good job for that.\n\nFor story, it has 2 routes, 1 for each heroines. It is divided into two part, Common Route and Heroine Route:\n\nThe Common Route is focused on providing tourist information on the location that you selected in the game. There are 5 destinations to choose, in which you choose one location per day. The information that are given by the heroine is simple yet very useful if you're going to Japan. It provides background information on the location, the adaptation of the area as time progress, and you get to know what's what in that location. You can go to 3 location max. The destination that you chose determine whose route you gonna take.\n\nThe Heroine Route is focused on romantic development for the heroine that you progressed. THIS IS WHERE I GOT FRUSTRATED BECAUSE OF THE CLIFFHANGER ENDING... ehm, ignore my fanrage. As a person that plays countless of eroges, visual novels and galge, I can say that the romantic part of this VN is under-developed but it has a lot of potential. The romantic development is fast-paced but it leaves you wanting for more. It might be a quick romantic trip, but the characterization is very good for this size of VN so I guess I can't complain about that.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty simple, you just read-click-read. A feature worth noting for this VN is the option to show Japanese text alongside English text, a very useful feature if you're planning on learning Japanese. The currency conversion is a pretty neat feature of this game as it allows you to set the rate of $/€ to ¥ and vice versa, it gives you an estimate of how many dough you might spend on the trip there (train fare can vary depending on which location you might stayed if you really come to Japan).\n\nThe art of this VN is quite good for its size, with the feature of upscaling to HD I can't even ask for more. Then again this is not AAA VN, the amount of CGs and sprite quality is decent enough.\n\nAll in all, I gave this game rating 7.4/10. It did a good job for being a tour guide, but then again, I DEMAND A SEQUEL FOR THIS GAME KMON WTF GIB ME A SEQUEL WITH MOAR H/E-SCENE AND PROPER ROMANCE + DEEP LOVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEROINE !!!\nehm, ignore my fanrage. Definitely recommend this game (and planetarian ～ちいさなほしのゆめ～) for people that is interested in playing visual novel medium","March 6, 2014","true","23.1"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","32","37","6","3"

Nippon! is a short Visual Novel based on the idea of someone visiting Japan for the first time.\n\nOf course you as the main character speak really good Japanese, and is also an Otaku.\nThe story is mostly centered around you exploring Japan in the company of two girls who take turns going with you depending on where you decide to visit. The nudity tag doesn't really belong on this game but whatever.\n\nPersonally the story felt as if it was a bit lacking because of the nature of the premise: visiting Japan for the first time. There are few choices that you can make that make any difference and only two endings.\n\nOverall it can be an entertaining game if you're in the right mood, just don't expect much from it. If you want to visit Japan though, it has cool features like being able to hit a button and see what that specific location looks like on google maps from a street view. I found this to be interesting as I wouldn't know exactly where to look for those specific attractions.\n\nThough it's not amazing, it's still worth the playthrough twice if you get it at a discount on the base price.\nIf you're  VN lover, you'd probably rate it higher than my 5/10.\n\n[This review is not based on the content in the DLC]","April 11","true","6.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

It comes with a bunch of IFs. Consider this game...\n\nIF you study Japanese : having the dual subtitles in English and Japanese is a great way to practice. (Personally, it is the main reason I bought that game for)\nIF you can't go to Japan and are interested because anime : then you will learn quite a few true things beyond clichés. And if you went there (I did), you'll be reminded in an unusual and kinda fun way.\nIF you don't mind a visual novel with less fanservice and less dating sim elements than most. The game clearly wanted to be educationnal first, and offer a love story second.\nIF you can cope with some scenes being pointlessly long.\nIF you can cope with the main character being a (good-hearted) complete idiot.\nIF you don't mind the price, which is slightly too high in my opinion.\nFor me, the idea of practicing my Japanese and being reminded of my trip made this game a decent experience. I also liked that the game felt more romantic because there was less fanservice than in many visual novels.\n...There definitely is some, but we don't really go into the world of ridiculous in which girls trip and fall breasts on your face all the time. If you see what I mean.\n\nIf you are not in a similar mindset as I am, you might find this game boring.

Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ I would soon realise that would not be the case. As the game progressed I found not only my character but myself falling in love with Makoto. I realised just how unhappy I was with my current waifu but knew she would never allow us to get a divorce. I stayed up all night thinking about how I would move past this but my mind kept turning to Makoto, so I devised my plan of action. I woke up to a nice breakfast prepared by my waifu and I informed her that we were going on a special outting today. I blindfolded her so she would not spoil the suprise and set my plan into action. I lead her behind our house and had her stand in a spot and poured what I was assuming she thought was lubricant all over her (She giggled alot), then removed her blindfold. What happened next came in a flash all at once. My waifu discovered she was standing in our burn pit out back, and that i had a lighter and a can of gasoline in my hands. I tipped my fedora down to hide my tears and said "I'm sorry, but there is a another." She cried out to me to think rationally but it was too late. The lighter left my hand and went onto the gasoline which instanly ignited my waifu.

The fact that there is a card that can be used to automatically pay for access to a train just blows him away. He thinks that only happens in Japan.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/recommended/251870/","dracosummoner","dracosummoner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/","180 products in account","If Steam had a "recommended with massive caveats" button, that would be an appropriate way to sum up my feelings toward this game, because for everything it does right or well, something else comes along that's either poorly done or is a bad idea altogether.\n\nThe concept is solid--take a guidebook of Japan, its history, and some cultural/tourist hotspots, and deliver it in the form of a fictional story as a visual novel--but everything that isn't explicitly focused on educating the reader feels like a waste of time.  There really is no story.  The foreign protagonist, your canonically nameless player character (PC), fumbles around in the company of two cute sisters, and his "tour guides" don't really get much character development until the very end of their respective stories, when the time comes for an obligatory and bare-bones romance.  At least the sisters don't completely feel like stereotypes; while innocent and sweet, the busty Makoto is not particularly gullible, and the younger Akira maintains a gruff exterior but is usually friendly, intelligent, and observant of the world around her.\n\nThat being stated, even the game's few attempts to develop its characters have their downsides; for Makoto, despite her being gorgeous, she just happens to be very naive about red-light districts.  Take a wild guess what happens, and take a wild guess who has to "save" her.  This also looks really weird in reverse, in an unrelated scene where the protagonist doesn't trust Makoto to go out alone at night in a quiet and completely different part of town THAT SHE LIVES IN AND KNOWS MUCH BETTER THAN HE DOES.  For Akira, her sometimes abrasive personality leads to unnecessary, contrived drama where she cynically overanalyzes everything that's said to and around her.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413508542 (This sums up far too many of the main character's ideas about Japan.  I've seen worse protagonists in games, but I've rarely wanted to slap one so hard as I do here.  The 'hero' is incredibly childish, becoming overly excited about everything to the point where he causes a distraction and embarrasses one of his tour guides.  Never mind when he suddenly starts looking, or trying to look, at adult magazines in public, with said guide only a few feet away.  He is a consummate "weeaboo," who loves Japan for no real reason and doesn't so much as understand the convenience stores or the toilets, let alone the nation's complex history.)\n\nThe actual educational segments are much more interesting.  You receive a guided tour not only of Tokyo but of various other areas, and the game does merit a lot of credit for providing a nice variety of settings and for not promoting an image of Japan as some sort of universally modern tech haven.  The "Show Photo" feature found in some scenes is a game-winner, as it actually loads up Google Maps in your Internet browser and shows you a real-life photo of whatever you're looking at in the story.\n\nThen the production values start becoming unpredictable.  The music is very hit-or-miss, sometimes being low-key and utterly beautiful, and sometimes being inappropriately excited when the exposition is tragic or depressing.  Building interiors work the same way; you get to see the insides of some temples and plazas, while others are simple and pointless fade-to-black transitions.  One museum is explored completely and instantly off camera.  The same goes for various characters, such as a sumo wrestler and a geisha who are mentioned but not actually shown, and this and the few varieties of character expressions make the game quality feel cheap.  (The player character also lacks eyes for no clear reason in the few scenes where he's actually shown.)  On the other hand, much of the dialogue is rendered in both English and Japanese, which is a really nice touch, and the game at least does a great job of making Japan look like a place well worth visiting and appreciating, especially since several background scenes such as the Ikebukuro district's are really well done.  Besides, you can hardly go wrong with delicious pictures of food.\n\nSome of the "facts" you're given are actually wrong, however.  Matthew C. Perry -- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=426537945 -- did help open Japan's borders, but he did part of this work in 1853, not 1863 as pictured ( http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1750_perry.htm ).  He wasn't even alive by 1863, and to the best of my knowledge, he was a commodore at the time, not yet an admiral.\n\nOne of the game's neater features is that you can manually enter the real-life exchange rate for yen to and from the American dollar or the Euro, thus having prices reflected in a currency and at a rate of your choice.  There's little sense in counting each penny you spend on foreign food, however, as your prices start skyrocketing when you begin riding the advanced trains.  It would have been nice to keep an eye on a set budget for food and travel expenses as an actual tourist would, since the game isn't designed to let you visit all of its half-dozen destinations in one playthrough as is, but your purchasing decisions are generally made for you.\n\nThe attempts at non-educational writing--comedy, drama, romance--largely fall flat.  Much of the dialogue feels horribly bloated, especially with the constant use of ellipses (......................... ................ ......) and parrot exposition ("Parrot exposition?  You mean where one character repeats something that was just said?"), to the point where it can become tempting to skip through long sequences of nothing to get to the next historical exhibit.  Despite this, the game is not long: my play time encompasses two playthroughs as well as time I let the game idle while I was checking facts or generally web-surfing.  The still-image fanservice is of the cheap and tacky walked-in-on-someone-dressing variety, and the protagonist's tendency to linger and ogle completely ruins the "gentleman" characterization that he and the game desperately want the reader to believe.  At least he has the decency not to ride the women-only trains, but other than his tendency to listen respectfully, I have no idea what the girls see in him.  Scenes like these and various suggestive or perverted-humor references scattered throughout, while not explicit, make me question claims of this being an all-ages VN.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=426537984 (People who complain about "spaz" references will want to be aware of scenes like this.)\n\nThe user interface is full of uneven decisions.  A corner of the main game interface contains intrusive save/skip/load buttons that could easily have been left to hotkeys or the pause menu.  Being able to fast-forward through dialogue using the scroll wheel can be handy or annoying, but since the conversation archive only stores text and doesn't actually rewind scenes, you may find yourself reloading earlier scenes if you want to revisit a certain piece of art, especially if you wind up skipping several lines of dialogue by accident.  Still, there is a requisite CG gallery, and the remarkable sightseeing album contains plenty of distilled and informative commentary on the various sites and places you visit, even as you might be better served by checking out an actual guide or history book from a library.\n\nIn short, there are a lot of decisions you should make on your own before deciding to buy this.  Can you deal with writing that vacillates between being decently entertaining and frustratingly boring?  A main character who acts like he's never been taught to behave in public?  A detailed but somewhat cluttered user interface?  Music you may find yourself turning off, and art that feels like incomplete potential?  The links to real-life photos are amazing, but I won't say they justify the price; the product is short yet still drawn out, and it needs a lot of polish.","April 16, 2015","false","11.8"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","26","40","3","0"

Not only does it give you a taste of Japan, but does so in it's own visual novel way mixed with romance and comedy.\n\nFor this limited sale, it is definitely worth it for the empty souled 2D-lover, aspiring Japanese future-tourist, or/and curious buyer.","February 23, 2014","true","6.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","1"

You start watching anime on netflix because you've watched literally everything else on there. It dawns on you. You like it. You actually love anime. You feel the transformation. The hunger for superior Japanese content. Words you used to use as a joke, you now use in all seriousness. You start watching hentai. Even the weird tentacle stuff. You realise you've become the weaboo you always made fun of and joked about. You buy Go Go Nippon. The transformation is complete.

Go! Nippon! my first trip to japan, with beautiful tour guider, good illustration, warming atmosphere, and many more.\n\nokay, here we go ...\nbefore reading, remember, this is my review. based on my point of view. other people might, or must, have a different point of view.\n\nfirst time playing, this game gave us a quiz about japanese currency. yep, how much 1usd worth in japanese yen?\nhere, we played as a tourist from europe. damn, i don't know he want to visit japan that badly. after arriving at the airport ( finally, after taking a quiz at the airplane ), he met with 2 qt young lady. the one named makoto ( older sister, the one with big ♥♥♥♥ ) the other one named akira ( younger one without ♥♥♥♥ )\n\ni'll tell you, makoto can't cook. but she can do house joob better, and has a great figure ( her body, i mean ) plus, she's a real kind person with a warmth aura that'll make you fall for her.\naand, there's akira. makoto's younger sister. she's the real, pro cook in her family that can't do house job correctly. plus she's a tsundere ( seriously, who'll fall for a tsundere with no ♥♥♥♥. come on man ... ) but she's cute. cuter than makoto. while makoto have a hot body, she has a cute face ( but still, no ♥♥♥♥ )\n\nyou'll stay at their house, plus their parents are off the town. they'll accompany you in this journey, telling you about SUICA, many kind of vending machines, sushi restaurant ( you know, that one with the rotating table. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome ). you'll spend your times walk around the temple, shopping district, arcade center, and etc. japanese awesome places.\n\nas the time flow, you'll know many things about history of all japanese temple. as well as the statue and some historical district in japan, the tradition changes, clothes, and how important some japanese people are. you'll know the different between the old japan and the 21st century japan that we know now ( building changes, street, festival etc. )\n\nlike any other VN, you'll have to choose some kind of place that'll be your route of this game. every place that you choose will trigger some event ( i assume you ga uys are already know how VN score counting system works ). with that you can choose the route you want, and not, to get to your version of happy ending ( i suggest makoto ending, akira's ending doesn't give you any good since she has no ♥♥♥♥ )\n\nmake sure to play this game alone, cz you don't want your parents to see makoto go half naked, right? ( especially your father, careful he might get a boner )\n\noverall this game is totally worth buying it.\none thing i think this game needed, achievement. yep, looking forward to it.\n\nanyway there's my review, i know peoples point of views are different. this review is based on my point of view, you might want to read other's review b4 buying this game.\nbut once again, this game i stotally worth buying it\n\npls rate up if you found this review helpful, thanks for reading.\n\nthis japanes mighty creation come with :\neducation - 9.8/10\nillustration - 8.5/10\nsoundtrack - 7.6/10\natmosphere - 7/10\nthe guy's reaction - over 9000\nhalf-naked  makoto 69/10 would bang till she passes\n\n\n\n" 10/10 your mom won't think you're a gay "  -  KunThouD, 2015","June 15, 2015","true","154.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","17","25","9","1"

Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is a simple VN from Overdrive and MangaGamer that's part romance game and part travelogue. You play an unassuming and rather naive weeaboo visiting Japan for the first time. On your arrival you find out that A. the two guys you had befriended online and arranged to stay with are actually cute teenage girls and B. their parents are out of town for the duration of your stay (of course!). This brings about a surprising but not unwelcome predicament as you're suddenly sharing a roof with two very attractive women.\n\nThe two girls have distinct but frankly rather unremarkable personalities. Makoto, the elder, is nicer and more cheerful and generally just a bit moe, and can speak pretty good English.  She's good at housekeeping with the awful exception of cooking. She also has a much nicer- ahem- physique, compared to her sister. Akira, the younger, is your basic tsundere, though perhaps more mellow and reasonable than some. She can barely speak any English at all, which doesn't really affect the plot that much since your character is mostly bilingual. She is also a great cook, to balance out for her lackluster housekeeping skills and attitude. I would say she's also the more fleshed out of the two, with a slightly more satisfying arc.\n\nThe romance of the game is simple, and who you end up with in the end is based purely on who you spend more time with, determined by where in Tokyo you go explore. See, throughout your week long stay, the girls will take it upon themselves to give you tours of the city, giving you lots of great information about the places, people, and customs. This is also the area where the game shines, as the presentation is both interesting and informative, and basically gives you a lot of pointers if you ever actually want to visit the country in real life.\n\nAs for the aesthetics, well, I actually quite like the character design. It fits very well with the nature of the story and theme, and is pretty memorable. The backgrounds can also be pretty gorgeous, which is unsurprising since it's basically giving you a tour of famous sites. The music was pretty forgettable for me, though (as in, I honestly don't remember much about it).\n\nThis is a good game to pick up if you're interested in Japanese culture and/or visitng Japan. If you're just looking for a general VN, it's okay, but there are lots of better ones around. I would recommend buying this, but only when it's on sale.","November 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Ever since I began to watch animes such as Naruto and Attack on Titan (OTAKU PRIDE!! ヽ(｀Д´)ノ ). So I ended up buying this game to learn even more about Japan and Japanese culture for my future trip.\n\nThis game is amazing, you get to plan exactly how your trip will go by visiting major hotspots (I recommend going to Akihabara ^_^). You also get to see plenty of famous Japanese dishes like Omurice and Ramen (YUM!! P:). Everyone speaks Japanese in the game too, to immerse the player more. Now I can plan for my trip and practice my Japanese at the same time, which is really sugoi* (sugoi means awesome in Japanese). And the women in Japan are gorgeous as shown in this game. When I go to japan, I hope I too can stay with two beautiful sisters.\n\nAs for the H-scenes though, they are fairly vanilla and lackluster in general. Nothing like the Violent ♥♥♥♥♥ Inferno VN that I usually play, but I can't really complain since I got this for planning purposes.

How could a visual novel emulate the true otaku experience of visiting Japan, the world's apex of cultural and intellectual development?

Their descriptions of specific buildings and locations have really prepared me for when I'm finally able to make my first trip to the Homeland!

Nippon! ~ My First Trip to Japan ~ is a cute little visual novel, where you explore many of the most famous landmarks in Japan, in the company of Two sisters you befriended online and whom you stay with during your weeklong visit.

All in all, it was a very cute game, with some funny dialogue and a couple of situations that gave it an anime feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, even though the playthrough was very linear. You can make some choices as to where you want to visit; However, a large part of the playthrough will be visiting specific areas in Japan, such as Kyoto.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juissismi/recommended/251870/","Juissismi","Yuiself","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juissismi/","77 products in account","*This "would-be professionally made" review will mostly cover Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ Ver. 2015, as that version has twice the amount of content compared to this base game version*\n\nRest assured, this game is an odd one - well, technically a "Visual Novel", but odd because it provides an education on the Japanese culture for those actually interested in it. And make no mistake when people say this game fills a small gap in a Japanophile's wet dream - that is pretty much true. But there's another reason I decided to make a positive review of this game: my enjoyment for this game was (and still is) two-fold.\n\nVisual novels - hereby referred to as VN - often suffer from poor localisation, cringeworthy translation and/or lack of content (and with it, replayability). This is the case with most VN's published by Sekai Project and Winged Cloud. Granted, they do provide great eyecandy but the characters, the story and the quality of the dialogue fall really flat as a result - hardly anyone buys Nekopara or a Sakura game for its story.\n\nGo! Go! Nippon however is a different case. Sure, the story is pretty much non-existent besides the "Gaijin-protagonist-visits-Japan" synopsis but all the things that are pretty much thrown away in Sekai Project's and Winged Cloud's VN's have been handled with love - and it shows. You'll get to know the Misaki sisters Akira and Makoto as you venture through six locales (ten, if you play the 2015 version) and educate yourself with some Japanese culture and its history. You'll also grow fond of them up to the point where you'll have to choose whom you'll want to be with the most between the two sisters – which is pretty heart-breaking, all things considering.\n\nThe education aspect in Go! Go! Nippon is another differentiating factor: you get a sufficient amount of information about the locales and Japan's history in a reasonably bite-sized package while still managing to be fun and not boring, being accompanied by either of the Misaki sisters during the trip.\n\nWith the content being twice as large as the base game, you'll find yourself visiting your virtual Japan again and again as there are multiple endings that you can achieve – two for each girl, as opposed to having only one in the non-2015 version.  And let's not forget the quality of the localisation: it's surprisingly okay. It's not something you'd cringe on the first line or on the first five minutes you invest in the experience, which is a huge win in my eyes.\n\nAlso, there are a few things added to Go! Go! Nippon! Ver. 2015 not present in the old base game. The E-Mote System certainly adds character and life to Akira and Makoto as they smile, stare at you in surprise and give you the "you w0t?" face. You can also check the locale's via Google Maps as you visit them in-game to further deepen your research and plan on your would-be IRL trip to Japan or just look at them in curiousity.\n\nGo! Go! Nippon! (especially the Ver. 2015) is a surprisingly great experience, despite the "weeaboo" target audience this VN is aimed mostly towards. It adds some educational elements to the experience while also remaining what it is – a visual reading experience, with something to see and... well, experience.","February 11","true","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusthebold/recommended/251870/","linusthebold","LinustheBold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusthebold/","1158 products in account","This game is my first visual novel, so I can't compare it to others.  As a standalone experience, it's interesting.  You play a tourist coming to Japan for the first time, staying with a couple of brothers you met on the Internet.  The brothers turn out to be sisters - shocking! and also, you forgot to ask and apparently never shared a pronoun - and in among the inevitable progress to seduction (you only get to fall for one of them per game) there's a lot of first-time tourist information about visiting Tokyo and the environs, along with light language lessons and some good practical advice about tourist mistakes to avoid.  Which is actually pretty cool. I've never been, but now I'm quite curious.\n\nThere's no nudity; the Steam game tag is wrong on this score.  You manage to catch each sister minus some clothing by forgetting to knock and then forgetting to look away or close the door, but the pictures are PG-13 in nature, if not intent.  Apart from that it's all about True Love, and in fact the game gets embarrassed pretty easily, like if anything ever even remotely suggests that people might be physically attracted to each other.  The number of awkward-pause ellipse screens to click past [...] is staggering.\n\nThere are two endings (one each for matching with each of the sisters), and if you check a game guide, as I did after my first play-through, a couple of judicious saves and liberal use of the "Skip" button will let you play quickly to the other ending and give you the couple of scenes you missed by choosing this restaurant instead of that one, and so forth.  Acing one or two of these alternatives unlocks extras that will let you look at the pictures of your times with Makoto and Akira, replay scenes, and give you an index of information about the sites you visited - you can also click through in-game to Googlemaps pictures of the places you go.\n\nThe game definitely wants you to end up with one sister rather than the other, or so it seemed to me.  They will both fall for you if they're called on to do so, but one harbors a quiet crush and the other is all "Hi, I'm the hot one but don't let me near the kitchen."  Goofy, but absorbing.","March 19","true","5.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If, like me, you get bored of reading text that fails to draw you in to begin with, you'll be clicking on the skip button quite a bit. Then again, even that has its flaw when the button stops at a random text box, making you click it off to turn it back on again.\nWhen it comes to the artwork, it's alright. But that's really the imagery concerning the areas of Tokyo. When it comes to "you" stumbling upon Akira getting changed or Makoto in the wash room, it's just unnecessary padding. It's there for a split second, drawn out before the next venture and never mentioned again.\nLast, but not least, the love plot. Oh god, the love plot. You could have kept the guy as their friend and it would have made as much sense. Visit 2 areas of Japan with either sister and they're your love interest of the game, and it's all set for you. Choose an area, say...Shibuya, and your tour guide is Akira. Two tours, love confirmed. That's it.\nAs far as graphic novel genres go, this felt like it WANTED to be a dating sim but gave up half-way.\nFor its good points: Artwork, music and information had been put in to Guide Book degree.\nFor its bad points: Bad plot, dim-witted protagonist and unconvincing love plots.\nI give it a 3 out of 10.","March 6, 2014","false","8.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theycallmetimothy/recommended/251870/","theycallmetimothy","Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theycallmetimothy/","99 products in account","It'd be easy to just dismiss Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ as a simple fanservicey VN for weeaboos, otakus and the like. Then again, it'd be easy to call Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker little more than a cheap attempt at being 'deep' and 'meaningful'. Bottomline is that it's easy to call brilliant works of art like those bad simply because we cannot understand them when we first experience them. And experience is the right word to use here, oh yes.\nGo! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is a brilliant satire on otaku culture, a deconstruction of the stereotypes we slowly have accepted as the standard for the once great Japanese animation industry. I'd call it the Me!Me!Me! of visual novels, but that would be a slight insult to Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ because it's so damn amazing.\nThe game tells the story of a young man, the 'protagonist' who goes to Japan and, unsurprisingly, spends the week there with two attractive anime girls, Makoto, the stereotypical 'kind' girl with a giant chest compensated by her lack of personality, and Akira, who is more boyish and is almost flat chested. Note how the game right from the beginning comments on the 'blank slate' protagonist who serves as little more than an empty canvas for us to project our own personalities onto. This is the first in a long series of intelligent and cleverly constructed criticisms on otaku culture stereotypes: girls that are fairly skinny yet somehow still manage to have breasts larger than their own skull, how it's okay to sexualize young looking girls because 'they really are 18' or 'they aren't real so it's not paedophilia'. But never does the game do this too blatantly, like, say, Spec Ops The Line's criticism on the glorification of game violence and justifying violent actions in the name of good. No, each time the game brings up a valid point on one of the many subjects it touches upon it does so in a stylish, respectful and aesthetically refined way.\nFrom here on, the review shall contain spoilers, so I'd recommend you to stop reading and play this masterpiece before you continue reading.\nThe story ends with the protagonist having learned that there's more to Japan than his so-called 'waifus' and eating sushi: in order to get the best ending, you have to try things you wouldn't necessarily associate with Japan (eating 'pizza' instead of sushi, which makes for a funny and charming moment when you and Akira begin to talk about how Japan has dealt with cultural influences throughout history) or give certain things you wouldn't expect an otaku to do a chance, like going for a nice morning jog (with one of the girls, as you'd learn later on) or eating a nice fruit salad Akira made for everyone in the house instead of emptying a bag of Doritos™ with some Mountain Dew™. Finally, you return home without having had anything 'sexual' with Akira and decide that she's worth a second visit to the country. You meet up again as you hold her tightly, having finally let go of your 2D chinese cartoon ladies and katana collection.\nFinally, you can move on with your life, get a job, move out, meet a nice girl, maybe even start a family. We see the protagonist who now seems to be in his thirties shutting off his PC and going outside, where his two kids are playing together in the grass. He feels a soft touch on his shoulder and sees his wife smiling at him as she nods at your two children playing in the garden. You smile and close your eyes, holding your wife as you feel a warm summerevening's wind blowing against your face, and you know that in the end, everything is going to be alright.\ntl;dr for all of you uneducated plebs: Akira best girl ♥♥♥♥ you and your cowtitted ♥♥♥♥♥ Makoto♥♥♥♥\n","May 10, 2015","true","9.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","8","12","6","1"

This review includes a lot of spoilers about the game, so if You're interested in playing it on Your own, then please do Yourself a favour and don't read this!\n\nGo! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~... Is this the perfect game?\n\nThis game makes You think that You're a total ♥♥♥♥♥, which You may have been while dating a girl, so now You'll just see how bad You might have been.\n\nFirst, this game is a total opposite to the things Your mother has taught You. You, as the main character, meet two persons in a weird chat room, take out all Your money and fly to Japan. You've always thought they were guys, but  surprise surprise , they're two cute girls. Who the heck would do that?! At least have a video call or something before You go to some country and live at their place... Anyway...let that be. You meet two girls who were really waiting for You and had prepared a lot of stuff, which is nice. But then You find out that one of the girls doesn't speak English. No, they didn't tell You their genders and even lied to You? Damn, bad luck. But hey hey, at least You can speak Japanese!\nYou arrive at their house and find out that their parents had left for two weeks, so You can spend Your week in Japan with the girls, all alone... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nAs I already said, they have prepared some stuff to do. They take You to places, talk about their history and importance. Then there also were some encounters, which were fun...sometimes... For example, Akira wouldn't let You to go to adult manga department. Damn, this was my main reason to play this game! Anyway, she also reads Your mind sometimes and that's really disturbing. When You go out with Makoto, then she almost gets abused by a guy and later she sees You as her hero and true love. Heh, sadly it's only the virtual world...\nThis game has two ending solutions, either You will fall in love with Akira or Makoto. I found falling in love with Akira a bit more interesting as she gets mad easily.\nBasically, she takes You to a Chinatown (And let's be honest, You're disappointed). You see that she's not feeling well and suggest her to go home. She instantly gets the wrong idea and says that You can visit the town on Your own. After she finds out that You followed her, she gets normal for a second again, but after You won't let her to go to a store she runs away and locks herself into her room. You're sad, really sad. So is she...AND SHE HAS EVERY F-WORD RIGHT TO BE SAD! Later Makoto gets home, impressed because she thought that You'd be away for a bit more. As Akira locked herself into her room she wants to cook a dinner and finds a fridge full of goodies. She knows what's in Aira's head but You, a tiny snail with no brains still don't get anything. After the hint she gives You, You find out that Akira is in love with You. She won't talk to You, no matter how hard You try. Then, when You're going to leave Japan, You leave her a letter with all of Your feelings. As You're going to go through the gate, Akira runs into You and starts talking in her terrible English which is really really really cute. Then You wake up in a plane and notice a paper bag in Your hand. You remember that Akira gave it to You and peek inside. There is a doll of You and letter that tells You to wait for her. I, myself was most grateful for the bag because You never know when You're going to puke in a plane. A year later You break the promise and won't wait for her. You go to visit her and bump into her near a store. She calls You a jerk but it all ends happily.\n\nSecond ending is that You go with Makoto, she tells You that You can "buy luck" and reads it for You. She herself got good luck, except that she hasn't meat her true love yet, which made her sad. You got bad luck which even said that long distance relationships won't work out for You. She tells You that You can leave the luck behind when You tie the paper thingy back together with Your non-dominant hand. You both do it. Then she goes to a tower with You. The tower has a bell in it. She tells You a nice story about  the bell and lies a bit, that little witch! You also screw up and make her a bit sad. Though, You both will ring the bell and then she reveals that now You're both in love...I want to get a girl like that! NOW! AND A NICE ONE LIKE MAKOTO! Anyway, she tells You how she loves You and when You want to start speaking, she runs away. Later, at night she enters Your room and talks to You. You say that You love her too and play a pirate. Play a pirate? Ye, arrggghhh! You're a filthy pirate who steals the cute Japanese girl's first kiss! Next morning You'll go to airport and prepare to leave. Akira tells You that You can trade in Your SUICA for the money that's left on it and goes to do it. Then You and Makoto talk and kiss, a lot. Akira sees it and gets traumatized. Next year You'll also go to visit Japan and find Makoto who's still in love with You.\n\nWhat did this game do to me? Well, now I'm going to learn Japanese, hang out in random chat rooms with girls (I'll make sure they're girls), go visit Japan and ring the bell with them! INSTANT TRUE LOVE! FOREVER! YAY! But meh...if something goes wrong, then I can just spend the rest of my Japanese trip in the  adult only  section of  a manga store and do my business. Later I would just go home, turn on my PC and cry, cry a lot because everything I knew was totally wrong.\n\nWhy did I pick up this game? Well, I'm a simple man with simple needs... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nI would rate this game 8.5/10 because I think that I'm not a total ♥♥♥♥♥. Heck, even I know how vending machines work, trains move and SUICAs function. Though, I don't know how these Japanese hyper-smart toilets work, so I'm going to forgive him about some things. But the main character was a total jerk! First I wanted bit more perverted situations to the game, but it even worked better without them, as the meaning of the game was great and funny. So what are You waiting for? Pick up this game! It may not be worth the full price, but if it's in a bundle, then definitely grab it!\n\nTL;DR - It's like Twilight, but You will get the girl in 7 days, there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chasing You and the girls look a lot cuter. So basically it's a better love story than Twilight.","July 2, 2015","true","20.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","3"

My shame is worth $1 Humble Bundle + the cost of cards.\n\nActual review - Now in all seriousness this game is stupid, so stupid it's genuinely entertaining. Here you are on your first trip to Japan. I'm guessing our protagonist is from middle of no where Europe. Location, probably spent a good part of his childhood in his mom's basement playing games and watching anime. Therefore every single thing he sees when he gets to Japan is superawesome amazeballs. Also the absolute luckiest guy in the world to meet 2 online friends who happen to be teenage Japanese girls. Not only do said Japanese girls offer him a spot to stay but their parents are out of town and is TOTALLY cool with some random internet stranger from mom's basement staying in their house with said teenage daughters.\n\nWhen your character isn't thinking naughty thoughts about the sisters he's being wowed by Japanese culture. Did you know that Japanese restaurants give you a glass of water before you order? So do most other countries restaurants. This isn't something exclusive to Japan. Our main character even thinks when a cute girl handing out tissues it's a sign that she's interested in him because he's seen it in anime. His naivety knows no bounds.\n\nAlso in Japan a woman's cheerfulness directly correlates with the size of her breasts. The upbeat sister has huge boobs and doesn't mind when you accidentally walk in on her naked. The small boob sister seemed to have a chip on her shoulder for a good part of the game. But every VN needs a tsundere female to show tension or some junk.\n\nAnyways there is a little bit of information about Japan in there. Nothing you couldn't find doing 10mins of research on the internet. But yeah, this game was so awkward I found myself just laughing during most of it.","February 19, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

This is not a 'game' as such.  There are no game mechanics in play.  What this IS, is a tourist's introduction to Tokyo, with some anime-style story-fluff built around it.  There are no meaningful choices to be made, just picking what order you do things in.  The rest of your time will be spent reading.  It could just as easily have been made into a TV spot, and you wouldn't have to click as much.\n\nThat said, the art is decent, the summaries of various districts are made relatable, and I had fun learning things.  So I'm recommending it.  It's one of the better edutainment products I've tried and worth the five bucks in prep-work for an upcoming overseas trip.

This isn't a bad thing; in fact, it was very informative and I enjoyed learning some things I didn't know about Japan. But sometimes I don't feel like reading a wall of text about this building or temple that was built 800 years about and the details of the Bakufu government back in the day.\n\nThe only choices that really make a difference are the places you want to visit the first three days you're there. The other few choices you get are only about food and don't affect anything at all.\n\nThis game was also incredibly short, with only two choices - I knew this going in, but I assumed that if there were only going to be two choices, then maybe the storyline would be more... in depth, more drama, more this and that.\n\nI enjoyed this game for the few, few hours I played it, and the art was cute and I enjoyed reading the Japanese text along with the English text.

Only the player's character is drawn poorly, making it very hard at some points not wishing to punsh him in the face :D Nevertheless he also has his bright moments working well with the character progresses of Makoto and Akira.\n\nThe locations are well chosen and drawn. Even if the game itself is more like a digital comic (only few interactive parts) the little options to choose from and the two different endings bring up a nice replayability lacking in similar games like Sakura Spirit. On the top the player gets some nice and interesting facts about Japan's history, its locations around Tokyo and some cultural facts. Also some japanese phrases can be learned while playing.\n\nLong story short: Whoever likes these kind of japanese graphical novel games or is interested in japanese culture should try this beautiful game. Unlike Sakura Spirit the focus on boobs and nudity is - beside two scenes - between very low and zero, serving the game's heart-warming dating part very well.\n\nBuy. install and enjoy this short digital trip to Japan.

Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~" is yet another title put out by MangaGamer (That's right, the eroge guys) and OverDrive. Unlike OverDrive's previous production, this is much more...educational. Learning about Japan with hospitality provided by two kawaii sisters sounds like quite the ideal visit, right? That question will determine your enjoyment of this game, and whether or not it warrants your investment.\n\nOf course, you are a "filthy gaijin", for lack of political correctness, and your objective is rather simple: Go around Japan. Learn some history, and have copious amounts of fun while at it. Throughout the duration of your week in Japan, one of the two sisters (or both) will take you around notable places of the country, and intrigue you with some history and other facts about the place or landmark in question. A lot of the things in this game are basic knowledge that most people might have learned in high school or college, but OverDrive does make the effort to squeeze in some facts or speculations that you probably are not familiar with, and I commend them greatly for that. Added to the charm of the two sisters that will be embellished during the course of the game, it makes for a familiar, yet amiable experience that I think most VN fans will get a kick out of.\n\nThere is a bit more context to this game though, and that is the light romance that starts protruding from the main backdrop around the final third of the game. It isn’t very elaborate or urgent like in a true romance visual novel, but it’s concise, sweet, and serves as a little refrain that love triumphs cultural differences. It’s well written indeed, but to some extent the circumstances are not realistic. Unless you are one hell of a weeaboo that believes he is fated to meet his true lover on the other side of the world, the notion of being involved an intimate relationship in a completely foreign country within ONE WEEK will be questioned. After all, I think it bears stressing that this is just an ordinary traveler’s story other than the fact you are temporarily living with two cute girls you just happened to meet on the Internet. (Perhaps I am letting my crude superstitions cloud my judgement, but it can't be helped to overthink it a little. Oh well.). That doesn’t mean this game does not have a plausible change of pace, which it definitely does when it starts shifting its gears upon learning more and more personal things about the two siblings. Despite the small nitpicks I have, the romance is well-done overall, and honestly, I couldn’t think of a more satisfying ending.\n\nMakoto best Nippon\n\nShould you ever spot a sale on “Go! Go!

A VN on Steam! Although a rare sight, it's always a welcome one. Especially considering that this is from MangaGamer, their first game on Steam. Props to them for bringing the title to Steam, hope to see more in the future.\n\nAnyways, Go! Go! Nippon! is a semi-educational VN in which two beautiful girls give you a tour of some of Japan's popular sightseeing spots. A lot of the game is about Japanese history, with the other half being the development of a relationship with either of the two girls giving you the tour. I know little about Japanese history (I do, however, know a lot about its culture), making this game quite the enlightening experience. Now if only I could get the rest of my education taught through this format...\n\nAside from the game's educational aspect, there's also the relationship aspect. It may not be as large of an aspect as I had wanted, but it was enough for me to sit through the game's lecturing. The game opens with the protagonist landing in Japan and meeting up with two friends he had met online. Unknown to him, both friends are girls. Sisters, actually, who you'll be staying with for the duration of your visit. Coincidentally, their parents are gone on some trip and won't be back until your stay is over, one week.\n\nYou'll end up building a relationship with one of them, depending on the locations you choose to visit while staying in Japan. That aspect was a bit annoying, as I didn't know which of the two I'd be spending more time with. You're given no info about which girl corresponds to each location. I ended up going down a route I did not particularly want to. Well, that just adds to the replayability of the game, right? I'd say that 99% of VNs are developed with replayability in mind, as is Go! Go! Nippon! Playing through the game multiple times finally netted me the result I had wanted.\n\nThe game's art is fantastic. The characters and backdrops are great. There was no voice acting, which was a bit disappointing at first. Even if it was in Japanese (which I was originally expecting), I'd still prefer for it to be added. Instead, all dialogue is shown in both Japanese and English, which was quite cool. I've never seen a VN do that before. The game's music sounded rather generic, like it had been recycled from elsewhere. That said, I'd still like a soundtrack download, even if the tracks are recycled.\n\nOverall, I can highly recommend Go! Go! Nippon! I'd love to see more VNs on Steam, especially some of those already available from MangaGamer (Shuffle! anyone?). Maybe we'll see more MangaGamer titles in the future.

It demonstrates the possible objects and facts you may engage during your 1st time visiting Japan (well, if you haven’t got much acknowledge of them). For example, you may stand in front of a vending machine for some time trying to figure out why not only it serves drinks but also sells bunches of snacks you’ve never seen before and packs of all kinds of cigarettes. Seriously? And putting too much Wasabi in your plate and eat them altogether is dangerous, because it will get you and your food both killed. Okay! And take an extra caution before travelling alone to the famous Tokyo station in order to avoid constantly getting lost and failed to catch your train. Get lost in a train station? What a hell? Are you certain? Hey! Wait a minute!\n\nMy boyfriend has his prospective of the game wrote below.\n\nHi, guys! As Japanese myself I am pretty amazed by how detailed the information has been structured in this game. It pretty much covered majority of the stuff you may interact and may later be interested in Japan. Thus it’s a pretty convinced example of guiding people along the way before them literally coming over to it and suddenly experiencing the unpleasant “Culture Shock”. The game is honestly a good tour, far better than the most of the tour-guide books you can easily grab in a book shop. If you would like to visit Japan some times, and wondering what it looks like. I would recommend you play this game, even just for a manga version of its prospective. It’s fun and relaxing.\n\nAnd of course, my girlfriend wrote it above based on her experience as a foreigner, is realistic, and moreover, true to her heart.\n\nScarlet's Score: 8.3/10\nKen's Score: 8.5/10","January 29, 2015","true","19.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I just finished the game, ending up in the "Akira Route" on my first try. I assume that it was based on the number of times we went out sightseeing together. It was two times, Akihabara, and I forgot the other one. The order I chose to sightseeing was standard, first to last. Since I only got to choose 3 times. I chose the first on day one, second on day two, and so on. So Makoto - Akira - Akira - Both Girls - Akira. I expected I was able to see all the sightseeing spots that was in the list, but it turns out I didn't, and with that, I really think that's the "actual choice" to see whose route you're going down on.\n\nSo what's the game exactly? It's an educational visual novel! What I do like about the game is the "Show Photo Location" or whatever it was that when clicked, it prompts up your web browser and goes to google maps, and shows google 3D-perspective images...on most, since there are some areas that aren't covered with google gps cars or whatever they were.\n\nI've been seeing some discussions about explicit images, raep~, romance intensive, and shiz. Come on guys, is that how we think of Japan? Okay probably...but the game isn't that. There are only 2 ecchi scenes, and the rest are fine.\n\nSo overall...ye, quite educational. The visual novel is basically "How 2 Japan" in a nutshell. No complicated romance stuff, which I don't really find arguable nor I am disappointed. Since the title is named "Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~", so most likely you are gonna be a tourist. So ye, romance isn't a priority.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's the protagonist. MC is a ♥♥♥ imo. Somewhat sissy. But yea, that's intentional ofc. Anyways, great VN.\n\nGreat for a cheap trip immersion to Japan.

(SPOILERS BELOW!)\n\nStory:\n\nThere isn't much of a story to go over, You're a socially inept eyeless male (<-insert name of choice here) who's dream is to go to Japan, At some point in time you met two people in a chat room named Makoto and Akira who happen to live in Japan, after a discussion you decided visit them for one week.\n\nUpon your arrival you discover that Makoto and Akira are both girls (sisters to be exact) and not the big burly Japanese guys you thought they were, thus making a new standard that in Japan the gender trap can work both ways.\n\nSo for one week both girls take you to different locations of your choosing while providing facts about its culture and history (Your location choice determines which girl you go with).\n\nCharacters:\n\nIn my honest opinion, I didn't like the main character you play as, he comes off as a clutz while attempting to converse with the sisters, It gets really awkward towards the end when you get romantically involved with one of them and your character just stutters a lot as he admits his feelings. (Locations you choose determine which sister you fall in love with)\n\nMakoto and Akira on the other hand, I thought were pretty interesting, Both had solid personality traits different from one another, Makoto being the polite and sweet older sister who's good at English, but she can't cook to save her life, Akira being the sassy yet bashful younger sister who's horrible at English, but she's a master of culinary arts and clothing design.\n\nMy one complaint, their personalities’ could of been fleshed out a bit more, considering the fact you end up dating one of them at the end of the game, It just felt like you confessed deep feelings for someone you barely know outside of being a good host/travel guide.\n\nPerformance:\n\nThis game had a few minor performance issues on my pc, Mainly with the steam in-game interface which succumbed to a lot of latency or flat-out froze forcing me to ctrl+alt+delete the game exe, Adding more fuel to the fire the skip button glitches out sometimes, forcing me to power click my way through sections I already read.\n\nScenery/Graphics:\n\nThe game included some nice artwork for the characters along with some cool tourism sites to explore; however, I feel they didn't provide enough sprites for the characters or sites of interest for each location, which made things a tad repetitive in the visual department.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis game is a unique experience, many games out there have tried to be educational while being fun but ended up being very boring, this game is spared of the boring factor by keeping you interested with soft-core hentai while dumping facts about Japans history on you, Feeling like spending money and hate going to Wikipedia? This game is your calling card.\n\n\nThis game gets 8 HNNGH!!'S out of 10.","March 4, 2014","true","7.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Go! Nippon!. It was Monster Girl Quest 3 that set the benchmark for how visual kawaii novels looked and played in the HD era. It was Monster Girl Quest 2 that redefined the FPS as all-action blockbuster, while transforming PC single-player. So it’s a shame to report that Go! Go! Nippon! doesn’t set any new benchmarks or redefine anything. When OverDrive dropped Monster Girl Quest 3 to kick off a new series it could have given the franchise a brand new start. Instead we have something that’s less a reboot than a remake, giving us everything we expect from a Go! Go! Nippon! turned up to eleven, but nothing more.\n\nThe premise is interesting, albeit faintly ridiculous. In the near future a new power – The Toliet – rises the water from the bowl and swirls around.  Your character is shocked by the advancement that the Japanese aquired in their technology, For ten years your weeaboo habits have exceeded in a positive manner, allowing you a trip to Japan for quite some time. Aided by two girls who acompany you through your journeys. The single-player campaign charts the story of you showing up in Japan from a train, and after a short prolouge, are acompanied by two females. One with a large pair of brests that have obviously been over detailed to draw your eyes to, and a flat chested but unrealistic personality female.\n\nIn theory – and in OverDrive PR campaign – this sounds brilliant. You’re not fighting or doing anything interesting, but as a beta weeaboo who travels to Japan is hilarious. In practice, though, it’s all still business as usual, with access to the ladies, air support and high-tech gadgets, and missions covering all the usual infiltrate this, run to this point, visit this place tomfoolery.\n\nWhat saves the game is its spectacle. OverDrive seems to have invested heavily in engine tech to make the scenery plants, intense sound effects, absolutely interesting dialouge and no level is complete without something big doing all of these things, often all at once when you’re running-and-gunning through it. When things aren’t getting wrecked, we get sudden erotica, This makes each mission like the climax of a blockbuster action movie, and while the effect is wearying spread out over the running time, it’s a great game to play one mission at a time. You know you’ve seen it all before, but you’ve never seen it quite this big.","March 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

The game consists of picking places to tour and having some awkward moments because anime stuff like walking in on people changing clothes happens. The information the game gives about Japan is pretty neat, though some of it might not still be current (I personally have no idea). And eventually, of course, it ends in a romance plot with the girl you spent the most time with. Hooray.\n\nAs generic and predictable as everything is, it's not necessarily bad either. It's a short little VN where you may learn a few things, which isn't exactly common.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrouya/recommended/251870/","Chrouya","Chrouya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrouya/","558 products in account","Go! Go! Nippon! was the first title that MangaGamer published on Steam, and me being a vivid VN player and Japanese Studies student, I instantly felt the need to get this game. At first, this seemed like a perfect start for Visual Novels to appear on Steam, especially after other titles like Analogue and its sequel, Hate Plus. But after going through all of it, I'm not sure whether this is worth your time.\n\nThis game feels more like a kinetic visual novel, with choices that don't really make a difference. You can go through the whole story without saving a single time, but because of forced branching you'll have to go through it twice (blind choices however). Basically, the estimate as given by the VNDB is correct (2 to 10 hours). Is paying 10 dollars worth this gameplay time? Up to you to decide. The characters are quite stereotypical but on the other hand, you can enter your own name, which might be quite to your liking. I just wished that they also showed the Japanese price (instead of just your own currency) when buying something, since you most likely will be carrying only Japanese yen with you while you travel.\n\nSo why do I not recommend this game? Basically, I found it a bit too short for my liking (at least Europeans tend to travel for at least 2 weeks when going this far abroad), but there's something that was bugging me more. The translation quality. I found it very lacking and so did other friends of mine who are proficient at Japanese. I made several screenshots that show obvious grammatical mistakes that usually only beginners would make. Since this game is actually giving both the Japanese and the English text, it's supposed to be aimed for Japanese language learners (you would have no other reason otherwise), but this definitely backfires instead.\n\nAnother thing is that the game is already quite dated. While the game released on Steam this February, it was first released in September 2011. At one point of the story, they're talking about the Tokyo Skytree, which was yet to be opened on the time of the release, but it's one of the most popular tourist attractions nowadays. I also felt like they're not talking enough about the typical spots too. Not a single word about Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea, and even the 109 building at the Shibuya Scramble Crossing. Kinkaku-ji was greatly praised, but no word of it's counterpart, Ginkaku-ji.\n\nIf you feel like you might go to Japan for the first time someday, with Tokyo as main destination, and love to have some nice fantasy about it beforehand, pick it up if you think it's worth the money. If you're already studying Japanese, chances are you know most of it already, and this will make you kind of annoyed at some times. The main protagonist is a know-all when it comes to Japanese, but is a complete blockhead when it comes to the culture. It's also feels incomplete, so if you want a great guide...Just buy an actual guidebook. Or else...Just find some Japanese tour guides in real life. It's not that hard if you look for backpacker or couchsurf sites out there.","June 30, 2014","false","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It doesn't even have any gameplay or choices that would require you to remember any of the information presented.\n\nThe game seemingly pretends to involve some kind of money management simulation, but actually contains no such thing. All the money you "spend" is shown on screen, and the girls will explain ad nauseam the different options for train tickets and whatnot, and where you can go if you need to withdraw cash, but none of it ever comes to anything. There was exactly one time where I had to choose how to spend money (on a restaurant meal), and zero times where I needed to concern myself with topping up my prepaid train pass, or visiting an ATM, or... well, anything else the game beats you over the head with. If the intention was to teach practical information for prospective tourists, shouldn't that be, like, incorporated into the game somehow? I probably would have remembered it for more than ten seconds that way.\n\nThere are two girls to choose from, and by choose I mean you can save scum while blindly picking which area to visit, and hope the right one is the assigned tour guide for that region. After three days whoever has guided you the majority of the time is apparently locked in as your waifu, but you are forced to slog through two or three more days of information about random crap until you get to the end. I assume if you opt for the twelve-year-old tsundere, you just go to prison instead of living happily ever after, but I'm not going back and playing it again to confirm.\n\nThere are many spots where a well-placed dialogue choice could have steered you towards one or the other in a logical way, but instead your character just has a mind of his own. There is even a scene where the girls ask you to pick out costumes for them, and emphasize how seriously you should take the choice... and then there is no choice. Another where the older girl, a terrible cook, wants to help prepare dinner, and her sister doesn't want her help. Your character just gives his opinion without your input. The mind boggles at how such obvious opportunities could have been missed.\n\nIf a visual novel can't be bothered providing meaningful choices, then at least it should have a compelling story. If all else fails, it could at least, I suppose, give you something to fap to. This game has none of the above. Its sole use lies in streaming it and sharing the misery with friends while making jokes at its expense.","June 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

But Surprise PLOT TWIST the 2 guys are actually girls, our Hero misinterpreted the names as guy names. hahaha\nSo they let him sleep at their house and show him arround. You get to choose what sight you want to visit\n\nOfc there will be a romance between the protagonist and one of the 2 girls.. i mean its a novel all right.  ^-^ (the side romance parts are actually pretty good)\n\nPro:\n- Money system. At the start of the game you can add your value to yen price. (eg 1€ = 100000 yen or use realistic values like the current ones). When the protagonist spents money on sth it gets calculated in the end of the day. The prices are more or less realistic prices, so you will see how expensive a trip to japan will be if you dont have to pay for a place to stay, realy awesome for those who plan to visit japan.\n- Actually explains about history and habbits a bit\n- Cute romance story\n- Realy good €/h value if you play every sight and considder the information you get.\n- Good backgrounds used\n- Cute character design\n- Realy good Music\n- Protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥\n\nCon:\n- Not realy 100% all ages, there are 2 short barely dressed scenes, which are hilarious and i don't considder too bad, but im counting this as con as its not appropiate for children to see (still, its like 1 or 2 minute maximum of the whole game)\n- Protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ^^\n\n~95/100 due to heavy educational value, planing value and fun in general.

The other complaints I have about this game is that there are things he finds really special about Japan that are fairly common in the Netherlands. I don't know about other countries though. But I think that hot water from the tap is fairly normal, shops in train stations is quite common as well and I don't think 14 platforms at a station in Tokyo is all that much.

As for the Visual Novel aspect - the plot is pretty straight-forward for such a short title. Either go around more and end up with love interest 1 or 2 (Go! Go! Akira-chan!). The animation, or more like the lack of it, is bad. There are very few backgrounds and sprites and sometimes the scenery is just black which is awkward... Although I do admit that the pictures that the game DOES have are pretty nice. As for the nudity tag and age confirmation I can only laugh as the VN has none of it. Still the logo of Mangagamer is up front so this could be an all-age version of an eroge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuatari/recommended/251870/","Fuatari","「Ｂｏｋｕ♥」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuatari/","552 products in account","Go! Go! Nippon! is a short visual novel most likely intended to be more educational or at least to lend a somewhat idealised insight of a trip to Japan rather than to be a standalone story. The cast is downright minimal, CG usage sparse and quality of the writing quite basic. However, as much as its possible to reprimand its simplicity it can just as much be a positive note -- it feels as though this would make a neat little "My First VN".\n\nThe novelty of GGN! comes from its usage of a dual text box showing both English and original Japanese text. For anyone interested in learning or, perhaps more adequately, someone who has a moderate knowledge of the language it makes a nice reference point. If I had any criticism of this it was that it wasn't possible to hide one or the other languages on the fly (to practice reading and translating) and there was no option to enable furigana for the more complex/rare kanji to really make it stand out as a learning aid. A full AGTH-like interface such as the ability to hover individual words/kanji and see more detailed information would have really made it useful for this, although this could have been achieved manually by playing with a dictionary in hand.\n\nThe protagonist is very much meant to be a self-insert for the player: someone who wishes to visit Japan and knows odd bits of the history and customs through anime as well as a bit of study; punctuated in moments where some of their expectations get shot down when reality has been stretched by the fiction they know. The only real sense of disbelief here is that while they claim to have done a "little bit of study" on the language, they speak damn near fluently save for plot, learning or surprise. The two girls of the game -- Makoto and Akira -- are very much cardboard cutouts of standard anime personalities: the knowledgeable and understanding older sister and the tsundere, slightly tomboyish younger sister. As far as writing is concerned I cant really fault either of them as much as I cant really find much interesting or unique about them. Its almost clinical. The romance between either one of them feels rather contrived also. More dialog/choices during trips with them probably wouldve done well to blur this a bit.\n\nAnyone who has been to Japan may find themselves relating or reminiscing with the protagonist, their mindset and any revelations they encounter (the teeming trains and scarcity of ATMs being mine) but, as I say, this VN is most likely intended for people who havent had the opportunity to visit and are willing to play a short VN on the subject as a form of self-tortu-- motivation.\n\nTheres a number of VNs out there I can and would recommend to people not interested in Japan, anime or even the culture at all but (and this probably goes without saying) this is not one of them. It feels a cop-out to end a review like this, but if you even think youll like this game then you likely will. GGN! is very much a game built for people who would be interested in the first place. Theres no hidden gems here, just a VN thats so on the nose you may as well call it Pinocchio.","September 28, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has the pretence of being a infomational game all bout Japan, and gives you countless completely useless facts like specific oyster card savailable for the underground train system of inner Tokyo. All facts will be forgotten in a few minutes, guaranteed, tbqh I wouldn't even recommend trying to remember them. The two girls who "show you Japan" consist of a tsundere and a nee-san character archetypes. While not being particularly exciting anyway, they aren't even very well done and continuously break their character. One minute she'll be all tsun-tsun'ing and dere-dere'ing, and then she'll suddenly switch to robot mode and start listing different ♥♥♥♥ing post office branches you can find arounf Tokyo.\n\nI think the reason most people will buy this is because they want to get into the world of VNs. If that is the case go elsewhere, this is nothing at all like the genre, go play some Key VN or something. If you want to laugh at weebs and cringe a lot, then perfect, pay your money and enjoy minutes of fun.

There is also NO SEX (H-scenes) at ALL, don't be mislead! If you want boobies and sex in your game, The Witcher series is a great first start. Snowdrop is also good choice.\n\nThis game truely falls into the Visual Novel category, those looking for more "interaction" or choices that affect the outcome are going to be very disappointed. The lack of voice acting also put a damper on the experince. Its basically a well illustrated "E-book"\n\nThat being said this game does exactly what it says it would do, give you a "guided tour" of certain parts in Japan. However I must throw in that just a quick look on google will get you more images of the sites mentioned in this game. They could have done much more, there are many scenes in the game where you are looking at clouds, when they could be showing you just what is being talked about, or what is happening.\n\nThe "love sim" aspect is basically non existant and seems rather thrown on at the end. Those looking for something along the lines of "Snowdrop"(which is the only love sim I have really played) will also be disappointed. I am still not sure how you can chose a specific partner, I guess its the tourist destinations you chose that have an impact. To its credit the endings do pull at your heart strings, slightly but it does evoke some form of reaction, I doubt anyone is going to burst into tears (happy or sad) at the ends.\n\nI would give this game an 7.5/10 rating, it does what its meant to do and does it well, however its rather limited choices for player and interaction in general limit its replayability. I am certainly pleased with my purchase of this game but it could have done more than what it did, there was a lot of missed potential here but at its current price I cannot complain. If it was any higher my "score" would drop quite a bit.","March 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is also NO SEX (H-scenes) at ALL, don't be mislead! If you want boobies and sex in your game, The Witcher series is a great first start. Snowdrop is also good choice.\n\nThis game truely falls into the Visual Novel category, those looking for more "interaction" or choices that affect the outcome are going to be very disappointed. The lack of voice acting also put a damper on the experince. Its basically a well illustrated "E-book"\n\nThat being said this game does exactly what it says it would do, give you a "guided tour" of certain parts in Japan. However I must throw in that just a quick look on google will get you more images of the sites mentioned in this game. They could have done much more, there are many scenes in the game where you are looking at clouds, when they could be showing you just what is being talked about, or what is happening.\n\nThe "love sim" aspect is basically non existant and seems rather thrown on at the end. Those looking for something along the lines of "Snowdrop"(which is the only love sim I have really played) will also be disappointed. I am still not sure how you can chose a specific partner, I guess its the tourist destinations you chose that have an impact. To its credit the endings do pull at your heart strings, slightly but it does evoke some form of reaction, I doubt anyone is going to burst into tears (happy or sad) at the ends.\n\nI would give this game an 7.5/10 rating, it does what its meant to do and does it well, however its rather limited choices for player and interaction in general limit its replayability. I am certainly pleased with my purchase of this game but it could have done more than what it did, there was a lot of missed potential here but at its current price I cannot complain. If it was any higher my "score" would drop quite a bit.","March 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The storyline was also cute, and I think you can get with both girls based on what cities you go to, but I am not too such; I got with Akira in the end.

As the "About This Game" section says: "a guidebook in game format!"\n\nPlaying through this game brought a lot of nostalgia of my times in Japan. Some information is outdated, like the SUICA and PASMO cards (there's an app for both!), but I guess that's to be expected from a guide made back in 2011. It has it's amusing moments due to some really cliche moments, but I guess that's its charm. If you're interested in visiting Japan, I think this game is a good introduction to the culture as well as some tourist locations. However, it's definitely not something to rely, since it's not your own personal experience.","May 12, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nippon! is a visual novel about a guy from an ambiguous country that takes a sightseeing tour around Japan (mostly Tokyo) with the help of two Japanese girls. This game is a bit of an oddity. There's actually very little gameplay here; you make roughly five choices throughout the whole experience.\n\nMost of this novel consists of an animated, factual tour guide of Japanese hot spots, complete with history lessons. I found it pretty interesting, if a little dry at times. It was pretty neat to see Shibuya, which I remember from two other games I've played (The World Ends With You and SMT: Devil Survivor). This game tries really hard to capture the feel of everyday events in Tokyo, and it was cool to see all of these things described in great detail and in a way that points out things that foreigners would find unique.\n\nYou might also expect some romance from this description, and if so, you'd be correct. The places you visit determine which girl accompanies you, and you end up with the one that accompanied you the most. I only played through once, and I saw a little over half the content. The romance plot is not that interesting and ends before it really blooms. I kind of wish it was left out, especially the more, well, risque images. (Ecchi, I think. Not quite hentai.)\n\nSo basically, if you're looking for a fun game, this isn't one. This is a visual novel about being a tourist in Japan stapled to a romantic manga story. It only took me about 90 minutes to get through one playthrough, so it's a pretty quick experience. All in all, if you can enjoy a visual novel and you have some interest in Japan, I can recommend this. Not at $10, though... wait for a Steam sale. If my description didn't sound interesting to you, then this simply isn't for you and it won't be worth your time or money.","July 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I love this visual novel. It teaches you about a lot of cool locations and aspects of Japan. Quite frankly you could experience culture shock just by playing this. If you want a laid back VN that's actually full of really cool trivia and facts about Japan, you should definitely pick this up.\n\nHowever, if you do pick it up, I recommend getting it with the 2015 DLC. That DLC improves the game tenfold in pretty much all areas while also doubling the content. I went from 6 hours to 15 hours (and still going) because I want to do multiple playthroughs. This allows me to visit all of the locations, discover all of the CG, and read all of the dialogue. The 2015 DLC is pretty much the Brave New World of Civilization, so it's definitely really recommended to get.\n\nThere are a couple slight and brief NSFW factors to this game. They only last like, five seconds each and there's two sections where it'll happen. Just make sure you're not playing with someone in the room! (once you get the second one, though, you're in the clear.)\n\nThere are some other little details behind this game but I think they should be discovered as you go in.\n\nRemember, this is a visual novel, if you don't like reading and looking at pictures then don't bother. It's really silly when people buy a visual novel and go "Wtf? This isn't a game!"","October 27, 2015","true","21.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

I bought Go! Go! Nippon! as part of a bundle and was eager to try it out in hopes of seeing a unique mix of story, characters, and culture. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.\n\nThe characters were shallow and unneccesarily awkward, with juvenile writing and dialogue that seemed like it was built for an almost illiterate teenage audience. The plot (outside of sightseeing in Japan) was nonexistent. The only decisions the player gets to make revolve around which sights to go see and the relationship aspect of the game seems contrived and more than a little bit forced.\n\nIf you're looking for something to give you a hint of Japan's culture you might enjoy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tottori/recommended/251870/","tottori","Hillard Rabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tottori/","669 products in account","Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ is an unusual experiment that trades heavily on novelty but fails to leave a lasting impression.\n\nThe game presents itself as a tourist guidebook-esque visual novel intended for English-speaking audiences--this being rather alien territory for the genre--with all the trappings of the genre. Indeed, the attractive (albeit limited) art, interface and scenario design are rooted in the traditions of the Japanese visual novel. Unforunately, the experience is too brief and the informational aspect too slim; the game falls short of both of its propositions.\n\nWhile the premise is intriguing, the characters are archetypal and the attempts at comedy and romance are tired and toneless. The main character--a foreigner homestaying with a pair of Japanese siblings--is merely a palette swap of the garden-variety protagonists found in lesser Japanese visual novels. His amorous leanings disappoint with their banal outcomes, and the girls fare no better. Makoto is a classical Japanese housewife-type whose prinicpal character flaw is an apparent inability to follow a recipe. Akira is a stand-offish, zesty younger sister whose conflicted romantic intentions toward the main character are too expected and textureless to muster any emotion in the player.\n\nThe game scenario branches into two storylines focusing on either girl, though the player receives no warning of how the limited choices to be made over the course of the game lead to which unaffecting outcome. The overall narrative has a distinct back-patting tone when mention is made of various technologies employed throughout Tokyo. The protagonist's constant amazement of Japanese technological progress and paradisiacal protrayal of Japanese life should strike any player familiar with the reality of living in Japan as disingenuous and irresponsible.\n\nAs a resource for would-be tourists, there is still more disappointment in store. The various guided tours of areas within Tokyo (and a few out-of-prefecture day trips) feel spartan and excessively-curated. Visits to points of interest within a given locale can be counted on one hand, and each day of the week's adventure ends before it seems to have begun. Wikipedia offers a more comprehensive study of the various neighborhoods of Tokyo than can be found in this game.\n\nThe game allows for currency conversions for all transactions in the game, ostensibly to fascilitate budgeting for a similar trip, but the usefulness of the feature is destroyed by how many costs are overlooked. That the protagonist lodges with a Japanese family--at no cost to him, one must presume--disregards one of the most significant expenses of a trip to Japan. Sadly, the greater preoccupation of the scenario writer was clearly the trite romantic comedy woven between the educational passages.\n\nThe music is servicable fare, limited to a handful of tunes that never become grating, if only due to the brevity of the game. Characters do not speak their lines, and aside from occasional sound effects, the background music is left to carry the scenes--a challenge far beyond its capacity.\n\nA small offering of bonus features becomes availabe at the end of the first playthrough, though these provide little incentive to return to the shopworn storyline.\n\nFans of novelty and experimentation will find some redeeming qualities in what Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ has accomplished, but anyone looking for a captivating narrative or a useful resource for planning a stay in Japan would be better served by almost anything else.","February 26, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Google maps link is nice and innovative. Food sketches are rather pleasing however. The girls are nothing special and just serve to be usual cardboard cutout sisters recycled over and over as Japan is known famously for, the sweet heart kudere and the yandere.\n\nWriting - 5/10\nDoes a good job of explaining Japan and it's culture. However there are some typos and some English saying's thrown in that serve no purpose and just seem completely off e.g. "That's totally metal". Don't come in expecting voice acting, because there is non! Furthermore the usual tropes are here that anyone would expect. It seems that all eastern women think western men think of nothing but engaging in sexual acts with anything that has a pulse. The gags are also terribly cringy and poorly implemented.\n\nStory - 5/10\nSets out be a organised trip of Japan but ends up being more like an interactive propaganda video for Japan which isn't a problem in itself but this odd love narrative they try to string in is. It's all completely out of place considering they only did it to draw in a more pervese audience and give you a reason just to struggle through days if talking about Japanese history isn't you thing.\n\nGameplay - 1/10\nWhat do you expect? Interactive slideshow. But if you like VN's then this is up your street.\n\nFeels - 8/10\nCharacters grew on me like wart.\n\nVodka's Overall Rank - 7/10\nWould only recommend to hardcore VN's lovers.

Google maps link is nice and innovative. Food sketches are rather pleasing however. The girls are nothing special and just serve to be usual cardboard cutout sisters recycled over and over as Japan is known famously for, the sweet heart kudere and the yandere.\n\nWriting - 5/10\nDoes a good job of explaining Japan and it's culture. However there are some typos and some English saying's thrown in that serve no purpose and just seem completely off e.g. "That's totally metal". Don't come in expecting voice acting, because there is non! Furthermore the usual tropes are here that anyone would expect. It seems that all eastern women think western men think of nothing but engaging in sexual acts with anything that has a pulse. The gags are also terribly cringy and poorly implemented.\n\nStory - 5/10\nSets out be a organised trip of Japan but ends up being more like an interactive propaganda video for Japan which isn't a problem in itself but this odd love narrative they try to string in is. It's all completely out of place considering they only did it to draw in a more pervese audience and give you a reason just to struggle through days if talking about Japanese history isn't you thing.\n\nGameplay - 1/10\nWhat do you expect? Interactive slideshow. But if you like VN's then this is up your street.\n\nFeels - 8/10\nCharacters grew on me like wart.\n\nVodka's Overall Rank - 7/10\nWould only recommend to hardcore VN's lovers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noobpower96/recommended/251870/","noobpower96","Noobpower96","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noobpower96/","979 products in account","My experience with Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ was a rollercoaster of a ride. I learned a lot about Japan and the ways of the Japanese people. I appreciate the art and music that gently portrayed the calm and serene atmosphere in the Japanese cities and buildings that the story took place. The templates used for the characters did not feel outdated or stale which contributed to the overrall storyline in a positive way. It almost felt like I was there.\n\nI started off my adventure with choosing my name. I chose the clever and witty name of "Onii-chan," which I have heard so many times in other Japanese mediums. An interesting design mechanism that the developers implemented was that all text in the story that was referring to me added "Onii-chan". This enveloped as I felt like I was in the game. I can't believe the level of immersion that this game has presented to the market.\n\nThis game presented a twisted and joking tone right off the bat, as I was plunged into thinking I was going to "hang out with my bros" in Japan, which I had previously met in an online chat room. The developers even provided sillhouettes of said bros. Well I was in for a surprise when a young girl appeared before me and presented herself as the "bro" I was waiting for. Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ threw a curve ball in my visual novel experience that I was not expecting, but was pleasantly surprising.\n\nWhen I started my journey, the game's text was presented in English, which was midly disappointing to me. The reason I decided to order Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ was due to recent Japanese animations (anime) that I have been watching, such as my favorite, Boko No Pico. Well, the game developers in their infinite visual novel wisdom decided to have all characters talk in Japanese. Although the game can be read in English, a Japanese alternative was displayed on top in a separate box. I have been wanting to learn Japanese because of the Japanese animations I have been watching, and this novel has definitely helped me.\n\nCharacter development has enriched the way I view myself as a person, and the world around me. The main character started his experience in Japan with a viewpoint that things would be the same as in his home country of The United States of America. He was met with the surprise that even the most simple things were not the same as what he expected. One example would be that simple things such as toilets are completely different (which led to an uncomfortable but humorous encounter which I still find myself chuckling about). There was also a separate event that happened, where the main character thought that the world outside was dangerous at night like in the United States. Well soon after he realized that it was extremely safe, against what he had grown up knowing. After playing Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~, I look at things at different angles and learned to question the world around me.\n\nOverall, this game was a cultural masterpiece that helped me envision Japan, which I have been wanting to do for quite some time now. I would recommend anyone that has even the most slight interest of Japanese culture to try this visual novel. It has given me insight into the Japanese culture, and provided wonderful, humorous, and witty dialect the entire adventure.","April 3, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I heard it was educational and usually that doesn't mean much fun.\n\nIt is educutional and as a learning tool it would be good for learning to read some Japanese, speaking it probably not so much as there are no voice overs. Lots of Japanese history of Tokyo and Kanto regions.\n\nFear not it's also got 2 charming characters to keep you entertained. Though I found the younger sister (refraining from names simply to not spoil a minor detail) a bit cliche, Ironically I also liked her the most.\nThe older sister seemed more realistic.\n\nIt has some ecchi (not nudity just teaser stuff) scenes which at first took me out of the experience mainly because you get them rather early on, but I also felt the VN would have been a bit more boring without them...\n\nWell if you hate VN's or just the Japanese culture in general (I have no idea why you are here then) then this probably won't change your mind. If you tend to like VN's then keep in mind this will be more educational than others which you might find less fun.\n\nIf you have an interest at all in learning the japanese culture and history it's great while also providing more entertainment than... well taking a class on Japanese =P.","February 22, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But a lack of focus caused the game to be very uninteresting in both elements.\n\nThe girls are cute. But the artist seems to emphasize too much on the waifus, and didn't put enough effort into the enviroment. I, for one, would love to see and know more about Japan, which this game really lacks a lot of picures of. For one, when you first arrived to the airport, your tour guide will hand you a "SUICA" card which are the prepaid card you will be using for a lot of places in this trip... without showing you at least a picture of the card itself.\n\nAll the things describe in this game that are supposed to be informative only touched the surface for each topics. Also, the tour guides treat you as a tourist from America/Europe, who speak perfect Japanese, visitng Japan for the first time without any common knowledge about that place what-so-ever before arriving to the country.\n\nIt contains some useful information if you are planning to go to Japan for a tour some time soon, but a well-researched itinerary done on the internet is way better and more informative than this.\n\nMy score: 3/10","November 3, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

(I have yet to play fading hearts & analogue a hate story though which both look like they'll be quite good.) The idea of being a tourist visting Japan is quite an interesting story idea as it fits alot of people like me and very possibly yourself! The story is fairly interesting, and all the sightseeing spots are also very interesting to read about and seem to be fairly accurate. All the normal feautres of most VN's are here and work well, and the interfaces are all made fairly well not too clunky. There's not really any "H" scenes if that's your thing which is to expected of a game like this (definently on Steam) and really the game is better for not having any as it would take away from it I feel. (There is one scene for both where they're in slightly comprossed possitions, but no nudiety of any kind). The game it's self does use quite a few borrowed assiests from other OverDrive games though. I noticed alot of the music and quite a few backdrops being pulled right from Kira Kira which all and all isn't a bad thing, but I feel like some of the music didn't quite fit in as well as it did in Kira Kira. The game is rather short only taking around 4-5 hours to fully complete both routes, all the locations, and earn all the Gallery images. All in all though I quite enjoyed the game, and felt that it was worth money and would Recomend it to others who enjoy similar games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atata/recommended/251870/","atata","____________Michael____________","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atata/","197 products in account","This is a game about going to Japan. As someone who visited Japan in the winter of 2010, I can say without a doubt that the game simulates the experience to a tee. In fact, one of my first experiences in Japan, and one of the earliest scenes in the game, was encountering the infamous “squirty” toilet, or a bidet as the locals call it. The first thing I do when I visit any hotel room is to examine the bathroom. I saw the toilet and was immediately awestruck by the array of buttons on a panel. I remember pressing a button with a water spout symbol, wondering what, if anything, would happen. And something happened indeed. From the middle of the toilet emerged a rod that sprayed water in an upward fashion: in the direction of my face. The experience was akin to drinking from a water fountain but much, much better, a truly wonderful sensation. Think of the hottest summer day in recent memory and remember uncapping that icy bottle of Poland Spring and pouring it all over yourself, no inhibition, nothing holding you back from such momentary release from the unrelenting heat. It was that good. I bring up this little anecdote because the game does that to you. It pulled from the deepest recesses of my memory the wonderful times I had in Japan. But it does something better. It brings you to Japan in the company of two girls  who host you in their own home. While I don’t remember much about the women in Japan, besides the Santa dressed girl who grimaced and said KYA! in my presence, I think it accurately portrays the inherent friendliness and outgoing nature of the Japanese people. Just make sure you have money and are willing to spend it. In this context, the game mirrors real Japan but removes the possibility of airsickness, hotel and food expenses, and arrest. Go! Live that long held off dream of visiting Japan and buy this game. You won't regret your first trip nor will your regret your next.","August 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/recommended/251870/","tuttythefruity","Tutty The Fruity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/","527 products in account","The game sells itself as a guidebook to Japan in the form of a visual novel. It is effective as an educational/informative tool to a point, but an actual guide book would be preferable as this is a somewhat limited and distracting format. At the least, some unfamiliar terms will be introduced, inviting further research on the part of the reader if they do want to make the investment of a trip to Japan later.\n\nAs an edutainment game in VN form, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. The plot is fairly weak and often takes a back seat to informative anecdotes, though the love story threads are very complimentary to grasping particular aspects of the culture. The protagonist is enough of a massive dork to elicit entertainment value, ironically or otherwise.\n\nProduction values, with regards to art and music, are all solid and with no major flaws. I question why the need was felt to include overt adult fanservice in this, as removing it would not affect the overall length in any major capacity.\n\nI ended up enjoying this more than anticipated and find it recommendable as its own product. If you're interested in the culture of Japan, or like visual novels in general, you'll enjoy this. That said, it's worth acknowledging that it's not the most effective guidebook by any stretch of the imagination, and further reading is recommended; it has been catered to the VN-reading audience as an introduction, nothing more.","September 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kinglucha/recommended/251870/","kinglucha","Get.Bent.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kinglucha/","200 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hodtacpLf_4\nEver felt like watching anime isn’t enough insight to what it’s actually like to visit Japan? Well enter your name, step into the shoes of the ultimate otaku stereotype and experience what it’s like to trick two young girls into letting you stay with them while you take in the sights of Japan.\n\nThe story revolves around spending a week in Japan and selecting one of several areas available to go visit. One of the girls you stay with will escort you to the area to narrate information about the location and sometimes get up to “wacky” escapades while there. While I can concede I didn’t know a lot of the stuff that was brought up, for me personally It was met with an “oh~” or “huh…”. Maybe the writers thought this was all way more interesting that I did or I’m just emotionally repressed (I am English afterall), but the protagonist takes any small piece of information and exclaims that it’s the most amazing thing he’s ever heard… Usually followed by a variation on “Only in Japan…”. This and the awkward dating sim parts really let the game down, because while funny the first few times, it permeates every day of the game and just becomes tiresome. Whether the writers honestly thought all tourists are like this, either through imagination or personal experience (fanboys *can* be creepy), I got really bored of reading it.\n\nOne of the neat touches in the game is that the dialogue prints out in japanese as well as english, so if you're learning the language you can follow along without having to manually switch between languages, or use a translation program. If aimed at people actually interested in learning the language or after ideas for places to visit during a trip, then the game actually does a pretty good job at achieving its goal. Sadly, the seedy, awkward dating sim side story going on that really detracts from that and seems to overtake the guide aspect as the focal point.\n\nAt first I didn't even actually believe this was going to have a dating aspect to it. Aside from the protagonist being creepy enough to send any sane girl fleeing in terror, it just doesn't really feel like the romance takes a natural progression. The whole premise of the game is that he's there just to take in the sights and be a humble little tourist, but after a few days he starts inner monologues about which sister he prefers and "choosing" between them (because that's how true love works). This gives the game a really sinister vibe to it; that he’s there under false pretences to try and get together with one of the girls.\n\nVisual novels pretty much live and die by the quality of their story and/or characters, and on this front Go! Go! Nippon! is either going to bring mirth or migraines. The protagonist is established at the typical otaku right from the get go, completely at awe at everything Japan has to offer, including its toilets. The two girls have a few instances that make them tolerable, but their fawning over this abomination of a person cancels any of that out. Why they don’t throw him out onto the streets when he “accidentally” walks in on them in various states of undress really irked me.\n\nYes, the game goes there.\n\nThe game doesn’t exactly push any boundaries in the world of visual novels; it’s a standard character portraits and text boxes affair. It does keep track of the amount of money spent during the trip, though I never worked out why, money isn’t a finite resource in the game and doesn’t seem to influence any of the activities. Each day you get to choose which location you visit, and depending on where it is will influence which of the girls accompanies you. This in turn seems to affect the dating sim aspect; in that the girl you spent the most time with is the girl that’d like you. Outside of that, while you do get dialogue options you have very little influence on the story.\n\nMaybe the game is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, certainly at times it seems that way, but similarly at other times it felt like it was to be taken deadly seriously. It's a goofy little game that doesn't really tell the most fascinating story (you can pretty much guess what the entire game's going to be after the opening scene), and in terms of player interaction, it's pretty limited. I did have some fun with it, even if it was just seeing what holes the main character would dig himself into and how completely dumbfounded he seemed to be by the world at large.","June 23, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love this game.\n\nFrom a game that I bought as a joke and now stands as one of my favorite games of all time. 5/5 please buy.","June 7, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atata/recommended/251870/","atata","____________Michael____________","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atata/","197 products in account","This is a game about going to Japan. As someone who visited Japan in the winter of 2010, I can say without a doubt that the game simulates the experience to a tee. In fact, one of my first experiences in Japan, and one of the earliest scenes in the game, was encountering the infamous “squirty” toilet, or a bidet as the locals call it. The first thing I do when I visit any hotel room is to examine the bathroom. I saw the toilet and was immediately awestruck by the array of buttons on a panel. I remember pressing a button with a water spout symbol, wondering what, if anything, would happen. And something happened indeed. From the middle of the toilet emerged a rod that sprayed water in an upward fashion: in the direction of my face. The experience was akin to drinking from a water fountain but much, much better, a truly wonderful sensation. Think of the hottest summer day in recent memory and remember uncapping that icy bottle of Poland Spring and pouring it all over yourself, no inhibition, nothing holding you back from such momentary release from the unrelenting heat. It was that good. I bring up this little anecdote because the game does that to you. It pulled from the deepest recesses of my memory the wonderful times I had in Japan. But it does something better. It brings you to Japan in the company of two girls  who host you in their own home. While I don’t remember much about the women in Japan, besides the Santa dressed girl who grimaced and said KYA! in my presence, I think it accurately portrays the inherent friendliness and outgoing nature of the Japanese people. Just make sure you have money and are willing to spend it. In this context, the game mirrors real Japan but removes the possibility of airsickness, hotel and food expenses, and arrest. Go! Live that long held off dream of visiting Japan and buy this game. You won't regret your first trip nor will your regret your next.","August 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/recommended/251870/","tuttythefruity","Tutty The Fruity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/","527 products in account","The game sells itself as a guidebook to Japan in the form of a visual novel. It is effective as an educational/informative tool to a point, but an actual guide book would be preferable as this is a somewhat limited and distracting format. At the least, some unfamiliar terms will be introduced, inviting further research on the part of the reader if they do want to make the investment of a trip to Japan later.\n\nAs an edutainment game in VN form, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. The plot is fairly weak and often takes a back seat to informative anecdotes, though the love story threads are very complimentary to grasping particular aspects of the culture. The protagonist is enough of a massive dork to elicit entertainment value, ironically or otherwise.\n\nProduction values, with regards to art and music, are all solid and with no major flaws. I question why the need was felt to include overt adult fanservice in this, as removing it would not affect the overall length in any major capacity.\n\nI ended up enjoying this more than anticipated and find it recommendable as its own product. If you're interested in the culture of Japan, or like visual novels in general, you'll enjoy this. That said, it's worth acknowledging that it's not the most effective guidebook by any stretch of the imagination, and further reading is recommended; it has been catered to the VN-reading audience as an introduction, nothing more.","September 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As i was basking in the sunlight, on a mere whim, i came across this game and added it to my wishlist. A dear, generous, short, indian, fragile, friend saw that it was nearing the day that i was born. He took this chance and bought me this game. I went home and saw that green email box on steam. I have never asked so many questions in my life, but i preceded to install this mystery. I came in with a delicate mind and casualness of a shota being violated by large 6 limbs stickey monstergirls and came out with a mindset of a rengar going into the eyes of the death without any stacks and just a single passive jump with 10%hp trying to steal a penta kill on live broadcast. The point of my review is to say you get what you expect. You get a trip to the land of no return. You will always remember that you have a game like this. It is a part of you and you must embrace it. Thus concludes my review. I must now go visit puru!n and fuku.","September 19, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At 5$ it was probably slightly overpriced for the 4 hours I spent on the first playthrough.

I really feel like I just "broke even." I think many people won't find it as enjoyable as I did, however.

But as soon as it turns out they're two sisters, and their parents just so happen to be out for a few weeks (I think the sisters murdered them, or there were never any parents and now they're going to murder you), the perv-o-meter goes to max.\n\nThis plot and how it plays out is basically the daydream of a very lonely, socially-inept guy. That's not an insult, but the way the girls act, fawning over you, boobs and panties, the stumbling and awkwardness of the male/you, if you have a love life (or are gay male or straight female) it's hard to relate to the closet-fedora-wearing protagonist.\n\nIt actually started off well, and seemed like a cool guide to the little details in Tokyo, useful bits to know if you ever go there. I'm a fan of the Tokyo-set Yakuza series, which is half megabucks AAA critically-acclaimed epic cinematic action RPG and half tourism simulator, and while I'm hardly some otaku whose watched anime and reads manga, this seemed like something that should appeal to me 'cause Japan is cool. But the tourism kinda takes a back seat to the intricate, dramatic plot of 'which girl will fight hardest to be my waifu?'\n\nIt was funny how the protagonist reacted to normal things. I'm from the UK and have visited London, so spazzing out over contactless pre-paid travel cards and 24-hour shops (that sell FOOD! And MAGAZINES! IN THE SAME STORE!! OMG!!!) was out of place.\n\nGameplay, there is none, no real interaction, so plot and visuals are important. None of that here. The plot is as above and the visuals are bare minimum drawings, where half of what's described isn't shown. The feature to include a Google Maps button is cool, but nothing amazing.\n\nIt all ends as you'd expect: one or both of the girls have declared their undying love for you, say how amazing you (some guy who's travelled half the world to have some company) are, and then you go back without having banged either of them. Because the internet-hermit virgin is a gentleman, who thinks girls are delicate flowers with feelings who want long-distance relationships in chatrooms, and not equally horny fiends who sometimes just want to [censored] a dude's [censored] while being [censored] on a futon.\n\nI mean come on, two women find a guy on the internet, get him to come to their country and stay in their house all by themselves for a week. What's going to happen? Awkward stuttering over breakfast, shopping, and declarations of true love apparently...","September 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's Embarasing, almost painful, to watch a lot of the time; and I say watch because you're esentially dragged along without giving any input save one choice each day (well, really the first three days). The characters are completely without depth, kind of blank slates, except where they are extremely cliché or stupid. The main character is just painfully thickheaded.\n\nThere's some replayability value because you can't go to all of the places in one playthrough.\nThere's some useful information, it does feel kind of like a week in japan, you get a sense of the places you go to. But it's not really worth it for the poor dialogue and fanservice. I have been to Tokyo for a bit over a week and I think that the game gives you a pretty good feeling (albeit superficial) for what the places that they go to are like. The backgrounds/scenery is very good but I can't help but feel like for all the work that must have gone into the background paintings they could have made some more expressions for the characters.\n\nOverall it's a great idea that lacks a lot in execution. If you're interested in Japanese culture, you'd be better off buying a good guidebook, learn the language and go there.\n\nOveral did I enjoy playing the game? Yes, if only for the nostalgia of the places they go to.\nDo I regret buying it? No... but there are better games for 4 euro.\nCan I reccomend it to others? No, not with a clean conscience.","December 29, 2014","false","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I don't like traveling nor do I know japanese, learning about part of it's history (the Edo period, mostly) and culture was quite interesting and enjoyable.\n\nSo, the game is not long, and it doesn't try to be the best Visual Novel out there, but if you're interesed in Japan culture, you will enjoy this VN.","March 31, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character is unbearable, and seemingly incapable of normal conversation (not realised in such a way that would make it an interesting being-shy-simulator).\n\nThe only interesting thing is how Japanese their idea of how Westerners find Japan is. Of course they think that Japan is utterly unique, and we will be flumoxed by 24hr convenience stores and Oyster cards.\n\nBeyond awful. I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly enjoy something this terrible. Ever. Oh God, it's terrible on every possible level.","October 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nippon is a visual novel game that has a lot going for it, but there are some things buyers might need to know before you buy it.\n\nOne- The price\n\nAt this current time the game is selling for 3.49 on steam, which is not bad for a visual novel game which takes around three to four hours to complete. However any  higher than this and I would suggest you wait for it to go on sale again.\n\nTwo- The story\n\nThe story of the game is a love story hidden within facts about Japan. It's not a bad story and if really do read all the text you do start to feel what the main character is going through. However don't expect to reply this game over and over. The story has two girls and two endings where you fall in love with one of them. That's it. Nothing more. A third play through might be in order if you would like to go to every location you can. But after that you might not play again.\n\nThree-  Scene error\n\nAll visual novels have them, but here it's a little weird. At the very beginning of the story you land at the airport and are you can see your inside the airport lobby but then your main character says, "That land mass below us  must be Japan!" A little weird. But after this most scenes are ok and you accept them for what they are. (At the price of £3.49 that is. Otherwise you can find better looking images on web created visual novels)\n\nFour- Enjoyment\n\nGo Go Nippon certainly is  an experience and  an education if you don't know a thing about japan.(Like me) Sure it's got the scenes where you walk in on the girls changing. But I guess if you're not really interested in learning about japan then you've got to get your enjoyment somewhere right? But don't be fooled by thinking love gets in the way of your learning. It doesn't. In fact you do learn a lot before the love story part begins.\n\nSo to end this review I would recommend Go! Go! Nippon! to anyone wanting to have a bit of fun while learning facts about japan. However if your just going to race through it to find the love scenes then perhaps it's not for you. The joy of this game i found is taking your time and ignoring the skip button. Because if you do, you'll feel and understand the special moments between the main character and the two girls. And that's not just from a love view-point, but from a friends on a trip view-point too.\n\nAll in all, give it a try if your visual novel fan. It's not something you see everyday here on steam. Plus I think games like this focusing on other countries are entertaining and help give the player some history about the country.  I hope overdrive make more games like this about other countries as it's fun and interesting. But I also hope they think again about their pricing. Seven pounds for a game like this is a little steep. When there are visual novels out there that are free and give their player a little more to do.\n\nMy score for Go! Go! Nippon!\n\n8/10","February 28, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
