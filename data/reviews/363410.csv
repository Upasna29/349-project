Large spoilers ahead, so be warned.\n\n- The language came across as overly poetic to the point of being purple prose. For example, we get lines such as "The precious fabric was a rich shade of turquoise which transformed the glaring sun into a thousand stars." There's nothing wrong with clever metaphor, but it should be handled carefully, not swung around willy-nilly like a sledgehammer.\n\n- A great example of what the game does wrong comes in how it describes Kira, the heroine. You get a whole paragraph about how unbelievably perfect she is, from her 'porcelain face' all the way down to her 'piercing apple-green eyes, which penetrated through all pretense'. Firstly a character with no obvious imperfections is boring; secondly, it violates 'Show, Don't Tell' pretty horrendously.\n\n- Rather than a coherent story, the game seems to just be a collection of disconnected scenes scrambled together without much in the way of pretense. One minute you're sharing milkshakes with Kira by the seaside, the next you're talking with her about the selfishness of mankind. None of these transitions feel natural at all, and the supposed drama that emerges from them turns into overly-drawn angst. (Oh, hey, my girlfriend's on the roof of the school crying to herself! Better walk away and do absolutely nothing to help because somehow I know I'm not supposed to!)\n\n- Speaking of story, it feels like huge chunks of plot are missing. There are several topics that are vaguely touched upon but never see any sort of payoff. For instance, during the opening sequence, the protagonist takes a pill of some sort before rushing to school. Is this an indication of illness? It's never brought up again. Likewise there's a bizarre subplot about owls in the Mediterranean which again leads nowhere. And sometimes things just...happen, without any real context (OK, so we're being moved off the island...why, exactly?)\n\n- Finally the ending comes out of nowhere and makes very little sense. So it turns out Kira's some sort of sea spirit who's been killing people every month to maintain her human form. After a VERY heavy-handed moral about the destructive nature of humanity she's sucked up by the sea again, and we get a short epilogue of how the sea will always be with us and so Kira's never gone or whatever. DID YOU MISS THE PART WHERE SHE WAS A SERIAL KILLER, GAME?\n\nPerhaps the frustrating part of all this is that there is plenty to salvage. The art is excellent for the asking price, with a plethora of backgrounds and CGs, and the game does a few neat things with Ren'py you don't see often (blinking characters, walking animations, etc.) The music was forgettable, but I didn't mind it in particular. It's just that the terrible writing sinks the whole package and makes me feel like I wasted my money on it.\n\nIn short, Always The Same Blue Sky is wonderful to look at, but absolutely miserable to play. Those hoping for a quick VN fix should look elsewhere. Consider the freeware game Voices From The Sea instead.","May 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 103 of 126 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","103","126","8","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/363410/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Always The Same Blue Sky… developed by Crimson Night and published by Flying Interactive, on steam. It is a visual novel with choices with 2 endings 1 being a bad ending and the other being a good end. Players are given choices to make in the game and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story.\n\nThe storyYou play as a thoughtful young soul, bumbling your way through late adolescence; you’ve been through a lot for your age and consequently are a little numb. This is why you don’t bat an eyelid when, out of the blue, you’re transferred to yet another school, in yet another remote location. Little do you know that this small island is nothing like the others, that the events that occur on it will change everything.\n\nWhat’s with the low score? Simple answer is that the ending comes out of nowhere and makes very little sense. it turns out Kira’s some sort of sea spirit who’s been killing people every month to maintain her human form. After a VERY heavy-handed moral about the destructive nature of humanity she’s sucked up by the sea again, and we get a short epilogue of how the sea will always be with us and so Kira’s never gone or whatever. But which part of the game says she is a serial killer? It was not even hinted at all and the fact of her being a killer just got shoved into your face midway through the story and everything felt very forced. The VN seems to be scrambled together without much in the way of pretense. One minute you’re sharing milkshakes with Kira by the seaside, the next you’re talking with her about the selfishness of mankind. None of these transitions feel natural at all and extremely forced like it happened in the story just for the sake of the plot. Huge chunks of plot are missing. There are several topics that are forgotten and it does not affect the story at all. For instance, during the opening sequence, the protagonist takes a pill of some sort before rushing to school. Is this an indication of illness? It’s never brought up again. So what was the pills for? Medication? No one knows because well its never been brought up again. Its just there for the plot that does not even exists.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements – Backgrounds are provably their best selling point in the visual elements department because those are the ones that look above average in this VN. Sprites are average but have inconsistency with CG art which is really annoying to me and a pain to look at.\n\nAudio – Music,  overall the music in game is average there is nothing too fancy going on with the music its just average at best. There is nothing much to say here.\n\nTo sum upWill I recommend this visual novel? Definitely no, the story was a mess and there is no other attractive aspect of it. It has average music, inconsistent sprites art. Something I forgot to mention is that the text. The text are SO SMALL I literally have to sit closer to my laptop screen to read through it and it is really annoying as it takes comfort out of reading.\n\nClick here for review with images to make things clearer[azusantiara.com]","March 15","false","3.0"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","51","58","9","7"

It's not much of a downside though as this VN ends at just the right time.

Well written with interesting characters, it's biggest issue is perhaps that it's a little -too- short. Character relationships progress in between the scenes and it feels like it's missing some of the content that would really pull you into their interactions and give them more weight.\n\nIt's lovely to see more original English language VNs on Steam, and for three bucks you can't really go wrong.

It was a fun break between some of my other games that require a lot more time to complete, it had a quirky story that agrees with my fantasy disposition, and the artwork was in good taste.\n\nWhere other visual novels lean towards nudity and verge on sex scenes, this game thankfully avoids all that. Even though the story really only consists of two characters, it is handled well in this regard, thus suited for all ages.\n\nUltimately it does have its problems. Conversations jump all over the place, from fun and stupid to downright accusatory and serious. Descriptions can seem overly flowery as well. Even the choices you can make seem tacked on like an afterthought. It may sound harsh, but compared to some other visual novels I have read, the story really does seem to need more fleshing out - to be longer, more eventful, more subtext and less exposition.\n\nConsidering the shortness of the story, it would have been nice to incorporate some voice acting to liven it up a bit.\n\nThe choices are a bit weird too, seeing as the endings aren't that different from each other, and none of the endings are truly a happy ending as such.\n\nWorth getting if you're a big fan of nice visuals and easy achievements, but if you like a great story then this one may not meet your expectations.","August 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinjiKnox/recommended/363410/","ShinjiKnox","ShinjiKnox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinjiKnox/","1136 products in account","Okay, let me get this straight: Always The Same Blue Sky is one of these games you can't decide between good or bad. It is one of these you think Steam should have a neutral button. Unfortunately we still don't have that, but I'll just recommend it because the game weights more in the good parts.\n\nIf you are interested in Visual Novels, keep going for a more in depth view about the game. No spoilers, rest assured.\n\n\nStory\nThe foundation of a Visual Novel is more than anything, the story. Some people would say that the visual part is more important, but several Visual Novels will prove you wrong. There is no art that saves a long, boring game; and in Always The Same Blue Sky, it turns out to be too short, all over the place, lacking emotion and with too many unnecessary metaphors.\n\nI would think that the writer was trying to be clever most of the times. I will even give you that, it's not something that makes you cringe, but I can't help but think why the story cuts so short and the scenes feels like a whole collage of snippets of story.\n\nLots of scenes are more than short, but also confusing. We don't have transitions, no "afterword" talk at the end of every scene, and no way to understand how much time has passed in the story. I was surprised when the game told me several weeks have passed since the protagonist arrived in the island. Really? It felt like one or two days.\n\nThe ending also suffers from the same problem. It just happens, no way around it, no real conclusion. The achievement "Mesmerised" should be moved to the ending credits, because I was truly mesmerised to see the game ending so soon and in a way that feels like so much was lacking.\n\n\nMusic and sound\nStarting with the sound, I would say that there are only a couple of sounds there. A game that relies so much in its surroundings should have gotten more attention in this department.\n\nAbout the music, that's something that went right. The songs are nice, well composed and fits the game well.\nIf the story wasn't so short, most of the songs would be running for more than a couple minutes. They deserved more than that.\n\n\nArt\nThat's where the game shines. If the art was unpleasant, sloppy and inconsistent, I would instantly regret buying this game. I'm glad that this is one of that cases where the art saves you from quitting the game and never coming back.\n\nThe character portraits are nice, but still lacks a bit of detail.\nThe backgrounds, however, are great. Full of details, glittering in beauty. Some of them are a bit inconsistent between scenes, but most are really good.\n\nThe backgrounds might be great, but the CGs are amazing. Always The Same Blue Sky have the most beautiful set of events for a VN of this price. The CGs certainly takes my highlight in this review.\nA gallery, however, would be really appreciated.\n\n\nConclusion\nIf Always The Same Blue Sky was slightly more expensive, I would say a "no". The story is full of flaws and overshadows most of the good parts of this charming Visual Novel, but the rest makes up to it.\n\nIt's a short Visual Novel, that can be completed in almost an hour. Even though there are two routes and several choices, only a few lines of dialog and the ending changes. But not much, as it feels like how The Walking Dead deals with its choices. The outcome will always be the same, and the ending will surely have the same bitter taste. Even if you are not looking for a happy or sad ending, Always The Same Blue Sky tries to deliver one, but it fails terribly in development.\n\nIf you are looking for a good art, then you found something cheap that will makes your fill.\nIf you are looking for a good story, then you have several better options priced similarly.\n\nAlways the Same Blue Sky should have been developed for some more time. The story needed more development, even if only to fill the blanks.\nFor this price I can't say a no, but as a Visual Novel, I can't say a yes.","May 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

Do look into the game if you're interested, but if the descriptive text above doesn't draw you in, the actual game is unlikely to change that.\n\nTerrible sales copy aside, Always The Same Blue Sky does in fact present nicely detailed art and a fitting soundtrack, both of which are used to good effect. It's easy to see the effort put into making things look and sound good, and Crimson Night’s team clearly have a good eye for what works, particularly with animations. But where Always The Same Blue Sky falls down is where a lot of first productions do: on the story.\n\nWhile the narration has some charm and wit, it's very much held back by trying to be as flowery as possible, often to the point where it's hard to know what it's describing anymore. Between a few straightforward lines or simple descriptions, the narration tends to go into purple prose overdrive about the simplest of things. It's hard to know what's important between it. In another visual novel this might be forgiven, but it's already a great struggle to understand what Always The Same Blue Sky wants to say.\n\nIt could be apt to describe this game as a collection of vignettes, but thinking about it that way doesn't quite make the story any more satisfying. The glimpses into the setting and Kira seem too insignificant, the ending that joins them a bit confusing, the mystery behind mostly everything a bit too out of reach. Is it simply a story to make you think about humanity's destructive nature? Is it more a way to capture a certain feeling? Or are we supposed to think about or feel something else? It feels like there's more to what we're given; that, like the hidden story on the title screen, there's things left to discover that can help you piece it all together. But all of that seems to remain out of reach, so what's left is a very short collection of moments connected somehow that lead to an ending that might make you think about whatever you think the game’s getting at.\n\nClearing the game once allows you to play through it again with more options, but being meek or assertive doesn't really reveal anything more about what's going on. You can also see an alternate ending where it seems the game really is all about your outlook on the world, but who really knows?\n\nIn all, even though it looks and sounds well-produced and has hints of a good mystery/psychological story, Always The Same Blue Sky is as it's shallowly described on the store page and that's probably the most disappointing thing it could be.","May 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/363410/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","To come right out with it, Always the Same Blue Sky is, in fact, a typical visual novel. It's a bit shorter than most, and the different paths are barely any different from one another, but it's not the atypical visual novel that is "a gripping tale with no filler" that it claims to be.\n\nA lot of the filler that this game decides to cut out is things that help develop the characters and make the things happen to them affect you in some way. The game covers something like three months of being on the island, but all you really learn about the characters boils down to this: Kira is pretty, Kira lost a bracelet, Kira likes milkshakes, Kira likes to look at the ocean, your character moves around a lot, your character has no real personality, and your character apparently like martial arts enough to join a club.\nThis also leads to weird scene transitions. Sometimes you just randomly cut to weeks later after a scene happens. Which means all of the friendship building between the main character and Kira is done off screen and this is something that would have greatly helped us care about the characters during the ending.\n\nSome nitpicks:The use of the British forms of "maneuver" and "leaned" are weird when there are no other words that use the British form in the game.\nThere are two spelling errors I noticed, "coordinate" shouldn't be hyphenated and during Kira's explanation of clouds there was a typo on some word in there (I think is was "career" used in place of "careen").\nThe game was much more verbose then it needed to be and this led to a lot of the dialogue feeling a bit off. The game is told from the main character's perspective and they're meant to be a blank-slate college freshman, why bother making them sound like their trying to write a high brow novel while they are simply recalling a story from the past.\nThe color choice for Kira's font was a bit harsh on the eyes, a darker yellow or even the green from her eyes would have been a better choice.\nThe inclusion of choosing the main character's gender and entering a name. Choosing gender changes one line in the whole game, and we don't have any real input into what happens in the game so there's no reason to enter the player's name as the character will never be a reflection of the player.\nIt's good that this game used Ren'Py over Tyrannoscript, or some lesser known VN engine, but it would have been nice to keep some of the stock Ren'Py actions in. I played through the whole game not knowing you could save because there was no onscreen buttons, to access menus, and right-click didn't bring up the save menu. It was only after trying to close the game with Esc that I realized it was actually possible to save.\nAs for things I actually liked, I think that the game's art is fantastic. The backgrounds seem like the artist isn't too great with perspective though. Kira is nicely stylized; though she looks oddly out of place in the CG scenes as her style and the style of the backgrounds don't mesh well.\nThe soundtrack is alright. It's not bad, but it's not memorable.\n\nSo, in short, Alway the Same Blue Sky is essentially just a really short visual novel with really weak character development. If the game was free I would say give it a try, but for the game being $3 I'd say just look for it in a bundle or at a really cheap discount.\nThough as an experiment for a visual novel that "cuts out filler" I would count this as a failure.","March 6","false","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

That's not to say it's good or amazing, but to say that I think it's worth the play for what it is.\n\nIt presents itself very well with charming art and an equally charming soundtrack, the writing isn't going to blow you away but it wont leave you disappointed either.\n\nThe reason I have difficulty saying this is a good game is that the writing leaves a lot to be desired and in a VN, writing should be your star point above all else. The story feels like I was being rushed through it, it didn't take its time building the characters and that makes it hard to feel much for them. Not to mention the endings feel a bit lacking in impact, mostly due to the issue of pacing.

In fact I really liked the short bonus story because its pacing felt right and had all the charm I was looking for without any real issues in it.\n\nAll in all I'd say this game is worth the price of admission and I really hope to see more from the people involved here, because I think with experience under their belt from this and hopefully taking criticisms in to account, they could come up with something amazing for their next project should they decide to do one.","May 26, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavenlykaruna/recommended/363410/","heavenlykaruna","HeavenlyKaruna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavenlykaruna/","130 products in account","Always The Same Blue Sky is a difficult game to say whether I recommend it or not, since it does have good and bad qualities in almost equal measure. Let's start off with the positives - the visuals are are quite pretty, some of the plot elements introduced are truly intriguing, and the music is decent. However, where this game fails is in the execution of the story. While I appreciate it being advertised as a story that gets right to the point and ranks a 0 on the pretension meter, I believe that it this same attitude that hurts the overall experience. Yes, it is nice to cut out the excess nonsense filler the plagues many games like this, but so much has been cut away that only a bare-bones structure remains. A little extra time to bond with our solitary (!) love interest would have been nice, with the added bonus of a little extra depth and get a sense of who she truly is.\n\nPersonal taste for fluff aside, what isn't cut out of the game is severely underdeveloped. Crucial twists and plot points are touched upon exactly once and then never brought up again (glass dolphin, anyone?) Also hurting the game is the use of the dual endings. Unless you answer the choices in a very specific way, you get the bad ending. Just wow. No gray area at all, eh? I don't know if all VNs work this way or not (I've only played a couple before this), but it drives me crazy when games stack the odds against the player of getting a satisfying ending. It doesn't help that some of the choices are absolutely ridiculous (announce your name proudly or shyly? Really?) and give you little to no feedback on how each choice changes the way Kira feels about you.\n\nFinally, the writing. Oh boy, the writing. It isn't something I'd exactly call terrible, but I'd place it somewhere between "Internet fanfic written at 3 AM after one too many glasses of wine" and "$5 paperback romance novel gathering dust at Wal-Mart." I've always said that a thesaurus is every writer's best friend, but this game's authors suffer from going a touch overboard with it. A little rosiness in the narrative and dialogue is nice, but it would benefit greatly from a little conciseness as well.\n\nIn terms of my recommendation, what it all comes down to are two questions: Would I play this game again? Would I recommend this to anyone else? In short, no and no. I wrapped the story twice in 50 minutes and got 2/3 of the achievements doing so. With one love interest and only two endings, I see no point in playing this game again. I would suggest this game to hardcore visual novel fans, and even then only in passing.\n\nAlways The Same Blue Sky escapes my thumbs-up, but only just. Honestly, there are worse ways you could spend three bucks and an hour.","August 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very nice, soothing artwork and good writing, and the world had substance even with only two characters featured, one of them being the player. But you can wrap this up with all achievements in less than an hour without hurrying.  While there are two different endings, and choices that lead you to them, the choices really affect ONLY the ending. The events transpire almost exactly the same way whichever options you choose. Definitely worth reading but I wish there had been a little more to it. (My time to finish was about 30 minutes, the rest was for trading card idling)","March 6","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
