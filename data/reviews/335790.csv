I just love everything about this game, aesthetically. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay is not very satisfying in my opinion, as the game is currently. I've recently made discussion thread that says as much, I'll repeat that here for convenience:\n\nDuring combat, damage happens too quickly after submitting a word to see how much damage you are doing, while looking for words I don't notice how much damage the enemies are doing to which of my party members (as I'm looking at the letter block, not the top of the screen).\n\nBuying equipment, I don't see any indication of my character benefitting, the damage number may(?) have changed for the party member, but I don't see a total +x to damage from gear, for gear that has effects (+bleed effect, etc), these don't show up anywhere that I can find after purchasing and equipping them, and I certainly don't notice them in the battle animations happening up top.\n\nHonestly, the game feels completely non-interactive, I may as well just be spelling words in the grid and the rest of the gameplay is just decoration that is not directly related.\n\nAs is, calling this "RPG gameplay" is deceptive at best.\n\nI would like to suggest a few improvements that would make the game feel more engaging for me:\n\n1) Combat/Word log - A log of the words you are using in a fight and which abilitie(s) and item effects are taking place, along with how much damage results. Enemy damage should also be listed in a log like this.\n\n2) Show equipped items... anywhere in the game. I would like to see that my character has a magic katar that's adding 8 damage and causing bleeds, etc. As is, I just have to remember that I bought an item, and assume it's doing what it said it was going to... if I can even remember what it said it was going to do 10 minutes later.\n\n3) Achievements would be nice, to mix up gameplay objectives, espcially since the main "fight" phase of the game states "find short words since they are easier to find and still deal the same damage", which seems to give no incentive to spending the time to make big words, unless you are just trying to proc a certain multi-skill-block ability.","December 11, 2014","false","2.7"," 216 of 244 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","216","244","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BonzaiFerroni/recommended/335790/","BonzaiFerroni","BonzaiFerroni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BonzaiFerroni/","55 products in account","This game is such an awesome idea. It suffers from a couple of deal breakers.\n\nSome of the words that it seems to expect you to know (or have a decent chance of knowing, i.e., treasure chests) are humorously archaic. Each chest that I came to (a dozen or so), the word they were going for was quite out-of-grasp, even with someone with a decent vocabulary and scrabble-related skillset. Here is one that comes to mind, and it wasn't even the worst example:\n\nDogship - The character, or individuality, of a dog.\n\nNow, I'm sure the dozen-or-so people throughout history who have had occasion to use the word "dogship" in a meaningful way find it a perfectly good word, and I wouldn't argue with them. But it is a word that is, perhaps, unrealistic to expect to leap into mind when you only have 20 seconds to spend trying to figure out a particular 7-letter sequence.\n\nIt is a great scrabble word. For a quiz-type challenge (where there is really only a single right answer), it is a really silly word to use. Perhaps I had a run of bad luck, but almost every treasure chest or "save-your-life" challenge that I came up against, it was a word like this. Going to Zen mode didn't really get rid of that particular problem, it just seems to give you more time.\n\nPerhaps the author used a database of words of various challenge levels for this challenge. In that case, I'd strongly recommend curating that list. It is great to use challenging words, but not necessarily archaic. Even the words that most people consider "vocab words" are possible to fit into everyday conversation. These words are on another level of obscurity.\n\nAs other folks have pointed out, it is near-impossible to pay attention to what is going on up with the fight, since most of the time you are hunting for words to use. Perhaps a mechanic more interesting than just a count-down timer would improve the overall experience. Maybe a more turn-based approach would give people time to appreciate the other aspects of what is going on.\n\nReally cool concept, just a few details in execution that make it difficult to recommend.","December 13, 2014","false","2.3"," 117 of 136 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","117","136","2","2"

I would like to play normally, but the monsters' damaging rate is too fast for me to think of words properly (especially further in when they hit harder). You can hear the damage going on, but it's difficult to see what's going on since you're focusing on the letter tiles instead of your own health (perhaps put it at the side from the letter tiles?).\n\nConsidering the equips, I'm not sure how the defensive stat is applied nor if the effects of the accessories can be put into play. The only thing that I know that equipping sort of works is the change in the attack stat. Another stat I noticed that I'm not sure of is "agility". When I open some chests, I'm granted 'agility', but I'm not sure how it's applied in-game. Does it make the monsters slower? The only thing besides that is when at a shrine, agility application is towards damage? This is confusing\n\nAnother thing to consider would be the ability to see your character's stats: knowing the exact HP left, if the loot found in chests are being correctly applied, list of skills & effects, etc etc. It would be helpful especially if you save and continue the next day.\n\nWord length should be considered more. Like having a longer to have more damage dealt. The same goes for how many letters can be put in. When working with the traps, I was trying to use up most of the letters in one go, only to be unable to (it was 9-letter word, but the max is 7).","December 12, 2014","false","4.2"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","0"

Considering how quickly enemies attack and how often you die to give it a roguelike-but-heroprogression feel (unless you look up the anagrams on the internet in the background), typing random words hopefully 3-4-5 letters long that you hope are on the grid is the way to go. After 4 hours, I don't really want to return to it. But I did get 2 EUR worth of time out of it, I guess. I don't like the time limits on the anagram system though, who the hell thinks of words like ICARIAN, JAMDANI, APOCOPE or NONYLIC? (or my favorite that the anagram finders didn't know - SAGATHY) And if you don't, your character is dead. Didn't like that mechanic, because I'm bad at it, and it just feels unreasonable.\n\nThe problem with the game is how the letters are not organized in any reasonable shape or form on the grid, so finding words really just comes down to typing in random permutations of letters you see quickly and hope the game accepts it.\n\nYou can buy it, it's interesting at first, but it's a one-trick pony. If you want a one-trick pony that's a bit more versatile, go for either Trigger Knight, or Puzzle Quest.","December 14, 2014","false","4.2"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

There is not much of a "complexity of the gameplay". Tiles, words, RPG, stats, all played real time, no turns.\nThe chests, and Last Stand anagrams are a game of luck, unless you have no clue of what the hell that word is. You can easily lose a playthrough where you don't know what [Insert complicated/archaic word here] means. I was tempted to cheat, with a website that solves anagrams (Shame on me).\nI also dislike the damage system. If you hit colored tiles, you do damage, even if your word was "discumbobulated" or something, it all depends on dem colored tiles.\nBeing real time, it becomes more intense, a game of speed, but you can't actually keep track of your health nor the enemy's.\n\nI expect this game to be really good, once they tweak a few features, but right now, in my VERY humble and honest opinion, it shouldn't be played....yet.","January 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

They're miniature, monochrome and masterfully addictive. Now rest assured, Words for Evil is a colourful and entertaining casual puzzle game with an influx of characters. It reminds me more of what my ideal smartphone game would be as a child of both 2g-4g mobile gaming.\n\nThere are 6 stages, 19 characters/heroes (can play up to 3 at a time) and 84 monsters. It will speak to the collector in you, which is something I am. I wish it had Steam achievements because it has some awesome emoticons, cards and badges. As the developer is a designer, the whole game is inherently gorgeous.\n\nNow keep in mind that as I've mentioned, it's more like something you'd play on your smartphone than a PC monitor. Which brings me to the only significant downside I've experienced being, the small display modes. Even with that I still love it though. It's fun on my laptop and I'm having no regrets for buying it at full price. It's a great addition for those rainy days or when your gaming device isn't quite up to par and you need something light...\n\nSo after just under 5 hours totalling a distance of 107.2km covered, my knees are aching because I've been sitting here trying to get to the end of this game. Light and fluffy, it may be but short game play it is not! There's not just a generosity of hero/monsters but an assortment of aspects in this game that'll keep you interested in levelling up every hero you manage to unlock (they're all different and super adorable, btw). Attacks fall under the simplified basic/strong/ultra attacks (length of words) in turn unlocking monsters and working to your advantage depending on what you level up in when you find Fountains (they also heal you 100%). As you progress, in line with any basic RPG, Strength (HP)/Agility (Damage)/ Wisdom (Mana) are your basic stats (you can add Luck (Gold) also), each hero has different strengths/abilities you can hone to your liking.\n\nWhen you first play, the speed of how quickly you type full words (3 letters+) will "make or break you". Starting off, short words in frantic succession will lay the best results. Don't be embarrassed to type can, man, bat and hat in a row until you're at a moderate level. There are Loot Chests and Deadly Traps to test your word skills and you can buy weapons and potions to aid you in battle. There are very clear instructions in the main menu so check them out. As an on-rails game there is a set route you may not deviate from apart from when you swap between different worlds/levels. Keep in mind that as long as you're good at the word games, you shouldn't need the luck anyway which definitely wasn't an option for my lack of a dictionary. Personally, I found it much easier once I chose heroes whom inflicted more damage to monsters when they inflicted damage on me. In short, the monsters would lose lots of health as they were killing me which was helpful when "lost for words". Once you find your pace, unique words will hit harder and let your relax with the typing.\n\nThough it wasn't too much of a downer for me, I should mention that I'm so busy looking at the word games (the screen is horizontally split in half, upper: RPG and lower: word game) that I have no clue how much my hero is losing health until I finish that game. Another bummer was how at times I'd type something and it would not compute in game. Playing other typing games on Steam, this was never a problem so I found it bothersome. Granted it would actually get me better words at times by mistake though, so yay!\n\nIf you've yet to master basic typing skills, it may either teach or frustrate you so proficient keyboard usage will help. If you don't like word games like word search, anagrams and the likes of Boggle, steer clear. As a word maven wannabe and RPG devotee, this game is a bundle of joy!","March 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Instead of a timer, you have adventurers that go in to battle.  There are four different types of puzzles your adventurers will face.  First is the regular battle, where you spell as many words as you can using letters that connect (just like Boggle).  The twist is that in order to progress (cause damage/use abilities), you need to incorporate highlighted letters in to your words.  A minimum of three letters are required for each word, and bigger words have a stronger effect.  Second is the trap puzzle, where you are given letters you need to incorporate in to words, regardless of their placement.  The letters can only be used once, and the key is to use as many letters as possible.  All unused letters cause damage, but a bonus is granted if all letters are used.  Third is a treasure puzzle, where you decypher a code using one of two letters available for every space in the word.  Even if you aren't sure what the word is, you are not penalized for guessing, so fit as many guesses as you can before time runs out.  The fourth puzzle is a 'saving throw' puzzle, where you have a final chance to escape death's grip.  You have a short amount of time to descramble an anagram.  Definitely not easy, but extremely rewarding as a last resort.\nI am really mixed on whether or not I recommend it or not.  Some of the words you are expected to have in your vocabulary have a wide variety of national origin.  I also have run in to problems where certain common words are not in the game's vast library.  Other times, I have been faced with the problem of being given trap puzzles where the only vowel I'm given is the letter "i." The game is also so high paced that you are typically taking all focus on the puzzle itself, making the animation of your adventurers in combat more of a distraction.  I recommend this to people who love word play, and a college level grasp of the English language.  Otherwise, you might find this game overly frusturating.","January 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is for those of us who love wordplay and typing in particular. I heard about Words for Evil quite a while before it was available on Steam, and bought an entire bundle and downloaded the Desura client just for this game. I have always enjoyed typing and have an average speed of 101 words per minute, and I write for a living, so this game was instantly on my radar. I am constantly intrigued by video games that incorporate wordplay in any form, but typing quickly in this game is also a plus because it directly affects the attack rates of your party members.\n\nFluency in typing, whether based in speed or accuracy, is not required, however. Words for Evil will be extraordinarily easy for those of us who can type quickly, but it is designed to be accessible for anyone. It also acts as a tool to encourage the player to both properly spell and accurately type because it is in your best interest to attack the enemy at a faster pace than she or he attacks you.\n\nIn a nutshell, Words for Evil plays out like a 2D adventure game where the party members you choose move automatically from left to right. Your party will come across enemies, blacksmiths, potion stores, and traps every few seconds. You can purchase goods to outfit your party from the blacksmiths and potion stores. Every time you come across an enemy, you are given a grid full of letters to choose from. Using gameplay mechanics similar to Popcap's classic Bookworm, you can spell out words via typing them if the letters are in order on the grid (connected vertically, horizontally, and diagonally). Each time you finish a word, your characters attack. By leveling up your characters, you gain access to special attacks that are used by utilizing colored letter squares on the grid. Each defeated enemy gives you XP, and each party member can be upgraded many times. In addition, you'll come across new characters every once in awhile that you may choose to add to your party (in an empty slot or as a replacement for another). There are many characters, special attacks, and even worlds to unlock.\n\nTreasure chest mini-games are vaguely similar to fights, but you are offered two rows of letters, and you must choose one letter in each row to come up with a word by the last column. Do this for all five rows within a time frame (for a five letter word), and you unlock the chest. There are also traps that present you with a grid, and you have to try to use all the letters in various words. Once you use up the letters, they disappear and none replace them; however many letters are left over, unused, dictates how much damage your party is subject to by the trap.\n\nWords for Evil is a casual game. Despite being set in a fantasy world (and a beautiful one, at that; the pixel art here is as gorgeous and colorful as it is simplistic), there is really no story to follow or "reason" to traversing the world other than the relaxing joy of it. There is a lot to unlock, there are pages of characters to level up completely, many enemies to come across and beat, worlds to unlock, etc., and the developers update the game fairly often with new content. This is a game that is not selfishly demanding of your time. Between playing games full of deep lore and convoluted storylines, picking up Words for Evil will relax you and may even teach you something. I fell in love with the idea of the game because it was so unique, and it did not disappoint. At $2.99, I recommend it even at full price (I have gotten about 10 hours out of it, including my Desura time before Steam, which far bypasses the $1 per hour of game time rule I follow).\n\nThis is a humble little game that is approachable by most. I give Words for Evil a 9/10, and I eagerly await developer Dylan Loney's next game.","March 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

You build words from a grid, the more colored letters you use the stronger your attacks will be.

I enjoyed the game and will probably continue playing until i unlock every character but this is not a game for everyone.\n\nIt is repetitive and using a lot of 3 or 4 letter words is a strategy that works throughout the whole game. I wish there was a little bit more depth to it. While the heros seems different enough, the mechanics and enemies are not. There is a lot of room for improvement because every enemy feels samey, sure they maybe have different stats but you don't have to mix it up to beat them. Other games of this genre often times use special conditions for fights, for example enemies that are immune to short words or enemies that remove some of your letters the longer a fight goes.

Sort of.\n\nSee, the huge issue is this: you can have up to three heroes with you at any time, and if you make enough progress, I think it's stage... 3 or 4 of 6?, you can begin a new run with any three you've unlocked, no problem. (Prior to this, you can bring 1-2 heroes depending on where you reached.) But the issue is, if you're like me, you're going to unlock a few early, and they will get PRETTY POTENT by being the only folks you have. And then it comes down to "do I start on later levels to make more game progress and reach the end? or do I run some heroes who sound interesting to use through earlier stages for levels/maybe unlocking more people?".\n\nThe gameplay's a real-time battle Boggle. It's not bad! I've said elsewhere I preferred this to Letter Quest by a large margin. But stage bosses can be a real slog if your party is support based as opposed to raw damage, and the endboss* involved a WHOLE LOT of the "solve anagram to revive party member" minigame for me.\n\n* Please note the game is technically infinite, don't go assuming that some of the terms I'm tossing around like "endboss" or "levels" mean you only have so much content and then you're done.

Combat can be fustrating when you're trying to scramble to find a single word in the pile of letters that you can use to hurt your opponent (considring you can only use certain colored tiles for attacks. But don't worry! More heroes = more colored tiles!)\n\nThe graphics are adorable, the music is soothing, and the premise is fantasticly simple. You are an adventurer, go off and adventure! You start off with two different pixely heroes to choose from, and you go from there. "There" being randomly generated adventures where you come across things like loot chests (which have word puzzles), traps (which have word puzzles), shops (which you spend your gold at), and of course, monsters.\n\nA few tips to help you along:\n\nDON'T WORRY IF YOU DIE. You'll still have all your progress on each hero no matter what, and you don't lose heroes! Did you die as the archer? Jump right back in there with all your experience and items!\n\nUSE THE KEYBOARD.

If it's too hard for you at first (it was for me), then you can change the difficulty in the Options menu.

The fighting of monsters is broken up by various encounters, most of which either allow you to spend gold or will make you solve a word puzzle.\n\nThe word puzzles seem to be balanced depending on where you are in the game, for example dying in earlier areas will net you a difficult anagram to solve (this revives one hero with full health) whereas dying in later areas will give you a slightly easier one due to the fact that you'll be facing some pretty beefy peril and your heroes will die more often.\n\nalso yes, you can use swear words/slurs to deal damage to your enemies and yes it's hilarious.","January 28, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

That said, the game is much more suited as a time-kill on a smart phone than an actual game on a PC; well, maybe not.  A keyboard really helps a lot.\n\nThe GOOD:+ I like the concept and the game play itself\n+ Nice variety of slightly different word/letter puzzles for the few different screens you get.\n+ I like the upgrading of characters.  That said, I still have no idea what armor rating my guys have, or if giving them armor or weapons when they already have some, just adds more to what they already have (I think it does).\n\nThe OK:~ No time to look at anything else but the letter grid.\n~ The game rewards just typing the 3/4 letter words you know, not necessarily what you spot in the grid.\n\nThe BAD:- No campaign?  No Story?  No Quest??   This would be so much better if your characters were on a march toward a castle, a dragon, an ANYthing.\n- Since there's no campaign, I really feel no desire to keep playing now that I've seen the vast majority of what the game offers.

The RPG aspect is kind of gimmicky as you'll be focusing more on the spelling rather than the action. There's quite a few classes, and they each have their own special attacks that proc when you chain their letters together, which is a pretty cool mechanic. The game is a little punishing, namely because of the traps and the monsters that attack a little faster than I think is fair. The gameplay gets a little repetitive since it's all about spelling words, but it's still pretty fun for what it is. There's a lot of room for improvement; if you're looking for a similar experience that's more fleshed out, Letter Quest gets good reviews as well, but it's a bit more expensive.

I am a huge fan of the blending of genres like match three and word creation with RPG elements. Unfortunately this game despite its reasonable price is falls short in gameplay. After submitting a word you have to instantly look up to see the damage you have done or you will miss it. If I am not mistaken the length of the word does not affect the damage you do in the game which results in lack of any incentive to create longer words to attack with. It's even more annoying because you are constantly attacked while you are trying to create words. I have no problem with that but it would be nice if I could at least be rewarded for taking the time to create more complex words in the game. Another issue is that you are penalized during little mini games like opening chests for not knowing the specific word they wanted you to submit. Most of the words I encountered during these sequences were really obscure, even for someone like myself who plays a lot of Scrabble and has decent vocabulary.\n\nThe game does not run in fullscreen which makes playing it a chore for me since everything is so small. This may or may not be an issue for you depending on your gaming setup but I am playing on a laptop at the moment and it's a real chore just to see anything in this game. The developer has listed his/her reasons for not including a fullscreen option. Unfortunately that does not bode well with me because there are other similar games that function perfectly fine in fullscreen like the Bookworm Adventures series. Save your time and money. Lost potential here, both technically and gameplay wise. It's a shame the developers won't budge with stance about the fullscreen option even despite the many complaints from those who purchased your game.

The game's setting and theme are both visually appealing set in a somewhat high fantasy environment. The game itself is more of a rogue-lite + word game than word game + rpg that places an emphasis on speed when typing.\n\nPros:- Visually appealing\n- Runs smoothly\n\nCons:My main problem with the game is that the window is tiny and can't be set to full screen. This caused my eyes to be strained extremely quickly and had to stop playing.\n\nAnother problem is that there's an emphasis on spelling words quickly using the coloured tiles representing the character(s) to trigger their individual abilities. I wish the emphasis was placed on spelling longer words rather than shorter ones using the said colour tiles. Now you can spell using normal tiles but it often result in less damage or gets destroy when submitted resulting in no damage done to the enemy.\n\nMy last problem was, when in battle there was no easy to see the health of your party as (x/x) or teach members' stats. This is a bit nit-picky but I'd have like to see the gear along with the player damage output while in battle rather than out.\n\nVerdict:For what it's worth it's a cheap word game with some rogue-lite-ish elements thrown in to the mix that can be fun.","December 12, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The basic game is simple and fun, and the addition of multiple characters each with powers and levels increases replayability immensely.\n\nThe game does get a bit repetitive and I've found that  concentrating on making many fast, small words in quick succession seems to be a far better strategy than going for longer words, which is a bit of a shame. For a word game I would have thought rewarding intelligence and thought above reactions and repitition would have been a better balance. And the chests and traps seem to be heavily influenced by luck: some are very easy while others are staggeringly hard.\n\nOverall, though, it's a nice diversion and definitely worth while picking up even at full price. At the time of writing, Steam says I've played 9.4 hours of Words for Evil.

Each member of your party has their own color. Using more than one tile of the same color in a single word causes your characters to use more powerful abilities. While you're hunting for words, the opponent is attacking you, slowly wearing down your health. You move from place to place in a neverending randomly generated linear landscape. Most locations will contain a monster to fight, but now and then you'll come across blacksmiths where you can upgrade your stats with weapons and armor, potion shops where you can buy up to three potions (healing, and various types of defense and offense), chests which you open by solving an anagram, traps which you disable by trying to use all the letters in a grid to spell words, and healing fountains where your characters are fully healed and level up their abilities. Eventually, you find the location that unlocks the next level, and you can choose to continue where you are or move on.\n\nCons:\n-Mouse controls can be a little glitchy from time to time (though keyboard controls are also available)\n-Gameplay can get a little repetitive, as with any word-based game\n-There is no way to view your characters' equipment upgrades, and it's unclear whether they are using only the latest weapon/armor, or if the effects are cumulative; the interface could use some more transparency and better explanation\n-The gameplay is so fast-paced that you never have time to look up at your characters and actually watch the battles. It's just a constant hunt for the next word. The action happening above the word box seems to be primarily for the benefit of someone watching you play the game. Would be nice if the speed were tweaked so that the action paused when you spelled a word, long enough for you to see the result.\n\nI've found the pros to vastly outweigh the cons, and I've enjoyed all my time spent on the game. I do hope that the developer will eventually tweak it a bit to resolve some of the issues, but even if they don't, I don't regret having it.","December 13, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of character types to unlock and level up, and the word games are varied so that you're not really doing the same thing over and over.\n\n\nIt's true that when you're "fighting" with an enemy you can't really keep track of who's getting hit because you're usually too busy trying to find words. However, you can encounter things that heal you: level-up fountains (I think there's 1 per level), medicine men (heal for a fee), and potion shops. You also have characters who can heal if you can activate their skills. Even if you don't pay attention though and the character runs out of health, he enters last stand mode, where you can recover half or all of his/her health by making a big word. So, if you're really good at spelling, or just use a scrabble solver in another window you can effectively never die.\n\nI don't know if the equipment works because I don't see their inventory, so I just click things that look nice and try to give them to my characters kind of by their job, but really this game is just about finding words and feeling good when you can recognize something longer than 3 letters.\n\nI have fun playing it, and it's easy enough that I can even get my g/f to give it a try... and she only likes board games.","December 13, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love word games, and I love typing games.\n-Fantasy battle elements! Words for Evil has a cool premise in that you use your typing skills to put together words and hurt enemies.\n\nCONS:\n-No way to check your party's stats except at designated "stop" points like shops.\n-Difficult to watch the battle, since you're too busy finding words.\n-If there are multiple ways to spell a word on the board, the game will decide which set to take if you use the keyboard.\n-Levels seem never to end, or maybe I'm just impatient. I honestly don't like the game enough to keep going to find outâ€”I spent 20 minutes on the first/tutorial level before I packed it in.\n\nI thought being a fast typist would help me in this game, but it really doesn't. You can only use tiles that are adjacent to one another (except in certain instances), so ferreting out words eats up most of your time. Because you're so busy word-hunting, you can't keep an eye on how much damage you or the monsters are doing to each other, making it difficult to gauge how much you need to worry.","May 7, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love word games. Words for Evil did not disappoint at all.\n\nIt's a walker type game, and you can quit out anytime from the level and keep the progress you've made. You make your own party out of a number of unlockable heroes, including Santa Claus (who is seriously impressive in a fight)! Essentially you're given one of a number of puzzles, depending on whether you are up against a monster, a chest, or a trap, and you have to do your best at figuring them out. It stimulates the mind, and there are RPG elements as well, such as levelling up and buying gear.\n\nI set it on the Zen difficulty and I still find it stimulating and challenging. It's the kind of game that sucks you in and, before you know it, hours have passed. It's so easy to say 'I'll just go to the next fountain' or 'I just want to do a few more battles'.\n\nThe graphics are adorable and charming, as well as in some cases quite stunning. The sense of humour in the game is welcome and pleasant. It's also noteworthy that it has a mode for those who may be colour blind or have a deficiency in distinguishing colours, so that's a really important thing.\n\nIt's a light game that doesn't take up a lot of space or demand masses of processing power, so it's the perfect game for any system. Some words you'd expect or know may not be in the game's dictionary, but that can just add a little to the challenge. Either way, it's been perfectly delightful for me, and I have no problem recommending it to anyone who likes to think as they play a game.\n\nCharming, fun, and really absorbing, Words for Evil also has a price that can fit into most any budget. It's worth picking up and supporting.

Letâ€™s get going shall we?\n\nI â€“ Story [3/10]\n\nWords for Evil is a RPG-like word game from Dylan Loney. WFE doesnâ€™t have much of a story; you (the player) select a hero and slowly gather more heroes as you battle your way through a series of worlds. In each world you must find a shrine to unlock the next and so on and so forth. Pretty basic, but, itâ€™s more of a story than most other word games youâ€™ll probably find out there.\n\nII â€“ UI [10/10]\n\nA good user interface is the heart and soul of any word game and WFE is no exception. Also, WFE had a marvelous UI. Every single command in the game can be issued through the keyboard. You can use a mouse as your primary source of input or in a more supplemental role, but that will become arduous in a hurry. WFE handles like smoother than a fish in water, so bravo to Mr. Loney on his excellent work in this aspect.\n\nIII â€“ Gameplay [8/10]\n\nIf youâ€™ve played one word game, youâ€™ve practically played them all. WFE has two styles of word games youâ€™ll encounter during play. The first (similar to Boggle or Bookworm) presents you with a table of letters with which you construct words. Once the letters are used, they are removed from the table and new letters take their place. The second style of game is more of a jumble. You are given a series of letters and you must find the word or words hidden within them. Seems familiar right?\n\nHere is where WFE shakes things up. Battle sequences use the first style of play. On the letter table, certain letter tiles will have different colors. These colors correspond to one of you heroes. If you create a long enough word that features one or more tiles of the same (or different) colors, the corresponding heroes will launch an attack on the enemy. In the event that your party of heroes runs up against a trap, a treasure chest, or (Cthulhu forbid) one of them falls in battle, youâ€™ll be presented with a game of the second play style.\n\nMy only real complaint with the gameplay was with the jumbles used on treasure chest encounters. Some of the words you are presented with and tasked with unscrambling are either archaic or youâ€™ll never have heard of them before in your entire life. It accounts for some mild annoyance, but the gameplay itself remains solid.\n\nIV â€“ Content [10/10]\n\nNormally, all youâ€™d expect out of a game such as WFE is a dictonaryâ€™s worth of words. This, however, is not the case. As I mentioned above, WFE is an RPG-like word game. There are 19 unlockable heroes, 84 different enemies, 6 worlds, and a small collection of items to upgrade your heroes with. At itâ€™s core, WFE is still a word game at the end of the day, but the extra content really breaks up the long-term monotony of the genre.\n\nV â€“ Visual [8/10]\n\nWFE has charming art, but some of the animations happen so incredibly fast, it is almost impossible to see what is happening during the battle. The environments are beautiful and very detailed.\n\nVI â€“ Audio [8/10]\n\nI quite enjoyed the music of WFE. It fit well with the atmosphere of the game and with the theme of each world. You couldnâ€™t ask for more of any game. Some of the sound effects become a bit repetitive after a while though, but, if you get into the zone, you shouldnâ€™t even notice.\n\nVII â€“ Overall [7.8/10]\n\nOverall, Words for Evil is a fun game and a great way to kill some downtime. At only $2.99, it is an absolute steal as well. If youâ€™d like to learn more about the game, you can visit the official website here. If youâ€™d like to go ahead and purchase it, go here instead. As always, thanks for reading and stay posted for our next Retro Review on Power Piggs of the Dark Ages.","February 14, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll warn that the RPG elements are extremely light, unintuitive (like when you purchase weapons/armor on a character does it overwrite the past or just add), and often only slightly rewarding... but I'm not surprised - it's a typing game!\n\nOn top of that there were and overwhelming amoutn of instances where I had no clue what the word was or meant - after they told me... which was usually in a "fight for your life" instance (each time a character gets killed you have a chance to have them explode, get half their life back, or all their life back). however, that didn't discourage because it was, after all, that last chance so it should be a bit harder.\n\nThe final discouragement was that I figured out, too early as well, that I could just exit the game and restart if I lost a battle to save myself from losing a valuable character in some death... that single factor is what hurt the game the most to me because I'm personally too tempted to exploit easy things like that.\n\nAll the negatives aside I still love this game because it's awesome casual play, I love typing games, and it does a good job at changing things up as it goes. Plus they're not asking much for the price, which is as low as a cheap iPhone app. All in all, well worth the money and I love coming back to play a new round... though I'm so tempted to not let my main character die and just close the screan >:)","February 15, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And if you do love word games do get this. However if youâ€™re not into word games and your thinking of getting this as a 'pass-time' game I don't recommend it. This is obviously a personal opinion so if you like word games go ahead. If you do however just want a pass-time game there are loads of better games for the job then this. You can get some really great games for just $5 that are better for the job than this. For an example, I highly recommend looking at one finger death punch as a stress-reliever and a fun action-packed game that is perfect for spending some time on.\n\nNow the important bit of this is the reason why I don't recommend this for people who donâ€™t absolutely love word games. The main reason is its extremely repetitive. Ridiculously so. You do the same thing hundreds of times and is there an award? Nope. Just more word grinding, and if you like that sort of thing thatâ€™s great but if you donâ€™t its tedious and there is nothing else in it. Also, a fact that doesnâ€™t help this is that it has no action, ever... sure you feel great if you get a 5 letter word and shoot a normal tiny ball like the hundreds of others you throw and get a 1 hit kill. But itâ€™s EXTREMLY hard to get long words NOT because itâ€™s challenging but because the board were you make your words barely EVER gives you enough letters next to each other to make a good word itâ€™s not your skill, itâ€™s if youâ€™re REALLY lucky. So, Iâ€™ll go over it again.\n\n1. itâ€™s not action packed, at all. Itâ€™s like playing Sudoku but without any feeling of victory if you finish the puzzle, great if you like endless Sudoku it but if youâ€™re like me itâ€™s not so much fun...\n\n2. You do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and you get the point.\n\n3. Thatâ€™s it. Read number 1 and 2 and you get the idea. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE. NO REWARD, NOTHING.\n\nThe trailer makes it look so good and I fell for it but the game really isnâ€™t fun after 5 minutes when you realise this is all itâ€™s going to be.\n\nPlease not that this is my opinion and that if you want the game you donâ€™t have to take into consideration anything I have said.

The RPG elements are minimal and the gameplay quickly becomes tedious. The words are not challenging enough and you find yourself making many short words rather than sitting down to consider longer more complex words. I also don't see much of a benefit mechanically from making longer words as in the time it takes to find them you could have dealt more damage by making several short words. Also, some of the words they use are a little questionable. You know the kind, the words that you've never heard of but learn just so you can get a quick few points in? I've always found that annoying in electronic word games. Anyways, it was a neat idea and I had fun for maybe five, ten minutes, and then it just wasn't worth it anymore.

Gets a bit repetitive after awhile, but still fun to play.\n\nStarting with a single adventurer, you journey through the land using your vocabulary to power your skills and defeat monsters you encounter on the path. You travel between worlds, encountering different monsters and other adventurers who can join your party. The general game has enemies which attack you in real time, turning your adventurer's health bar into something of a time. You attack by link letters on a grid to form words, using colored tiles associated to power your adventurer's attacks. The game is best played with a keyboard: Typing will not only select the tiles for you, it will change the selection based on the word your type, relinking letters, and prioritizing colored tiles. The only time I even touched the mouse was while selecting adventurers. In addition to the main puzzle, there are a few mini-puzzles used for activities like looting chests and disarming traps.\n\nThe RPG aspect of the game has your adventurers gaining experience after every encounter, which can be used to level up their abilities. There is also gold used to purchase potions and items at various shops along the way, which I think is where the game starts to falters. The potions work well, enough, but the equipment doesn't seem to do much. Gear looted from chests is either randomly assigned, or possibly shared between party members; either way, the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining how it works. Gear can be assigned when purchased from a merchant, but there's no way I could find to see what the adventurer's was currently carrying, or compare it to what was being purchased. I'm assuming this means that whatever bonuses given simply stack, even if the old gear is completely replaced.\n\nThe only other downside in my opinion is the repetition. Part of this is inherent to the genre: How many letter grids can you look at before it starts to get a little boring? For it's part, the game does a pretty good job mixing up the puzzle types, and the RPG aspect does help a bit. That said, this game feels a bit too easy. The puzzle difficulty feel static, and you can win almost any fight using only three letter words, especially using the keyboard to pound them out. Enemies don't seem to be very powerful. You might lose an adventurer once in awhile, but very rarely will you lose the entire party.","February 14, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are given a series of letters and you must find the word or words hidden within them. Seems familiar right?\n\nHere is where WFE shakes things up. Battle sequences use the first style of play. On the letter table, certain letter tiles will have different colors. These colors correspond to one of you heroes. If you create a long enough word that features one or more tiles of the same (or different) colors, the corresponding heroes will launch an attack on the enemy. In the event that your party of heroes runs up against a trap, a treasure chest, or (Cthulhu forbid) one of them falls in battle, youâ€™ll be presented with a game of the second play style.\n\nMy only real complaint with the gameplay was with the jumbles used on treasure chest encounters. Some of the words you are presented with and tasked with unscrambling are either archaic or youâ€™ll never have heard of them before in your entire life. It accounts for some mild annoyance, but the gameplay itself remains solid.\n\nIV â€“ Content [10/10]\n\nNormally, all youâ€™d expect out of a game such as WFE is a dictonaryâ€™s worth of words. This, however, is not the case. As I mentioned above, WFE is an RPG-like word game. There are 19 unlockable heroes, 84 different enemies, 6 worlds, and a small collection of items to upgrade your heroes with. At itâ€™s core, WFE is still a word game at the end of the day, but the extra content really breaks up the long-term monotony of the genre.\n\nV â€“ Visual [8/10]\n\nWFE has charming art, but some of the animations happen so incredibly fast, it is almost impossible to see what is happening during the battle. The environments are beautiful and very detailed.\n\nVI â€“ Audio [8/10]\n\nI quite enjoyed the music of WFE. It fit well with the atmosphere of the game and with the theme of each world. You couldnâ€™t ask for more of any game. Some of the sound effects become a bit repetitive after a while though, but, if you get into the zone, you shouldnâ€™t even notice.\n\nVII â€“ Overall [7.8/10]\n\nOverall, Words for Evil is a fun game and a great way to kill some downtime. At only $2.99, it is an absolute steal as well. If youâ€™d like to learn more about the game, you can visit the official website here. If youâ€™d like to go ahead and purchase it, go here instead. As always, thanks for reading and stay posted for our next Retro Review on Power Piggs of the Dark Ages.","February 14, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice variety.  The "cheat death" is a last opportunity to unscramble a word and return to full health.\n\nThe RPG element is reflected in the deep combat system - Buffs, critical hits, armor, character attributes, disables, attack modifiers.  Also, as your character levels, s/he can increase in strength (health), agility (damage), wisdom (mana, which increases power sqares), and luck (which increases the gold won in battle).\n\nYou can purchase potions that restore health, increase positive attributes for you, and create problems for monsters.\n\nYou can purchase equipment, but it's not clear how that upgrades/replaces previous equipment.\n\nDrawbacks?  The reviews will point out that it doesn't support full screen + it doesn't have standard achievements.  The former no longer bothers me.  The latter isn't actually true:   You have in-game goals of unlocking each of 100 monsters, leveling each of 16 heroes (which requires leveling each skill set), and obviously completing all the 6 game stages.\n\nAnyway, two final notes, the game keeps an ungodly amount of stats, which makes it interesting.  The RPG element is enhanced as you decide which types of characters to team up with + which skills become your most dangerous.","April 22","true","195.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, those stuff probably isn't much of deal but this game isn't very interesting. Best tactic? Make short words only. It's get boring really fast and sure, I can try harder and make only longer words but sadly this game isn't turn based but real time, so if you spend longer time trying to make some nice word, you will probably get killed very fast. Some sounds in game are too loud (even with sliding it to lowest), graphics aren't really interesting or beatiful, not like it really matter but you can feel that something is missing.\nIf you are fan of this kind of games, if you get bored with every other game from this genre avaible on Steam, maybe you could try it. It's not really expensive and maybe you will like it more than I do.","May 31","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not buggy or anything, it works fine. It's in a small window, though, and the game is very repetetive. Can't recommend this for 3 bucks, unfortunately.","June 3","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
