Not For Everyone\n\nThe time twisting, puzzle platformer is brilliantly made, fantastically designed but a killer on the brain. The introduction to the game drip feeds you the information you are required to complete it, and its all down to you to apply the knowledge you have been given.\n\nNow this is where opinions will divide; I enjoyed the challenge and that inspired me to push on. You could argue this game is actually really boring, I would disagree, but essentially it is advanced jumping with time elements. The story is strong, the character is great, albeit eccentrically odd, and the mechanics are near flawless. If you are a naysayer, play this in chunks and it'll win you round.\n\nI think compared to other indie titles this game is perfectly priced at £5 - £10. If you don't enjoy the art style, then anything below that and you have got a steal and its worth a shot.\n\nNotes\nSteam Achievements, No Trading Cards, Full Controller Support.","November 25, 2013","true","12.2"," 198 of 227 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","198","227","0","6"

Something that affects you so profoundly that it moves beyond being just a form of media. It is internalized and remembered forever.\n\nBraid is one of those things. But it isn't just an example of art in gaming, it's a game full of pure genius as well.\n\nThe game, at first, comes off as a platformer. There are relatively little instances of hardcore platforming in the game, and they usually only serve as a medium to allow you to interact with the puzzle that you're dealing with. Make no mistake, this is a puzzle game at heart.\n\nThe puzzles here are incredibly good, and very well scaled from level to level. The first two levels are relatively easy and will only take you a few minutes, the third is a bit harder, and the last puzzles will make you feel like your brain is deflated. The amount of time that you'll have to put into each puzzle may be debilitating for some, but the sheer joy and pleasure of solving one overcomes any sense of stress that staring at your screen racking your brain may cause. These aren't just run of the mill puzzles, either. There are a number that are, in my mind, some of the best puzzles that I've ever seen in a game.\n\nThe art direction is beautiful. The backgrounds are watercolor constructed, they're vibrant and bright, and dark and brooding. The soundtrack is perfectly placed and flooded with beautiful violin work. Each are augmented by an incredibly written preface that comes prior to starting each level. The story is written so broadly and so metaphorically that it can literally be translated to represent whatever the player would like it to. The ending represents one of the epic twists in video game history, and does so in game -- a puzzle in itself.\n\nI literally cannot think of one thing that I dislike about this game. It could be longer, but length can't really be expected from a game that costs so little.\n\nThere is so much value stuffed into the 10ish hours that you'll spend playing this game, it's hard to put it into words any other way than just to spout off the cliche of "buy it and experience it yourself". It's an experience to be had, and it's one of the most artistically beautiful exhibits in gaming history that is guaranteed to affect you in a most profound way.","December 20, 2014","true","0.1"," 114 of 129 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","114","129","6","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/26800/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Braid is a platforming puzzle game which was released on Xbox Live initially in 2008 before later being ported onto PC in 2009.  You play the character, Tim, as you attempt to rescue the princess from a monster (very cliche!).\n\nGame play in Braid looks like a very generic puzzle platformer on face value, however with the addition of the special ability to manipulate time by rewinding and fast forwarding, you can find yourself in some very unique situations.  The other gameplay elements are very much the same though, running, jumping and climbing around a standard platforming environment.  Each level in the game adds a little bit of a change to the time bending ability which keeps things fresh each time you progress.\n\nBraid is a very simple looking game; the graphics are standard two 2D style, however they do have a very pleasing charm to it. The art style within the game is just gorgeous to look at. The art work alone apparently took over a year to produce, and you can really tell a huge amount of heart and effort went into creating it.\n\nThe plot in Braid is very intriguing indeed. You are certainly in for a few twists and turns and very unpredictable outcomes throughout - I was personally in no way shape or form expecting the end of the game to end up how it did; and that is a nice change from a game since they can sometimes become very predictable. After finishing the game, you are able to find additional text that expand the story even further too.\n\nThe music used in Braid was selected by the developer himself, from licensed music, this was done to reduce the cost in the development stage. What I really liked about the music is that each tune has a different feel to it when you re-wind time in game; its a really small element, but it makes a huge difference to how you feel when playing.\n\nI found Braid to be a difficult game; purely because I am the worst person possible when it comes to 1) Puzzles and 2) Platformers. Put the two together and it's just a mess.  At times I had to resort to a trusty walkthrough to work it out, but for the majority of the time I was able to figure out each level on my own. Puzzle veterans may well find this game's puzzles to be easy, and still struggle on the platforming element to it!\n\nBraid took me just over six hour to complete; this was purely a run through the story mode; there are a lot of Jigsaw pieces to find in the game which result in achievements, so will add a couple more hours of gameplay. Some of which are unobtainable at the first time of coming across them, so a little bit of replaying older levels is needed to collect them all. However I personally see no reason to replay the game only for the achievements.  The story and gameplay 100% linear.\n\nI had no technical problems whilst playing. Braid can be played at all resolutions up to 4k in windowed mode and full screen. A controller, as always with platformers is highly recommended to play but can also be played with keyboard.\n\nTo sum up, I am only going to Recommend Braid, simply because the two genres put together are my least favorite of all time, however take that with a pinch of salt because if you really enjoy puzzle/platformers, then this game is certainly for you and you need to pick it up, even at the full price of £6,99 this game is a steal!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Back when i was not so much into indie games, i saw "Indie Game: The Movie" which drove me to get this game. I did and played it and just loved it. The puzzles were really great and even a bit tough and they kept me thinking about how to get that puzzle piece even when i wasn't playing the game. I literally kept thinking most of the day. No game has ever done that to me before i think. And when i solved the puzzle somehow, i felt this great sense of achievement and it made me so happy. Even made me feel very intelligent :p . I fell in love with this game. Loved the concept, loved the gameplay, loved the puzzles.  The story was a bit confusing for me but i liked it nonetheless. I even kept staring at the screen for a long time to figure out how i can solve the puzzle. And then i discovered ..  stars. Could not figure out all of them, only 2 of em.

Its level and puzzle design are nearly flawless as they instruct the player in each world's time altering mechanics while also providing compelling challenge. Most of Braid can be played non linearly, so if you get stuck you can try another level and maybe later come back with new ideas to the one you left. It's still beatiful though it has aged a bit. I'd appreciate a hint system but I respect Jonathan Blow not wanting to compromise his design vision.

If there's a soundtrack version buy it. The art style and animation is great, actually better than great. The story is good but it's kept a bit separate from the game play and you might have a question or two in the end (I think that was on purpose though, to create debate). Most puzzle are solvable with a few tough nuts but the ability to skip puzzles until later is nice. Often something in a later puzzle will give you a flash of realization about an earlier puzzle.\nNot a particularly long game, unless you like speed runs, but for a few bucks it's worth seeing why there are so many indie puzzle-platformers right now.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3rfNXCSPJg","December 5, 2013","true","11.4"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","42","60","0","0"

Its challenging enough to get you thinking, but once you think, you get it. The puzzles are not long, everything you need to know is *there* (well, except for one single specific puzzle but that ain't a dealbreaker I assure you) and rarely rely on dexterity (unless you're interested in speed runs).\n\nThe story is fantastic and got me thinking a while, but there is a "k00l secret ending l33t for science" which I didn't find cool at all. Basically, the first immediate one is a love story and the second one... its more about work and science (no spoilers shall be given), really, and it ain't all that beautiful. That's my only complaint about the game: the regular ending leaves some things in the air that only make sense in the pr0-tröö-g4m3r secret one, but the regular ending sounded way more appealing to me, and I wish the developer would have exploited more the vanilla one.\n\nIf you like achievement hunting there isn't much challenge in this one here, except for the speed run achievement, which might need some practice but its not overfrustrating.","January 18, 2015","true","9.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

The simple platformer type works well on both PC and consoles.\n\nMy one critique is that the ending is somewhat unfulfiling in that the designer got all artsy-fartsy and left the meaning open to wild interpretation. Either he just didn't have a moral to tell at the end, or he went with the "bluster them with bulls**t" strategy, and I'm thinking it was the latter.\n\nBut, even if you don't care about the background story and getting all deep into the meaning of it all, the puzzles should entertain.","November 4, 2014","true","17.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/26800/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","Braid is one of the best arguments for video games as an artistic medium. This game is made up of much more than than its pleasantly detailed art style and its perfectly meditative background music with a few clever puzzles thrown in for interest. No, Braid is a game that focuses on exploring a concept, on teaching a truth, through challenges it presents to the player. Each of the game's six worlds begins with a few paragraphs of pure exposition, but the purpose this serves is more to provide context to the questions that follow than as storytelling. With the primer read, the world begins with its unique take on time manipulation - its own 'what if' in the form of puzzles. Solving these puzzles grants the player a piece of a larger picture and, more importantly, a better understanding of the complexities involved in playing a scenario out over and over again until the desired result is achieved. These 'lessons' are confined to their own particular world; the new mechanics don't build on each other, which is in itself another lesson.\nAs incredible as teaching through player experimentation is, what makes Braid truly great is all of that pretension can be skipped by if so desired. The player can run right past any annotations without pause; what remains are puzzles that are just as engaging, art that is just as charming, and music that is just as sublime.","May 10","true","5.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It revolutionizes traditional gameplay mechanics, by allowing the player to manipulate time within the world; a mechanic that not only augments the unique narrative structure of Braid, but differentiates the game from other platformers.\n\nThe player makes their way through the several worlds of Braid by manipulating time in order to collect puzzle pieces. Levels themselves are much like puzzles, as spatial reasoning is required in order to traverse each level and collect the required puzzle pieces to progress. The player is able to reverse time, manipulate key objects that are irreversible, and manipulate time through a time dilation ring. This gameplay mechanic augments the plotline of Braid, due to its unique narrative structure that bears resemblance to other narrative techniques used in media, such as the film Memento. Instead of jumping through (or on) obstacles, Braid’s gameplay encourages the player to think critically, much like other spatial reasoning games such as Portal. Although some of the levels of Braid are difficult to solve, it does not make the game any less accessible.\n\nBraid is an exceptionally well done indie platformer, offering a unique experience that is bound to challenge its players. The narrative structure and game mechanics all contribute to the experience. However, the game does not offer much replay value (unless if you wish to complete a speedrun), and the soundtrack could have been an area to where the developer could have produced original content for the game.\n","January 17, 2015","true","12.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Basically, you use to switch the time back if you die, so there're no game overs or anything in that kind. You don't have to restart a level when you die, you can just switch back the time to the point you can fix your faults and just move on. But what's more - in this game you use time switches for solving puzzles.\n\nThe game is separated by worlds and every world has it's unique features, like time-resistant objects; shadows, that repeat your moves, which were previously recorded by you; a ring, that freezes the time in a little range around it and more. All these things will help you to solve the puzzles and save the precious Princess...or not. The difficulty of some puzzles is pretty challenging, it can require some great patience and irregular way of thinking. Also, the difficulty doesn't really change gradually. Every world has some relaxing and insane puzzles, they're just different in the way of solving. So you won't get bored nor annoyed.\n\nEvery world has it's own atmosphere. Fantastic soundtrack and drawn game art will make you shiver every time you touch this masterpiece. Plus the storyline.\n\nActually, if you play through this game quickly - you might not even notice it, because the whole story is written in the books which you may just skip. But you shouldn't, really. I spent an insane time playing this game before purchasing a Steam copy. Maybe to discover its' secrets, beat all challenges, etc, or maybe just to be in-game, in this gorgeously-made world. But the best thing that I've discovered over time is a plot. It made me look at this game at the absolutely different point of view.

The ability to rewind time not only allows for intriguing gameplay, but also provides a good way for there to be challenging puzzles without the game becoming unnecessarily frustrating. If you like puzzle/platformers, this should be high on your list of games to try.\n\nThe game mixes elements of puzzlers and platforming to form its identity. And there is a comfortable familiarity to the game which should feel inviting to most gamers. It starts off mostly focused on thinking-based puzzles and then a little while into the game there does start to be some platforming aspects sprinkled in, where your reaction time and precision abilities will be tested.  But for the most part it's pretty mild and not that hard.  Again, the time-manipulation also helps alleviate some of the difficulty of the platforming sections. It works out so a large majority of people should have an easy time enjoying Braid.\n\nAnd as you progress through the game you will unlock different time-manipulation abilities which will need to be used properly to complete your quest. So the gameplay evolves throughout the campaign, keeping things fresh and keeping your mind active.\n\nThere isn't much of a story to be mentioned, but the game doesn't really need one. There is a strong influence of old school platformers (i.e.: the early Mario Bros. games). In that vein, there is a basic purpose to your actions, but no need for a sprawling narrative.  Your quest in Braid is to traverse hostile lands to rescue a kidnapped princess, what else do you really need to know. Also, there isn’t that much of an immersive atmosphere either. The ambiance feels very nondescript and purely functional. However, none of this is a bad thing; Braid is simply a game that is focused on gameplay, purposefully minimizing the other distractive aspects.\n\nAnd so I definitely recommend you check out Braid if you’re a fan of the puzzle/platformer genre and are looking for a new game that focuses on gameplay.

The art is pretty and its story is a fairly raw exposure of the thoughts and feelings of the developer as you (and every other person) grapple with both wanting to move forward and turn back the clock in your life and in your relationships. Instead of distracting, this enhances the gameplay and gives you a rare connection with the developer beyond the mechanics of playing the game.","November 12, 2014","true","5.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have a good friend who complains that he hates when indie games seem pretenious. This one definitely is, it constantly reminds you that it's that sad vegan girl who loves pretending to know who Arthur Russell and The Dancing Cigarettes are while she eats quiche and carries around a ukelele that she can't play. Yes, this game can really feel that way at times, but you know what? It deserves to present itself that way because it does deserve to be treated differently.\n\nThe music and art style are all excellent as are the controls, mechanics and controlling time. Even the puzzles can be damn good. Not the puzzle picture you make for each world of course, but figuring out how to get those puzzle pieces in the first place (as well as a certain other collectible). But the biggest draw here is the story. There is what you can gather from the surface (some lovely prose and paintings) but there are more layers to the game. I will leave it up to you to figure everything out.\n\nBraid can be just a relaxing platforming breeze of a game, but you really should take a look at the puzzle elements of the game and I mean that on every level. If you want to get the most out of this game, analyze the story and solve the puzzles on your own.\n\n**A fair warning, there is one puzzle that will probably be impossible unless you look it up. Most guides will mention it outright because it is an early missable. Don't  complete World 3's puzzle without looking up the star for it.","August 2, 2013","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When they were awake, we strolled around the block, went for car rides, played toys,  When they were alseep...one word...Braid.  Special week.  This game messes with your mind in such a good way.  It's a difficult physical puzzle game played as a platformer.  The story is deeper, albeit slightly hard to follow, than I expected.  I had never rewinded time in a video game before Braid.  The concept is borderline genius, and Jonathan Blow (creator) runs with it with surprising results.\nI'll recommend this game to gamers who don't get frustrated easily, who like the satisfaction after a difficult puzzle is solved, and who don't mind thinking before acting in a platformer.

The way this game has built puzzles around time-manipulation is actually quite clever and that added to the ability to rewind time when you die keeps the game flowing nicely. However the difficulty curve is steep and this is where the game may divide people. While i've no problem with a challenge i found myself getting irritated with the puzzles which led to me losing interest in the game altogether.\n\nThe visual style of the game is quite nice and so is the soundtrack. Even though this game has a story it never really sucked me in and felt a bit irrelevant.\n\nWhile i have chosen No for game recommendation i would recommend looking at gameplay videos to decide whether this game is for you or not. It's not neccesarily a bad game but it just wasn't for me.

The writting and level design are really worth bearing through it though. Itts a puzzle playformer that involves worlds with different rules. Establishing what those rules are is a nightmare by itself. Trying to figure out the solutions and actually pulling those solutions of then become your next hurdles. This game isn't for everyone, but i think everyone should at least experience this level of creativity. At worst case watch a lets play or read a guide if you are stuck. Doing that will probably kill it though.\nNote - If you are visually impared you can still play this game. The story is told mostly through writting, but it isn't too tiny, and there aren't that many lines to read. At worst case you can screenshot the bits of story. Another difficulty you might come accross involves identifying things that glow in a particular color. This is related to the physics of each world you encounter, so you may need to pay extra attention, especially with yellow glows cos the enemies in the game are mainly that color.","March 5, 2015","true","6.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

For those people, I'd ask them to complete the game. It is quite complicated at times, but gives you some really quite remarkable closure at the end.\n\nOne of the criticisms I have for the game is that the story doesn't "fit" together until you have fully completed the game. The fault here, though, is that people get so annoyed at the lack of a coherent storyline, confused as to what's going on, that they give up before it's over, and never appreciate the full story. Which is a real shame.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers, check this one out. Give it time and complete the game. If you buy it and give up before it's finished, you'll be disappointed.

What's so great about it? Firstly, the timetravel-based mechanics make for unconventional and diffult puzzles. Learning to think about yourself in time loops is extremely challenging and rewarding. With each world (or level), the game introduces a new timetravel mechanic that adds another layer of complexity to the puzzles. The puzzles become so hard that at certain points I had headaches and had to stop playing. But that pain is worth the payoff of finally being able to figure out a puzzle after spending an hour steaming at the ears. You feel like a God, until you reach the next puzzle.\n\nBut the best payoff of all is the twist at the end of the story. The story is primarily told through books read at the beginning of each world. The writing in this game is extremely contemplative and existential, dealing with topics like memories, identity, and the nature of relationships. The writing beautifully weaves into the timetravel mechanics for each world. The design of the mechanics, their ability to be relevant to the story, and their ability to make the game's puzzles more complex at the same time, is the product of genius. The story, like a poem, doesn't explain itself. It leaves itself open to interpretation. The replayability of this game is in the different meanings that can be thought of upon further playthroughs of the game.\n\nThe music of the game fits the aestitic of the art style and reflects the mood of the story very well. The gravity of the twist near the end of the story is helped by the music. The music plays a role in telling the game's story.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is the greatest puzzle platformer because it ties the story, gameplay mechanics, and music together SO WELL that I would go back in time to experience the game all over again for the first time (small Braid joke).

The fact that certain mechanics are never given a decent explanation (i.e. what the arbitrary limitations are) makes a lot of this game very frustrating personally. I do like puzzles and games based around them, but there are too many times to me where the solutions have seemed "fiddly", for lack of a better word. You may understand the solution perfectly well, but it may be unnecessarily difficult, often due to the awkward platforming elements. All in all I have some enjoyable moments in the game, but I am very glad I got it on sale because this is simply not worth $10.

It makes the first several levels' platform action-puzzle gameplay forgiving and enjoyable.\n\nThen the game starts layering additional gimmicks atop the gimmick. A level where simply moving in a particular direction reverses time for everything but you. A powerup that causes you to clone yourself when rewinding. Areas that trap objects such that they don't get rewound when everything else does.\n\nThese things sound awesome, and they could have been, if the difficulty curve didn't go stratospheric as soon as they were introduced. I found myself skipping level after level, because the solution was either so opaque and convoluted that I had no idea where to begin, or because I could see the solution, but it required such flawless timing and precision that full play sessions of practice got me no closer to success.\n\nThen I learned that in order to finish the game, you must complete every. single. puzzle.

"If Y'all didn't catch that, I just went back in time..."\n\nBraid is a simple platforming game worth discovering. The game is set apart by a time-rewinding mechanic that is used ingeniously to an extent matched by few indie games that came after it. A common complaint against indie games is that they're half-baked unfinished games that gatekeepers would have shut down in the past. This is not true at all here, and Braid is on-par with many classic 16-bit platformers. In addition, there's a story, and it's also rather good. If you haven't played Braid, you should.\n\nSoulja Boy's real review from 2009 is pretty accurate too, "if you just be getting ♥♥♥♥ed up" it's purely enjoyable too. The story is completely ignorable if you just like the puzzles and mind-bending levels. Johnathon Blow understands what few other indie devs do, if your gameplay can't stand on its own feet, no one is going to slog through your game to read your artsy story.\n\nIn a world where many of those in the so-called "art games" subgenre of gaming seem to be trust-funders and upper-middle class twits who think their stories are gravely important to all of humanity, Johnathon Blow has always taken a more restrained approach. There are two chief kinds of "art games" in indie gaming, those that are heavy-handed narratives driven by reading, and those that are minimalist and abstract. A key problem with the former is that the projects are often obviously not originally intended to be games. The fact that many of these projects end up being games at all relates to gaming being a more profitable and hip field with less barriers to entry than filmmaking or publishing. This is not true of Braid, and part of what makes it so artful in the first place. Braid is about regret, about mistakes of youth and arrogance, and this is mirrored in the gameplay which is entirely based around rewinding platforming mistakes.\n\nBraid has the watercolors and flowers that every indie art game has, but it also has the thing most of them lack, innovative gameplay that ties directly into the themes of the story and raises greater questions in the audience's mind. These are the places where Johnathon Blow and Edmund McMillun shine and lesser indie developers like Fullbright and Phil Fish flounder.\n\nYou should play this.","July 15, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The levels are interesting, for sure - lots of time-and-space based puzzles, which I thought was a neat take on platforming.

Braid is one of the coolest games you will ever play. The mind-warping, time-bending 2D platforming puzzle goodness ranks right up there with the best of 'em. It is just one of those games that can't be missed. The only thing I didn't care for all that much was the somewhat pretentious "story" that meanders behind the scenes throughout the game. It didn't really add or detract from the experience, it just felt like that author was trying too hard to be "deep" or something (just my personal feeling). That aside, I can't find one negative thing to say about Braid. Give it a try. I guarantee you have never, and may never, play any other game like it. It's a really well designed and sometimes challenging game with great puzzles and original gameplay mechanics that will stick with you for a long time.","October 8, 2011","true","7.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Here are my issue with this game that really ruins it for me\n\nIt's too cryptic: To get all the puzzle pieces and even the stars requires you to do very specific things that only somone with a walkthrough would know and I do not state that lightly. Some of these things are virtually impossible to find so you find yourself constantly watching youtube video to figure this stuff out. Otherwise, you are left running through the game which is not very much fun and makes the game way too short. Now I know many games can be cryptic but this one is over the top and the way they do it is not even fun. One level you are supposed to wait 2 hours just so a cloud will appear in a certain part of the map. Does that sound like a fun way to spend 2 hours playing a video game?","December 29, 2014","false","8.5"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","19","36","6","1"

For those who desire a poetic and allegorical fable with layers to peel away with each passing stage, Braid is for you.\n\nBraid will long be remembered as a landmark achievement in video games, and I hope as a memorable work among all the arts.\n\nBraid is a necessary experience for every gamer, and demonstrates a narrative experience that cannot be replicated in any other form of media.\n\nIndeed, Braid is a masterpiece.","June 1, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also one of the first larger successes in the "public" indie scene.\nThe game itself it a platform puzzle game with elements or references from games like Mario and homages to several other "old school" NES games.\nThere also is a very interesting mechanic that is important to the core of the gameplay; Rewinding time.\nThis little feature will prove more important than a simple "save point"-feature in games such as Prince of Persia: SoT. In Braid certain elements are unchained from the time/space continuum - In other words, you can rewind time and unchained elements will stay put, or if you are holding them; Follow you back to where you were.\n\nThis entire process is used cleverly in the puzzles you are faced with.\n\nApart from the puzzles there is a very neat story tucked into the game(as with most artsy indie titles).\nWithout getting into too much detail on that part; It reminds me of a very well known "Save the captured Princess" scenario... With a twist.\nI'm not going to spoil it and I'll leave it up to you to figure out the rest.\n\nIt's a short but great game - clocking at around 5-6 hours to beat it.\nFor what it is, it's well worth the time spent.\n","August 15, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every puzzle you solve requires you to question our day-to-day view of time and space, without the painful formality of a high-school physics class.\n\nThe only two weaknesses of the game are its short length and difficult story. Given the extraordinary density of inventive design in the game, its relative brevity is easily forgiven. As for the story, if you enjoyed games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and BioShock: Infinite, you will find Braid's plot rewarding, though it might take some thinking to earn the rewards. Just don't expect to like the plot without effort.\n\nIf Braid is the start of Jonathan Blow's visionary quest to enrich game design, I can't wait to see what's next!","August 23, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a 2D platforming puzzler set in a gorgeous painterly world with one of the best soundtracks in modern gaming. The gameplay involves manipulating time to solve clever puzzles that earn you jigsaw pieces to a painting that hints at further back-story and helps open the path to the final chapter… which is actually the first chapter in the story. It's refreshingly forgiving in that you can never die and need only rewind time to do something just right; this focuses your attention on trying to complete a challenge rather than needing to re-play entire areas or continuously try to make the same jump over and over again.

It's a 2D platforming puzzler set in a gorgeous painterly world with one of the best soundtracks in modern gaming. The gameplay involves manipulating time to solve clever puzzles that earn you jigsaw pieces to a painting that hints at further back-story and helps open the path to the final chapter… which is actually the first chapter in the story. It's refreshingly forgiving in that you can never die and need only rewind time to do something just right; this focuses your attention on trying to complete a challenge rather than needing to re-play entire areas or continuously try to make the same jump over and over again. I deeply appreciate that.\nThe ending sequence to a story that is told through hind-sight and recall is a level of brilliance that made all the time spent playing it worth every second.","August 1, 2012","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphic is beautiful, the music is astounding and the story is unforgattable if you take the time to understand it. As you progress the colourful dreamy world turns into dark and gloomy representing the change in the protagonist and the story. You can feel the growing tension and sadness of a man who's dragged by his obsession. Apart from that, there is a lot of message in the game what makes you think.

Something like Braid.\n\nBraid's best feature is the awesome power of going back in time if you mess something up. What isn't mentioned is what this entitles as well. Going back in time at twice the speed allows you to beat objects unneffected by time travel to their destination, small gold rings create black holes in which time travels at a near stop, and creating copies of yourself by doing something you would do normally and then traveling back in time to do something else. Each world has its own unique time power (even the last) that the game gives only subtle hints about and I went bonkers (in a good way) having to figure that out for myself. That said, the game's short and will probably be finished within three hours if you're looking for all the puzzle pieces. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/26800/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Braid is a solid indie title with unique time based mechanics in a puzzle platformer along with great visual and sound design. Immediately upon starting the game, players are shown a rich looking world that resembles a painting. Throughout the game, this painted style along with intricately designed backgrounds looks gorgeous when playing the game along with providing some interesting designs for players to admire. The design manages to be distinct for each game element while looking beautiful for the parts that make up the land of the world. The music matches the refined style of the art with some instrumental pieces that accompany each level. The songs aren't loud in nature, but give a backdrop in each level for players to listen to while solving some of the puzzles. Each song sounds natural with the recorded instruments and still sound nice when applied with some audio effects caused by game events like rewinding time.\n\nThe story seems at first to be about a man trying to rescue a princess, but the game goes beyond just that simple story. Throughout the game are books in each world that are read and provide deep meanings with symbolism. Thus, this story is taken more figuratively than literally, and can tend to be confusing much like the actual gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay works as a puzzle platformer with unique time based mechanics. By default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. The player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. Each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. Some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. The time based mechanics of Braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. Although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, Braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles.\n\nBraid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. While the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.","August 5, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/26800/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","Braid is a time-altering side-scrolling platformer.\n\nIn a story that seems to mirror that of the Mario series (find a princess), but there's more at work than just that, if you carefully read and think through the story blobs told when you walk over books. Personally, this wasn't really to my tastes.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is, in my opinion, a much more important aspect than the story, Given that it's a side-scrolling platformer. The aim is not to finish the level quickly, but to get all of the puzzle pieces. The puzzles to do so revolve around the use of time-altering powers. Slowing Time, reversing it etc. And provide some nice tricky challenges and a good feeling of success when you complete them. But you will inevitably do so, as the game doesn't take an extremely long time to complete.\n\nThis game can be controlled via. Either the keyboard or a controller. I tried using both and they both work well.\n\nThe graphic stylings of this game are very nice. The art gives a sort of "painted" look to the game, and changes as you utilize time travel powers. Despite it being a "painted" look, do not think that it will be static sprites. The game looks and feels very fluid.\n\nThe graphic setting themselves are set on-launch, and cannot be changed in-game. A tad annoying, but once you figure out the best settings for you, you won't need to worry about it.\n\nThe music is very intriguing. As you utilise time travel powers, the music changes accordingly. Be it moving in reverse, or even in-step with your movement.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, this game doesn't take  a very long time to just run through each level. Finding every puzzle piece and assembling them takes a bit longer. If you do want to speed-run it, once you complete the game you can select this option from the main menu, which adds an extra level of difficulty.\n\nThis is a well polished game, and given all the bugs that could occur with the "time-travel" mechanic, it had no bugs that I could see.\n\nOverall this is a great game to play if you're a fan of side-scrollers, or puzzle games that involve a time travel aspect, which I feel is somewhat hard to come by in a well-made manner.","September 4, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its puzzles are mentally delicious. Its story is kinda loose, but also super intriguing. Its ending left me mindblown at 1am and needing to tell everyone I knew to play this super awesome game. Its graphics are art. Its soundtrack is beautiful and peaceful, which is necessary to counteract the frustrations of puzzles. If the soundtrack was not so calming, things might have been at risk of being broken in frustration.\n\nThere is a satisfaction that comes with making it through the entire first run-through without looking any puzzles up and being able to say, “I figured it all out. All of it.” Another cool thing is that everything in the game is put there for a purpose. It’s kinda like how in a good piece of literature, every word should fight to be on the page, or else the author is wasting the reader’s time. In this game, nothing is wasted or thoughtlessly placed.\n\nOverall, 9.15/10, would recommend to anyone who wants something different and challenging that works the brain muscle more than average. I subtract most of a point because I am still left with too many questions, almost like the game is too metaphoric to get its message across. Also I’m point stingy. It still is satisfying enough and thought provoking not to lose a whole point. Perhaps I just need more time to reflect and replay.

It is a very neat game with some really great and innovative mechanics. The visuals and art concepts are also very interesting, as well as the music, cleverly integrated almost as another element of the gameplay. And, indeed, that’s where the strongest point of this game lies: its gameplay. It feels fresh, it’s fun and even though it can be challenging at times, there were no impossible stages. To me Braid felt more like an experience than just a simple game. It was short, but also intense. There were only two times when I just gave up and looked online how to beat that particular stage, but I kind of regret it now. This game is a challenge. Just let yourself be immersed into its mechanics and enjoy the ride. (Using your brain helps too :D)\n\nThe only negative side of the game is how little the story managed to interest me. I read all the signs containing the story until the very last ones, when I realized I simply didn’t care and just wanted to play. But that’s not a major issue at all. The game is a gem and everyone into the genre  should try it. It takes less than 5 hours to beat, so you probably don’t even have any excuses not to give it a try. Oh, and I don’t recommend playing for too long…  After beating it and writing my homework, I was seriously thinking of turning time backwards instead of simply pressing delete.

It's not super difficult but it's not exactly easy, either - it falls into a nice "kind of challenging but not frustrating" place - that is, unless you want to unlock the true ending.  Moving through the levels and collecting the puzzle pieces is a fun affair, but the 8 special puzzles for unlocking the alternate ending range from fun to "the developer is giving me a giant middle finger and I don't know what I did to deserve this."  I have been told that the sadistic difficulty/tedium of some of the special puzzles is a metaphor.\n\nYour character, a cute little guy in a suit coat named Tim, starts off with the ability to stop, rewind, or fast-forward time, which he retains throughout the game.  At first this is mostly used to rewind mistakes, but as you progress you'll find several other uses for it.  As you enter each new area you will be given small pieces of writing about moments of Tim's life.  The little vignettes are nicely written and interesting to read.  They are mostly unrelated to the actual story, but they tell us about Tim's character and set an appropriate tone for each setting with hints at that level's special ability.  Each area also has a simple jigsaw puzzle to collect and assemble.  The images in the puzzles are unrelated to the story.  I have been told that the images in the puzzles are metaphors.\n\nThe overall story is...  About 95% of the time it seems to be a spoof of the original Mario games taken to a strange extreme: Tim is an eccentric dude with an obsessive personality, and he is totally fixated on finding a princess.  In the last area or two it then beats you over the head while screaming "It was a metaphor!!"  Frankly it's a bit obnoxious.  If you have the patience to collect all of the extra objects for the true ending, the game will explain the metaphor in detail (but it's easy to figure out even with the ending that doesn't explicitly come out and say it).\n\nTo summarize:  This is a fun puzzle-platformer with an eye-rollingly pretentious story.

It is a side scrolling 2-d action platformer, but you have no guns, and you do not punch ♥♥♥♥ to death.\n\nIt is however, a highly enjoyable action platformer where hilariously enough, fast forward and rewind are your greatest weapons.  The puzzles are superb, the difficulty is more than satisfactory, and the story telling isn't too bad either.  The graphics are sprite based, so visuals are simplistic in terms of complexity.  However, the artistic style is very nice.  While it's not a technically impressive game visual wise, the art style is what makes it beautiful to look at.\n\nIf you see it for cheap, I highly reccommend picking it up.

This game is part of the canon—and for very good reason. Braid is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.\n\nThe core engine of Braid is a simple, 2D platformer reminiscent of Mario. (The resemblance to classic Mario is more than passing, and the creators of Braid overtly nod to it at several points.) But to the simple mechanics of jumping and dodging Braid has added a novel element: the ability to reverse time. At the touch of a button you can rewind your performance of a stage to whatever point you like and then begin again from that point.\n\nThat alone would be novel, but not worth much—just an alternative to replaying levels—but Braid makes this mechanic the central tool in the solution of an array of tricky puzzles. At first your control of time is just a way of undoing mistakes, but it quickly takes on other dimensions as you, for example, discover items which are immune to your powers and so keep moving normally while all else rewinds. Solutions to the problems Braid poses are not usually a matter of muddling through, trying things until something works, but instead involve having some insight about the central mechanic and how it affects your surroundings. Like a good riddle there is a moment of dawning insight and suddenly you see things in a new way.\n\nAnd the surroundings are themselves wonderful. While the mechanics of the game would be worthy regardless (an early version of Braid won a game design award while the graphics were still just place holders) the graphics makes the game into a piece of visual art. Everything in Braid looks hand-made in the best possible sense. The levels have an almost water colored look. And while there are actually fairly few sprites in the game, corresponding to the small number of pieces out of which levels are constructed, the background elements are various and gorgeous. Each group of puzzles has a distinct aesthetic subtly adapted to the content of the gameplay. Beautiful, low key instrumental music compliments all this perfectly. This game is simply pretty, and in a way that makes playing it feel meditative.\n\nThe story, provided mostly by textual interludes, is rather impressionistic. I found it difficult to make sense of, and in the end not entirely satisfying. But nonetheless thematic elements intertwine with the gameplay. The most obvious example is that you play as a man troubled by regrets, and this theme of regret resonates in the mechanic of undoing actions you have already performed.\n\nBraid is a piece of art, pure and simple, but as already mentioned it is also a tightly designed puzzle game. This means some stages are rather challenging, as they should be. However, a nice feature is that the puzzles are not locked into strict sequence. If the needed insight simply will not come in one place then it is open to the player to skip ahead and return for the missing bits much later, lessening the potential frustration that’s part of puzzle games.\n\nBraid has taken simple parts, things that have been around since 8-bit consoles, and polished them until they shone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/26800/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Great platforming puzzler.\n\nBraid is one of a few games that rose during the 'indie craze' next to games like Super meat boy, Bastion and Binding of Issac.\n\nStory is deep. I was surprised that a puzzle game could have such a good story. You play as Tim, an individual who is looking for a princess who has unfortunately been captured by a monster. It's not a plot which openly tells you what is going on per se, rather there is quite a bit of ambiguity (especially the ending which is good), which leaves the player to reflect on what is actually going on. Many themes play out in the story including desire, regret and making up for mistakes.\n\nGameplay is great, burrowing elements from Mario. Each stage pits you on one end of the map, trying to reach the end on the other side. Stages are unique, with different puzzles and goals to reach in order to pass, such simply reaching the end, eliminate all foes, using keys to open doors etc. Similar to stars in Mario, each level has a selected amount of puzzle pieces to collect. Each, piece collected helps to complete a picture which provides some incites to the story. There are platforms you can reach by jumping on them. You can also defeat foes by jumping on them and avoid traps by jumping over them. The only enemies are giant head things which walk around and may jump to different platforms (which reminds me of Gumpas). There are also traps such as pitfalls, spikes and canons.  You only have 1 life, so a single collision between a 'Gumpa' or trap will kill you instantly.  Fortunately, death doesn't end the game, instead this is the part where you make the most of your 'Time control' power. Reminiscent of 'POP Sands of time', you have the ability to reverse the flow of time, sending Tim back before his current predicament. Besides using it to save your life you can also use it to solve puzzles, by stopping time to allow  you to think of a plan or moving back objects to obtain items. Some puzzles may leave some guessing and frustrated, however with some patience they can be solved easily (or just use a guide).\n\nSoundtrack is amazing. The music is very calm, with sorta 'Irish tune to it', and something you can listen to calm yourself (which especially helps with some of the puzzles). Sound effects are also good. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.\n\nGraphics are excellent. The 2D-art style is vibrant and detailed. It is quite attractive and fits perfectly for the game.\n\nBesides the main campaign, there is also 'speed-run' mode which is unlocked  after beating the game. The mode tests how fast you can get through certain stages in the game.\n\nIf your looking for a good story and don't mind some platforming and puzzles, Braid will show you how brilliance can be formed in a simple indie game.","April 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

People throw deconstruction around as a cheap buzz word, but here it actually applies. "Braid" quite literally and systematically disassembles the most common and basic mechanics of the past 30 years of platformers and both isolates and reassembles them in new ways on a level by level basis--all leading up to its brilliant twist ending which turns the conventional narrative of the genre completely on its head.\n\nPlus, it's one of very few games which use "game mechanics" and "gameplay" as languages and means of expression in their own right. You can learn as much of the philosophical nature of time and paradox just from playing Braid as you could from an entire undergrad course on the topics, not to mention about more ephemeral topics such as the nature of love, obsession, and regret.\n\nPretentious? Maybe. But luckily it's also fun to play as well.","June 30, 2012","true",""," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Right there in the middle. On the other side I do not like it to have a "meh" opinion. DAMN YOU BRAID! :D\n\nNow, I know this game has been praised all up and down for being amazing, and it is. Except for the times when it is not.\nTo me, the most interesting parts about Braid are the art style and the core gameplay mechanic. While I can't do anything but praise the style of the game as well I will do so. Be praised Art Style! Your rock!\nThe core mechanic, however, is a double edged sword. It basically is all about turning back and replaying time. You can do so manually at all times or sometimes you'll have a special time mechanic on your hands:\n\nIn example, when your movement is queued to the entire game world. Walking forward will move you and the time, standing still will freeze it and walking backwards will rewind it.\nThere are quite a few different time mechanics within Braid, but since I'm not all that evil I won't do spoilers here.\nOh yeah you can walk and jump here. That's like the platforming part. It's solid but nothing special without the time travel thingy.\n\nWhile this makes for an amazingly fresh gameplay experience, some of the puzzles tied to it are ridiculous. You'll spend hours upon hours to solve a single game screen just to get frustrated as hell, turning to a youtube guide if your computer can still play videos after you've tossed it through your entire apartement, out the window and ran it over with a truck. Twice.\nSome of the puzzles later on even require the usage of tricks never hinted at, let alone explained wich just seems cheep.\nThere may be the 1% of players who will dedicate their live to solving those puzzles without a guide but there's a 1% of people who try to invent time travel itself in the real world as well without much success. So yeah.\n\nAnother interesting thing are the collectables. You can run through almost the entire game, skipping all puzzles. Now it won't do you and good and you'll be done with the Braid within 15 minutes. So don't do it. Embrace the rage! By collecting certain things you'll uncover other certain things wich will uncover 6 very certain things and the games ending. Wich in itself is a thing. So ya. Getting those collectables is the goal of the game.\n\nThere are a few more things I wanna praise here to look in the mirror tomorrow morning, hating myself for being mainstream or something.\n\nYet another great apsect this game does have for it is the music. it's great. I do have the feeling that it is intendet to calm you while the hate about not solving puzzles inside you does grow to an infinite amount of pure rage. Just like the visual part of the game it feels "real". As in, all hand made. A warm piano accompanied by a soothing Cello charm your ears while you are afraid of blowing up the house on the other side of the street if your speakers fail to work all of a sudden. Or if you use the time mechanic (wich you have to) for it will rewind the soundtrack as well wich sounds god awful. So basically, the music makes you afraid of solving the game... Soundtrack, you've nailed it! Except for the fact that you make me staring at the screen not doing much at all cause I am afraid of rewinding you.\n\nThe story is surprisingly deep for a puzzle platformer. Not deep in the sense of an epic story that will unfold before you but deep as in you'll find yourself thinking about it... in fact, Braid is kinda vague on the story thing with a bunch of diaries as your only lore. But those diaries are, in fact, very well written and thought worthy... You'll (or can... there are those people) squeeze your thoughts in a philosophical attempt, triggered by those diaries in the game... with about 30% of your brain cells while the other 70% will be occupied crafting a pipe bomb you'll stick into your computer, watching it blow up in satisfaction about the running gamescreen fading to black while you'll get caught into the explosion. Story, you are awesome! Kind of.... Kant would like it I suppose.... or Tolstoi. Maybe...\n\n(Dat ending though.... 12/10)\n\nThere are more likable aspects about this game (like dropping huge objects on people and jumping on heads) wich do result in the same awesome but not awesome part of the game. In the end, it is indeed a great game wich you should buy but it also sucks ♥♥♥ for it will ruin your day whenever you start it. Wich probably means you shouldn't buy it.\nSo buy it! Or not! I dunno.\n\nYou'll have to answer yourself a simple question: Is the massive frustration worth the whole lot of joy you'll get from this game? I do not regret buying it at all but damn! This new computer was expensive!\n\nYet again... dat ending though! 13/10!\n\n\n(if there are any typos I DON'T CARE CAUSE I'M RAGING!)\n\n\n\nOh did I meantion the ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to beat speed mode? I didn't? Shame on me!","July 21, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is part of the canon—and for very good reason. Braid is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.\n\nThe core engine of Braid is a simple, 2D platformer reminiscent of Mario. (The resemblance to classic Mario is more than passing, and the creators of Braid overtly nod to it at several points.) But to the simple mechanics of jumping and dodging Braid has added a novel element: the ability to reverse time. At the touch of a button you can rewind your performance of a stage to whatever point you like and then begin again from that point.\n\nThat alone would be novel, but not worth much—just an alternative to replaying levels—but Braid makes this mechanic the central tool in the solution of an array of tricky puzzles. At first your control of time is just a way of undoing mistakes, but it quickly takes on other dimensions as you, for example, discover items which are immune to your powers and so keep moving normally while all else rewinds. Solutions to the problems Braid poses are not usually a matter of muddling through, trying things until something works, but instead involve having some insight about the central mechanic and how it affects your surroundings. Like a good riddle there is a moment of dawning insight and suddenly you see things in a new way.\n\nAnd the surroundings are themselves wonderful. While the mechanics of the game would be worthy regardless (an early version of Braid won a game design award while the graphics were still just place holders) the graphics makes the game into a piece of visual art. Everything in Braid looks hand-made in the best possible sense. The levels have an almost water colored look. And while there are actually fairly few sprites in the game, corresponding to the small number of pieces out of which levels are constructed, the background elements are various and gorgeous. Each group of puzzles has a distinct aesthetic subtly adapted to the content of the gameplay. Beautiful, low key instrumental music compliments all this perfectly. This game is simply pretty, and in a way that makes playing it feel meditative.\n\nThe story, provided mostly by textual interludes, is rather impressionistic. I found it difficult to make sense of, and in the end not entirely satisfying. But nonetheless thematic elements intertwine with the gameplay. The most obvious example is that you play as a man troubled by regrets, and this theme of regret resonates in the mechanic of undoing actions you have already performed.\n\nBraid is a piece of art, pure and simple, but as already mentioned it is also a tightly designed puzzle game. This means some stages are rather challenging, as they should be. However, a nice feature is that the puzzles are not locked into strict sequence. If the needed insight simply will not come in one place then it is open to the player to skip ahead and return for the missing bits much later, lessening the potential frustration that’s part of puzzle games.\n\nBraid has taken simple parts, things that have been around since 8-bit consoles, and polished them until they shone. Play it. You’ll be glad you did.","July 29, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is Braid. "\n\nBraid was told to me by someone in a forum, being an overlooked game and all. So after a year, I finally tried it out when it went sale. And...\n\nThere's a lot to compliment about Braid, and I'll start with the art style.\nIt is magnificent. Wonderful hand painted-like backgrounds to 2D variations sprites of these hand painted-like objects in the game. Everything good about aesthetics, this game has.\n\nNext is the plot. It is a story about a rather looking middle-aged man named Tim, that traverses different worlds from his house to find and rescue a "Princess". There are only a few noticeable characters, and, including Tim, are all very odd. The game offers a rather...no...very surreal plot, in a way that not everyone would understand, and probably it's intended best that way, for the people themselves to leave it to their imagination. I would like to talk about the ending, but I'll just spoil you guys. Which I would have to say, one of the most surreal endings I've seen yet.\n\nFinally the game's mechanics. It is a puzzle-platformer. 'Nuff said, but is it a good one? Yes, it's VERY GOOD at what it does. The system is so unique, that it contrasts your average platformers, and it provides a unique mechanic in every world. With that, it takes away the "redundancy" we see in most platformers.\n\nThe system's mechanics are divided into two: The Basic Mechanics; and The World's Mechanics.\nThe Basic Mechanics is supposedly Tim's otherworldly powers, which is controlling Time, either reversing it, forwarding it, or stopping it, but Tim goes along with the Time's flow, he does not stop in one point when he controls it, unless he has Time Immunity. The World's Mechanics, is how the World's reacts to everything, including Tim. The variation will differ in every new world. An example would be, that in one world, as Tim moves forward, everything moves forward, but when he moves backwards, everything moves backwards, disregarding him controlling Time to reverse time. As in another world, everything just moves backwards.\n\nThe game has no deaths. Whenever you die, you'll just be prompt to reverse time, so that you can prevent what killed you in the first place. The puzzles are literally two parts; the platforming puzzle, and the puzzle pieces you actually collect.\n\nDoes it have hints? No. The introduction to controls are rather a-blurred, that if you don't know how Braid works at first, you'd find that you can control time when you die. It's not a game for casuals...I would think that, but...the game has no deaths, as I've said.The platforming is brutally hard per se, but I'm pretty sure everyone with decent puzzle-platforming skills can manage it. So long they get used to the game's mechanics.\n\nLifespan is more or less 5 hours if you're a decent puzzle-platform gamer. As you would see in my game time, that will include the time I had breaks, like alt-tabs. But that excludes(for now) the "Hidden" stuff, that you people would know later on.\n\nOverall, it truly is a magnificent game. Probably as people say, it is an overlooked game amongst others, but I would greatly recommend this to everyone who enjoys puzzles and platforming.\n\nVerdict: 10/10","January 19, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sadly to them, they are still unable to do so, but not Tim, the protagonist in Braid, Jonathan Blow's puzzle platformer. At a certain point in his life, Tim lost someone very dear to him and thus he enters a quest for finding that someone, whom we only know as "the Princess". In his attempt to correct apparently permanent mistakes, Tim is able to rewind time, never having to suffer the consequences of a wrong decision. With this in mind, can Tim really lose anything in this journey?\n\nThe protagonist's travels are set in different worlds, divided in different levels, and the goal is quite simple: use Tim's abilities to solve platforming puzzles, collect every puzzle piece (literally) and reach the end of the level. At the beginning of each world, before entering any level, the player is presented with short books, explaining Tim's past and his relationship with the Princess. The plot, completely separated from the gameplay, is delivered in such an ambiguous manner that the player is mostly left with questions, pressing on hoping for an answer, but the princess always seems to be in another castle, as we are often told. Who is the princess?\n\nTime manipulation, often accompanied by platforming, is the gameplay's bread and butter, each world introducing and/or replacing new time mechanics, resulting in a great variety of puzzles. Braid isn't a game that gets easier as you grow accustomed to each ability, because you'll soon abandon it and be forced to completely readapt your thought process. The level "Fickle Companion" is a prime example of how becoming used on certain mechanics will stop you on your tracks until you begin to think again. It's a challenging game, but not in a way that will force you to abandon it. As you find a solution you'll notice how deceptibly simple it actually was. The superposition of platforming and time manipulation is so organic that it results in the most dinamically entertaining puzzles, while those who are solely time manipulation usually require more abstract thinking, usually being the most difficult.\n\nMost of Braid's $200,000 budget went to the game's artwork, developed by David Hellman. Every level has a lush pallet of colours and painted backgrounds, akin of an oil paiting. A forest in a yellowish tint, a cloudy blue sky, a city at sunset (or is it burning?) are a few examples of Hellman's glourious results. Would the game have delivered the same experience had the developer not invested in this artistic direction? We'll never know, because we lack Tim's abilities.\n\nThe music throughout the game is mostly delivered by Jami Sieber and Shira Kammen, resulting in a classical touch, which actually influenced the above mentioned artwork and actually help setting the game's mood. The prime examples are Kammen's "Downstream", which is an adaptation of Luar Na Lubre's "O son do ar" (Galician: The sound of air) and Sieber's "Undercurrent". The former is commonly used earlier in the game, when the story is at its gentlest, while the latter, much darker, is reserved for latter moments, namely the final levels. There is, however, little variety of music, which may tire those who are searching for an expansive soundtrack.\n\nDespite its flaws in storytelling and an ending, which despite being amazing, leaves lots of questions unanswered, Braid is an important piece in the most recent rise of independent gaming popularity. Its sometimes challenging puzzles will quench the thirst of those looking for a challenge of the minds, but will not appeal to those who prefer more action in their games. Will Tim ever find the princess? It's up to the player to find out.","August 3, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

To complete Braid, and in particular to complete the achievements, Braid forces you to play the same 5 second tidbits of game over and over again until you get it just right.

The fact that the story isn't just laid out for you to read trough and must actually put tought into it, coupled with the fact that the gameplay elements themselves are an important part of it can cause a much higher sense of accomplishment and even trigger some fairly strong feelings.\n\nThe graphics and estethics are amazing. The assets were litterally painted and digitized, and it shows - almost everything looks gorgeous. There's really little to say about it, and screenshots don't do it justice, just see it for yourself.\nThe music fits right in. Very atmospheric, yet still at times very melodic. A better soundtrack could not be wished for.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and interesting, often times quite difficult to figure out, even. And that's just the basic ones - there are hidden puzzles within puzzles that unlock something special, and those are _really_ mindbending sometimes. Each "world" comes with it's own set of rules and capabilities, and most of them are quite amazing.\n\nI, personally, have only two complaints about it: 1) the bunny-cat-flower things are make way too high-pitched noises, and 2) at some points there are doors (completely indistinguishable from regular ones) that break your key and don't open. That's just a cheap shot.\nOther than that, I can't fault almost anything about it.\n\nGo get it, and enjoy it - almost guaranteed you will.","January 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its a perfect blend of story telling and puzzle platform action.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of Super Mario with the monsters a bit like goomba troopers but with afro hair cuts. The puzzles will have you scratching your head while you figure out the different ways to complete them. Its broken up nicely into several different worlds and each world has its feature. See this is the interesting thing about Braid. Its the ability to go back in time. You can rewind and take yourself back in time and do it again if you screwed up. They work it nicely into the puzzles also with you having to rewind time as certain aspects in a level are sometimes not affected by the rewind. Sometimes this is a key to open a door or its a cannon or even a monster.\n\nThere is a lot of replayability to Braid. Once you complete the game normally you then have the challenges. Once you've done the challenge you have the ultimate time challenge... complete the whole game in one sitting in a time limit and the time limit leaves very little room for error. Which in itself can be a bit frustrating when you reach the last level and screw something up on the last part of the game.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game more. buy it....

There are a few places where quick reflexes are required, but for the most part solving the puzzles just requires figuring out the right sequence of actions. Most of the puzzles are intuitive yet difficult and require a lot of thought to solve. A few puzzles were so difficult that I had to consult a video walkthrough. The goal of the game is to collect puzzle pieces, and then assemble the puzzle on a canvas. The puzzles are artsy-fartsty paintings which are pretty decent, and it is trivial yet fun to put the puzzle together. There are also books in the game that contain pieces of a story. Just like the paintings, the developer is trying to get artsy-fartsy with this story as well. For me the story was too disjointed and "out there" for me, but this does not really detract from the game. The art and music for the game are very good. I played this game with a game controller on my PC, it is probably a bit harder to play in on a keyboard. Overall it is an excellent game that I can strongly recommend. If you like this game, you might like these 2-d puzzle games: Limbo, Vessel, The Swapper. You might also try 3-d puzzle games Portal, Portal 2, and Antichamber.","January 12, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its a perfect blend of story telling and puzzle platform action.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of Super Mario with the monsters a bit like goomba troopers but with afro hair cuts. The puzzles will have you scratching your head while you figure out the different ways to complete them. Its broken up nicely into several different worlds and each world has its feature. See this is the interesting thing about Braid. Its the ability to go back in time. You can rewind and take yourself back in time and do it again if you screwed up. They work it nicely into the puzzles also with you having to rewind time as certain aspects in a level are sometimes not affected by the rewind. Sometimes this is a key to open a door or its a cannon or even a monster.\n\nThere is a lot of replayability to Braid. Once you complete the game normally you then have the challenges. Once you've done the challenge you have the ultimate time challenge... complete the whole game in one sitting in a time limit and the time limit leaves very little room for error. Which in itself can be a bit frustrating when you reach the last level and screw something up on the last part of the game.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game more. buy it....

There are a few places where quick reflexes are required, but for the most part solving the puzzles just requires figuring out the right sequence of actions. Most of the puzzles are intuitive yet difficult and require a lot of thought to solve. A few puzzles were so difficult that I had to consult a video walkthrough. The goal of the game is to collect puzzle pieces, and then assemble the puzzle on a canvas. The puzzles are artsy-fartsty paintings which are pretty decent, and it is trivial yet fun to put the puzzle together. There are also books in the game that contain pieces of a story. Just like the paintings, the developer is trying to get artsy-fartsy with this story as well. For me the story was too disjointed and "out there" for me, but this does not really detract from the game. The art and music for the game are very good. I played this game with a game controller on my PC, it is probably a bit harder to play in on a keyboard. Overall it is an excellent game that I can strongly recommend. If you like this game, you might like these 2-d puzzle games: Limbo, Vessel, The Swapper.

Progressing through the game & solving the variety of diverse puzzles is certainly brain-teasing, & while some may leave you totally stumped at times, Braid is the type of game where as you are running around experimenting the answer will hit you all of a sudden & keeps you coming back for more. You can't die in Braid, but don't let that fool you into thinking this game is somehow lacking in difficulty. It's definitely quite challenging & just when you think you have solved it all there are secrets hidden throughout the game. While the game is not that long the experience will certainly leave its mark upon you. Thanks to Braid I now pay a lot more attention to indie games because there are some real gems out there. Also can't wait for "The Witness", the follow-up to this from lead developer Jonathan Blow.","July 3, 2011","true","32.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After all to err is human, but what if we revisit our past, fix the problems we create and come out the better for them? This is the crux of Braid, a game that at it's core, is about someone who has done something very bad and is now doing everything in their power to wind back the clock and make amends. Eloquently penned and highly symbolic it tells a story with a deliberate purpose, the details of which have been picked and scrutinized over. It's meant to be open ended, to inspire discussion, and ultimately to make you sit and ponder the outcome, which speaking purely from my own perspective caught me entirely off guard and was cause enough for me to pause and step away from it to contemplate what it all meant.\n\nBuilt around the narrative (or perhaps the other way around) are the puzzles which again deal with the manipulation of time. At first it's simply a way out of the inevitable mishaps you get into, but as you progress they evolve into much more elaborate and inventive conundrums, continually changing up the rules while keeping the framework intact. Again and again I was astounded by the simple elegant way everything fit together, much like the jigsaw pieces you collect, each part feeling necessary and fleshed out. This goes a long way in keeping the puzzles challenging and absorbing, and although it is a short experience developer Jonathan Blow makes smart use of his time and doesn't waste yours with filler or sections that fall flat from poor execution.\n\nThe rich pastel backdrops that blend effortlessly with the stunningly animated sprites, create a scene that looks like a watercolor painting in motion. It's absolutely beautiful and perfectly matches the tone of the narrative, further complemented by the soundtrack which flows alongside it in time, seemingly telling its own story in the process. It's an artistic masterpiece that captivated and enchanted me the moment I laid eyes upon it, and the organic pacing kept me wholly engrossed throughout.\n\nIf you only play one puzzle-platformer in your time, Braid would be very close to the top of my list. It personifies the genre better than almost anything that came before it or after, and did so before the genre was anywhere near as prolific as it is today. If for some reason the story doesn't grab you the brilliant puzzle designs will, and those that look deeper be duly rewarded with what has been placed beneath the surface. I savored my time with it and am now, like our protagonist, wishing I could go back and relive it over again.","November 5, 2013","true","5.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Gameplay is incredibly smooth and well done along with all the time tricks you get to experience throug the levels. You'll love the relaxing "classical" music and overall soft and chill appeal in whole design.\nThe trick is the first glance of simplicity wears off quite fast and you are going to get stuck. Often. Braid is by far the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. This is truly going to test how patient and clever you are. You are going to be frustrated at times, but at the same time each puzzle is going to give you a great feeling of accomplishment if you are patient enough to solve it on your own. None of the puzzles are dumb or repetitive and each brings a new pattern to uncover and understand.\nAbout the story - I must say I enjoyed the sentimental style and slow uncovering of it, but most of the time I was quite confused and had no idea what it was all about. Well, I definitely experienced better storytelling in games, but this game won my gaming soul just by its crisp gameplay.","May 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Each world has a variation on the time mechanic. It has beautiful art and the music is fantastic. It is easy to control and very forgiving. If you can't solve a puzzle right away, you can just move on and come back later.\n\nOne of the things I love about this game is that it doesn't hold your hand. It lets you discover the world in a very natural way. My first playthough of this game was on the XBLA and clocked in between 10-15 hours. The game can be completed in less than an hour once you have the puzzles memorized and if you are decently skilled at the game.\n\nI highly recommend it to everyone!

Manipulating time has never been so fun! You traverse through each of the five worlds, collecting puzzle pieces that are very difficult to get. Once I started playing, I couldn't stop. After completing the game, try the speed challenges to really test your skills. It took me an agonizing (but oh so enjoyable) 6 hours to play through the entire game without any breaks and help. Now I'm ready to beat the entire game+collecting all puzzle pieces in under 45min for the speed challenge achievement.

It's a challenging, yet forgiving game (by design). If you can't manage to figure out an especially tricky puzzle, you're allowed to play on and come back later to solve it. Time is a major element here, and you control ALL of it. Even the pace of the game is driven by you; the narrations of the story bits are read by you, and at no part of the game should you feel idle nor rushed.

To my disappointment, the dialogue in this game is some of the cheesiest I've ever read from anywhere. I may not be able to do better, but if you're going to make this a story oriented platformer, at least try to make sound less like a fifth grader's attempt at writing a mystery novel.\n\nWith that said, Braid is a great game. It's music suits the atmosphere very well as do the visuals. But those details pale in comparison to gameplay. At heart, Braid is a puzzle game, despite its platforming setup. A good majority of the puzzles require players to use time manipulation, with solutions that are both frustrating and clever.\n\nNo doubt there will be times you'll be stuck. My best advice is to never use a walkthrough because solving each puzzle will make you feel immensely rewarded. Instead, if you must, look for hints online (I admittedly did so a few times!), not answers.\n\nGrade: B+","June 27, 2011","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Well, as it turns out, all the puzzles ARE indeed solvable, so that would mean that I'm... no, actually, not (I solved all but one or two of the puzzles by myself).\n\nThe art was fantastic and the story was confusing and mind blowing at the same time (jsut wait until you get to the end!)\n\nMy only regret playing this game is that I didn't get any card drops, but the satisfaction of completing the puzzles is reward in its own right.","February 4, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline has very profound meaning behind it.\n\nThe mechanics and the world kinda remind you of Super Mario Bros, except you manipulate the flow of time instead of shooting fireballs. You literally cannot die as you can always rewind your action. You timing doesn't really matter in this game... Well it does to some extent, but if you made a mistake just rewind it back!\n\nUnfortunately this game is kinda short. About 3 hours to complete the story. But It takes more time and dedication to complete all the speed run (which can be quite frustating).\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of puzzle game, then you cannot pass on Braid.","April 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And they are totally right.\nBut what really makes this game shine is - in my opinion - the storywriting. The story is told by books at the beginning of every world, and you can read them or skip them, and they are pieces of art - you don't exactly know what the story is about, who "she" and "the princess" are, you have to come up with your own interpretation. Then you will eventually finish the last world and your interpretation may be proven wrong; you may start the game again and try to figure out, what it really is about, who is good and who is bad (in a platformer!), then you may start googling some quotes and ask yourself: Is it really about THIS? You'll never know...\n\nYou may ask, what is THIS? play the game and figure it out by yourself... 10/10","August 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is at times very challenging and fighting the urge to do a search on youtube for the way to clear an area could be tough for many people.\nVisually it has a timless art style which keeps it seperate from the graphic spec' fights of contempory titles and as a 2D game it is not overly taxing on the machine it is played on.\n\nThe Story, though hidden in a way, is actually quite deep & somber but i'll not spoil it. The length of the game is on the short side but for most people the puzzels will slow them down enough to get a good few gaming sessions out of it.\nGameplay wise, it is inventive and surprisingly intuitive. There is little need for any tutorial beyond trying out the variations on the mechanics each world brings.\n\nThe real downside is probably the replayabillity once you have collected all of the puzzle-pieces. Speed players may go back to try and beat their time but beyond that not much would bring the player back post completion.\n\nWhile most games out there lately seem to be either clones of other games or made to be easy to beat, this is refreshingly challenging. It looks good and it plays well. If you like platformers and puzzels, get it.","February 4","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game follows the original format of Mario where you go through different maps jumping through obstacles to eventually reach a castle, only to realize the princess is on a different map. The one thing that makes braid a much more brilliant game is because of its time manipulation mechanics and integrated puzzles within the game. The environment is the puzzle and your skills with time manipulation will ultimately determine whether or not you can beat the puzzle to advance on to the next map. The game feels surreal with bright poppy colors, and the music is soothing and relaxing. The story is very deep and meaningful for a 2d plat former game.

Zero autotune, zero electronic effects, zero ANYTHING that would indicate that they did anything other than grab a bunch of instruments and go to town. The gameplay itself? MASSIVE BUGS. I'm talking about TIME GOING BACKWARDS OR STOPPING and all sorts of ridiculous stuff that should never have made it past QA.

It is also a very good game.  Great sountrack and art style, and very fun gameplay that's fairly varied (though the first half is better).  HOWEVER the story is told entirely through mostly meaningless sort of pretentious walls of text at the beginnings of levels, which kind of sucks.  So yeah, except for a fairly brilliant ending sequence I'm not crazy about the story (though the text helps set the atmosphere of the levels, it doesn't go a good job of actually getting anything across), but Braid is worth getting soley for the excellent gameplay.","July 28, 2012","true",""," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game does well at creating some difficult puzzles which will test a persons mental prowess.\n\nI also think that the soundtrack is excellent and that it provided some great background noise which helps to soothe you as you try to figure out the puzzles which are presented.\n\nHowever, I think that the storyline is very dissatisfying and the reward that you get for finishing the puzzles is likewise a let down. I didn't find the gameplay or the story addicting enough to play it for more than an hour at a time. I thought that the overall look of the game was childish, which can be ok, but in this case rather annoyed me. The ambiguity of the storyline prevented me from feeling any attachment to the protagonist and the damsel in distress doesn't make an appearance until the end of the game. Essentially, the action of the story was never present during gameplay. There were obvious allusions to such gaming classics as Mario and Donkey Kong, but the game is not as nearly as addicting or as fun as those games are.\n\nIn the end, I expected more from braid. The game was short and although I enjoyed the soundtrack and found the mechanics innovative, that's all there was that impressed me. I recommend it for it's interesting mechanics and soundtrack even though it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.","January 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","0"

I've played about 10 hours of it in offline mode; I wound up getting about 2/3 of the way through the game.\n\nThis game is probably one of the most overhyped ever. It has some unique selling points, though. The art style is good, the story is really cool, and the central power is really awesome. Time control is a really unique power that many games haven't managed to implement well. For a while, braid implements it well--sometimes. Most of the puzzles don't really revolve around you using time reversal as a way to solve puzzles, but just trigger certain things once per level in very specifc circumstances. You're mostly walking around for the whole game.\n\nHowever, every new stage in braid is based around a new "version" of this time control mechanic. This means that the original mechanic doesn't get to grow and be explored in new ways. Let's compare Braid with Portal: in portal, you start off simple, just moving yourself and objects around. Then it gets complicated; you add in turrets, lasers, light bridges, and then movement gels. Every time a mechanic is introduced it _builds_ on the previous ones you've learned and takes the central power in a new direction.\n\nIn braid, the first power you have is the power to reverse time. This is explored for a bit, then you move on to other worlds. Here's some sample powers: one world has you move around, then "send" a shadow copy of yourself that follows the steps you just took that you have to interact with to solve puzzles. Another has the world run like a music box, where time moves forward as you move right and backward as you walk left. Do these sound related to the first mechanic you learned? Because they're not at all. What's the point of learning the core puzzle mechanic if you're going to drop it in the next world? The game could basically be described as a collection of 6 time-based different puzzle minigames, but not as a puzzle game that follows a good, challenging progression.","December 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

Он является абсолютно изолированной единицей, неспособной на взаимоотношения с кем-либо. Его реакции направлены внутрь, они не относятся к мыслительным процессам; его разум — просто инструмент для обслуживания собственных страстей и потребностей; он не способен к полету мысли, обмену идеями; он не соотносит себя ни с чем, кроме собственных физических ощущений. Он — полумертвая, ни на что не реагирующая масса, неспособная давать или получать удовольствие или счастье; соответственно, он, в лучшем случае, абсолютно скучное явление, безобидное пятно, поскольку только те, кто способны воспринимать и принимать других, обладают очарованием. Он застрял на полпути в сумеречной зоне между человеком и обезьяной, но гораздо хуже обезьян, поскольку, в отличие от них, способен испытывать множество негативных чувств — ненависть, ревность, позор, отвращение, вину, стыд, сомнение; более того, он осознает, что он такое, и чего ему недостает.\nОбуреваемый чувством вины, страхами, стыдом и неуверенностью, обладая, если удается, едва заметными физическими ощущениями, Тим, тем не менее, полностью захвачен желанием ебаться; он переплывет море соплей, перейдет вброд глубокую лужу блевотины величиной в милю, если будет думать, что там его ждет любезная «киска». Он выебет женщину, которую презирает, любую беззубую ведьму, и даже заплатит за это. Почему? Снятие физического напряжения — это не ответ, поскольку для него достаточно мастурбации. Нельзя объяснить это и удовлетворением самолюбия, иначе он не ебал бы детей и трупы.\nАбсолютно эгоистичный, не способный реагировать, сочувствовать, отождествлять себя с другими, наполненный до краев необъятной, всепроникающей, всепоглощающей сексуальностью, он физически пассивен. Он ненавидит свою пассивность, поэтому считает, что она свойственна женщинам, а мужчины — активны, а затем пытается доказывать, что он существует («доказывать, что он — Мужчина»). Главный его способ доказать это — ебля.","December 23, 2013","true","8.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","2"

After about 4 hours, I did everything except for the speedruns, which I decided weren’t worth my time.\n\nThe story just seems all over the place, I know it's supposed to be out of order, but what order is it supposed to be in exactly? Reading through the texts, almost nothing seemed to be part of some cohesive story line and nothing was even enjoyable to read. What a terrible epilogue. Far before the end of the game, I had lost all interest in the story, which comes off as pretentious.\n\nPuzzle difficulty increases almost exponentially, which would be fine if there was more instruction on your new powers than just "The Pit" levels at the beginning of each world, especially with the ring.\n\nThe art is also very off-putting to me. The main character, Tim, has this unsettling stare up into the sky, like he’s looking at nothing and his expressions consist of a creepy toothless smile and what looks like a frown maybe? One of the puzzles has the gall to make use of the jigsaw puzzle pieces scattered throughout the game, as if the bland looking platforms are distinct somehow.\n\nMost of the music was good, at least the first time I heard it. In world 4, since your movements change time, each level is really only about 8-20 seconds of real music and you get to hear it all distorted and weird for like 30 minutes as you struggle through the puzzles.\n\nThis game was enjoyable for about 45 minutes and I don’t recommend buying it at full price under any circumstance.\n\nEdit: I have since read the Wikipedia article about this game and it just about validates every single problem I had with this game. Blow basically says outright that the story is whatever you thought it was (in my case it was trash). Blow was so pretentious about his game that he didn't think anyone was smart enough to make a soundtrack for it. And again, Tim looks like Chucky.\n\nI have also realized that this game is, in fact, not at all as intelligent as it is made out to be. Just because you can't understand something, doesn't make it smart, it doesn't make it a masterpiece. If you want to ponder and reflect on a story, read a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book, don't play this game.","June 17, 2014","false","4.3"," 32 of 69 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","32","69","2","0"

It's a game that begs to be liked: beautiful, painting-like art, soothing soundtrack, and ingeniously crafted puzzles. It has a complex, well-written storyline that requires a series of intelligent inferences to follow, as well as a whole horde of subtext and interpretation articles written by people far more intelligent than me. It's an intimidating game, too: a game that birthed an entire genre and has become a sort of initiation into indie gaming for many players out there. It's one of those games that, when you're having a conversation about small developer teams and the rise in indie gaming, you just can't ignore.\n\nA lot of people make the mistake of equating an industry changing game with a good game, and while Braid is, in truth, a work of art, I struggle to qualify it at as a truly enjoyable experience as a game. The mechanics of Braid revolve around the idea of time-manipulation as a core gameplay element. When your character moves forward, time moves forward. If your character moves backwards, time moves backward. But what starts as a relatively simple and unique method of creative puzzle solving turns into something grotesquely twisted and almost indecipherably complicated. Hard puzzles in a game should never be a bad thing, but puzzles that are so far out of the realm of my thinking that they become nigh unsolvable aren't fun, they're incredibly off-putting.\n\nOn top of the intensely challenging puzzle-solving aspect of Braid, the game also identifies as a platformer that often tests the reflexes and timing of the player holding the controller. As the game progresses the player must become more and more precise with their control of the main character. Unfortunately, this, in combination with the difficult puzzles, made for a game that I could only play half of—any of the puzzles that weren't too farfetched for me to understand were instead doubly frustrating because they required a precision and sense of timing that my fumbling hands just couldn't seem to fathom.\n\nAltogether, Braid's the kind of game whose phenomenal story is somewhat ruined by its gameplay for me. It's the sort of game that I would rather watch someone play through on YouTube and then read about it on the wiki afterwards than sit down with the controller myself. It's a summary game—the kind of thing that when you step back and look at it as a whole, it's a wonderfully enlightening experience, but that experience is drowned out by an incredibly steep learning curve and absurdly convoluted puzzle solutions. Playing Braid is an uphill climb and while the view at the top of that mountain is pretty great, it's not quite worth the struggle to get to it in the first place.","January 2, 2015","false","8.3"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","24","53","2","0"

Doing many of them felt like a chore. It wasn't fun.

Graphics are great, music is nice, some of the puzzles are impressively clever, the end sequence has a "HAH"-worthy moment, and that's just about where my praise ends.\n\nThe story OOZES pretentiousness. Holy lord, you have no idea. Pretty much a long collection of non-sequiturs in the form of diaries that refuse to tell a coherent tale. The music, while pretty good, is butchered to hell by the time mechanics; quickly loses its luster by the 20th time you have to hear the same 5 seconds looped forwards and backwards. Lastly, while most of the puzzles are actually pretty good, the game does an awful job at actually explaining the gimmicks and limitations of each time style.\nMinor puzzle spoiler:\nFor one, it's pretty obvious that your "shadow self" from world 5 can kill enemies, but the fact that the enemies can also kill your shadow (and gain height from it) is left for the player to figure out (i.e. blindly stumble backwards into).\nTo sum, vagueness killed this game for me, both in terms of mechanics and in story.

For me a really important element to a well made game is the story behind it, and if I can't connect to it then it's hard to truly enjoy the game. The story is essentially about a guy who regrets being a bad husband and wishes he could turn back time. If you think you could connect to this story, then consider buying the game, otherwise there's better stuff out there. If I could turn back time would I still buy this game? Probably not.

A neat idea, but the game is ultimately just dull. You spend your time messing around redoing things over and over to try and do the perfect sequence to get another puzzle piece, which you then literally need to use to assemble a puzzle in a very clunky interface. Ultimately, it just isn’t much fun, it gets quickly boring when you have to continue to retry your bounce off one of the enemies just the right way to reach your goal because the controls are poor.","February 23, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","7","19","0","0"

This game is pretty much pretentious Super Mario Bros. without a time limit. The story, which I had thought was a highlight going into the game, is literally just poorly written flavor text that flashes on the screen before you enter a world, that you couldn't care less about if you tried. The watercolor art and the classical music playing during the levels really showcase the pretentiousness of the devs. Finally, in my opinion, while some of the mechanics were entertaining at first, many of the puzzles are poorly designed and frustrating, even with the somewhat unique time reversal mechanic. Something is wrong in any puzzle game when I am unable to beat a level simply because a mechanic wasn't introduced properly. Yes, of course I believe puzzles should be challenging, but in a much more genuine way. I never had to use the internet for Portal or Portal 2 even for the challenge maps, and yet I always eventually found the solutions out after taking plenty of time scanning my surroundings. With Braid, I had to use the internet on more than three of the puzzles and each time I felt completely ripped off.\n\nThe bottom line is that Braid just isn't very much fun. If I play it for a while, it sort of grows on me, but once I quit, I can't force myself to go back and play it. It also makes me angry that Jonathan Blow has the audacity to go on record and criticize other, far greater video games than his own, the least of which being Bioshock Infinite. For as many problems as Bioshock Infinite had, it's still a far more entertaining game than Braid.","August 9, 2015","false","8.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I won't describe the plot anymore than saying it does not make any sense and when you think you've got a handle on it, it quickly flies away.\n\nAs for the gameplay, its pretty damn fun if you're into this kind of puzzle game. By that I mean really hard ones with no hint system whatsoever. You can rewind time, and must use this skill and some platforming to collect jigsaw puzzle pieces. This isn't strictly necessary but, given the terrible storytelling, the puzzles are the only fun this game offers. Oh and the game often adds very interesting wrinkles to this time mechanic. The design is fantastic. But this is also an extremely hard game. There is no smooth difficulty curve. I tried to get each puzzle piece myself and only looked up a solution after reaching peak frustration. I was able to get the majority of them myself, and more than a few times found the solution to be something I never would have thought of.\n\nI'm happy to have played Braid, mainly because I wanted to see why critics love it so much.

Not just because the initially nonsensical logic-bending puzzles are difficult (and they are difficult) and not just because the solutions have to be executed with such a high degree of precision that it leads to a lot of frustrating trial and error (and there is a lot of frustrating trial and error), but because the game seems to go out of its way to trip the player up at every possible opportunity, up to and including inatentive blindness kills worthy of the kill-screens of even the most change-hungry arcade cabinets.\n\nYes it has the rewind dynamic, key to it's design, but rather than being an interesting addition it just seems to serve to prevent the game from being just totally impossible to tollerate, and just barely at that, because,  unfortunately, it's inclusion and implementation just doesn't seem enough to justify all of the cheap deaths that seem to be set up at every turn as though intended really just to frustrate.\n\nBasically in addition to the core design, Braid also seems to be designed to trip the player up whenever  and wherever possible, essentially putting a pie in the player's face at nearly every step, almost like practical jokes the player should be in on but unfortunately it's one of those things that's not really that funny when it's happening to you.\n\nBraid consistently frustrates; if it had a muted trumpet "waa waa waa waa" everytime it trips the player up with a pie in the face or a slap accross the cheek with with a wet fish no one would recommend anything but uninstalling this game and never touching it again.\n\nBraid is a remarkable achievement for a single indy developer, but ultimately, on some level, it really can just feel, at best, like a chore and at worst like some bizarre form of mental abuse, and as a result, does begin to grate, and ultimately to become just kind of repellent.\n\nBraid ultimately has effectively conditioned me out of actually wanting to play it, which is a shame because I enjoy puzzle games and I quite like its aesthetic. I'd recommend just enjoying what you can of the demo, up to the point that it starts to irritate; unless you're some kind of sado-masochist (and I guess "to each his own") I don't recommend playing beyond that point.\n\nAs with many of the other people who've posted their thoughts about Braid, I have to say...I wanted to like Braid...?","June 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

This is just my impression of the game, so you should take it with a bunch of salt.\n\nPositives: I generally like the graphics.  The painterly style is kind of nice to look at.  The concept of the puzzle design being about turning back time seems intriguing.\n\nNegatives: As far as the gameplay goes, I just couldn't wrap my head around many of the puzzles.  Many of them seemed like I needed to come back later, because I was missing some ability, but I wasn't quite sure.  Unfortunately, I can't comment on the puzzle design with much authority because I just didn't want to play the game very long.\n\nWhat I can say for sure is that this game was off putting for me.  I'll try to put my finger on that... mainly, it's the soundtrack.  I hated it.  Soundtrack is very important to me, especially for a platformer of this style.  But this game's soundtrack is all wrong.  As music, it is nice enough, but as a soundtrack it just doesn't fit what is happening on screen.  It's non congruent.  It's also not particularly good soundtrack music as none of it is very memorable.  It basically sounds like someone just grabbed some random music off their ipod and just through it in background while I played.  I think this non congruency might be why some people accuse this game of pretentious-ness.  To be "pretentious" literally means to put on a pretense of something you're not, and the soundtrack alone sounds like it's screaming at the player "this game is very serious and important!" while not at all trying to fit what was happening on screen.  The very definition of pretentiousness.\n\nFrom what I've heard, this pretentiousness also extends to the story, but unfortunately I can't comment on that.  What I can say is, besides the soundtrack, there was just something about this game that really put me off.  Maybe it was the overall feeling of the game, that feeling that all of the components aren't meshing well together.\n\nOverall: I'll be the first to admit that this not a great review.  What a review is supposed to do is inform about a game, and I don't know enough about it to provide much useful information.  If I worked for a gaming publication, I wouldn't publish this.  But you know, I'm just a guy who tried the game, and this is my personal impression of that game.  For me personally, the first hour of playing this game was enough to put me off from wanting to play any more.  Feel free to take that for what you think it's worth.\n\nAbout my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  Overall score, and soundtrack.  Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance.  The meaning of each number are as follows:\n\n0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece\n\nBraid's score:\n\nGame Rating: 4 (Mediocre)\nSoundtrack Rating: 1 (Awful)","July 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Only one DEVASTATING problem: it's too hard. Puzzle games like this should have a good amount of training. You train players until they fully catch one idea of puzzle solving, and only then can you put them into a real puzzle. However this game lacks training - there's hardly any training at all, it just throws you into a brain-killing puzzle and then nothing. As a result, most of the puzzles seem impossible to me, and I've lost all interest in this game.\n\n+ beautiful graphic and music\n+ flawless time reversing\n+ moving story (from what I've seen so far)\n- not enough training\n5 out of 10, unsatisfying.","February 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Controls are solid and I appreciate the fact that nothing is explained, instead of the player must figure it out. It's too bad then that the game suffers from such poor design a times. Puzzles can be broken, making the unsolvable and needing a restart. Some puzzles are timed, miss the timing and again, a restart is required as rewinding won't fix it. There is no quick way to do this however, one must either go back to a door and then back to the puzzle, or exit the world, reinter it, and select the level. For a game that requries such trial and error one would assume the game designer would have made this more easily done.\n\nAdditionally, this game requires 100% completion. You have 5 worlds to start out with, and to get to the next world you must complete every single level before, getting all puzzle pieces is the only way to actually beat the game. Most games that require progression in earlier levels to reach the final destination settle for an amount close to 100%, but not quite. Of course, it wouldn't be as much of an issue if the game didn't suffer from the restart issue described earlier. Sadly this just made the game a chore to play, which isn't much of a game at all at that point.","July 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","14","35","0","10"

From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.\n\nBraid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game.

I found that all the puzzles were challenging, for me anyway. One of my problems with this game is for those people who aren't really into it for the collecting can sometimes just simply walk right to the exit. I found this games puzzles interesting and creative, using the time travel really well. But some of these are nearly impossible and the fact that i could just walk right past it was really annoying. Take world 2. The ... hedgehogs, I guess, were getting fired out of the cannon and you had to time it perfectley to make it across the gap. I ended up just walking right past it after trying MANY times to make it. And the no dying? Breaks alot of gaming rules. Dying is part of how gaming works. And besides, it's not like it helps you. It takes you back to exactly where you are and for most of it all it helps you with is knowing that you were off by a few seconds. Pretty useless. The game fails to tell you anything about what things do and how they work. I had to figure out how to go back in time which i caught on to at the start of the second world. The story was pretty dull and boring so i really didn't pay attention to the text. The game isn't exciting. The music is bland, the puzzles can be repetitive, the story is boring, the game is confusing, and it's just not that fun.They even started reusing puzzles! I swear, the first world has a parkour to the end level. 2 worlds later, they have the exact same level, but you have to kill all the monsters on your way. Again, the game overuses the time travel. Need to revive, time travel. Kill a boss, time travel. Timed something wrong, time travel. Do anything wrong whatsoever, you guessed it. TIME TRAVEL! To sum it up, this game is probably the worst I currently have on Steam. It's just different for me cause i'm used to sidescrollers to having killing things, platforming, and making to the end of the stage. Not going back in time to solve problems, having optional puzzles on the way, and taking a nice lovely stroll through a bland field and occasionally jumping over a hedgehog.

Just because a game seems deep or philosophical does not automatically mean it's a shining paragon of gaming artistry. The games time reverse gimmick is pretty neat at first, but the schtick wears off pretty quickly as the "puzzle" difficulty ratchets up extremely fast. I thought Braid's artwork was really nice to look at although the main character looked a bit to me like a shrunken down Junior Gorg from Fragil Rock outfitted in a schoolboy uniform. The soundtrack was also a bit off-putting for me, much like the time reverse aspect, the music was nice at first, but I soon found myself turning my speakers off while playing. Finally, the play through time. The one saving grace I found didn't have anything to do with the game at all, it's the fact that I bought Braid during a Steam sale for about 75% off. I finished the game in about 5 hours and would have felt terrible paying full price.","January 1, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

The puzzles themselves mostly aren't very difficult, with more issues arising from implementing your solution rather than thinking it up due to the way it controls. If Braid were just about this, it'd be pretty okay for, say, an internet flash game. Graphically, the game is... not nearly as good as it is hyped up to be. Eye-wateringly bright colour palettes (world 3 is especially bad about this) and largely boring environments mark this as ugly and forgettable. Musically, for my taste nothing really stood out at all. Writing this after having just beaten the game, I'm already having trouble remembering most of the pieces.\n\nWhere the game really starts to stink is its story, which is 90% delivered to you in horrible prose dumps. The writing in these is absolutely excruciating and later often only tangentially related to the levels you experience afterward. Video game 'academics' have stated that this game manages to meld story and gameplay: I fail to see it. At any rate, the provision of story via a gigantic ugly text dump at the beginning of a world is a major design disaster and, for me, a sign of the game being supremely self-conscious about presenting itself as an intellectual experience (it fails).\n\nPlease, video games, stop trying to be 'art'.","December 27, 2013","false","5.8"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","1"

The surface mechanics of the game are very similar to the old Super Mario World, but the twist that makes it fundamentally different is the ability to manipulate the flow of time either forwards or backwards, which makes for some truly ingenious puzzles.  In addition to being able to move backwards and forwards through time, each of the five main worlds of Braid introduces a new element to the spacetime manipulation that keeps the puzzles fresh and intriguing.  While the storyline has a distinct stream-of-consciousness style and can be hard to follow, the artwork and the soundtrack make for an aesthetically pleasing ride through the game.

I love this game so much that I watched someone else play it. It is a must own for anyone, it will bend your mind, and test your patience innovatively. It is truely a work of art, and up there wish Bastion as far as games you should have on steam right now.\n\nA side note for adults, if you have Lucy with you, this game is amazing, very visualy trippy, the music fits perfect, and the story is dreamy.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game: Some of the puzzles require you to really think, this may be too demanding for someone who wants a breezy game to beat.\n\nWould I buy at current asking price of 9.99? Yes, even though I got it in a bundle for much less, I would not wait to play this game, it is truely one of a kind.\n\n**Disclaimer**\nI would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant.\nThe current date of review 11/20/14.","November 20, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
