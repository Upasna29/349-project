The player usually takes control of an aircraft (or spacecraft) to do this, and today, we define this sub-genre as the "Schmup" (shoot-em-up).  These games were such a staple of gaming's earlier developments that you can see thier DNA now infused with many modern games.  The problem is that the more pure form of vertical and horizontal scrolling shooters doesn't seem to surface very often anymore.  The more recent release of Radiant Silvergun in the x-box live marketplace makes up for some of this, but the modern shoot-em up world is still barren!\n\nEnter Velocity Ultra-- possibly the most clever evolution of the classic shooter genre, since Ikaruga.  This game takes the conventional shoot-em-up, adds an excellent teleportation system, throws you into it's more than fifty mini-playgrounds,\nand challenges you to adapt to them while meeting certain requirements.  Those that find an affinity with this game, as I have, won't be able to stop until they've gotten a gold medal in every stage.\n\nThe graphics are more than adequate, and have a consistent style to them that doesn't confuse the eyes or get in the way of the gameplay mechanic.  The comic-like art in between missions is fun to look at, and serves as a throwback to the "barely-there" style of storytelling that most shoot-em-ups adhere to.  Why tease the player with too much story when all that'll be needed is very twitchy hands?  The comic-frames more than suffice.  Music is above average techno (I understand that electronic music consists of multiple sub-generes, but "techno" seems to fit the profile here), and carries the game's pace nicely.  Controls are fluid and responsive, with only the occasional failed teleportation to make the player question his or her controller.  And even then, practice makes perfect is the bread & butter of this game, and evidences it's tight gameplay.  I'm curious as to how the controls feel in the Vita original, and I'm even more curious to see how curve studios might integrate the teleportation controls in to IOS, or other mobile devices.\n\nBuy this game.  It's an evolution of one of the most classic genres of video gaming, and it does what it does very well.  The price is certainly right, and we need to encourage more development of games in this genre!  Oh, and did I mention the game has a built in calculator, as well as the game Mine-sweeper?  Does this enhance the experience?  No!  Is it awesome?  Yes!\n\n9.1 / 10","December 12, 2013","true","1.6"," 84 of 103 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","84","103","0","3"

The controls take some time to get used, and it's a bit hard to master at the start, but with some practice you'll do well. It's important to say that this is not a bullet hell title.

Teleporting gives you a nice method of advanced movement, and in many stages a mechanic for puzzle-solving. The controls are easy to understand, but take a while to master.\n\nReplayability: Even after beating the game, you will probably revisit levels to achieve the level-specific milestones for time spent, survivors rescued and score (possibly all in the same run, to get a "Perfect" stamp). Getting all that usually takes about 15h to 20h.\n\nPresentation: Unfortunately the game falls short in this category. The visuals are simple but at least for me get the job done, and the music isn't exactly bad, but gets annoying over time. I mute the in-game music and set my own playlist.\n\nConclusion: It's a very underrated gem, and deserves your time for bringing fresh ideas to the genre, while providing precise and rewarding gameplay.","March 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/244890/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Velocity Ultra is a cool shoot 'em up, where you can complete most of the levels at your own pace. You can scroll through the levels at a faster pace with the press of a button. Your ship can also teleport and hit walls without taking damage. It's an impressive spaceship, really. There are many levels, about 50 or so, and completing a level will earn you xp; xp that can be used to progress through these many levels as some of more difficult ones will still be locked at the beginning. And it's not just about navigating levels, you also have to shoot enemies (with upgradeable weapons later on) and collect escape pods. Collecting and shooting these will help you earn a bronze, silver or gold medal and these are tied to your xp. I should've mentioned that a tiny bit earlier maybe, but what the hell. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, or a short story shorter; it's an amusing game with, for me personally, not enough content to keep me coming back for more. Then again, it's a shoot 'em up and I've rarely seen one with tons of content. Still, entertaining. Certainly not bad.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","December 26, 2013","true","2.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The folks over at Futurlab have tried to innovate on this style of game with much success. It stays true to the roots of a Shmup while experimenting with things such as acceleration and teleportation.\n\nNow while these innovations change how the game plays, it doesn't mean it'll suit everyone. Personally I suffer from motion sickness in some games, games such as Battlefield and Hotline Miami are prime examples, with either narrow FOV or with large amounts of moving elements. Velocity Ultra suffers from the latter, with the addition of acceleration you'll be jumping between snail crawling speeds to being able to do the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs. This is worsened by the quite zoomed in nature of the game and how you're encouraged to use your blink ability ASAP which causes you to move to the top of the screen, only seconds later being forced to draw back, these jumps up and down across the screen are the main offenders to motion sickness. Narrow game sections are a similar affair, with sometimes 70%+ of the screen being covered in repeating tilesets.\n\nNow if you're not a panzy like myself and can actually play more than 5 minutes without having to take a break you'll love this game, and I can say that to people who may not even be Shmup fans. It innovates enough that it can appeal to a large audience while still being a Shmup at its core with hundreds of enemies, online leaderboards and multiple weapon types. It features a great soundtrack and the cutscene art is a favourite of mine, the style it's done in is breathtaking using a small palette of green, blue and red with thick outlines is a sight for sore eyes.\n\nThe game controls well and supports keyboard + gamepad, runs at 60FPS which is always nice to see. Options while somewhat limited should not be an issue as this game seems to run well on nearly every setup. Only major complaint would be the lack of audio sliders and maybe an ability to zoom out further (though that could make certain teleportation segments slightly easier).\n\nCheck this game out it's worth the money, has lots of cool interesting things which I haven't seen in a Shmup. It's just a shame that this will be a game I won't be able to fully enjoy because of the constant acceleration and teleportation.","December 17, 2013","true","1.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","1"

You need to clear every levels and save the survivors, but for that, you'll have to use teleporters, dive ability, booster and or course : shooting.\n\nThe game is in 2D but that's fine, it's beautiful, and smooth. The difficulty increases for every zone you'll unlock.\n\nThis is like a race game mixed with Ikaruga and Portal. There is leaderboard and high replayability to gain every possible gold medals.

Different stages alternate their focus between puzzles, speedy navigating, and shooting/dodging, so there's a nice feeling of variety.  The shooting is pretty forgiving (your ship can take multiple hits) so extreme shmup skills aren't required.

The concept is simple: save all survivors, take out threats, and complete each stage as fast as possible. The twist to this game is that you have to teleport from area to area in order to complete these tasks. Where many shmup's difficulty stems from bullet hell, Velocity®Ultra's challenge comes from fast pace manuvering. The game's fluid and tight mechanics are its stong point. However, this is what will make or break you during your play. In other words, it's a perfectionist type of game. Learning how to navigate/teleport as quickly as possible while rescuing all survivors as quickly as possible is a rewarding challenge. Visually, its easy on the eyes. It boasts a cartoonish art style which is a nice touch, offering a different atmosphere than most shmups. However, It can be somewhat repetetive. Each of it's 40+ stages is just a slight variation over the others. Then again, for the under 5 bucks I payed for it, I can't complain. I think there's a lot of potential this title and I look forward to any future installments.","June 8, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, like all puzzle shmups (excluding a particularly awesome boss sequence in Shikigami no Shiro II), the shmupping(?) falls a bit flat.  Ikaruga fares a bit better in this regard with the awesome boss battles but Ikaruga not only sucks as a shmup (enemies never aim at you, they just spray patterns, everything is pre-set and once you get the hang of it every game will be the exact same) but it sucks as a bland match-three puzzler.  If you want a good shmup I would generally avoid Steam because even the ones with more praise such as Jamestown are not that good (fine, if you really want one maybe try Ether Vapor Re-master) so graduate to the Sega Saturn or at least download a good version of Shmupmame.  Now, it may sound like I'm bashing the game, but in reality I'm just very long-winded; the puzzle half of this game rocks!  The levels are tight and well thought out, the controls respond perfectly, and there are various techniques to master if you want to improve your time and score throughout all 50 levels.  The shmup aspect does fit in such a way that it makes what are already complicated puzzles more stressful and constrained adding to the challenge.  There are neat frames shown before missions giving you the gist of what is occurring in the level and the music is your standard techno affair but done better than most.  My two largest complaints so far are that the leader-board scores seem broken (or I'm just the worst player ever) and the screen tears at the top quite frequently.  I'm only eleven levels in and those eleven levels did not take me very long but the difficulty is starting to ramp up to a point that I'm being genuinely challenged which, for being only a fifth of the way in, is awesome and leads me to believe that there should be some decent longevity to the game, especially for its genre.  I'd recommend this game to fans of puzzle games who shmup in their spare time and recommend people that do not fit this niche to watch some game-play videos and wait for more qualified reviews from anywhere that is not IGN.","December 12, 2013","true","1.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

Throwing powerful bombs in every direction is as easy as flicking the right stick, yet the less-powerful main guns have their place. Every stage in Velocity is designed like a puzzle, with switches to hit in a certain order, enemies to kill, and civilian pods to rescue. A single miss-placed bomb can reset the switches, while the main guns take far more shots to activate a switch.\n\nSwitches and shmups wouldn't seem fun on paper, but Velocity includes a teleportation feature that makes missing a switch far less punishing than it would be otherwise. In certain levels, you can place a limited number of checkpoints to allow you to hop between switches with ease. The teleportation isn't limited to the checkpoints, however, as you are also free to teleport into any open space you can see.\n\nThe combination of the shooting, switches, and teleportation with a screen that constantly scrolls upwards (you're always forced to go forwards, so without the teleport you could never move back) seems overwhelming. However, Velocity does a very good job with pacing. As someone who is usually terrible at these kinds of games, I was surprised how quickly and easily I got into the game. I'll probably never get a handle on all the systems in play, but I'm definitely having fun.\n\nI only have two issues with the game. First, manually teleporting around the map feels extremely clunky, and I've died several times from the cursor refusing to recognize a space as empty. Second, levels are gated by XP, so if your not good at these kinds of games you may find yourself forced to replay levels in order to progress.\n\nOverall a good game.

Still i am a huge fan of scroll shooters and tried it out.\n\nIn Velocity Ultra you try to rescue as many survivors as possible and finish the level as fast as you can to gain the maximum score.\n\nWhile this is a different approach to the scroll shooter genre than the usual "kill everything", it doesnt seem to work very well. Even though all levels are different, they just feel the same, as all you do is collecting rescue pods that are hard to reach.\n\nThe fights feel really bad, as the opponets ships are all looking the same, are not animated and just feel wrong. They die in one shot and even though you get special weapons, its no difference as they are not fighting back. As the screenshots tell, this changes at some point, but the game was so boring that i couldnt make it to those levels without falling asleep.\n\nThe only challenge in this game comes from the high speed and the locations of the rescue pods that need to be collected.\nA game that is about getting the best time and score, should offer scoreboards and allow the player to compete for the best time. However, in velocity ultra there is simply a maximum score you can get which totally desotroys the competition.\n\n\nI recommend watching a couple of videos before hitting the "buy" button, as this is not the typical scroll shooter.

It requires great judgement, some memory skills, a problem solving attitude and sharp reflexes. But unlike other TDS's the fault is never with the game. If a mistake is made then you know who made it, and it spurs you on to try harder next time. The game is never at fault, and as such the biggest challenge is knowing how hard to push yourself. Go too fast and you're in for a world of hurt - go to slow and you'll never clock up the highest scores.\nThis game stands alone as a great example of how games should be done. The artwork and music really capture the atmosphere, and the hidden minigames are all sublime. I would recommend that you add this game to your library, the difference is refreshing, the learning curve is spot on, and the challenges are all perfectly balanced.

Note that this game has been ported from the PSVita, but the port has been executed excellently so you won't notice it while in-game.\n\nConcerning story: The storyline is decent (though nothing much out of the ordinary for a shoot-em-up) Some levels have a cartoony screen setting the scene and explaining the storyline of the game, so you don't get bothered too much by that in-game.\n\nConcerning gameplay: the game itself isn't that different from a regular shoot-em-up, until around 10 levels in, where the game introduces a teleport mechanic. You are capable of teleporting back to a checkpoint you put down wherever you are, as much as you want. A very innovating feature, and quite fun considering the added insane difficulty that comes with wanting that shiny "Perfect" medal on the level select screen, or the achievements that follow it.\nThere are levels where you need to deal with waves upon waves of hostiles, waves where the only objective is simply rescuing vessels, or levels where you can't let go of the speed boost button, another feature introduced to complement the difficulty.\nThis game is a test of muscle memory, rapid response, aim, perception, and skill in general.\n\nConcerning bugs: Almost completely bug-free. There is a bug where you can hold the teleport button for the bonus levels and clip through walls, but this is never really useful, as you can't move while teleporting, and bonus levels tend to snake around a lot. There's also an issue with teleportation being slightly calibrated incorrectly so in the fast-paced levels you can't hug a wall to your left without dying if your reflexes aren't up to par, however this is only really an annoyance if you play with a gamepad, as the mouse simply doesn't handle that way.\n\nAll in all, these are only minor issues and can be ignored.\n\nTL;DR: An innovating game that's easy to learn but hard to master. Definitely a must-get for anyone, imho.","August 17, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, though fun, many have been nothing more than attempts to replicate games often found on the iOS and Android systems. Velocity represented a departure from this and in doing so created a new standard for what can be achieved with a mini\n\nWith Velocity Ultra, FuturLab have taken the original game and upped the level of the presentation to try and make it a standout game in its own right. What they have managed to create is the greatest vertically scrolling shooter from yesteryear that you haven’t yet played. But to merely categorise it as a shooter is doing it a disservice. At its heart there are so many different mechanics going on that it’s something with much more depth than that.\n\nEach of the fifty levels (plus Bonus stages), requires players to juggle with a number of different objectives. First of all, players must blast enemies and simply survive in classic shooter style. Secondly, there are pods spread around the level containing survivors which need to be rescued and last but not least each level is a deadly race to the finish as a clock continually counts down. As you progress the focus changes in each stage with, for example, a static comic book style screen popping up displaying a message to tell you if you can take your time or need to boost through until the end.\n\nIt is within the mix of these games mechanics that things become very interesting. Aside from the usual weapon power ups and bombs your ship can also teleport. The levels often descend into crazy scrolling mazes with dead ends, when this happens you need to teleport into a clear section of the level to continue. Holding the right trigger button also speeds up your craft as it moves up the level. This leads to many levels turning into more of a maze race than a shooter, especially when the time limits are set incredibly tightly.\n\nThis would be hectic enough but there are even more fiendish things afoot. At a certain point players gain the ability to drop teleport pods. Sometimes these are infinite and sometimes highly limited in use. This allows the player to teleport back to any one of the pods they have dropped and continue the level from there. The reason you need this is because at higher levels there are complex laser shield defence systems that need to be deactivated. This generally consist of anywhere between ten and thirty colour coded nodes that need to be destroyed in numerical order from lowest to highest. Hit one in the wrong order and the whole grid reactivates.\n\nThe nodes are of course spread out all over the levels requiring the playing to bounce back and forth around the map to hit them in the right order. There can also be numerous sets of nodes, all in different colours. Couple this with the continued threat of enemies, the time limit and the need to rescue survivors and everything gets incredibly, addictively hectic. Oh and of course hitting any of the laser shields results in instant destruction.\n\nAs well as this there are hidden areas spread around the levels that unlock trophies and further bonus missions. This, along with a tough medal grading system based on your performance means there is a staggering about of replay value in the game. Just in case that isn’t enough for you there is also a complete version of mine sweeper and a few takes on classic games such as thrust hidden away in the extras section.\n\nVelocity Ultra has made the transition from Sony’s handheld remarkably well. The visuals spring to life on HD displays and the music has never sounded better. Velocity Ultra is a must have game but there isn’t anything here that wasn’t in the other versions, so some may well think twice before buying it again. But put up against the wealth of talent available on the PC this still shines incredibly brightly.\n\nWe’ve said before that if this had been made on the eight or sixteen bit consoles it would be lauded as an all-time classic. This is still about as essential as you can get and shows an imagination, design level and craft that many of the industries big hitters could learn from. For PC gamers who haven’t experienced the game before it’s an absolute must buy.\n\n9/10","February 4, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try to write a mini review below to justify why I recommend it.\nFirst let's take a look at (in my humble opinion) the most important aspect of any game - the gameplay:\n\nIt's awesome! It's fun, it's fast, it's everything you'd expect it to be. It's easy to learn, hard to master and very, very satisfying. Once you understand how the mechanics work, you'll complete the missions relatively easy. But the enjoyment comes after that, when you try to get the best rating, achieve the highest score and collect all the collectibles. There are total of 50 missions or 'zones' for you to complete, so you won't be able to beat the game in one sit. Combined with the replay value of the missions, I'd say the game is pretty lenghty. A thing to note here - this in not your typical shoot'em up game! Sure, the SHMUP elements are present, but it plays more like a puzzle game. Another thing that should be mentioned - I found the default mouse/keyboard controls kind of strange. Forunately you can customize them for your liking. However, in my opinion the best way to play is with a gamepad - I'm using a XBOX360 controller and it's definitely better than the M/KB controls.\n\nNext - the graphics:\nThe graphics are 2D, with enough eye-candy to keep you entertained. The visuals are shiny and colorful, but don't expect something revolutionary you haven't seen before - it's the typical space setting we all know and love. The graphic settings are limited to changing your resolution and Anti-Aliasing, but seriously, who needs more in that kind of game?  The game has a very small impact on your system's resources, so even if your computer is older, you won't have any problems running and playing it.\n\nA few words about the music:\nThe soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. It consists of several electronic/techno tracks that fit with the gameplay perfectly. Even if you're not a techno music fan (like myself) you'll like it.  Each mission has it's own theme that pumps you up and makes want to play more and more.\n\nThe story:\nBefore each mission, there's a short comic that explains what you're doing in the current mission. And that's pretty much it. I ended up skipping these after the first two missions, simply because I didn't really care. Sure, they could have made up a more complex story, but honestly, if you're playing the game entirely for the story, you're doing it wrong.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums it up. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, I'd say go for it! You'll have fun and it will last you more than what you paid for it.\n\n\nTL;DR version:\nFun little game with nice visuals and good soundtrack, that will keep you entertained for a long time. Buy it!","September 25, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is about a blackhole coming to destroy a bunch of colonies and space stations and you as Lietenant Kai Tana (only realised the name halfway through the game...) are tasked with rescuing as many engineers, scientists and colonists along with taking out some alien invaders taking advantage of the situation. The story reminds me of Sanctum 2 as in it's there but almost pointless and acts as a base setup but here it looks like they really tried expanding this game's universe and it's somewhat interesting so A for effort!\n\nYou take pilot of the Quarp Jet which let's you teleport to hard to reach places. This shooter has some puzzles as well, mainly deactivating powerstations. It's interesting and works for the most part. You have your normal things like shooting aliens, upgrades and such. I like the cutscene images, they're very nice and detailed and the levels themselves are alright too. Music is okay, it sets the mood but you won't be tapping your toes to anything. The game contains a story mode with 50 missions, leaderboards and a flight computer which has various things to offer such as concept art unlocks, minigames, a calculator and... minesweeper? What?\n\nStill this game is very good, it won't rock your boat but that's fine. It's a nice little shooter game to have fun with occasionally. It has a couple of cool tricks too and uses them well enough. I'm not sure if the sequal is any good but now I gotta give it a try someday.
