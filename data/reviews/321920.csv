Right away it strikes you with its gloomy protagonist and – excuse the clichéd comparison – Limbo-like, drab, backdrop. With it comes the mirror image reflected in the murky swamp, that for the duration of this game, we are an inhabitant of. The game switches between different colors that all signify their own version of the swamp, we have the rugged, gray and old normative state, where our character has a bleak expression, signifying the hopeless situation we are in, losing our son and all. Then we are quickly introduced to the green light, which turned our character into a young man, perhaps a boy, golden hair and smiling, perhaps the former self of the main character. Then we have what according to the achievements is: despair and insanity, with the colors red and blue, respectively. I would imagine it should have been the other way around considering the expression of the “blue” characters face seem like that of one who is in despair, and the “red” with fiery brimstone and an angry expression seems more like that of an insane person. But I digress. This is the basis of Schein's gameplay, and if I may say so myself, it's great.\n\nThis game go from one minute being a slow-paced put-your-thinking-cap-on kind of game to a fast-paced rush through so-called “boats” requiring intense maneuvers that feel absolutely amazing to pull off, and as a bonus, don't make you frustrated when you fail, because it's so much fun to actually learn these patterns and perform elaborate patterns of jumps in accordance with color-switching. There is one level in particular that stands out in this fast-paced regard, with a somewhat fitting name, called “Speed of Life”. The way the level gradually integrated every aspect of your skill set to crescendo you into to some rather impressing stunts, really felt like amazing game-design, and was a lot of fun, to be honest. There were levels or puzzles that could have used some type of hint that you were doing the right thing, especially if you needed to bring a lantern or not. It was ambiguous and subsequently forced some backtracking, albeit minor and not really damaging to the overall experience. Boss fights appear in this game, which is interesting for a puzzle/platformer, and for the most part it paid off and worked within the games structure, as they were the means of which to gain more power. The last fight did become rather confusing as to when you were actually doing damage to this unnamed (to not spoil) thing, but ultimately felt as difficult as a “last boss” should be.\n\nVisual design is not particularly special in any way, but still enjoyable in a reminiscent sense, like the gloomy gray looking like Limbo; the hellish world and green forest-lushness reminding me a lot of Dust: An Elysian Trail, these games use similar textures and models for a lot of the levels, and kind of copy-paste it, but in the process make what's actually there look presentable. The changes, as touched on previously, that our character goes through in every color was a neat feature. In a way it connected to the story of the frustration of not finding his son along with this hellish rage-inducing red, or the coldness of realizing that he may not find his son with the blue, cold – to me distraught and acquiescent – expression. Design-wise things were thought out and seemed to have a purpose, and even though they weren't too awe-inspiring or interesting for any longer period of time, things felt worth looking at.\n\nSchein's story probably has something to offer, but it's delivered in a not so ideal way. The voice-actors sound either uninspired or far too whimsical, and the discrepancy between the two leads can at points be very distracting, at least for that moment, until the game hits you with another brain-hemorrhaging puzzle. In a way it seems mostly metaphorical, perhaps just thrown in to give the game some purpose, and sort of plays on how easily forgotten the story is in the context of the swamp and its hardships it throws at us. “Forgetting” and “moving forward” are keywords, along with perhaps “purpose” if you can be so bold to exchange the word “son” in every dialog with “purpose”, there are some interesting insights to gain from this story, but entirely speculative, but that's where all the fun is to be had, no?\n\nA cacophony of orchestral music littered with piano strings crescendoing into something larger was part of the in parts great musical aspect of Schein. The music stemmed from a scatterbrained person throwing epic orchestras in between slow piano pieces and acoustic guitars, silently plucking away. Was there a general tone, trying to match visuals with audio? Not to my knowledge, but the individual pieces were fine, the quality was high and when the loop was right it actually gelled well with what was happening on the screen. Scatterbrained, but well executed, well enough, I should say.\n\nIt's a clear recommendation to me, but mostly for the gameplay, if puzzle-games are your thing, this will be your thing as well. Schein is unique in how these color-systems interact with each other and can often be very satisfying, once you clear a level or an especially difficult puzzle. Although the aesthetics were not ideally pleasing to me, they were not without novelty and worthy of at least some appreciation. It's a good game, you'll enjoy it.","October 10, 2014","true","9.1"," 98 of 110 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","98","110","2","8"

If you visit the store page for Schein on Steam you'll see logo after logo of award nominations and wins Schein has picked up over the course of its development. And it deserves them too, it's a great game, yet for some reason no one seems to be talking about it. It should by rights be an 'indie darling', but so far it's a lost gem\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that it's easily dismissed as yet another indie puzzle-platformer, a Braid-like. With simple graphics, a so-so character model, and some less than great voice work. Spend some time with Schein though and you realise it's more than that, packed with smart, challenging puzzles, and some cool aesthetics.\n\nThe premise is fairly simple, the game opens with you in a swamp looking for your son, soon you bump in to a fairy-like creature, an orb of Light that knows more about the swamp than you, a little more than she's letting on, and can alter the world around her and you. The gameplay quirk of Schein is its use of Light to alter reality. An uncrossable gap in normal light might reveal a ledge to jump on in green light, an impassable barrier in green light might need you to flick to red light to make it disappear. It's a mechanic that starts simple but quickly becomes hugely challenging.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is because you don't always get the time to think and plan out how to solve the puzzle. If you're trying to negotiate your way across a huge gap then working out which light you need to switch to has to be done on the fly, you can't always lay down the groundwork. Similarly the platforming can require a large amount of dexterity and skill. To reuse an example from earlier, if you're using the green light to reveal platforms to cross a gap, but there's a barrier in the way that can only be removed using the red light then the process is; have the green light on, jump, switch to the red light, switch the the green light, land the jump. There's a real mind-bending, rapid-fire aspect to the platforming\n\nThe shifts of light also improve the game graphically. The simple, bland design of the swamp and main character become far more interesting when the light mechanics are introduced. The green light brings colour to the swamp, your character all smiles and joy, it's sinister. It's a great idea, maybe one that isn't quite explored enough, but it does work to short-hand that everything is not quite what it seems in the swamp\n\nSchein does have problems; the main character is played too flat, he’s supposed to be depressed but whether it's a production issue or a performance issue, something about it just doesn't land. Similarly, and fairly trivially in the great scheme of things, the spirit's English accent is offputting, probably only an issue for English players, but it noticeably isn't an English accent, even if it's recognisably supposed to be one. I was also a little disappointed by the story, a nice premise, a decent off-kilter world, that resolved in to not a lot really, I liked the almost fairytale aspect to it, but it still felt like it's core was missing.\n\nA larger issue comes from the platforming, it's mostly fine but there's moments when encountering spikes where their damage area is larger than the pixels they're made up of. More infuriating, particularly later on, is a series of reworked platform-puzzles involving ledges and lanterns. The aim is to get from one side of the gap to the other, carrying over one coloured lantern at a time, stopping and leaving the lantern in a safe spot to head back and grab a different colour lantern, then leapfrogging the safe lantern before going back for that. It's not entirely different from the riddle about carrying some seed, a chicken, and a fox over a river. The problem is that if you're carrying a green lantern and land on a red platform with a red lantern on it, while in theory that should be fine, too often the green will overlap the red and you'll fall to your death. I'm fine with the game being difficult, but these moments where you feel cheated are blemishes on the game.\n\nThe difficulty is worth noting too, I found it pitched just about right, impressively so in fact. At the points where I was stuck I'd come back the next day and solve it. However, I was playing for review, I HAD to make progress, and when I did I found Schein hugely rewarding, but it's not inconceivable that had I just picked the game up on Steam I might have put the game down for the night and never picked it up again.\n\nDon't let that put you off too much though, Schein is a fantastic game, it has a few flaws no doubt, I can't say that any of the boss battles were a high point, but it really is a gem of a game. Difficult but rewarding, it even manages to switch around those first impressions from looking like a cheap patchwork game, to being an impressive, extraordinarily well pieced together game","October 19, 2014","true","15.2"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

Fortunately, it's the best one of those that I've played, and a pretty good, if very challenging, platformer.\n\nYour character awakens in an appropriately dismal swamp, seeking his son. He soon finds a chatty little wisp that casts a magic light that can make special platforms and obstacles appear. Like Closure and other games that came before it, Schein is built around using light sources to clear the path ahead. In addition to revealing platforms, the light can power certain devices and reveal hazards, as well. As if that wasn't enough, you'll find additional kinds of light further in, multiplying the complexity.\n\nAnd boy howdy, is there complexity. Schein throws both puzzling and precision platforming at you, and does not hold back on either. There are twelve levels to traverse, and as early as the second or third you might run into puzzles that trip you up. They're a good kind of challenging, the sort that look impossible until you get your head in the right place, like the ones in Braid or P.B. Winterbottom. They only get harder, too, which makes Schein a good game to fill the gaps between other, less trying titles.\n\nYou'll need breaks from the platforming, because some of the timing and light-switching can get absolutely brutal. Never unfairly so, and there are generous checkpoints and instant respawns, but it goes far more difficult than the look of the game would suggest. It is a very pretty title, with the different light sources changing the look of the world in salient ways, and some lovely sound effects and minimal music to support. As long as you don't let frustration get to you, Schein will keep you engaged and busy for quite some time.","November 8, 2015","true","2.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I liked the fact that some of the puzzles are thinking based while others are reflex based. The game does not completely bogs itself down with a single type of puzzle over and over again; it alternates between these two types of puzzles to keep you interested to the game. You never feel any unnecessary repetion in the game. It has quite a good of an atmosphere. The graphics and music is nothing like Bastion, Braid but it is decent enough and fits very well with the atmosphere.\n\nThere is also the underlying story which unravels as the game progresses. When everything is finished it just felt a bit underwhelming to me. For such an interesting and compelling atmosphere, I would have preferred at least multiple endings.

But, the platforming made me knock the rating down a little bit. It was all about timing with the platforming section. Not a bad thing per se, but couple that with the fact that the later sections were impossible because you needed to know what was coming before it was even there, makes this a very frustrating experience.

In general the idea is that you manipulate light around you to reveal and mix different worlds so you can overcome obstacles. The concept works great and allows for some difficult brain twisters. The puzzles are challanging but also rewarding once you get past them.\n\nGraphics are decent, nothing impressive to me, in fact if anything I would say the game feels bit unpolished there but given its an indie game I'm not taking that as a con. It didn't bother me. Couple of things that did bother me though:\n- Unless you shed the appropriate light color you won't know whats there. This may not seem like a problem at first, but there will be many sequences where you have to navigate tight spaces switching lights and you will die many times because you switched the light too soon or too late and there is no way for you to know until you try (and die). Game that does this much better as an example is Fly'n where you have shadows of the other world.\n- The game tries to do a decent job at introducing you to different things you can do, but doesn't hold your hand. This means if you are particularly resourceful you may overcome some obstacles in a non intended way and never learn what new mechanics you were supposed to pick up until you get stuck much later, because you never learned it. Other things you never tried or had to try until you are stuck 30min on the same puzzle and discover "Hey! This is possible?! That would have saved me hours had I just known!"\n\nThe story is non fairly shallow, not going to say more about it.

(I hate blind jumps -.-)\n\ntldr;\n\npro:\n- the visuals are very nice and detailed\n- the idea with the light orb that lets you see another world is great\n\nneutral:\n- the voice acting is not my taste\n- the music isn't remarkable in any way\n\ncon:\n- the controlls are somewhat.. "clumsy"\n- the gameplay has no flow\n- the dificult isn`t hard but often just unfair\n\nDon't pay more than 2€ for this game. So buy it in a sale if you whish to...\nBut if you really want to enjoy a platformer or a jump n run, there are many others, which will bring you way more fun. ;)","June 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Lots of blind jumps, you can't see the obstacles from the "other world" until it's right in your face. Blind jumps are a thing that stopped existing after the 16 bit era because game designers realized it was bad level design, but this game has tons of blind jumps. The fact that I can only see things from the other world in this small orb around the player makes the rest of the screen completely useless. There are vines with thorns that instantly kill me, and can only be seen with that orb on. So I have to turn off the orb to get past them, but there's no indication as to when I'm past them since I can't see them. Overall it just has lots of really bad level design from the get go and it was too frustrating for me to continue. I'm fine with difficult games when they make me feel like it's my fault when I lose. This game, the majority of the time I lose, I feel like it's due to lack of information that the game is supposed to give to me.","March 22, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

Also the character is very good and you are very fast in the right mood for a good game with an interesting story.\n\nBUT!!!\n\nThis game is just frustating... It is not possible to beat this game without a few hundred, or maybe thousand times dying. I beat the game to 50% and my deathcounter score is 452. There is no chance to make most of the the jumping passages in one run, without falling and dying. You have to die many times in one jumping passage, even to know, what you have to do next. This is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and there are other ways to make a game interesting or difficult. This game is not very difficult, it is just unfair. And it lags many times, so that it is impossible to time your jumps or lights changes right. And then... of course - you die. This is what this game is all about. Just to frustate you with unfair and impossible to make it in one run, jumping passages. Maybe this game could be good, but the producers just had no idea how to make a game difficult without being this ♥♥♥♥ like "Schein".\nSo don't buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥.\nI don't know how this game could get any award. Maybe no other game was nominated.\nReally!!! Hands off. This game is one of the badest games I've ever played.
