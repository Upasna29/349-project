Picking up the "chair" results in a strange feeling of it hanging by a string. All larger objects behave that way as I remember. Your hands in game float about 4 inches above where your real world hands are.\n\nThe scripting is awkward and transparent. I decided not to take the pills in ep.1 and everything begins all over again without context.\n\nThe point being that in order to be scared, you have to be drawn into the place, and all of these things constantly serve as distractions that break the immersion. It's like trying to watch a scary movie with the boom mic and set crew ending up in the camera view.\n\nAside from that, I only made it to the second chapter and quit of frustration, while not being at all scary to me.\nI can't say whether it would be worth $25, because lost interest before completing it.","April 2","false","0.8"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","45","55","0","0"

Sure there are a few jump scares, but that's not what the game relies on. What it DOES rely on (and what it does so well) is giving the player a prolonged sense of fear. You'll spend the majority of this game looking over your shoulder, feeling like you're being watched as you explore your surroundings, piecing together the missing fragments of your memories.\n\nDownsides: The item manipulation can be a little finicky occasionally hen it comes to complex tasks (I had trouble with the crowbar) but it didn't draw me out of the experience. At other times it can be absolutely spot on (eg. I was hit by a jump scare and instinctively reached offscreen for my lamp, grabbed it first time and swung it around to see what spooked me. Didn't even realise until I was watching my recording later on)\n\nUpsides: Everything else.","April 24","true","1.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You will actually feel like you're in a cramped, dark room with no way to escape. I feel like this is the current benchmark for VR horror games.\n\nMany people (perhaps rightly) complain that most of today's VR games are too short and unfinished to be worth their price tags, but A Chair In A Room isn't one of them. It's short--it took roughly three hours for me to get through it, but it feels complete. In fact, if it were any longer, it would have started to feel as if were dragging on.\n\nIt's not perfect, though. The most noticeable problem is with object manipulation. Sometimes you'll spend a couple of minutes just trying to pick up an object. The physics can get weird at times, and collision detection seems to be a bit buggy. The narrative feels a bit strained as well. Honestly, I still don't get it.\n\nBut even with these issues, it's still worth picking up.","May 5","true","9.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I involuntarily cried out several times, tried to back away in horror at least twice, mumbled to myself incoherently while trying to figure out the mystery, and generally felt like I did when I was a too-young boy of 13 who snunk into the theater to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street... it was an incredible experience!\n\nThe story is engaging, the environments are beautiful, the suspense and fear feels genuine, with only a few of the cheap (but well-placed and effective) "jump out of the shadows" type startling moments.  In short, I loved this game.  I'd never heard of Wolf & Wood before this, but I'm already looking forward to whatever they offer next!\n\nAs others have mentioned, the controls can be a bit frustrating, and I did have to reload a couple of levels when key items fell through the map or magically shot off into space, but these are minor issues - distractions, really - and should not dissuade you from purchasing this otherwise amazing game.\n\nThis is VR.

I'm a big horror fan and I knew with VR, these kinds of games would be great for it if done right. Well, I'm happy to say that this is one of the best out there so far for the Vive!\n\nPros - Great atmosphere and music. This is something a horror/suspense game needs and this one pulls it off! As for the scares, from what I played so far it does the job. I've been playing horror games for years now and never got scared or felt uneasy. This game made me jump and creeped me out. Great job! For the hell of it, I wanted to see how good of a job it does to make you feel like you're there in the world. I was very impressed with even the little things. When I was on a boat, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, rocking back and forth. The boat actually moved like it would in real life. Bravo for the small details!\n\nCons - So far the only thing I can complain about is the object interaction. Holding items feels weird unless you go out of your way to manipulate them until they fit in your hand how they are supposed to be. Then you have items that fall into walls or floors. If that happens with a key item, you have to restart the chapter. The other thing is room scale. It tells you that you have to have a certain amount of space, which I'm sure is true. It warned me my room wasn't big enough, but I continued anyways since it was just slightly off from the recommened space. It still worked well!\n\nWith the small cons this game has, you must play this! This is the right direction for VR horror and I hope to see more from this developer and others.","May 27","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let down by janky physics/interface and unsatisfying puzzles.  Still one of the best room scale horror games and worth the asking price.\n\n---\n\nLooks and sounds great, with some great creepy visuals and audio. Story doesn't pull any punches and there's a good element of psychological horror rather than just relying on jump scares, although there's some of those to enjoy too.\nUse of space in room scale is one of the best I've seen too. Rather than rely on a teleport mechanic, you move one room at a time. Between each section you're asked to position yourself so that there's always space to move. I think this works really well, and adds to the immersion as you always feel like your doing the moving around yourself, rather than by some  teleport magic.\n\nThe puzzle design is passable, if you can call them puzzles. None of them really require thought more than just banging together random objects. I found at least one of them to be annoyingly non sequitur.  It's a shame that there was nothing there that I really had to engage my brain for.\n\nMy biggest criticism is with the interface and physics. It really lets down the whole experience. Picking things up, which is arguable the most common thing you do, is awkward as hell. Even if you do manage to get a grip things can annoying just drop out of your hand for seemingly no reason. On more than one occasion the thing that was dropped dissapeared forever causing me to have to replay sections of the game to continue. This was excacerbated by the lack of any inventory system which meant the only way to carry the required items between rooms was in your hands. In general the physics feel seriously janky and really reduced the immersion for me. On the plus side, the physics on the underwater sections were really nice to play with.\n\nOn the whole, despite the problem with the physics, I very much enjoyed the game and can recommend it. I'd say in its current state it's only just worth the asking price, but it is worth buying.","May 25","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before buying, I assumed this was (a) a series of small-room puzzle escapes, or (b) minimalist cubicle adventuring (maybe a single morphing room). I was wrong! This is a full, innovative 1st-person narrative horror adventure. There are some single-room sequences, but the room-scale VR is more often used to organically navigate multi-room locations like a hotel, or to mimic the small interior of a vessel as it travels. This is not another hobbled/abridged VR demo, but it might be the victim of a minimalist title and marketing language that suggest the opposite (e.g. navigating "your memories" instead of "multiple locations").","May 21","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sorry for shouting, but get this game now, i mean NOW! You will thank me later. Don't worry about the high price tag, to be honest even i was skeptical because of how expensive it is for a short time.

I felt that i was actually in a movie.\n\nI am yet to complete it, i think i have 1 or 2 chapters left but i would buy the game again instantly without thinking.\n\nBy far one chapter stands head and shoulders above all the others and that is the one in the motel. Obviously, no spoilers but there are too many amazing scenes in this chapter.\n\nThe game does have a few glaring issues however, mainly the problem of items collision detection being a bit weird, especially when they interact with other items in the same world. Its a bit glitchy. Especially paper and news articles, they tend to get stuck onto each other and make it hard to pull away.\n\nHowever, don't let that issue detour you away from the game, it is an amazing experience, and i am afraid to finish it so quickly as i want to play it for much longer :D\n\nDevs, please add more chapters to the game or release a sequel ASAP!\n\nThanks.\n\nRating: 9/10","May 20","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best horror experience I've had. It creates a super creepy and suspenseful atmosphere while only have a few well placed jumpscares in the entire game.  I only have a 2.4m x 1.9m play area, but was still able to complete the game thanks to being able to reach over my desk and dressers. Ocassionally I had an object on the floor just out of reach and I had to use some clever problem solving to use other object to get it within my reach. If you're just under the space requirements consider supporting a great game and give it a go. Just don't blame the game if you can't complete it because of space requirements.\n\nPositives aside, there are some wonky things in the game as well. The physics are kinda bad in the game.

I'd like to see some of the content worked on though. The school locker lock was frustraitingly difficult to spin and see, when the solution would be to "zoom" in on the lock when picked up. Infact, most of the text could use a little 1.5 zoom when looked at. I know it may hurt immersion, but we flat out skipped some text because it was just too annoying to stick the controller against our faces. Otherwise! The story and atmosphere was great.

VR horror adds a level of debth thats impossible to achieve in any other medium ive experienced. If you are into horror games and you have a vive, do yourself a favor and pick this up.\n\nPros:\nAmazing atmosphere. Its actually scary.\nI dont think ive ever played a game that has made me so scared. Not because what happend was the most frightening ive ever seen, but because it definitely ranked in the top 10 scariest things I've ever physically experienced. Having you be the player, walking around, exploring leaves you so immersed, at times i forgot i was playing a game. I never thought to tear the headset off my face because I was standing there confronting these things and I knew it was hopeless and there was nothing i could do but let my fate unfold.\n\nGreat little touches that really immerse you in the game.\nThe post cards have smudge marks on them from being handled with someone with oily skin. Its only noticable if you hold a card under a light and angle it a particular way. Who thinks of that?! Also, there is a moment where a bright light is shined in your face. I instinctavely held my hand up to the light to shade my eyes and it worked. Little moments like that pulled me in completely and I totally lost myself in the game. The developer did an amazing job making you feel a particular using sights and sounds. I dont think ive ever been so present in a VR experience before.\n\nCons:\nHolding objects is a pain.\nObjects you can interact with come in two flavors, ones that you hold steady in your hand in the position you grabbed them in, and objects that kinda swing freely in your hand. I would say 95% of the objects in this game should have been the steady kind. Unfortunately, its only about half that you hold steady. This makes moving large objects very difficult, even if you use two hands. Two handed holding feels like you are grabbing two strings attached to the object and its free to spin and sway however it pleases. But even the static object holding was not optimal. If you pick something up off the floor, and try to look at it, you have to hold your controller awkwardly. Objects are held in the exact position you pick them up in. This works, but i think it would be greatly improved if they snapped to a default position in relation to the controllers orientation. That way you wouldnt need to keep picking things up and putting them down until you hold them in the optimal position for use.\n\nThere is some replay value, but not much.\nThis isnt really a con though and just kind of the nature of this expreience. I went back and replayed some portions of the game and the atmosphere stays, but if you know the solutions to puzzles and when some frightening scenes are, you can mostly get through the game unaffraid. That being said though, there were still some times when id forget something was about to happen and jump out of my skin =]","May 17","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

We were all alternating between chapters.  Girlfriend gave up half way through. It was too intense for her.  My roommate couldn't handle the last couple levels so I was left to handle it myself. My stomach hurts. I'm exhausted and I'm probably going to sleep like crap tonight. And in my own weird masochistic way I loved every moment of it.  The description and pictures of this game hardly do it justice.  If you have a Vive and the required play space, this IS A MUST PLAY.  This game is affecting on so many levels. My girlfriend literally induced herself into a panic attack in a section that wasn't even particularly frightening.  It's great psychological horror where the promise of what miight be hidden in the dark is actually the most terrifying aspect.  Its not perfect.  The hit detection can be wonky.  You spend much more time than needed simply manipulating objects.  But at the end, this was truly an experience and once of the most satisfying game purchases I've had in a long time.  If you're a horror and tech afficionado, there is no better combination out there.   I will definitely be looking at games from this developer in the future.

I didn't find it to be too scary, but I'm not easily scared. There were a couple moments that made me jump, and many more that I found rather creepy/spooky. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of presence. There is no teleportation mechanic and you need to actually walk to get to the different areas in the rooms. That being said you do need a larger play area (2.5 by 2.5m) however I was able to manage with a play area 2.1 by 2.4m but I also have a buffer zone that lets me go outside of my bounderies a good bit. Between rooms there is a type blank space that lets you reorient yourself for the next room. I found this to work very well and not break my imersion in any way. The game does a very good job at creating a tense atmosphere. It creates a sense of worry or panic in the player without needing the use of jump scares like other horror games. The story is pieced together very well through memories and flashbacks that keep you from understanding the whole thing until the end.\n\nThat being said, the physics in this game could definitely use some improvement. Items you pick up in the game often clip into things causing them to fall. In one instance I lost a flashlight which I needed because it bumped into a closet door while I was bending down to pick up another item causing me to have to restart the level. The items clip through each other at times causing things to occasionally spaz out. The hitboxes of these items are also a little off. I occasionally would grab the wrong item because something was sitting next to what I wanted to pick up. I found myself frustrated at a couple spots where I knew what I was supposed to do, but was unable to because of the physics. I always eventually got it to work and never quite got the point of rage quitting but I did get fairly close once or twice. Even though the physics can be frustrating, its by no means game breaking.\n\nPros\n- Great use of room scale\n- No need to teleport around (teleporting used in other vr games for movement is something I personally think needs to be improved on, I find it to be slightly game breaking)\n- No cheap horror scares, genuine sense of hopelessness and fear\n- Good story\n\nCons\n- Object physics\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. A majority of VR experiences are demos at the moment and this feels like a full game. It's a short game. It took me only around 3 hours to beat it but I'm sure it can be done much faster, even on a first run through. I spent a lot of time reading the signs and pamphlets in the game and I also didn't progress further until I was sure I saw everything there was to see in an area. Also I had to play two levels over because of physics issues. Realistically I would look to get about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of playtime out of it. I don't really see much replayablility out of it once you beat it once, but it would be good to demo to others who wanted to play a horror game.","June 2","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/froolie/recommended/427760/","froolie","Vroolie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/froolie/","247 products in account","This review is written on the basis of someone who rarely plays horror games and takes a general disinterest. I know from brief experience that horror games tend to have strong stories or emotional drive and I wanted to see the potential of this type of game going in with a completely fresh perspective. I felt that this title deserves a good word to try and interest as many people as possible.\n\nI think it's important to start with the outweighed negatives. This game has physics issues with interactible objects which can be disorientating at times. I also needed to use the locomotion system (beta build currently) to progress due to my smaller than required play area. In spite of these two "immersion breaking" factors, I felt completely involved in the surroundings and universe the developers created. A third factor would be the clue system, there have been two instances I have been frustrated enough with the time it has taken to solve a puzzle that I have felt it necessary to quit out of the game to find the answer. A secondary stronger clue system might be a solution, or just a tweak of the existing ones. I had issues in one scene in the first room and a second scene in the bathroom of the motel. Reading other reviews points out I am not the only person to have this experience, which is a shame. A linked downside to this is that I have had to replay sections up until the puzzle to get back to my progress. Some form of quick autosave would be appreciated for convenience.\n\nRoomscale horror is fantastic. VR allows for some truly unforgettable set pieces. The sound design is superb to go hand in hand with this. The soundtrack is great and it really fits with the environment. To be honest, I do notice bad textures and "jaggies" in games (including this), but this seriously makes you look around them out of pure fear and respect for the terrifying atmosphere. There was also some texture pop-in in the onrails sections, but this may be due to my GTX 970 being on the lower end of the performance scale. You quickly get over the videogame aspect and put your mind into the shoes of your character. I would put this title alongside other high presence games, namely The Gallery and Waltz of the Wizard. If I was more sadistic, I would actually demo this game to other people that didn't directly ask just for the sheer immersion factor. It's that good!\n\nWolf and Wood deserve huge credit for what I consider to be the most substantial and fulfilling title I've played so far on the Vive. The Gallery was magical, but this is brutal and unforgiving and will have a longer overall playtime for the money. At 3 hours in, I am still progressing through the game (chapter 4 for people that have completed it). I believe (and sincerely hope) I am about half way though based on the Polaroids on the start room door.\n\nI wanted to write this review when my initial impressions were still fresh. In spite of this, I would still recommend the game on the basis of value for money and strength of the experience. "A Chair in a Room : Greenwater" sets the bar high for future titles in my opinion. I have enjoyed the game enough to put it in my current "must own" list of games. If you do not typically enjoy horror games or are unsure you will enjoy this, I would suggest waiting for a sale as I do not recommend missing out.\n\nI cannot wait to see what else the developers have in store and I sincerely hope they continue in this avenue of development.","June 3","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a tremendous sense of place, and presence is stronger in some scenes than any other game I've yet to play.  It is also regularly TERRIFYING, but without ever resorting to jump scares (some things suddenly appear behind you though).\n\nAll that said, it suffers from common early-VR problems (janky object physics) and common adventure game problems (hitting a dead end and feeling the need to guess what to do next).\n\nIf you like adventure games, horror, or enjoy checking out the best that early VR has to offer, do not pass this one up!
