Basic graphics and the sound seems a little flaky, but I like these casual time wasters that test your mind rather than your reactions.\nUse your word prowess to battle thrugh levels, utilise power ups, sound familiar?\nBookworm did it better, the price is a little too high, sound a little dodgy and basic graphics. Should really be a thumbs down .... However I like it, it has its charm and so ...\nThumbs up .... Just.\nWe really need a wavy thumb.","May 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

This is a fairly decent game, easy to learn but with some interesting strategy.  I'd definitely call it more of a strategy game than a game that tests one's word knowledge.  It reminds me most of Puzzle Quest, since nearly all of the gameplay consists of fighting battles using a standard casual-game mechanic, but this game is simpler.\n\nIt's a small thing, but after the first level, you can choose to play a male or female avatar, an option I always appreciate.  You're on a quest of some kind, I don't know.  The art style doesn't stand out, either.\n\nYou battle against a series of AI enemies, and you place words alternately on a game board.  You're trying to get your opponent to do things that will benefit you.  Upwords and Wordox are the word games which this one most resembles, but again, this game is far simpler.\n\nThe enemy AI really needs improving.  It's easy to dominate most of the enemies just by making more than one word at once (e.g., CAT is on the board, you play DOGS, making CATS).   You can also rack up a lot of energy (spell points) and skulls (which harm your enemy) just by stacking two-letter words.  I don't know what dictionary this game is using; it isn't one I've seen used in word games before.  But there's no penalty for guessing, so it doesn't really matter.  Mostly, the game is a little bit too easy for a word game junkie.\n\nI just started the "second round" thing where you can go back and replay old levels with challenges.  This mode seems like it's going to be fun.  The first challenge is that you lose health for making less than three letter words.  There's another set of challenges, too, but I haven't gotten that far yet.\n\nThere is also a board that you can buy tiles for and try to get as high of a score as you can, which gives your character more health and spell points.  I really like this version of leveling up a character.  It definitely makes me want to get the best possible score.  It's very much like gearing up in an RPG.  There are spells and potions, also, but I haven't needed to use them much.\n\nI would really like to see achievements added, as well as multiplayer.  I could see this as a fun, fast multiplayer game.  But overall, the price is low, and the mechanics are different enough from other word games I've played to keep my interest.","May 5","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
