It tells the story in the most ridiculous, Japanese way possible - the authors present a quintessentially American story that is haphazardly cobbled together from second-hand cultural hand-me-downs and packaged inside a completionist's nightmare. Despite this, it manages to come off as endearing - like a young boy dressing up as his father for a game of pretend. It is charmingly off-beat, well acted and well written.\n\nBe mindful of the fact, however, that this game is terribly short, ends on a cliffhanger and there are no solid plans for a continuation as of now - if you just go for story progression without delving into the side stuff, it's maybe four hours at most.

Find objects and interact with them. The question that remains is if it is always meaningful, e.g. you can click on a flower, squirrels, newspapers, the cat, and furniture, almost anything and are also able to interact with it. Which is kind of fun. But....you lose stamina. For every action you take, you lose some, which has to be refreshed by eating something. You also possess a detective 6th sense, which when activated, trigger a vision of meaningful items in the vicinity. But this also uses up the "vision" bar. If you need more vision you need to drink a coffee, tequila or something. Very neat.\nI recommend you play the game with a gamepad, rather than with the keyboard. Because there are times where there are some seriously difficult and time controlled quick time events, where playing with a keyboard will fail you.\n\nGraphics & Sound 7.5 of 10\n\nThe graphics are comic-style and have a very unique and distinct style. You can interact with various objects and the surrounding is very detailed.  I would rate it a solid 7.5.\nThe sound is very sparsely and only sometimes there are complete musical score played. It’s okayish. Was not that impressive, yet did not disappoint at all.\n\nStory   8.5 of 10\n\nThe story is where this game really shines. Starting out just as another "traditional" detective game, where you, David Young, are looking for the killer of you wife "Little" Peggy. But the more you play you realize there is something wrong with the story. Because some facts are not adding up. Why can David travel through time and space? What's the meaning of the house cat and why can only David see a mysterious gigantic doctor. I won't spoil anything, but it's one of a kind story and something really unique in pc games.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nI can truly recommend this game for all gamers of detective games and if you liked Twin Peaks as well you will like this one for sure.\n","January 26","true","8.1"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","64","70","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/358090/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\n\nA note before I begin: after I played D4 for review I had a few friends over to take it for a spin. One sat in rapt attention, absolutely needing to know how this weird story plays out. One spent most of it drinking and facepalming. These are the two most common reactions to SWERY.\n\n\nMemory is a curious thing, isn't it? Curiouser still how we “store” them... sometimes memories stay fresh, instantly recallable despite having occurred in the forever rose-tinted, nebulous past. Memories can be locked away, buried just beneath the surface until you find the right “key;” a weathered photograph, the smell of an old coat, or the splash of rain on your face in the right place at the right time. Sometimes memories are forever locked away, and you'll always find yourself chasing that key.\n\n\nDid you know that every time you recall a memory you're just remembering your last memory OF the memory? And like all things it fades and melds and changes until it's unrecognizable?\n\n\nDo you know about string theory? Quantum gravity? Me neither. But I know many lemur species are matriarchal.\n\nANYHOO.\n\nD4 was cultivated and harvested from the wacky mind-fields of SWERY, the same gentleman who brought us that wonderfully weird love letter to Twin Peaks - Deadly Premonitions.\n\nAnd boy was the harvest bountiful.\n\nYou play the part of one David Young: Bostonian, tequila enthusiast, semi-successful husband and police officer in the narcotics unit. And like all good video game heroes his wife was murdered (semi-successful!), the trauma leaving him amnesic but with a peculiar gift – the ability to traverse (seemingly) time and space using mementos with incredibly strong ties to specific events. His mission in life now is to solve his wife's murder, prompted by her final words: “Look for D.”\n\nA little forward for my tastes but fine, I'll bite.\n\n\nConfused? That's okay! That's normal. I don't think anyone completely understands these surreal romps except SWERY... possibly. And if anyone says otherwise they are God damned liars. But despite that you'll find yourself riveted. The characters are rich, HILAROUS (intentionally and unintentionally), animated, and strange. The story, as weird as it is, leaves you glued to the edge of your seat. I think I can safely say that this might be one of the most engaging “point n' click” adventure games available on the market – you can touch everything for points and descriptions, read articles, slap around humans, owls, cats... it's nuts. And the QTE's are some of the most engaging I've ever encountered in a game of this type.\n\nAesthetically D4 is leagues better than Deadly Premonitions. The music, the voice acting, the charming, cartoony cell-shade art, the ever present creative hand of SWERY, all comes together to make something truly special, perhaps the most memorable and entertaining “TellTale” style title this year so far. There's a health system (can't take too much damage during fights/interactions) and a stamina system (every action costs stamina – grab or purchase food and drinks to avoid passing out). There's even a synchronization system that takes into account actions and dialogue that determines if you're really behaving as David Young would during scenarios. All the while you'll gather credit you can use to purchase outfits, hairstyles, and more (I made my David look like a pirate because I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing adult).\n\nHowever, there are things to consider before parting with your hard-earned cashola. This is SEASON ONE, two episodes and one prologue, maybe three to five hours of gameplay for the average gamer. And SEASON TWO is dependent on how this game is received, so buyer beware (it also ends on a major cliffhanger). The QTE's I mentioned are weirdly difficult! Maybe it's because they're clever little combinations I've never seen, but you'll be hard-pressed to get a perfect score. Likewise, the synchronization conversations assume you're living inside David (and SWERY's) brain. Sometimes you'll choose a dialogue branch (lacking context, inflection) thinking David would say it and you'd be dead wrong, resulting in a lower synch score. And I think it goes without saying... but I'll say it: this game is not remotely for everyone. If you're a fan of Deadly Premonitions this is absolutely a must buy. If that wasn't your cup of tea you aren't likely to enjoy this. It's a western looking game with very Japanese sensibilities – keep that in mind.\n\n\nAnd I would be remiss not to mention a certain character's terrible, awful, abysmal voice acting delivery. You'll meet him in Episode 1 (the cinematography of that scene is BRILLIANTLY TERRIFYING).\n\n\nAND.\nHE.\nWILL.\nE-NUN-CI-ATE.\nEVE-RY.\nSYL-LAB-LE.\n\n\nI get it, I do. He's supposed to be like the G-Man from-Half Life in that way I guess. But unlike the G-Man his dialogue may represent a quarter of my initial playthrough. Just a minor gripe. And time theft.\n\n\nOverall I think this if you're a fan of SWERY, of point n' click adventure types, and of weird narratives you should take the leap, entertain your friends with it for a “movie night.” It's going to leave a mark on you, that's for sure.\n\n\nThis reviewer is not responsible for stigmata-like occurrences as a result of playing D4.","June 5, 2015","true","6.6"," 145 of 201 people (72%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","72","145","201","29","0"

There is so much about it that is just straight up hilarious and I love that. The characters are quirky, the action scenes are amusing,and it has the foundation of an amazing story. I love these types of games where you find clues and collectibles be exploring and you can do random silly things to people and things in your environment.\n\nFor me all of those things would make the experience worth $15 that I spent, but I find myself constantly torn on that fact.\n\nMy reason I'm so torn is due to the fact that Season One offers no resolution to ANY questions. Personally, season one feels like that intro to a great game and just as it's about to pick up steam and get to the good stuff BAM it's over. It truly stops right before an action scene, leaving you confused as to why there is no episode 3.\n\nSeason one just feels like a 5hr or less demo ♥♥♥♥ tease for a spectacular game. I would still find the game worth my $15 if I knew there would be more, if I could expect a continuation and explanation for at least SOME of the questions I have. At this moment, however, there is no solid news on if or when D4 will continue.\n\nFor that fact alone I want to implore everyone who is interested to support it and speak out on your desire to see more. I admit they went about having an episodic series pretty badly. They should have taken a page out of TTG's book on how they do their seasons. For a game season you want to present the story, present questions, but you also really want to resolve SOME and have what feels like a season conclusion. If you are unsure if you will get a continuation in the future, you'd damn sure want to make it so your customers don't get a lack of a finale for a season. You want people to feel satisfied, but also eager to come back. The current 'ending' to this season may do more harm than good to the series as a whole. As an example, I was so close to just telling people to avoid it til news of a continuation arises, but that very well might spell the series' doom.\n\nAll in all, be aware of what you're getting into BUT the experience of playing this, the characters, and the story that's being built is all very much worth $15.","July 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","43","48","3","0"

No, you're not dreaming. Thanks to Hidetaka Suehiro aka SWERY65, we've finally got the chance to try the former Xbox One exclusive.\n\nDavid Young is a private eye from Boston, a man with a tragic past that he's trying to repair. You see, David can go back through time and place thanks to the objects called mementos, everyday items that somehow stored memories of important events. On his journey, two friends help him along the way - Amanda, a mysterious girl that's silent and acts like a cat and Forrest, his former boss from BPD.\n\nThe game and its character will get more surreal the further you go down this rabbit hole. Paranoid airplane passengers, avant-garde fashion designers, tall men that talk in slow, thunderous voice that rattle cutlery in a ritualistic manner... The atmosphere easily flows between drama, comedy and thriller (even horror!), drawing you deeper into this bizarre world. Do not expect everything handed on the plate though, the gameworld just exists and invites you to explore it and read about it in scattered newspaper clippings.\n\nGameplay-wise, D4 is a mix of Heavy Rain and newer Telltale game, with a dash of Myst's nod-based movement. You'll only need to use the mouse throughout the whole game. Be prepared for QTE's, though, as they're the bread&butter of D4. Whether it's opening the door or punching a cocky Latino drug dealer in the nose, you'll be clicking, dragging and slamming your mouse along the way and it's actually fun. The whole "gamification" of the experience is rounded by points system and mini-chores in maintaining your three stat bars.\n\nIt ends on a cliffhanger, though, a big one. Just as the second episode comes to its epic conclusion, everything stops and you're greeted with "to be continued" screen. Mind you, up until that point (which is after 4 or 5 hours of gameplay) you'll be having a blast and be genuinely invested in this game's insane world and story. It will get a sequel one day, it has to. D4 is just too uniquely weird to not leave a legacy.","July 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/358090/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","I got to play this on Steam-PC this past week. I would say, it's a nice game. Interesting and quirky. Slightly offbeat. Strange. I enjoyed playing it, that much is certain.\n\nHowever, my single biggest issue is that this is misleadingly being marketed as an episodic game, and what we have here is being called "Season 1". It's patently false, on both counts. I should know, cause I've pretty much played all the recent episodic games (KRZ, Telltale's stuff, Life is Strange).\n\nFirst off, there is a Prologue, "EP1" and "EP2". Between each of them, you can't say there's any kind of "closure". Episodic games tend to have closures (however small) between episodes. It plays and feels like one continuous game throughout (except for the fact when each new episode begins, you're shown the tutorial icons again).\n\nThen, the most damning part is that the game just ♥♥♥♥ing **ends**. Just like that! It's ultimately the biggest climax moment. The cliffhanger. And the game just...ends. Incredible. I felt cheated of the 7 odd hours I spent in the game (I explored, and went achievement-hunting, a clean playthrough is probably 4 hours).\n\nThe most disappointing thing is that, this was done despite the fact that a Season 2 was not a guarantee at the time the game first release on the X1 (though yes, now we know there will be a "Season 2"). So the devs were ♥♥♥♥♥ in releasing a game that ended on a cliffhanger that could well have never been completed.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, it's a fun adventure. Very story driven. Some bizarre ♥♥♥♥. The cat lady was just ♥♥♥♥ing scary...I felt disgusted.\n\nIt kinda looks and plays like a Telltale game, minus the choice aspect. You go to hubs, solve "puzzles" and talk to people.\n\nAs for the PC port quality, it's below-par. On a GTX 750 at 1080p, I got mostly 35-50fps. The reason for this is cause most of the time, the game renders two scenes at ones (like a comic pane, left and right). No graphics options except for On/Off Dynamic Shadows. There is a severe lack of AA, but I think that may have been intentional and you get used to it. The bummer though is the fact after an hour or so of playing, the game goes to 4700MB (!!!) of RAM. Some memory leak which happened continually, which hopefully they fix.\n\nAnother minor issue is with the side-missions are done. You have to move back and forth in time, and it gets irritating after a while. Also, you are confined to the same house, and in each of the three parts, you examine/inspect the same locations/objects to find collectibles.\n\nSo there's that! Hope you guys enjoy the game. I myself hope Season 2 is out soon.","June 5, 2015","true","8.1"," 87 of 129 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","87","129","2","1"

Just buy it, so SWERY could make more episodes and let me play this game some more :)","June 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","0"

One night a couple of years ago, your wife “Peggy” was attacked in your apartment and was seriously wounded. All you can remember are the words she whispered you before she died….. “Look for D”.\n\nD4: Dark Dreams Don’t Die is a point and click adventure game where you play a detective who can jump into the past by holding objects that belonged to someone from the past. These objects are called Mementos. Incredibly, Forrest Kaysen, your ex-partner at the BDP has brought you one of these Mementos - the badge of the officer who was guarding “The Rabbit” (a crook) during a transit flight. “The Rabbit”, was about to give information of a drug lord who’s name start with the letter D. Thus begins your investigations.\n\nYou will experience a very interesting but strange story with very good dialogue. At times you will have to reply by choosing one of three different options presented to you, which keeps you involved in the conversation. Accumulate as many credit as you can by collecting objects which you can use to customise all characters. There are several quick time moments in the game where you will need good reflexes executed them well.\n\nThis is season one of D4: Dark Dream Don’t Die and you will be able to play a prologue, episode one and two, which you will probably finish within 5 hours but this assuming you are not trying to get all achievements.\n\nIn terms of graphic, the art is marvellous and you will be treated with stunning cut-scenes. Great soundtracks and voice-over.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great artwork and cut-scenes\n-	Interesting story with a touch weirdness\n-	Great dialogue\n-	Must have reflexes\n-	Stacks of achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A bit short but to be expected\n\nOne of the best games of its genre.\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Not great, but fine. I made the mistake of letting it run for a while, resulting in a crash. I had a similar problem with Deadly Premonition, though worse.\n\nVery Swery, which is exactly what I signed up for. There's no telling what will happen next. Though you can bet there will be plenty of breaks for food. This game has an obsession with basic pleasures, like drinking, eating with friends and acting silly. Instead of worrying about your health much, your character is more concerned with drinking coffee or tequila to smooth himself out. And despite his central focus in investigating his wife's murder, he still has other interests, and will take opportunities to bring up hockey or music. He watches cartoons. Makes jokes. Sometimes when he's alone, he remembers how dark his life is. You'd mistake him for a real guy if his accent weren't so ridiculous. Many other games would make him a far bleaker character.\n\nSo this guy has the ability to travel through time and space at will, provided he has an item tied to a specific event. It's his special advantage over others, allowing him to solve mysteries that would be impossible otherwise. As a trade-off, his own memories become distorted.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of searching the environment, talking to people and occasionally taking part in bizarre QTE sequences. A lot of collection is involved, including searching your own home each day and carefully going over each new area. The pace is very laid back, especially since you can hop back and forth in time at-will, as well as replay previous chapters with items you find later in time. Backtracking for certain sidequests can be quite clever in its use of time travel.\n\nThe main draw here is the story and overall personality of the world. It's a version of America filtered through the beer-goggles of an eccentric Japanese cinephile. Familiar, but weird. It isn't afraid to run with an idea, especially if it's over the top. Yet it still takes itself seriously. I appreciate that kind of thing.","June 5, 2015","true","20.9"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","39","53","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/358090/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","D4: Dark Dreams Don’t Die is a game with big problems that is all but impossible to dislike.\n\nAs David Young, former detective now out to find the culprit behind his wife’s death, D4 took me on an adventure seemingly designed for one purpose: making an impression. Swery and his team at Access Games developed a rather passionate reputation after their eccentric cult classic Deadly Premonition became a surprise hit, but where DP was overburdened by its mechanics and ambition, the significantly smaller D4 proves a far more suitable conduit for whatever insanity Swery manages to dream up.\n\nD4 falls somewhere between the modern adventure game as told by Telltale, and the QTE heavy efforts of Quantic Dream. Hav ing been originally designed to be played exclusively with Microsoft’s Kinect, D4 focuses itself around single screens and simple gestures, an interface that at first feels moderately restrictive but ultimately works in the game’s favor. It’s always clear where you’re supposed to look, what you can interact with, and when you’ve missed something important, as well as being generally straight forward and intuitive where a more traditional control scheme may have been overbearing.\n\nWhat’s so endearing to me however is in the ways D4 appropriates mechanics from other games that ultimately have no reason to be here. There’s a stamina bar you refill by picking up food that’s been for some reason stowed throughout every level, a health bar that takes a slice off when you fail a prompt, and a credit system that rewards you for almost every action you take and can be spent on a rather outrageous number of unlockable costumes. In most games I’d scoff at how pointless it was to include things like this, but with D4 it becomes part of its personality. There’s a feeling that Access Games do not completely understand how to make the game they’re trying to, which leads to them pilfering bits and bobs from other games to fill in the “game-y” portion of D4, but they display such an infectious enthusiasm in everything they do that I eventually stopped caring about the trivial bits of D4 and in some ways even found them charming.\n\nD4 is so entirely detached from its peers in almost every way, that these little touches mostly amounted to winks and nods at a medium Access Games clearly loves working in, and thankfully never encroach upon anything else in the game. What is left then is a crash course through a world of extremes, from D4’s over-the-top characters, to its love of ridiculous dance-like fight scenes. D4 is obsessively spectacular, each scene enriched with a playful gravitas that would seem excessive if it wasn’t for how much more absurd the rest of the game is. D4 made me laugh more than any game I can remember in a long time, and I think it’s because it always seems in on the joke. It isn’t necessarily trying for comedy, but it’s aware of itself in a way most similarly bizarre games completely miss, playing to its strengths and remembering to have fun with itself instead of just the player.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with D4 is mostly in how it chooses to portray some of its characters. There’s the damseling of David’s wife right from the start, taken a step further by the way D4 infantilizes her at every point. Some characters spout blatantly sexist commentary, and in general the women of D4 end up feeling like they were included mostly to ridicule, injure, or give David someone to fall into a compromising position with. I also found the token person of color to be problematic, as he’s portrayed as almost alien in his mannerisms and how he shows up inexplicably throughout the game mostly to be unsettlingly weird in a way that isn’t shared among the other characters. None of this is done in a way that feels intentionally malicious, but they were enough for me to shake my head and wish D4 had done better, because in general it avoids most of the worst ways women and people of color are often displayed in games and at points almost came close to being one of the better instances of representation in games.\n\nD4: Dark Dreams Don’t Die is an imperfect creation, one that’s janky, at times conflicted with itself, and which may never be finished (this being only the first season and ending on a huge cliffhanger). But it’s also one of the most earnest games I’ve ever played, with a passion that shows up in even the endearing ways D4 fails to reach its full potential. It’s a game that I want to love unconditionally because D4 deserves it. It deserves a shot and a chance to do better, and for whatever faults it may have I feel no hesitation in saying everyone should play it.\n\nOn the PC port...\nAfter the mess that was Deadly Premonitions’ PC port, a lot of people are no doubt justifiably concerned as to the technical state of D4. Thankfully, D4 is (mostly) a big improvement. I experienced no crashes or major bugs throughout my playthrough, and using a mouse proved a serviceable stand-in for the Kinect (though some immersion may have been lost in the transition). Optimization isn’t as lucky, with some shockingly high system requirements that seem to be mostly accurate (I experienced some serious frame-rate drops playing on a machine that hits the minimum requirements and which has managed to run far more intensive games in the past). It never became unplayable due to the lax pace of the game, but for whatever reason speaking to characters caused the frame-rate to drop into the teens where it had previously been smooth. It isn’t anywhere near the problems Deadly Premonition faced, but if you’re concerned about whether or not you can run it downloading the demo would definitely be a wise choice.\n\nFull disclosure: D4 was reviewed using a copy provided by the publisher.

Actually that statement isn't entirely accurate. My favorite "experience" of 2010? Hmm... Well the long and short of it is that Swery65 and his team at Access Games are exceptional talents in some respects, much less so in others. The strongest elements of Deadly Premonition were the character interactions, the story, and those absurd, surrealistic, and also strangely subtle moments that held everything together. The actual game portions (particularly the "action" stages where you shoot the enemies) weren't anything to crow about.\n\nThe recipe for D4's success is Access Games focusing on their strengths. Rather than attempt another low-budget Resident Evil 4, what we have is an adventure game, filled mostly with quirky character moments. The main plot is certainly interesting, but the real charm is in how everyone plays off each other, as well as the limited interactions you have with their world.\n\nIt's fair to say that the bulk of the game is spent "goofing around". When you're not piecing together the events of a mysterious incident on an airliner, you're seeing what's on TV, pushing objects (and people) around, and drinking heavy. Most of the conversations that take place in this game, have nothing to do with anything. Still, they are what makes the game all the more entertaining. It reminds me of the earlier Metal Gear Solid games. Yes, Snake is on an important mission, the world is at stake, but is that any excuse to miss out on discussing James Bond's gadgets? I think not.\n\nMost of the actual game-playing is investigating objects. A lot of the text is flavor, but there are those rare times, where you'll feel a brush of emotion. This is what makes attention of detail such an underrated aspect of videogames. David Young's house is filled with reminders of his recently-deceased wife. He recalls the simplest things, like notes on a fridge, or the time a cabinet is purchased. It reminds me a little of a hat I purchased for my grandfather. He passed away several years ago, and I still have the hat as a memento. It's odd how I can recall when the hat was bought, the store, and how I felt at the time. Sometimes I wonder how David can stand it. He's living in an apartment where he's literally surrounded by mementos of his wife. After awhile it really has to... eh well perhaps this review is overdue for a change of subject.\n\nAs far as the QTEs go, this is one of the few games where I actually like how they work. All of them are handled through various mouse gestures, and they're very lenient. I suppose they'd have to be, considering that the game was originally designed for the Xbox One's Kinect. There are only a handful in the game, and half of them involve fights with a cat-girl. Did I mention D4 is weird?\n\nD4 is a difficult title to recommend. It has all the charm and personality of Swery65's last game, but it is definitely incomplete. It's possible that we might never see a Season Two. It's also entirely possible that you simply won't like Season One. This is the part where I throw in "Not for everyone" right? That's usually the case for these games. Still, it could be worse. At least this game didn't recieve a garbage PC port like Deadly Premonition did.","December 31, 2015","true","8.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","1"

Plays to the team's strengths by focusing on writing and not much gameplay beyond clicking things. There are almost no puzzles to speak of, merely clicking around until you find something sparkly to get a new bit of entertaining dialogue. Effortlessly cool and a joy from start to... well, a bit before the finish. The writers do a bang up job of mixing the quirky with the human. It may be offbeat and weird but it is falling all over itself to entertain you at every turn, which is what puts it apart from other "walking sims" or similar offbeat storytelling experiences.\n\nThen you have an ending that essentially cuts out right as the first interesting thing that episode happens, right when it looks like they are going to pay some of these plot threads off... and it's over. The game barely even filled out act 1 of the story it intended to tell. It's a bad enough taste to hurt the whole experience, coupled with the undeniable fact that not only are we not guaranteed to see this play out, it will be at LEAST a year before we can revisit this lovably goofy universe. You're left with nothing. Half-plot threads to mull over, the realization that you spent 3 of the last 6 hours watching Teddy eat (Worth it), and 2 of them solving a mystery which, while charmingly executed in every way, just was not enough to give you anything to chew on, and 1 of them in one conversation with a mysterious dude.\n\nWhen D4 is finished, you should waste no time buying it.

It has cool characters, impressive directing, awesome dialogues, and really funny QTEs.\n\nD4 is a detective story with murders, dangerous drugs, US marshals and undercover agents. One would think that protagonist is a clueless FBI agent working on a regular case, but no:\nyou are a private investigator, involved in all this mess only for your investigation's sake.\n\nThis game takes place in a super eccentric world, but everything feels very natural and you easily accept all the oddities, without noticing them. It takes a special skill to create an odd world which feels as normal as the world you are currently living in.\n\nThe best way to play this game — beer in one hand, mouse in the other. D4 is fully mouse-driven (or you can use a controller, it’s your choice, I’m not judging you), so it feels like classic point’n’clicks used to. It’s all implemented in a very convenient way — after a minute or so, you begin to move like a breeze and track items with ease. It is a good transition of classic point’n’click mechanics to a 3D era.\n\nCore gameplay also has a very cool aspect: you have health, stamina and vision points. Health for hazardous actions, Vision for hints and Stamina for interactions with people and objects. So in this game you can literally exhaust yourself by talking to someone or looking at mirror. Because of this, you can’t just click everything in sight — you must mind the state of your character and make your priorities. As for “pixel-hunting”, lots of it has been made dynamic — you must spot something not at your own time, but during an interaction, a cutscene, etc, and be rewarded for success, sometimes even with bonus “Extra cases” — a type of side activity that D4 offers.\n\nGraphics and overall visual aesthetics show that not every game with cell-shading should look awkward. You barely notice it.\n\nMusic is nice, but nothing you would listen to outside of the game. It really works within the game, though.\n\nThe only real problem this game has is right in its name — “Season 1”. So yes, it is not a full game, it is only the first part. And this is really a plague of this type of distribution: people don’t want to buy it before it’s complete, but it won’t be completed if people don’t buy it.\n\nOn the other hand, we have a game with deep investigations; cool aesthetics; a topic-based dialogue system that actually works; superb presentation and overall design. Made by developers of a Deadly Premonition, with every good part DP had left intact and every bad part tossed away.\n\nIf you’re still reading this, you definitely should try it out. It is super cool even for what it currently has to offer.\n\nP.S.

A good starting point is did you like Deadly Premoniton? Then you will probably dig this gem. If you didn't? I suggest passing on the game or at least wait til a sale before taking the plunge into the world of David Young, his charming (terrible?) Boston accent, and Flight 117.\n\nD4 is for the most part an interactive comic, you will be spending most of your time talking to characters and doing favors for them while looking for clues and trying to figure out how someone can disappear from a plane in flight. It took me 3 1/2 hours to main line the story, but I skipped quite a bit of optional side quests in favor of seeking out the next story beat. I found the gameplay interesting and incredibly different than anything I have every experienced, and for me that is a huge bonus. I like to play different types of games every now and again to remind myself that we can still experiement in the game industry.\n\nIt is a Swery game, which means its incredibly weird, very weird. The story revolves around several mysteries that are connected in various ways, but the shining part of the game is crazy, memorable characters that inhabit the world and whom you will be interacting with. While 3 1/2 hours wasn't enough time (for me) to remember everyones name (a sign to me that I'm really enjoyed the media I am viewing/playing/reading), the characters are highly memorable and I could describe them in full detail as well as describe meaningful moments that they were apart of.\n\nThe game does end on a cliff hanger, but the game is set up for sequels/seasons to continue. This might be a turn off for some, I personally don't mind it as long as content doesn't take too long to come out. I enjoyed my time with the game and want to play the game again to find what I missed and just in general, be in the world that Swery has created.","June 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","2"

Can get memory usage heavy after a few hours but overall game runs smooth.\n\nImaginative game that has an intriguing storyline with good art style to compliment . Characters are unique in their own ways that each one of them will leave a strong impression on you (be it good or bad). Plays much like any Telltale games.\n\nVoice acting is spot on with some of the best VAs in the industry (Liam O'Brien for example).  Dialogues are fun to listen to and I think this is also partially due to the good voice acting.\n\nI think the only real gripe I have is the quick time events during the action scenes. Instead of paying attentions to the actual game all you are worried about is getting ready for the next quick time event. I did well in most of them but I still feel like I had no idea what the heck happened as I'm trying to recall. Game has fairly high replay values for getting 100% completions, so perhaps during the 2nd playthrough I can see more of the actual actions instead of big arrows.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience so far. (I'm on to chapter 2 now) It's not perfect, but very entertaining and very much worth the purchase.","June 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

It also has QTEs that are genuinely fun and  are actually some of the best parts of the game. The characters are all bunch of goofballs like DP and it’s just as funny, the voice acting is also good. The soundtrack is great too. This game will even give you enough knowledge about planes to get you a pilot's license.\n\nThe game ends on a huge cliffhanger because SWERY and his team got screwed by Microsoft, though more episodes seem to be in development.

As with Swery's previous game, Deadly Premonition, the characters are very quirky and strange, and oddly likable. The plot itself is also rather strange, yet captivating, full of twists I certainly didn't see coming. You are David Young, a detective whose wife has been killed, and his memory of that day lost, remembering only her finals words: "Look for D". Somehow, the incident gave you the power to travel back in time using mementos, and you set out to solve your wife's murder and find this mysterious D with the help of your former detective partner and a woman acting like a cat. It only gets stranger from there.\n\nUnlike Deadly Premonition, the gameplay is actually well implemented and doesn't seem like an afterthought. The game plays like a point-and-click adventure game split into episodes, much like Telltale games and the like. Also unlike Deadly Premonition, the game isn't a technical nightmare.

A detective story for the attention deficit disorder afflicted crowd. Whenever I get distracted by the game's weird, flabby storyline of "who is the guy that killed my wife inside of this airplane I'm on", I can just ruffle through people's belongings, eat all the hamburgers that the passengers have so kindly stored in the overhead compartments on the airplane, and then shove the cat riding on the top of his seat in business class!\n\nYep, it's by SWERY, and it's as bonkers as everyone said. It's a little bit too bonkers, as if the guy who was writing some Twin Peaks fanfiction had a mental break and then suddenly had one of the detectives eating five slices of pizza at the one sitting and another had subconscious thoughts about wanting to ♥♥♥♥ his cat which looks like his wife. It's a game where one moment a guy is trimming the vines from his apartment balcony and the next minute shoving his detective partner for imaginary credits to buy more hamburgers with.\n\nAll of this Twin Peaks-aping crazy on offer is, however, one attempt to hide just how damn short the game is. The game revels in side-quests and poking through everything and eating all the hamburgers you see - doing things requires stamina (but for some reason, the overlong mid-chapter boss fights don't), and you gotta pack in the mother♥♥♥♥ing calories to have enough stamina to annoy everyone on the plane. The quick-time events are another attempt to slow down the game for a five-hour runtime - oh man, the ♥♥♥♥ing quick time events. I still don't know whether to give them a pass because they have this weird Shenmue feel to them, or to slag the game off on them because there are so many of them that are required for, say, opening a microwave door. Or cupboards. Or doors. Or practically anything. This is the game trying to pad out the time it actually takes, and there's no reason for it since there's no Kinect functionality available here. It's just extra steps. Stop ♥♥♥♥ing around and tell me what's going on, D4! You don't need this much damn nuance to tell your story!\n\nI like D4. I like the mood and the tone it sets, and I really like playing as a mentally broken drunk cat-♥♥♥♥er detective who might or might not be the cause of all of his problems. It's got too much fluff, but of course I bought into all the fluff and ♥♥♥♥ because that's what gives D4 it's character (and also I played through most of this game drunk as a lord, much like David Young, Cat-♥♥♥♥er Extraordinaire is). But the glacial pace very nearly killed it for me and the payoff was almost non-existent except for 'That's all for now, so go dress up your cat as a dalmation'. So it gets a conditional recommendation on the basis that Season Two takes some ♥♥♥♥ing Ritalin and focuses on its story.\n\nAs an addendum, this game didn't deserve to languish unnoticed on the Xbox One (part of a fleet of  giant AAA Titanics heading eagerly towards icebergs), and I'm super, super glad it got a PC release.","June 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

My dislikes are mainly drugs... And chewing gum.\n\nOverview\nD4: Dark Dreams Don't Die -Season one- is the first part of a planned episodic adventure games series developed by Access Games in the same vein as Telltale's cinematic titles. D4 is a crazy story filled with wacky characters and ridiculous situations somehow fittingly wrapped into a serious, moody detective crime story.\n\nStory\nD4 follows the tale of David Young, middle-aged ex-cop and widower turned private detective in order to find D, a mysterious individual whose only known initial was Little Peggy's (Young's wife) dying breath.\n\nIf the plot I described above sounds super cliché, I can assure you that this is where any parallel resemblances to other detective stories end. David Young has developed a special power that allows him to find the truth about the past through objects he finds. This allows him to manipulate and learn about the past, convinced that his power can bring back his wife if he can find the right clues.\n\nThe story manages to remain entertaining in large part due to the extremely strange characters that David encounters, including his gluttonous, Bostonian buddy called Forrest Kaysen and a crazy half-human, half-cat freeloader called Amanda.\n\nGameplay\nThe game plays exactly like any other episodic adventure game the likes of Telltale Games' titles but manages to add some variety to the mixture. A huge variety of objects can be inspected, picked up and collected throughout the game and multiple optional character dialogues, mini-games or side quests can be triggered (or missed) at certain times.\n\nYou'll spend a lot of time pointing and clicking, dragging and rapidly executing action-driven QTE sequences but it feels natural and is an enjoyable accompaniment to the pace of the game. The only downside to the game is that it is easy to miss certain events or collectibles and, with the game sectionned into only three chapters, it can take some time to progress through previously-played chapters in order to find what you missed.\n\nVisuals\nD4: Dark Dreams Don't Die -Season one- has a gritty cell-shaded appearance, leaving many visual imperfections (such as character outlines overlapping each other) that yet somehow appears intentional and could be considered artistic design.\n\nIt's definitely not the cleanest cell-shaded art style I've seen, but it certainly has flair of its own and feels appropriate.\n\nAudio\nGreat audio work all around. Every member of the cast, whether their roles be minor or major, have fully-voiced english dialogue that sound excellent, with David and his sidekick Kaysen having authentic, Bostonian accents to compliment the game's setting. The music is a delightful mix of instrumental pieces clearly inspired from crime TV shows and sci-fi soundtracks.\n\nTechnical\nThe game plays great at all times, has a slew of PC-centric options and I have not encountered any bugs myself.\n\nThe TL;DR\nD4: Dark Dreams Don't Die -Season one- is a fantastic adventure game that succesfully compounds the surreal and the authentic, comedy and tragedy and packages it in a completely wild adventure where you can struggle to make sense of what is real and what isn't.\n\nNeedless to say, I am extremely excited about a follow-up to Season one.

As the title suggests, this is Season One so the last chapter will definitely end in a cliffhanger!\n\nShort summary:\nYou lost most of your memory and your wife was killed. Her last words were "look for D". A result from what happened gave you the ability to take items that hold memories (mementos) and travel back to that memory to solve cases and find D.\n\nThe game is a combination of point and click and QuickTime events. Although that sounds like a bad concept, it is pulled off quite well. At times the point and click side can be rather slow and boring, the action kicks in for the QuickTime events. To keep the story moving, every interaction except opening doors uses a little bit of stamina. If you meter drops to zero you pass out and wake up back at your place. You can refill your stamina by eating and drinking. (If you do not find food lying around you can always purchase some from the cat vendors)\n\nGetting to the QuickTime events, the music ramps up and the scenes start moving quickly. Instead of just pressing a simple button, the bottom of the screen tells you when an action comes up and you follow what pops up on the screen. That may be using the right analog stick or pressing several buttons at once. Each scene corresponds to what you are doing and can change depending on if you succeed or fail.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is very short. You have a prologue and two chapters. Once completed you have the opportunity to replay any chapter.\n\nThe characters are all quite unique and borderline demented. You have Amanda, who stays at your place and acts like a cat, Duncan the fashion designer, Deborah, and many other crazy characters. According to Dr. Johnson, some of these characters will definitely get on your nerves.\n\nThe graphics of the game are definitely not state of the art. They were going for a more artistic style and did a great job at it. It feels almost like a comic book in motion.\n\nThe dialog is sometimes cheesy and can become predictable. The acting was well done with good emotion put into the acting.\n\nThere are a few things that will get annoying. Every time you start a new chapter or new section you have a cutscene from Little Peggy where she gets shot. This scene is not shippable and happens way too often. The fact that you have to play through each chapter after beating it to get to the really fun action scenes is disappointing. Also the shortness of the game.\n\nAll in all it is a great game and will be an awesome game if we get all the seasons to complete the story.\n\nDefinitely a buy!\n","June 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Aaaand it's absolutely bonkers.\nD4 is about David Young, a detective whose wife was murdered. Now he is trying to solve the case behind his wife's murder  and find the murderer with his only real clue being his wife's last words, "Look for D." Now, this sounds like something you have seen before doesn't it? Well, that's hardly surprising. The setting is very generic and by now a cliché. However, with D4 that is hardly a problem. The way D4 is executed is done in such a ridiculous and unique way I have only seen D4 pull off in a video game that I just couldn't help have a really good time with it. D4 is like those B movies you sometimes watch with your friend just have a laugh at how terrible they are, except that it's not terrible. It's like a detective story Tenacious D.\nThat doesn't mean that the story of D4 would be terrible either. It's not, but it's not the strong point of the title.\n\nD4 is a point & click game similar to, for example, Telltale games or Life is Strange, except that it turns the whole thing up to eleven. Almost every little thing in D4 has a QTE for it, and by that I do mean almost everything, like raising a toilet seat for example. That might sound quite annoying but it really takes only just a quick movement of mouse and you get used to it very quickly. The game also has some longer QTE action scenes that are so ridiculously over the top that despite my general dislike towards QTEs, I couldn't help but love them. They are just so well executed in D4. Aside from QTEs, gameplay of D4 involves searching clues from the environment that will allow you to progress with the story. It is also played with only your mouse, or a controller if you choose to use one.\n\nCharacters in D4 are not any less over the top or cheesy either. The main protagonist, David Young, is your typical gloomy detective type, except that sometimes the things he says or the way he acts is so cheesy that it is impossible to take him seriously, and with each new character the game introduces, it gets worse. And when I say worse, I mean better. Each character in D4 feels more like an exaggerated caricature than a proper video game character, and I really enjoyed that.\n\nVoice acting, again, was not very good in D4. In fact, on few occassions it was so bad that as I was playing, I looked up few of the voice actors and it turned out that the game uses English voice actors who have mostly worked on English anime dubs. That might tell you quite a lot about what kind of voice acting you should expect. However, this never bothered me while playing the game. I think somewhat cheesy voice acting that was bit on the poor side actually contributes to the overall mood of D4, but I'm sure this is something that can bother other people.\nSoundtrack of the game on the other hand is very good. It is mostly composed by MANYO (aka Tomomi Teratani), whom visual novel fans might recognize from Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo and Kara no Shoujo.\n\nWhat about the PC port? Well, it is very bare bones but does the job. The game runs at 60 fps, there's some resolution options (not much), and an option for VSync and dynamic shadows. It also seems to be fairly poorly optimized with frequent fps drops and long load times. So yeah, it's not great, but it's perfectly playable. At the very least it's not so bad that you should not play the game because of it.\n\nNow then, while I greatly enjoyed D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, I won't claim that it's flawless. Story is not particularly amazing, setting and characters are arguably cheesy, the game is pretty short, and the voice acting is not very good. However, what is most likely the biggest flaw of the D4 is the ending. The game ends in an annoying in cliffhanger, one that is so ridiculous and over the top I actually laughed a little, but also one that's probably the worst kind of cliffhanger you can have. What makes it particularly annoying is that there is no confirmation of a second season for D4. That is not to say it won't happen, but it really is up to how well the PC release will do. Either way, you should buy this first season of D4 for the content it offers and not while expecting that the game will get its conclusion later down the line. Of course, I really hope this happens.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to does this kind of ridiculous B movie styled nonsense D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die offers sound like something you would enjoy. I personally had a blast with it.","August 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And thankfully, my hype was founded. I love Deadly Premonition but couldn't stand the driving controls, so D4, while not perfect, plays a lot better while keeping the Swery charm.\n\nThere are some graphical errors (sometimes the game can't handle costumes, I've noticed, as well as audio/visual desync at times) but I can't fault the game too much - the controls are quite reasonable, the dialogue and story is fascinating and I know I will be replaying the game a lot for the purposes of completionism. I can only hope that we don't have to wait too long for further episodes.\n\nOverall, while far from a perfect game, if you enjoy Telltale style games like The Walking Dead, Life Is Strange, or you enjoyed the quirkiness of Deadly Premonition, I can only highly recommend it.\n\nAnd please watch the Forrest Kaysen extra cases.

It is played entirely with your mouse (or controller), and is a point-and-click adventure.  This may sound great, but it is quite different than Telltale's offerings in that the choices you make do not impact the story.  Where this game excels is the interesting character designs - everything from how they talk, act, dress, etc.  On top of the interesting characters is a mystery/detective story layered with murder, amnesia, drugs, and all kinds of weird crimes from exsanguinated bodies, bodies with the flesh inside out, drowning without water, etc.\n\nWhile a single playthrough of the game is pretty short, say 4-5 hours, it is designed for multiple playthroughs and we are waiting to see if Access Games will give us Season Two, although there don't seem to be any promises on that just yet.  With the multiple playthroughs comes a lot of the things you'd expect in a Japanese production: collectibles, costumes, documents to flesh out the story, numerous sidequests, quirky humor, and 78 achievements to keep you busy. In all, after many playthroughs and getting every achievement it took me about 14-15 hours of game time.\n\nThose players that have played Deadly Premonition will notice a lot of easter eggs, and will see that this game is in many ways a spiritual successor to it.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but those of you that enjoyed Deadly Premonition and Spy Fiction will be rewarded, and for me it added to my experience with the game in a good way.\n\nFinal thoughts... I'd say barrier to entry is that you have to like point-and-click play style, with an added bonus if you like quirky Japanese productions.

It is played entirely with your mouse (or controller), and is a point-and-click adventure.  This may sound great, but it is quite different than Telltale's offerings in that the choices you make do not impact the story.  Where this game excels is the interesting character designs - everything from how they talk, act, dress, etc.  On top of the interesting characters is a mystery/detective story layered with murder, amnesia, drugs, and all kinds of weird crimes from exsanguinated bodies, bodies with the flesh inside out, drowning without water, etc.\n\nWhile a single playthrough of the game is pretty short, say 4-5 hours, it is designed for multiple playthroughs and we are waiting to see if Access Games will give us Season Two, although there don't seem to be any promises on that just yet.  With the multiple playthroughs comes a lot of the things you'd expect in a Japanese production: collectibles, costumes, documents to flesh out the story, numerous sidequests, quirky humor, and 78 achievements to keep you busy. In all, after many playthroughs and getting every achievement it took me about 14-15 hours of game time.\n\nThose players that have played Deadly Premonition will notice a lot of easter eggs, and will see that this game is in many ways a spiritual successor to it.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but those of you that enjoyed Deadly Premonition and Spy Fiction will be rewarded, and for me it added to my experience with the game in a good way.\n\nFinal thoughts... I'd say barrier to entry is that you have to like point-and-click play style, with an added bonus if you like quirky Japanese productions.  If any of that interests you I suggest you pull the trigger and play this game now!","September 19, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

A lot of the more humorous actions, like slamming your fist down to crack a fortune cookie or swinging a baseball bat (in the Xbox version you're actually instructed to get into a batter's pose and swing alongside the character), are replaced with simple actions like clicking on your fist and dragging it to the cookie or swiping across the screen to swing the bat. It still feels okay, and the game itself is still fantastic, but even though I'll still continue to buy the following seasons on both platforms I'll probably only actually play them on the Xbone, because ultimately I feel like this is a game that's made for the Kinect (and probably the only game made for the Kinect, for that matter).\n\nIn the end, if you're a fan of the parts of Deadly Premonition that didn't involve combat, and you appreciate quality over quantity (from what I remember from the Xbox One version, the game is only about 5-10 hours long depending on how much effort you put into the side content, so if you need to get your money's worth you might want to wait for a sale) you'll love this game. If you have an Xbox One (why?), I'd recommend buying it there instead unless you just really really like having your games on Steam (which I wouldn't blame you for), but if you don't have an Xbox One this version is a perfectly fine port.","June 5, 2015","true","13.1"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","25","46","0","1"

A relatively simple narrative adventure game, D4 shines primarily in its presentation--it jumps back and forth between comedic and deadly serious at a moment's notice and just about every character feels simultaneously real and like some kind of wacky cartoon character. Combined with dialogue that's just often coming just barely shy of making you cringe and an overall sincerity to the whole thing, you get a game that will either keep you smiling or scratching your head in bewilderment at whatever the hell it just threw at you that you're now supposed to take seriously.\n\nTo call it "So bad it's good" would do it a disservice, as I can't genuinely call the majority of this game bad.

In-fact, it comes from the same guy that brought us Deadly Premonition (Swery). The game itself is great although I'm told it's incredibly short -- clocking in at just about 3 hours. The port however is somewhat decent (you can only choose your resolution and whether dynamic shadows as well as vsync are to be turned on or off) and in what actual playtime I got to test the title: performance was thankfully solid and for a Kinect title on the Xbox One, the translation to PC was done excellently.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think I'll be able to progress much further into the title because I had a display driver crash in my first hour or so with it, when I was "pushing" a plant in David's house. The next crash happened about 1 hour later again when I was in the plane level. 5 minutes later I tried yet again (clearly not getting the hint lol) and I was met with a display driver crash on the same level.\n\nPuzzled at this, and testing my GPU on a number of titles that day, I decided maybe my GPU drivers weren't any good (nvidia 361.43) even though I only seemed to be having issues with this title. So I downloaded and ran Display Driver Uninstaller (as recommended by my good friend PlayaOfGames), removed the driver with it when I booted into safe mode, and then slapped on the new 362.00 driver (not going anywhere near the 364.xx drivers due to concerning user reports).\n\nI came back and this time I decided to monitor my temperatures with HWMonitor. Sure enough, in one scene alone, the game pushed my GPU to 77 degrees or more on a number of launches in just a few minutes:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668682713\n\nI have no idea how an Unreal Engine 3 game that looks like this can be this demanding. Something's just not adding up. Not to mention there's tons of people not even able to launch the game after all this time and there have been no patches for this game since release. I do, however, thank the devs for still replying to user reports after all this time (they made a reply to my post on their hub just yesterday). There's always the possibility my PC isn't strong enough to run this game at 1920x1080 w/ dynamic shadows and vsync on, given the rather weird recommended system requirements for this game:\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit edition / Windows 8 64-bit edition / Windows 10 64-bit edition\nProcessor: Intel Corei7 4770K @ 3.5GHz or an equivalent AMD CPU\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 or AMD Radeon HD 7850 (VRAM 2GB)\nDirectX: Version 11\nStorage: 20 GB available space\nSound Card: A DirectX 11 compatible card\nAdditional Notes: Keyboard and mouse necessary. Compatible with XInput controllers such as the Xbox 360 controller. Display: 1920x1080.\n\nWhatever the case, I just don't know. Consider yourself warned and if you have a system weaker than mine... all the best. This is an awesome game, and from the good 2 hours or so I got out of this game (the other time was spent at the main menu while I was away or replying to friends), I really enjoyed it. I won't give a score because I don't feel it's appropriate in this case but I am disappointed.\n\n\n[EDIT]:\n\nHere's another person with the same problem as me: http://steamcommunity.com/app/358090/discussions/0/357286119110734030/","April 19","false","5.0"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","29","54","0","0"

The main character has a fake Boston accent. The gameplay's kinda boring and sometimes tedious, consisting entirely of hovering your mouse over objects and moving it in different directions in order to open every single door. Since it's not anime styled you would think it would be exempt from typical Japanese quirks but they're still there; they're just a little more subtle (there are white people everywhere yet they all act like Japanese cartoon characters). There's also a mysterious black man that's introduced who is like this game's G-man except he talks ridiculously slow in an effort to make him seem creepy, but all it really does is make the game drag unless you skip his dialogue. Also, the game consists of a prologue and 2 episodes making it about 6 hours long and ends on a cliffhanger with literally nothing resolved.\nRegardless, it's unique, (despite the fact that the main character has amnesia and is looking for the killer of his dead wife and is being helped out by his friend Teddy and collects MOMENTOS *cough*) so I recommend you  get the game when it's on sale just for the experience of a Japanese manufactured acid trip.","August 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","10","17","3","0"

The core IPs it's inspired by are Memento (2000), Quantum Leap (1989) and every 1990's TV show opening you've ever watched, as well as a few other modern movies like Inception and in general the graphic novel genre with a good celshading look.\nOf course, whilst it takes inspiration it also has a lot of originality within the framework, it's not a blatant rip like the creator's other games and it shows that he's actually progressed as a creator a lot since then.\nCharacters feel well developed, especially the main character who has strong emotional moments that are brought out through the gameplay and various flavour text rather than a cutscene. The story introduces curious scenarios that you wish to figure out. Even flavour text and magazine articles you happen across have large place as background to the story though it isn't immediately apparent.\nThe game has many quirks.\n\n-Genuinely well thought-out Point and Click/QTE fusion of gameplay,\nPoint and Clicks may put some off, but this game deserves a test spin, as it can actually have legitimate difficulty. Easy comparisons are Heavy Rain, Policenauts, Catherine's social sections. Quick Time Events also take place, and whilst I'm not partial usually these have all the hype of a Platinum Games style QTE, in a quirky and funny kind of way.\nThe interface takes a lot more from older games such as Policenauts or Snatcher whilst streamlining them to make interacting with the environment not menu-driven. Immersion is earned through miniature interactive segments, and every item you come across has unique properties that run a voice clip explaining the protagonist's thoughts, a readable article or a world building cutscene that will either leave you slightly upset for him or extremely entertained. All of these are obviously optional.\n\nThis game is a slow and methodical one for the most part that does encourage the player to think and consider what's going on around them. There's a lot of dicking around to do (in the detective sense and the unnecessary gameplay sense) and depending on how much you like admiring yourself in the mirror you'll blast through the game in 1 hour or 5 hours, with replayability being encouraged.\n\nBut suddenly, the game has faster paced QTE sections. These keep you invested, not by assuming you care about your character's welfare, but by layering slapstick humour, one liners and daft arguments over challenging inputs that feel extremely natural to execute once you've got a feel for it. It's a rather insane departure from Deadly Premonition to see unwarrentedly good game design for what was once a KINECT game on the XBone that shockingly translated well to functions on common inputs. The optional outcomes of these events also encourages replaying the game. There's a surprising amount of content for the pricing.\n\nIn short: Don't worry, the game's fun. There's a health and stamina meter, as well as "Detective Vision" which you probably won't need if you're good at picking out interactables, that aren't too hard to juggle but require more attention than MGS3:Snake Eater's stamina for example, and it's all executed without menus.\n\nI was left with an incredibly good impression and look forward to the currently developing sequel series.","August 10, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But every pro has its con.\nThe game contained a very interesting story and setting that you don't find in many other games, on the flipside the story doesn't last to long. My record says 4.4 hours and that was with me taking my time (did I miss some things, sure, but did I even attempt to speed run it, no).\nThe game controls and mechanics are very neat, it is a point and click-esqu style game, with better graphics and a "stand right here" style movement system. This said, if you have a large screen or a slow mouse, you might want to consider hooking up a controller, otherwise this game can feel pretty clunky with your mouse at the start.\nI would recommend but would definitely beware, if you wanted a super long lasting, very smoothly controlled game with lots of action, this isn't the game you should buy.\nIf you are looking for a casual game to mess around with for a day or so 10/10 would recommend.\nIf this game goes on sale, would recommend.","August 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However it does differ from other episodic games in that its more linear and does not have "consequences" from your choices as other games such as Walking Dead or Life is Strange. Its focus is more on the story line and the quirky world that is D4.\n\nThe story follows a former Boston Detective using his strange powers of "diving" into the past to find out who killed his wife. He is aided by his former collegue Kaysen Forrest and Amanda his "cat" along with other characters that he meets on his journey. Although his wife died 2 years ago he never got over her death and often hallucinates memories of her WHICH GIVES ME THE FEELS!!!\n\nThe game has a RPG type upgrade mechanic when completing side quests (cases). Your characters can have their looks customised which adds variety to it. Not to mention it improves your stats as well.\n\nPros:\n\nInteresting Story\nQuirky Characters\nCustomise Character Looks\nRomance/Tragedy feels of protagonist's past\nAwesome soundtrack\n\nCons:\n\nIt may never be finished.\nIt eats up a lot of memory (doesn't run well on weaker machines)\nNot a lot of customisation of graphic settings\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy this game to save it from extinction and preserve it for future generations of game nerds.

This was landmark stuff back in 1995.\n\nTwenty years later, all episodic adventure games, especially those by Telltale, have all of these gameplay elements. D4 is no exception, but they're mixed together in a way that makes them feel fresh and vibrant, just as they did back in Eno's D.

But even for those who aren't familiar with this video game director, I still wholly reccomend this game.\n\nThis experience is split in to two types of gameplay; Exploration, and action scenes.\n-Being a port of a kinect game, you aren't given direct control in the exploration sections. You point yourself in a direction, and click on a movement icon to walk to that specific point. It's very intuitive and easy to learn.\nBut one mechanic mixes up the usual point-and-click formula: A stamina meter. Everything you do, from opening a door, to walking across the room uses a little bit of stamina. Stamina is replenished by eating food you find in the enviroment. It's an interesting inclusion, and subtly adds to the quirky nature of the game.\n-The action scenes control quite differently though. Usually, a direction is displayed on screen, and you move your mouse along its path. These scenes are full of energy, and fun to play.\n\nWhile the game is short, it has tons of replay value, with hundreds of interactable items, each with unique flavor text. Every single action you perform gives you credits, which can be spent on clothing items, music tracks, and more food for your stamina.\n-So far the game consists of a prologue and two episodes, each about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how you play.\n-It has plenty of sidequests and collectibles to find, to encourage subsequent playthroughs.\n\n\n\nBut while I love this game to death, I do have a couple complaints about it.\n\n-Sometimes it is unclear on what will progress the story with no point of return.\nA couple times I performed an action, without knowing it would continue the story. Because of this, I missed sidequests and items, having to replay the whole episode.\n\n-No chapter select.\nGranted, while the epsodes are short, (about the length of a television episode,) it can be annoying having to replay parts you've gone through multiple times to get to a perticular section. Thankfully, you can start a new save with all your collectibles once you complete the game.\n\n-Very short length.\nThis is probably the biggest issue with this game. It's incredible short. I've gotten about seven hours at the time of writing, after replaying the first two episodes multiple times. Unfortunately, being a stealth release, this game got almost no attention on launch. Since then, it's sold only about 150,000 copies worldwide. We're probably not going to get more episodes, but we'll just have to wait, as Swery is (at the time) facing medical issues.\n\n\nDespite these issues, this game is probably my favorite game of 2014, as well as the past several years. There is nothing else like it, and any fan of TellTale or David Cage games would feel right at home. It's funny, well written, and full of genuine love for the project. I would reccomend this game at full price.","January 9","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is extremely hard to play, it's would be very easy, but it's full of bugs, I'm hoping that's just because of it being newly released though, so I'm not giving up on it. To be more specific, it lags like crazy, has extremely long load screens, and, after the tutorial when you first see David, there was some white tint with black spots on the screen, I tried exiting and reloading, but it had the same tint, finaly I exited and when reloading the game, I turned vsync off and it went away(this tint did not appear in the main menu or loading screen), only problem is, it lagged pretty bad, and after opening a letter, a different tint appeared from that when I closed the letter, then the screen just kindof froze, odd part is, I did the motion to turn to a different direct, odd thing about that is while the screen didn't move to show the other room, the "examine" "(!)" still identified items in the direction I was trying to turn to.\n\nThe reason I'm still recommending this is that the game is still an amazing game, it just needs serious bug fixes.\n\nSo, in summary, great story, need to work out the bugs.","June 8, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agrobal/recommended/358090/","Agrobal","Agrobal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agrobal/","657 products in account","D4 is one of the strangest games I have played this year, let alone in my entire life. I came into this game without any knowledge of the developer's previous games. I knew only one thing and that it was an adventure game with mystery elements in it which automatically made me sign up for a point and click game. Interestingly enough, it was not initially released for the PC but was rather planned as a Kinect game.\n\nI can safely say after checking out this game, I got immediately curious for the developer's other projects since D4 just breaks the formula for your typical genre. That's not to say good Adventure games are common nowadays (Although I am starting to notice their rebirth despite their outdated mechanics). D4 is a very eccentric game in all shapes and forms and you can notice my hesitation since I am not sure where I start from but I'll jump right into it.\n\nYou play as David Young, a detective that can travel through space and time to discover the mystery of his wife's death.... From his bathtub. The setup sounded really serious and that was the reason I actually wanted to play it in the first place. However, it turned out to be one of the most fun rides I have ever witnessed. It's hard to talk about this game without spoiling so if you are curious to find out yourself, stop here.\n\nDavid Young along with his partner, Forrest solve other cases along with the main case of his wife's death. The last word his wife, peggy, told him was to find D. David, ironically starts finding anyone that has a name starting with a D since that is all he remembers from the incident.\n\nControls are pretty basic if you are playing it on PC, almost every object is identifiable and can be examined, which leaves a huge room for exploration for fanatics like me. Examining an object earns you credits and with credits you can buy apparel for your characters as well as food. That's right, every action you take here takes a bit out of your stamina and when your Stamina is depleted, it's basically game over. Another bar that you can use is the vision bar which is basically the game's hint system where it shows you your next objective or it can highlight items that you haven't examined yet. The Vision bar is replenished with Alcohol.\n\nA very interesting concept but in my opinion is quite fun and leaves room for more interactions for the player since there is a lot to collect and explore including flashbacks for David in the form of letters from his wife, magazines that have trivia in them, side quests for each character you meet in the season and a huge food list to cover with its own trivia that you get to share with Forrest. The side quests range from mini games to pop quizzes. All in all, I assure you this is one hell of a ride for those that want no more than mindless fun or a mindful if you want to answer those pop quizzes.\n\nD4 is fairly short if it was tackled from point A to B however, the whole purpose about it is to approach it with a curious mind since you are role playing as a detective. Speaking of which, the game rewards you if you stay in character depending on your dialogue options, although you are not forced to remain in character, it is still hilarious to see the reactions of a flight attendant slapping David for him staring at her rack.\n\n\nAll cutscenes are Quick Time Events and I know QTEs are most of the time disengaging and boring most of the time, but not this time since at least it is not a button prompt and David also has a health bar that depletes if you dont follow the QTE accurately. The scenes have things getting out of hand in every way and I suggest you put up a counter to how many times go "WTF"\n\nThe game is planned to be episodic and only one season is out so far. I loved how every episode actually has an opening just like a TV show and not only that, but there is a recap of the previous episode in each one. I suppose the only thing I hate about it is I have to wait for the next season but then again, the whole project was experimental initially. In my opinion, it succeeded enough for another season and I can't wait to review the new one.\n\nhttp://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/08/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die-season-one.html","August 17, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The main character has a ginormous Boston accent, and I find it a little weird that he keeps calling his wife "Little Peggy", but nonetheless the constant interactions with the environment gives the game a very high level of immersion.  You can also unlock a lot of alternate costumes for different characters and equip them to see them in the cutscenes Dead Rising(Or other recent Capcom games) style, which gives the game a lot of replay value.

This crap is awesome.\nI love episodic games already. In fact, it's fair to say that I'm not hard to please in that particular...subgenre..thing. This one is particularly interesting, and with just the Prologue and the First Episode played through at the time of this writing, I'm going to go ahead and go out on a limb here with the statement, "...Yeah, I think it's alright. And by alright, I mean fan-freakin'-tastic."\n\nBut then, a review is a critique. So I'm going to critique it.\n\nThe lowdown:\n\nKeanu Reeves plays David, and in the game you are David. You are also Keanu Reeves. As it turns out, you join this after fully accepting that you're part of the Matrix, and you have to enter the Matrix to find clues to solve your dead wife's murder. I don't consider this a spoiler, because they tell you this right dead in the beginning. If you call that a spoiler, you're more of a brat than I am and need to calm down. Besides, this is a Keanu Reeves miniseries we're talking about, here. KEANU.FRIGGIN.REEVES!!!\n\nThe Bad Stuff\n\nI have very little to complain about here, but I do have a few minor gripes. The game seems to be made in Squigglevision. If you've ever seen television shows featuring animation that squiggles around the hard lines, that's kind of how the game engine looks. I know I don't have the game set up improperly, it's just the nature of things. Nothing looks like it quite touches things, so it seems a little out there in terms of visual stability until something is demonstrated to show the pressing of flat surface against flat surface. Suddenly, it makes sense. It doesn't make it a good thing, but it makes it bearable. Maybe this was on purpose! However, if it's being used as an artistic device, they could've definitely done a better job with it.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nAbso-friggin-lutely everything else about this is awesome. It's eerie, it's cheesy, it's 1980's music, Boston folk punk, racial stereotypes, and a healthy dose of, "Why in the hell is this here?" - These things are used so well in this game that anyone who complains about them clearly just doesn't get it.\n\nThis is like playing a David Lynch video game with the oddity of Twin Peaks, but with the modern feel of something actually mae recently. I feel like if Lynch, being who he is, were to interact with SquareEnix to temper his entirely bizarre imagination into something coherent while using the plot control device of time travel to do it, this would be the game that would come out.\n\nAnother thing that lends itself to the Lynch-esque experience is the soundtrack. It's honestly one of the most well used, eclectic, and bizarre selection of tunes I've ever heard to use in the context - but they make it all work in a way that provides amazing results.\n\nEverything is so clear cut in such bizarre and surrealistically hilarious ways, and if you ARE a fan of David Lynch films or Twin Peaks (especially Twin Peaks), time travel, episodic gameplay, or Keanu Reeves, you should check it out.\n\nI knew this was going to be good before I played it, but I've been let down by that assumption before. This, in 4 hours, has used good as a brief introduction into holy surrealistic crap, Batman! I know Kung Fu?\n\n9.5/10 - Damn near perfect, now buy it.","July 26, 2015","true","6.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","2"

I don't mind gameplay lite games if they have an interesting, insane story along the lines of Killer 7. This game looked to be a blast from the quick time event videos in the trailers.\n\nThose action sequences are a blast, but they only make up about 5% of the game, and you've already seen the best ones in the trailer. The other 95% is dull dull DULL expository nonsense, dull dialog, and scenes that go on way too long.\n\nThere's gameplay segments where you move around to look at clues. You "move" by advancing forward or backward along waypoints a 1 dimensional line. You can mouse around at each waypoint. What's amazing is how badly they managed to mangle the controls for such a ridiculously simple movement system. It's impossible to describe how terrible the controls are, or how atrociously optimized it all is. Those smooth framerates in the trailers? Good luck ever getting that on a PC. This is the worst PC port I've ever played, and I've played Dark Souls!\n\nIn the end I quit after the first quicktime event. I just couldn't take anymore of the awful framerate, controls, and long dull cutscenes. Watch the trailer, and don't bother with the game.","April 5","false","1.2"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

Even though I don't own an Xbone, I still purchased this game for the sake of supporting it. And now that there is a version that I can actually play, I didn't think twice about it. I knew I was going to make great decision with that purchase.\n\nDeadly Preminition was famous for it's... how can I say this... "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t". The bugs, graphical errors, awkward dialoug, and that creepy smile (you know the one). Something about all of the absolutely god awful design made you want to play more, like you wanted to see how far it would go. You anticipated the garunteed laughter that would ensue. What would have normaly ruined a game, made Deadly Preminition the favorite game of most people who played it.\n\nThis is not Deadly Premition. This is SWERY at his finest. It's all cleaned up, fixed up, and still a good mix of serious drama and anime-isk comedy. Like the game doesn't realy take itself seriously, and to be honest, thats the way we all like it. This game has an amazing story, unique QTE controls that are sure to get you the first time, and is definitely a worthy successor to the PS2 game that I, and many others, loved so much.\n\nBuy this game.

You scroll and move around the screens with both sticks and the game is riddled with QTEs done right; Telltale could REALLY learn a thing or two from this game! I played it with a controller and headphones to fully enjoy the ambiance. I also played using the mouse after finishing the game and the QTEs became a bit more challenging. You save using phones in game. There’s action phases mixing up rhythm games and QTEs, there’s even a score screen after you’ve done them! Those unlock several achievements.  There are also very easy mini games, mostly limited to the secondary bonus quests.\nThere’s a LOT of stuff to collect – badges, envelopes, clothing - hidden around the scenes. They can be laid out in the open or hidden inside furniture you have to open; you’ll sometimes have to squeeze and pull the camera at weird angles to be able to grab them. All the objects you highlight with the cursor pops out several small descriptions, which can be funny or interesting. There are 78 steam achievements, yikes!\nThe game uses 3 meters: stamina, vision and health. You consume stamina with every interaction with an object or a person and refill it by eating food scattered around.  Vision highlights all the interactive things, it refills with drinks. Hits lower your health and you heal with bandages. If your energy falls to zero you faint but if you need it you can buy food from a special NPC character that follows you in all your scenes and it isn’t expensive: completing the prologue awarded me with 4.5k credits and refilling half of the energy bar costs 50 credits. Credits are also used to buy bonus stuff, like clothes or music.\nThe visuals are astounding; the graphic style is similar to comics, with lush colors and a lot of contrast.  Music and sound is also top notch. I didn’t have any tech problem whatsoever – no slowdown at all.\nThe story is amazingly told, the game constantly alternates wacky humor and dramatic tense tone. The voiceovers are all well played. Story is divided in chapters and after finishing one you get a very detailed score screen. You can replay any one you completed to try and find everything. The main game took me 10 hours.\nOnce I started the game I couldn’t put it down until the end, then I immediately replayed the chapters to search for the missing bonus stuff and to enjoy the dialogues and the characters again! It’s really the best adventure game I ever played, and I played MANY games.  This one is a pure gem and should be in everyone’s library!","May 22","true","13.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Much like that game, D4 is the kind of energetically confusing adventure that one needs to play to fully grasp exactly what it is and why it is so fun. Unlike Deadly Premonition though, where the game as a whole was “so bad it’s good,” D4 is “so good it’s good.” It’s clear that Access Games knew exactly what made it’s previous title so great, and poured it into a better constructed frame. More importantly, Access Games has created undeniable proof that more can be done with the genre as a whole, and I look forward to seeing what else they can do in future installments. There are two episodes and the prologue out for D4 currently, but more may be on the way, and what is currently there is well worth the fifteen dollar price tag. If you enjoy adventure games, then you will no doubt love D4, and if you’re not keen on those kinds of games, I still recommend you check out D4 as it really does set itself apart from anything else I’ve ever played.","July 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It certainly does not take itself seriously or limit itself to silly concepts like physical reality.  A series of unexpected and entirely bizarre things happen  over the course of the three chapters making up this game.  Unfortunately, the last chapter ends on a cliff hanger and the story remains incomplete.  It still is worth a look because something this strange deserves to be looked at.\n\nJust to say how something average in this looks like would be to describe how it starts - After a tutorial scene, you wake up in a bath tub, walk out of the bathroom and are attacked by what is either a woman who thinks she is a cat, or your cat who your entirely mad mind decides is a woman.  After fighting off the cat? a portly man arrives and tells you to use your weird power to go back in time and find some info on the guy who may know something about the guy who killed your wife.  He then drinks a bucket of clam chowder, stacks several slices of pizza together, disjoins his jaw and eats them all in three bites.\n\nAll of this is played seriously and without an eyebrow being raised by the characters.  It lends to the game's charm alongside the strange cast of characters series of bizarre events you wind up in.\n\nGameplay is nothing spectacular for an adventure game.  The gameplay is done through dialogues, item searches, quick time events, and mini games.  You have a set amount of endurance which limits the amount of things you can look at and how many times you can speak to people.  There is a highlight hotkey showing all the interactables, but you can only do that so many times before needing coffee.  There is enough food laying around so I never had any problems looking at everything in an area at least once.\n\nPuzzles are served fewer in quantity and in smaller areas than what you may see in other adventure games.  It does set the pacing and focus on one event at a time.  None of the puzzles can be considered particularly difficult, the hardest part may be finding the point on the screen where that one item your looking for is before bringing it back to the character who wants it.  Transitioning to the mini games can be jarring as you don't expect it and they have nowhere near the polish as the core game.\n\nYou get currency for doing well, searching out-of-the-way areas, accomplishing goals, doing well at a mini game.  These are then either  wasted on coffee and food so you can inspect more objects or spent on outfits for the characters you can dress them in as you go through the game.  I honestly thought this form of reward was weak and artificially encouraged replayability - when the game stands fine on its own for replayability - and also seemed like the designer wanted to reward the player but didn't quite know what to give them or do with the currency system he made up.\n\nIn all, I'd say this is different enough from most other adventure games in sheer weird value to give it a go if you enjoy adventure games in general.","January 11","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inedible/recommended/358090/","inedible","for a bad time call","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inedible/","189 products in account","There are plenty of great games that prioritize plot over gameplay, to great effect. That's clearly where this game was headed, but good storytelling needs more than quirkiness. This game looked promising, but the story was ultimately uninspired. Alternate recommendations: if you're looking for something quirky and thoughtful, go for Life is Strange. If you're looking for something quirky and funny, go for Tales from the Borderlands.\n\nThe gameplay in D4 isn't spectacular, but definitely could have held up a narrative if the story was worth telling. Most of the time, you're exploring the world in a point-and-click adventure game style. Every time you interact with something or talk to someone, your stamina drops, an mechanic reminiscent of Deadly Premonition's exhausting status management system. It's enough to discourage exploration, which seems backwards for a game about investigation. The "revelations" you get for gathering a complete set of clues are pretty bland for a detective game as well.\n\nThe other major game mechanic is in action sequences, which is nothing new for narrative games. D4 does a beautiful job of making them feel unique, though, both in the character actions that play out and in the combinations of inputs that are needed. This is pretty much where the game shines, and it just feels awesome to dodge a knife by spitting your gum at it to knock it off course. The only real downside is that it's hard to understand why you get penalized at some points. Regardless, the action sequences combined with the attractive art style of the game make it a real disappointment that the story was so subpar.\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward: ex-cop David Young doesn't remember much about his past, but has the ability to dive into certain points in the past through artifacts known as mementos. So he's going to do that a bunch to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Unfortunately, there's no rhyme or reason to any of the investigations, other than that some of the characters' names start with the letter D. No, seriously, that's the reason Young gives for his investigations. We're a full season into this game with NO connection from any of the characters to the murder of Young's wife. It makes it really difficult to take any of the drama seriously.\n\nA subpar story indeed, but perhaps the weakest part of this game were the characters. Most of them are nothing more than the tired tropes that inspired them. David Young is an ex-cop with a single-minded determination to solve a case that's gotten too personal (even though his investigation basically involves turning to the "D" page in the phonebook). Olivia, one of only 4 female characters in the game, is little more than a love interest for Young. And the effeminate character in the game is treated as repulsive and deviant (surprise surprise, coming from the people who made Deadly Premonition). Nearly everyone is antagonistic, and a few characters are just unpleasant to talk to, making the dialogue excruciating.","November 7, 2015","false","5.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

So what could possibly go wrong?\n\nProblems start right in the beginning. The main character is restricted in movement, so he can only move like a train from station A to station B by following the guidelines. It feels awkward, but this is kind of person preferences, so you might like it, I guess, in parallel universe. Plus, add to this a stamina meter, which doesn't really feel needed and make the whole process of exploring uncomfortable. Its still not so bad, so let's go next.\n\nThe main problem comes with narrative and setting. I mean, Im totally ok with all of this Japanese weirdness. When its good, when there is a quality behind it. But here you get a total cliche western detectives combined with a most typical anime overreactive agressive unhuman girl in a bunny god**** costume. Such mix of heroes might sound intriguingly, but in reality it's just bad. Not so bad thats its good, but just bad and unimaginative.\n\nBut ok, it's still possible to overcome, The thing. which made me delete this game after 1.5 hours of playing are the dialogs. First of all its a narrative game, so the good dialogs could level the balance of good and evil, Unfortunetly, they turned into the dark side. Most of them or just too boring or absurdly stupid. Combine all this stuff and you'll get a lack of motivation for completing the game, The concept is there, but its not enough to make you seek for the answers,\n\nIn the end I must say one major thing, I've played only 1.5 hours of it, so the dialogs are might be better as narrative progresses, characters might show some "non cliche" depth to them and narrative get some more progression. At very end the game have a very positive score of reviews, so thats should mean something. But for all of this possible goodness you have to overcome the problems I've mentioned before and oh boy if it's not that easy.","March 11","false","1.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, it’s hampered by several technical missteps.\nAccess Games really just wants to tell a story; but it has to be bothered with making something that can be called a game.  This causes D4 to prod you with menial tasks such as moving your mouse sideways to open a door, randomly guessing a password, or collecting magazines for your “scrapbook”.  None of this adds to the experience.  The game doesn’t know how else to keep the player engaged.  After all, it’s not a television show.\n\nProsVery unique / bizarre characters and story\nFunny\nGood art direction\nSuperb attention to detail - they bothered to draw little water-spot etchings on the sink mirror!\nOverall I think I like the story, I think…..\nConsVery clunky, imprecise, and slow controls\nArt style is good, but graphics are sloppy.  So many textures are just blurry pixelated blobs.  No AA or other post-effects.  It's on the Unreal engine so all of these features should be available.\nThe game is frame locked to 62 FPS but it can be unlocked.  See my guide How to unlock the 62 FPS cap in 2 minutes!\nThe game is short - a prologue, and two episodes.  I think at least one more episode to call this a season would be sufficient.\nThe pacing of the game is slow.  It just takes a long time for anything to really happen.\n\n","May 18","false","10.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumlepumle/recommended/358090/","dumlepumle","Dumle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumlepumle/","911 products in account","I did not like this game at all. In most ways i found it really disappointing and at its best moments i simply thought that it was ok.\n\nWhat the game does reasonable well is the few action sequences. They are fairly imaginative and quite well choreographed. I also enjoyed that you can customize the characters appearance. there were some colorful characters in the first episode and there were some nice interactions with those. The game do have some small stuff every now and then that makes the game stand out and gives it character. The visuals and the voice acting was alright as well.\n\nThe rest of the game i did not enjoy. Let start with the story. The story is all over the place. Characters do not get enough time to develop into anything, nothing gets explained, short as hell and it just ends without resolving anything or even properly kicking off the story. It is like the game ended without even finished the prologue. You can throw around terms like "season" all you want but this is just an unfinished mess that ended before it even had time to get going.\n\nAnd what is there i did not really like. Perhaps i would open up to the characters if they got some more screen time but they don't. I also want to mention the whole "it is soo weird and odd blablabla" that some people like going on about. It is just shallow nonsense, style over substance. This is of course very subjective but throwing around a bunch of cryptic nonsense and making every character talk or act weird just feels extremely forced.\n\nIt feels more random than bizarre or intriguing. I do not have a problem with this and i would be able to enjoy this if the game actually had some substance to back it up but it does not. It also does not help that the game lacks all kinds of meaningful decisions.\n\nBut what about the gameplay? Well their camera solutions is horrible. Either go full third person or go set camera angle. This middleground just does not work very well. The game also forces you to move the mouse across the screen for almost every single little trivial thing you want to do. It is just annoying.\n\nWhat more is there to say? It is a quicktime event game with a short, nonsensical and unfinished stoy with little to no meaningful story interaction. And it did not take me 5 hours to complete this game. I had it on afk for atleast an hour or two.\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 13, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I wanted to stick with it, I really did, but jesus...This game is cheesy as all hell.\n\nThe scenes are long and drawn out, the dialogue is bland at best, relying on the accents to carry the character (which are also awkward as hell) and I was not in the slightest bit intrigued or drawn into the plot.\n\nThe transition from each scene looked like it could have been interesting, but the exposition was so drawn out with a soundtrack from something I'd expect on the Lifetime channel.    The one action sequence I saw was amusing but not enough for me to endure the rest of the problems.  It felt like an anime for 10 year olds thats trying too hard without offering any substance.\n\nFirst game I ever wanted to get a refund for on Steam.

The storyline is quirky and unstable, not explaining anything logically but instead relying on the fact that your character can now 'time travel'. Its very short, at the very most 5 hours of total 'gameplay' that leaves you with an idiotic To Be Continued screen. If you want to experience the game, just go to youtube and search it. It isn't worth the $15 it demands, and I sincerely hope that the dev's aren't going to be money grabs and make you pay $15 more dollars for Season 2 that includes 1 chapter and three hour long intros/cutscenes. This series isn't worth the trouble, and at this rate it'll be at the very least another year before the next two chapters arrive for $29.99.","July 17, 2015","false","5.4"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

I never in my lfe saw such a restricted monorail cinematic adventure gameplay. You cant move freely in this game, you only move between hotspots (each 5-10 meters) and rotate in 4 directions, this feels almost like turn-based board game.  After this game, corridor shooters with invisible walls everywhere feels like open world games. And its really a shame that after open world almost simulator kind of experience in Deadly Premonition this is such a dumbed down game...\n\nWow and i thought that recent Telltale games like Walking Dead 2 with lot of talking and cutscenes and minimum of exploration and puzzles was restrictive, and thought that Dreamfall Chapters had nothing but borring walking and talking and Quantic Dreams games had nothing but QTE... man, after D4 all of these games feels like relief with endless freedom.\n\nSeriosly, i love Swery games, but this one has really bad game design, worse than 1 button games from smarphones, it really needs patch for pc version with game design overhaul, that will allow unrestricted movement in entire area and free rotation in every direction.\n\nOh, and a PC port is not as terrible as DP was, but has bad things such as limited predefined list of resolutions that barely goes beyond 1280x720, has unskipable launcher that does not have gamepad controls (which makes full controller support a false, since it means that everything in game can be done with gamepad only, which is not, you have to use mouse every time you start the game), it lacking any form of AA and other advanced  graphics settings, it has glitchy mirrors, and controls on gamepad and mouse are total disaster.\n\nWill get refund now, and maybe i will buy this game again if will patched to allow moving and rotating freely in area. but now i cant stand this hotspot movement, its really frustrating and dissapointing.\n\nC'mon Swery, get back to open worlds amd realistic lfe simulation expirience with total freedom! Make this game open for exploration! Just look at LIFE IS STANGE to see how it needs to be done!\n\nP.S. - Another thing that annoys me in every swery game, are immersion breaking floating medal everywhere in game world and score based griding, this feels so arcadish and so unrealistic when medals float in world near everything. And the UI cluttering is always i problem in his games, i once solved this problem with my Immersive Premonition game, but this Unreal Engine 3 title is not that mod friendly and its harder to solve UI issues here, nearly impossible without full unrealed.","June 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 10 of 48 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","10","48","0","0"

Though it seems that has quite a cult following, so I can only assume the same chumps have picked this up with favorable reviews.\n\n\nThis time, it's not dreadful technical flaws and ghastly gameplay that plagues this game. Don't get me wrong, this still looks pretty ugly, even if at first the screenshots look minimalistically stylish. And the gameplay is essentially a clutter of QTEs, with awkward mouse movement. That's a reprieve to doing almost anything in DP, but still an annoying excuse to pass the plot, which is just absurd.\n\nYes, the problem is the story is so far north of surreal and downright nonsensical. Anyone remotely wanting to gain a general adventure, visual novel experience will be left sore as any rules regarding plot physics are constantly broken. The plot runs on ridiculous coincidences, bizarre characters within a somewhat attempted real world, and baffling surreal metaphorical sequences.\n\nIt's as if a Mulholland Drive era David Lynch and a bunch of mediocre devs decided to cough up a video game.","June 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 20 of 139 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","20","139","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_pigdestroyer_/recommended/358090/","_pigdestroyer_","Piggy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_pigdestroyer_/","510 products in account","Definetely a special one this game. Want a game with unique art, a throwback to the Shenmue 'action' scenes, a hilariously bizar story, a great soundtrack and just an all around good vibe? This might just be the game for you.\n\nStory:\nI don't want to spoil the story too much so I'll keep it short. The story is about David Young and his dead wife, Little Penny. You step into David's shoes to go back into the past, to find out who is responsible for his wife's death with only 'Look for D' and his memento powers which allow him to go back in the past as help. You encounter amazing characters and it just gives an all around good feeling at what pace it has.\nThe bad part is though.... will there be an episode three? Will there be a season two? Episode two ended on a huge cliffhanger which just demands for more episodes / seasons.\n\nGraphics:\nLook at the trailers and pictures. This game has an amazing graphical style which adds so much to the game. You want to discover every single detail and the moment the 'action' scenes are going on it's almost a pitty you have to go through them at a decend pace. You don't want it to stop, you want more, more, more,.... That this game is a work of passion is most easily noticed by the art. Kudos to the artists!\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of D4:DD is pretty simple, there's the dedective part and there's the 'action' part. The dedective part is straight forward and you're never clueless thanks to the Vision skill you can activate at pretty much every time showing you what you can interact with and where the next pieces of the puzzle are. So pretty straight forward point-and-click. The 'action' scenes are pretty much quick time events. You can use both a controller or a mouse to play the game, I tested both and I preferred the mouse. While they're not hard to complete and not much to it comes to 'gameplay', these scenes are bizare, hilarious and somehow this makes the 'drag from left to the right' events pretty damn fun no mater how simple.\n\nOveral:\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ AMAZING art, absolutely breathtaking at times\n+ Hilarious and bizare story\n+ Brilliant character design\n\n- (so far) short story and it ended on a huge cliffhanger\n- Simple gameplay, while this isn't an action game, you just sit around looking at scenes a bit too much\n\nSo far I'd say if this is what you are looking for, and you immediately fell in love with the art and humor in this game from the trailer, it is worth its price and you will have a great time. If you're looking for lots of action, the art style isn't your thing, ... don't bother really. Overall, allthough this will definetely be higher if / when new episodes or seasons get released, I will rate this game:\n\n7.5/10","August 16, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the primetime American TV roots, to the just absolutely absurd characters that Swery just cannot resist but to playfully bring to life in his games, Dark Dreams Don't Die excudes a confidence and surrealist charm usually reserved for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton movies.\n\nThe elements of this game prove work well in its favour to make the whole experience interesting and enjoyable. The characters are loveably strange, there's a bunch of funky customization options, the story is so bizarre and artistic that it can't help but to also be genuinely funny, and this game gets point and click and quick time events right.\n\nSadly, this game is an episodic title, and Access Games being a fairly indie developer we might not see more of D4 anytime soon, but I will gladly proclaim that this game is worth the price of admission and deserves all the love it can get. Even if this ends up being a one-off, you won't walk away without enjoying this game in some respect.","August 16, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/358090/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","It's a shame this game's future depends on sales.  I would, at this point, rather that SWERY try crowdfunding for the rest of the episodes and see if he can make due on that.\n\nIt's also a shame that the ridiculous DLC listed on the store page is likely to turn some people away before they even look at the game.  All of the DLC is pointless, so the game very much stands on its own.\n\nSo what is D4?  In short, it is an adventure game in the classic sense.  You point, you click, you solve puzzles... sort of.  Fact of the matter is, it's by SWERY, the gonzo game maker who brought you the wonderfully bizarre Deadly Premonition.  Haven't played that one?  No worries.  He also made Spy Fiction... oh, you haven't played that one, either?  Well, nobody did, so you're not alone.  The point is - it's weird.  Purposefully so.\n\nLike Deadly Premonition, however, the key to all SWERY games are its characters.  As bizarre and twisted as the world is, the characters remain strangely compelling despite their completely bonkers behavior and that is key for holding anyone's interest in an adventure game.  First, the hero is a Boston native and the accent is... well, mostly passable... but moreover, he's an ex-cop-turned-PI with a murdered wife and he can travel through time... or can he?  Then there's the pet cat, who is also a slim blonde woman in a onesy, who is also a shop.  No, I'm not kidding.  And then there's his buddy - the actual cop - who can eat four hotdogs at the same time without chewing, has a bum leg, and hangs out at your place all day because the alternative is going home to his New Yorker wife to argue about sports.  And that's just inside the house.  You have no idea what awaits you once you leave it.\n\nTrying to describe the game is like trying to describe Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  There's a certain charm to the way it presents itself.  At once it is both familiar and completely outlandish.  The mechanics are adapted from the Kinect, so most of your interaction will be clicking on hotspots and waving/swiping your mouse across your desk when the action sequences come along.  But the meat of the game - hero, David Young is a PI - is investigation.  That ultimately means, like in proper adventure games, going up to people and interrogating them.  For some thematic flavor, the game encourages you to choose the responses that best sync up with what David would actually say vs. what you might say.  It's a neat touch.  But what's outlandish is everything surrounding the mechanics.  From presentation, to the music, to the wacky cast, D4 just goes out of its way to be weird in a charming way.\n\nGranted, this game isn't for everyone - if you gave Deadly Premonition a go and didn't like it, you're not going to find this your cuppa, either.  If you didn't... well, I might just recommend it over this if only because D4 is an incomplete experience.  If you want things to fall into place neatly and knots totally tied and unloose... move along.  Season One comprises a prologue and two episodes - if you're thorough, there's a lot of content, but a lot of it is admittedly meaningless.  The determined adventurer could blast through the entire thing in a couple of hours and be no worse off than those of us who decided to catch clovers or answer ridiculous quizzes about the FAA.  More importantly, you won't be satisfied with where it ends; it's intended to go on, but there's no guarantee that it will.\n\nSo I'll say yes, this game is great and it's a lot of fun just to unravel the weirdness; in SWERY's previous effort, all the weirdness came to a satisfying conclusion and there's no reason to think that D4 won't follow the same steps... unless, of course, they never make the next season.  Here's the catch - if nobody buys this and waits for more seasons, it's not going to happen.  At the same time, it's so hard to recommend something that is clearly going to leave you wanting to know more, and knowing that there is a very real possibility that there will never be a Season Two, my heart already breaks.\n\nTherefore, get this game.  Show SWERY you want to see more of it because I guarantee you that you won't be alone.","August 17, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sort of like a primetime crime show as written by Japan, which plays out like a Telltale Game. Characters are quirky and memorable, especially since everyone talks like an alien who is trying their hardest to pass for a human. The QTEs are actually satisfying (less God of War, more Asura's Wrath), the plot is fairly interesting, and the hook to find the killer named D is extremely engrossing.\n\nThe stipulation is that this is only Season One. Liking this game means knowing that this story's ability to be resolved lies in it's ability to find a new publishing team, because D4 was not a commercial success. If you're OK with buying a game that's short but extremely sweet, and maybe never seeing the end of it's story, buy D4, because even in it's current state, it's incredible.","November 1, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/358090/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","It's a shame this game's future depends on sales.  I would, at this point, rather that SWERY try crowdfunding for the rest of the episodes and see if he can make due on that.\n\nIt's also a shame that the ridiculous DLC listed on the store page is likely to turn some people away before they even look at the game.  All of the DLC is pointless, so the game very much stands on its own.\n\nSo what is D4?  In short, it is an adventure game in the classic sense.  You point, you click, you solve puzzles... sort of.  Fact of the matter is, it's by SWERY, the gonzo game maker who brought you the wonderfully bizarre Deadly Premonition.  Haven't played that one?  No worries.  He also made Spy Fiction... oh, you haven't played that one, either?  Well, nobody did, so you're not alone.  The point is - it's weird.  Purposefully so.\n\nLike Deadly Premonition, however, the key to all SWERY games are its characters.  As bizarre and twisted as the world is, the characters remain strangely compelling despite their completely bonkers behavior and that is key for holding anyone's interest in an adventure game.  First, the hero is a Boston native and the accent is... well, mostly passable... but moreover, he's an ex-cop-turned-PI with a murdered wife and he can travel through time... or can he?  Then there's the pet cat, who is also a slim blonde woman in a onesy, who is also a shop.  No, I'm not kidding.  And then there's his buddy - the actual cop - who can eat four hotdogs at the same time without chewing, has a bum leg, and hangs out at your place all day because the alternative is going home to his New Yorker wife to argue about sports.  And that's just inside the house.  You have no idea what awaits you once you leave it.\n\nTrying to describe the game is like trying to describe Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  There's a certain charm to the way it presents itself.  At once it is both familiar and completely outlandish.  The mechanics are adapted from the Kinect, so most of your interaction will be clicking on hotspots and waving/swiping your mouse across your desk when the action sequences come along.  But the meat of the game - hero, David Young is a PI - is investigation.  That ultimately means, like in proper adventure games, going up to people and interrogating them.  For some thematic flavor, the game encourages you to choose the responses that best sync up with what David would actually say vs. what you might say.  It's a neat touch.  But what's outlandish is everything surrounding the mechanics.  From presentation, to the music, to the wacky cast, D4 just goes out of its way to be weird in a charming way.\n\nGranted, this game isn't for everyone - if you gave Deadly Premonition a go and didn't like it, you're not going to find this your cuppa, either.  If you didn't... well, I might just recommend it over this if only because D4 is an incomplete experience.  If you want things to fall into place neatly and knots totally tied and unloose... move along.  Season One comprises a prologue and two episodes - if you're thorough, there's a lot of content, but a lot of it is admittedly meaningless.  The determined adventurer could blast through the entire thing in a couple of hours and be no worse off than those of us who decided to catch clovers or answer ridiculous quizzes about the FAA.  More importantly, you won't be satisfied with where it ends; it's intended to go on, but there's no guarantee that it will.\n\nSo I'll say yes, this game is great and it's a lot of fun just to unravel the weirdness; in SWERY's previous effort, all the weirdness came to a satisfying conclusion and there's no reason to think that D4 won't follow the same steps... unless, of course, they never make the next season.  Here's the catch - if nobody buys this and waits for more seasons, it's not going to happen.  At the same time, it's so hard to recommend something that is clearly going to leave you wanting to know more, and knowing that there is a very real possibility that there will never be a Season Two, my heart already breaks.\n\nTherefore, get this game.  Show SWERY you want to see more of it because I guarantee you that you won't be alone.","August 17, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interface is point and click with various action sequences mixed in each of the 2 episodes.

From the primetime American TV roots, to the just absolutely absurd characters that Swery just cannot resist but to playfully bring to life in his games, Dark Dreams Don't Die excudes a confidence and surrealist charm usually reserved for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton movies.\n\nThe elements of this game prove work well in its favour to make the whole experience interesting and enjoyable. The characters are loveably strange, there's a bunch of funky customization options, the story is so bizarre and artistic that it can't help but to also be genuinely funny, and this game gets point and click and quick time events right.\n\nSadly, this game is an episodic title, and Access Games being a fairly indie developer we might not see more of D4 anytime soon, but I will gladly proclaim that this game is worth the price of admission and deserves all the love it can get. Even if this ends up being a one-off, you won't walk away without enjoying this game in some respect.","August 16, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would, at this point, rather that SWERY try crowdfunding for the rest of the episodes and see if he can make due on that.\n\nIt's also a shame that the ridiculous DLC listed on the store page is likely to turn some people away before they even look at the game.  All of the DLC is pointless, so the game very much stands on its own.\n\nSo what is D4?  In short, it is an adventure game in the classic sense.  You point, you click, you solve puzzles... sort of.  Fact of the matter is, it's by SWERY, the gonzo game maker who brought you the wonderfully bizarre Deadly Premonition.  Haven't played that one?  No worries.  He also made Spy Fiction... oh, you haven't played that one, either?  Well, nobody did, so you're not alone.  The point is - it's weird.  Purposefully so.\n\nLike Deadly Premonition, however, the key to all SWERY games are its characters.  As bizarre and twisted as the world is, the characters remain strangely compelling despite their completely bonkers behavior and that is key for holding anyone's interest in an adventure game.  First, the hero is a Boston native and the accent is... well, mostly passable... but moreover, he's an ex-cop-turned-PI with a murdered wife and he can travel through time... or can he?  Then there's the pet cat, who is also a slim blonde woman in a onesy, who is also a shop.  No, I'm not kidding.  And then there's his buddy - the actual cop - who can eat four hotdogs at the same time without chewing, has a bum leg, and hangs out at your place all day because the alternative is going home to his New Yorker wife to argue about sports.  And that's just inside the house.  You have no idea what awaits you once you leave it.\n\nTrying to describe the game is like trying to describe Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  There's a certain charm to the way it presents itself.  At once it is both familiar and completely outlandish.  The mechanics are adapted from the Kinect, so most of your interaction will be clicking on hotspots and waving/swiping your mouse across your desk when the action sequences come along.  But the meat of the game - hero, David Young is a PI - is investigation.  That ultimately means, like in proper adventure games, going up to people and interrogating them.  For some thematic flavor, the game encourages you to choose the responses that best sync up with what David would actually say vs. what you might say.  It's a neat touch.  But what's outlandish is everything surrounding the mechanics.  From presentation, to the music, to the wacky cast, D4 just goes out of its way to be weird in a charming way.\n\nGranted, this game isn't for everyone - if you gave Deadly Premonition a go and didn't like it, you're not going to find this your cuppa, either.  If you didn't... well, I might just recommend it over this if only because D4 is an incomplete experience.  If you want things to fall into place neatly and knots totally tied and unloose... move along.  Season One comprises a prologue and two episodes - if you're thorough, there's a lot of content, but a lot of it is admittedly meaningless.  The determined adventurer could blast through the entire thing in a couple of hours and be no worse off than those of us who decided to catch clovers or answer ridiculous quizzes about the FAA.  More importantly, you won't be satisfied with where it ends; it's intended to go on, but there's no guarantee that it will.\n\nSo I'll say yes, this game is great and it's a lot of fun just to unravel the weirdness; in SWERY's previous effort, all the weirdness came to a satisfying conclusion and there's no reason to think that D4 won't follow the same steps... unless, of course, they never make the next season.  Here's the catch - if nobody buys this and waits for more seasons, it's not going to happen.  At the same time, it's so hard to recommend something that is clearly going to leave you wanting to know more, and knowing that there is a very real possibility that there will never be a Season Two, my heart already breaks.\n\nTherefore, get this game.  Show SWERY you want to see more of it because I guarantee you that you won't be alone.","August 17, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_pigdestroyer_/recommended/358090/","_pigdestroyer_","Piggy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_pigdestroyer_/","510 products in account","Definetely a special one this game. Want a game with unique art, a throwback to the Shenmue 'action' scenes, a hilariously bizar story, a great soundtrack and just an all around good vibe? This might just be the game for you.\n\nStory:\nI don't want to spoil the story too much so I'll keep it short. The story is about David Young and his dead wife, Little Penny. You step into David's shoes to go back into the past, to find out who is responsible for his wife's death with only 'Look for D' and his memento powers which allow him to go back in the past as help. You encounter amazing characters and it just gives an all around good feeling at what pace it has.\nThe bad part is though.... will there be an episode three? Will there be a season two? Episode two ended on a huge cliffhanger which just demands for more episodes / seasons.\n\nGraphics:\nLook at the trailers and pictures. This game has an amazing graphical style which adds so much to the game. You want to discover every single detail and the moment the 'action' scenes are going on it's almost a pitty you have to go through them at a decend pace. You don't want it to stop, you want more, more, more,.... That this game is a work of passion is most easily noticed by the art. Kudos to the artists!\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of D4:DD is pretty simple, there's the dedective part and there's the 'action' part. The dedective part is straight forward and you're never clueless thanks to the Vision skill you can activate at pretty much every time showing you what you can interact with and where the next pieces of the puzzle are. So pretty straight forward point-and-click. The 'action' scenes are pretty much quick time events. You can use both a controller or a mouse to play the game, I tested both and I preferred the mouse. While they're not hard to complete and not much to it comes to 'gameplay', these scenes are bizare, hilarious and somehow this makes the 'drag from left to the right' events pretty damn fun no mater how simple.\n\nOveral:\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ AMAZING art, absolutely breathtaking at times\n+ Hilarious and bizare story\n+ Brilliant character design\n\n- (so far) short story and it ended on a huge cliffhanger\n- Simple gameplay, while this isn't an action game, you just sit around looking at scenes a bit too much\n\nSo far I'd say if this is what you are looking for, and you immediately fell in love with the art and humor in this game from the trailer, it is worth its price and you will have a great time. If you're looking for lots of action, the art style isn't your thing, ... don't bother really. Overall, allthough this will definetely be higher if / when new episodes or seasons get released, I will rate this game:\n\n7.5/10","August 16, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It works great on PC and XBO.\n- Frame rate not locked ;)\n- The phase and the clues from the plot keeps you interested. Some are not expected for such short duration. That was nice.\n- Mini games, collectibles, outfits, amazing BGM selection again all because of Suehiro San.\n- If you liked the little details and item descriptions from games like Shenmue (+QTE) or L.A. Noire (beign veeery different kids of games). If you like silly humor as mentioned like in the past Swery did with Deadly Premonition...this is a good game.\n- Many references to western culture and also Japanese culture even references to movies and series (yes, once again haha!).\n- The adaption to mice is good, confortable. Maybe with Kinect it was a very different experience I'm curious... (don't ever EVER use a joystick).\n- You like cliffhangers? You like unanswered questions? weeeell!!... ;) AVAAAAAAANT-GAAAAARDEEEE!!\n\nCons:- It looks great but the anti-aliasing could be better for PC. A lot better!\n- This is a game / interactive experience. So if you're not a fan of this "genre" think twice.\n- Can be a bit short for it's price.

D4 is filled with joyously insane characters and situations and like Deadly Premonition is one of those games you simply have to show someone else (just to verify that you didn't dream it happening). If Deadly Premonition was a mad scientist vision hiding inside a largely broken game then D4 is a great step in the right direction. It's largely playable for one thing and simple gameplay mechanics hid a surprisingly complexity that at times equals or even surpasses Telltale's best work.\n\nSadly, despite being a so-called "first season" D4 doesn't even come close to providing anything close to resolution to it's numerous plot threads. This is like if the first season of a TV show amounts to a couple of episodes because a network realised it's creator was insane, so they cancelled it part way through. Given that much of what made Deadly Premonition such a special game was it's surprisingly masterful conclusion, it's a shame that D4 will probably never recieve an ending.\n\nAlso, while the prologue humously sets up it's main characters, and episode one is an inventive and insane time travel adventure on board a plane, episode two sadly lacks much in the way of memorable situations or characters and despite a rushed and bonkers ending, largely leaves D4 on a bit of a downer note.\n\nStill, true gamer auteur's like Swery should be encouraged with your money! The modest asking price is well worth the joy of playing a truly unique gaming experience.\n\nSo if you're looking for an inventive and completely insane point and click drug trip through the mind of a mad genius of gaming, you should totally buy D4! 8/10\n","January 25","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to go into too much detail to avoid spoilers, but it's basically about a detective solving a mistery with time travel involded (though be warned by the big - Season One - in the title, the game is episodic and it ends with a  ♥♥♥♥ing cliffhanger ) and it's  really good	 . It has both comedic and dramatic moments but it seems to mostly be going in a very bizarre and random direction which I would not know how to define well except that is amazingly entertaining in an over the top and trashy way.\n\nOne last thing: Even though I really enjoyed this I think the full price (15€) is a bit too high, especially considering how short the game is, I advice to wait for a discount.","January 25","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full of quirkiness and stuff to find. A strange plotline that reaches a 'oh god why did it have to stop THERE of all places' climax, featuring time travel, catgirls, OCD, Mexican drug lords, clam chowder, and a strange doctor with a knife and fork whoooooo sppeeeeeaaaakks veeeeerrrrryyyyyy sloooooooowwwwllllyyyy. Enjoyable characters and some great dialog, as well as an interesting graphical style and a bizarre take on sidequests. Never a dull moment or place you'll get stuck forever, and actually fun quicktime events that require a lot more than buttonmashing, which keeps them interesting. Great soundtrack too.\n\nI found myself getting so into it but it ended - though there's a bunch of stuff I didn't find I need to save for a replay sometime.  Totally worth trying, but moreso if there actually will be a Season Two. This deserves finishing!\nps. Look for D.","January 20","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/358090/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Essentially a point & click game for you to have fun watching that's loaded with QTEs.\nThe graphics options are limited to only the resolution (which are incredibly limited in options as well), window mode, vsync, and dynamic shadows.\n\nControl is very limited to the QTEs themselves during cutscenes and outside of cutscenes it's just clicking to designated marks to move around. You can play with a controller or a mouse but I found the mouse to just be crazy faster with most everything here.\n\nIt's incredibly short especially since all you get is a prologue and two episodes which are the entire first season. It's got very little replayability and far less so since the story is linear despite having some different dialogue options. The different dialogue options are there just so you can "synch up" with the character, like choosing the right thing he'd say in the situation only it doesn't matter because the story just goes one way and it doesn't really change anything practical.\nIf you want to replay a scene you have to go through an entire episode from the start. If you're replaying an episode from the "Replay Episode" menu then only your "collection" progress is saved and not your actual progress in that particular episode, meaning that if you were to leave the current game you'd have to start it over.\n\nThe cel-shading doesn't look entirely great here and I don't know if that's just because something was off with this port. The outlines for the characters up close look like they were badly rendered out of something so it comes out all jagged looking.\n\nI don't know for sure what to say about the story for sure on whether or not it's good or bad (at the very least the concept and how it goes about is interesting I thought) but its charm sold it to me with its sometimes cheesy dialogue and the characters having character with some more unique & overzealous than others.","January 20","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like it's "you don't understand me, dad, and you never will" given form, and it works beautifully.  It ends up feeling like something you'd watch late at night, while everyone else is asleep, on channels further up the cable list than your mom would normally let you watch.  I've seen other reviews mention Twin Peaks, and there's definitely a touch of that oddness (though not so much of the darkness) present here.\n\nD4 is billed as "Season One," but from what I could find, there is no indication that a Season Two in production.  This may sound like it makes the story feel half-finished, but the end of the season fits so well in relation to the rest of the game that it may be a deliberate choice and a second season may never have been planned to start with.\n\nThe gameplay relies heavily on QTE, which is often a reason to gripe about a game but, again, in this case it works.  The action sequences allow for a reliable pacing through QTE, allowing the humour within to shine through.\n\nAll-in-all, this isn't a serious game, but it is great fun.","April 17","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
