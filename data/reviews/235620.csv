Rather than keep trying to patch it, I'm just going to add my latest thoughts up here.\n\nThey've been very good about fixing issues quickly, and in particular the fact that it no longer pauses or resets when it loses focus is a massive improvement. There are some lingering issues related to the game's touch-interface-heritage (e.g. the requirement to drag tokens around, rather than being able to just click on a spot), but overall I'm much more satisfied with it now.\n\nTo be honest, I still don't heartily endorse it at the current quality and price (especially considering the price of DLC), but the steam rating system requires a thumbs up or a thumbs down and I think it narrowly makes the cut. Hypothetically, it should only get better from here.\n\nI also should mention that at the moment, my review says 164 of 197 people (83%) found this review helpful. Those ratings were from before these updates, when I was giving the game a thumbs down, and that negative review. Hopefully my review is still helpful, but I don't want those people to feel like I hijacked their endorsements or something.\n\n------ Mostly-original review below ------\n\nBoard games are my thing. I have almost 500 board games, and Small World is one of my favorites. I even kicked in for the collector's edition in the kickstarter that brought Small World 2.\n\nAnd... I can't recommend this. Besides being overpriced (the Android version is $10; no idea what DLC costs for Android), it's really poorly designed for PC.\n\nDoing everything requires dragging tokens from one place to another, which would be fine on a touch display but is a huge hassle with a mouse.\n\nThe game pauses if it ever loses focus, which means you can't browse the web and such during the computer's turn. Also, if you're playing an online game, and you leave the window's focus, even if it's played every other player's turn for you and it's your turn now, the game rewinds and plays back every turn again. What the hell?!\n\nUPDATE: Quick play is now working, although the sub-minute estimates are quite optimistic. Took me a couple minutes to find a game. I'd previously written that only quick play wasn't working at all (and it wasn't, at the time).\n\nThere's support for a friends list, but it uses Days of Wonders' servers to manage your friends. There's no way of seeing your steam friends, as far as I can tell, which is particularly baffling since it already goes out of its way to tie your steam account to a Days of Wonder account.\n\nThat said, the quick play issues is the only real 'bug' I've encountered in the hour or so I've had it. All the other problems I have with it are design issues. Technically, it runs well. There's no full screen option, but the window resizes smoothly to whatever size you want (including maximizing).\n\nI'm enjoying it, but I've already sunk the money for it. I don't recommend purchasing it until at the very least the online issues are ironed out, and ideally some more thought is put into how the game should work on PC differently from tablets.\n\nUPDATE: Match making for online quick play is working now","December 11, 2013","true","15.4"," 276 of 333 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","276","333","0","11"

The game is arguably easier to play than its tabletop incarnation because it prevents players from making invalid moves and sometimes indicates possible moves. It also makes it easier for players to keep track of numbers like turns and quantities of troops. The game also captures the aesthetic of Small World very well, and actions are played out rather pleasantly. However, the game crashes or bugs-out frequently. The game is locked at one specific resolution, which cannot be changed (except by maximizing the window, which may sometimes result in letterboxing). There are no settings options whatsoever, aside from game volume and music volume. And finding a game online is horrendous because creating and joining games is tedious, and that's if there's even anyone online to play with (which there more often than not, is not). Many of the UI elements can be confusing, especially since the tooltips (when functional) aren't always informative. Parts of the UI, particularly text, will even change the game's cursor to the system or text cursor, making the entire game feel cheap and poorly made. One would expect many of these issues to be solved, or at least addressed, shortly after the game's release, but since at the time I'm typing this the game has been released for over a year, I believe that it's safe to say that these issues will not be addressed any time soon, if at all. The entire game feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ money grab, and despite the genuine entertainment it may provide, albeit in small amounts, I cannot recommend this game while these issues continue to exist.","December 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 168 of 197 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","168","197","0","0"

However it's quite expensive for what you get, only took half a year to make and the DLC option is an insult to any other passionate developer that works his ♥♥♥ off to go that extra mile who truely deserves it. Back in my day DLC was called an expansion pack and it was worth every penny. Here we have a set of simple and over priced DLC packs on day 1, something alreay made & a number of fans could poop out in an afternoon if they spent that time to support mods. OK, It's understandable that a company seeks to maximize profits but this developer goes a little too far with asking consumers to purchase an aditional andriod version even after they have brought the PC one. Not sure if that also requires purchasing the DLC twice but its deserves critisim because the combined price tage is approaching a tripple A title.\n\nAs for the quality of the game itself, there are a few bugs with it. The race descriptions don't always render properly, it appears to use flash/html pages for that and suffer from a font issue on my machine. I also caused the game to freeze when attempting to read the rules as the bots were taking their turn. There are limited graphical options for resolution & sound. All said and done, its entertaining for an hour or so but for that price I think you can find something else that will keep you going for far longer.\n\n*update* Some parts of the game looks nice, but the quality of developement feels rushed in how it responds, the screen doesn't scale well in places. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203025847\n\nThe application must also be active at all times to play multiplayer otherwise you get a re authorization message followed by the turn replaying itself from start which means no browsing on your 2nd monitor to pass the time and even reading the in game rules causes this issue to occur. I like the game but the quality could be better.","December 11, 2013","false","66.3"," 204 of 272 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","204","272","0","2"

If you cuss, it not only censors you, but even goes so far as to presume to mute you (even if you are just playing with people you know, who couldn't care less if you cuss or not). So, congratulations, now you can't type anything to your friends at all.\nAccidentally clicking the "redeploy" button automatically ends your turn. No take-backsies. Given that the arrows to skip forward to your turn are positioned in the same place as said redeployment button, it is very easy to accidentally click it.\nSimilarly, if you accidentally drop your tokens on a space (or change your mind about where you want to deploy your troops), too bad.\nThere is no way to change your mind about your turn, even before clicking to end your turn (which is totally ridiculous given that it is a turn-based game. No one can make any moves until you click your "done" button to indicate that you are finished with your turn, so what does it hurt to let you change your mind about what you are going to do during your turn?)\nOther problems with the game:\nIt crashes out frequently.\nGame options are embarrassingly sparse. You get sound volume, music volume, and some minor profile edits. That's it.\nTooltips take several seconds of hovering to show up and are uselessly vague.\nAs I understand it, this was a cellphone game that was ported to the pc, which could explain why it is so restricted.\nYou have to set up an account online to play it, which is an annoyance.\n\nMy conclusion:\nNot even worth $2","June 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","48","80","4","0"

This is a pretty faithful digital version. My son digitally crushed me twice in a row last night, and it took less time than it would have to play one game with the physical board game. We were pleased that it clarified a couple of rules that were not clear (to us) previously. The art is in keeping with Small World art, although the graphics don't scale well when maximized on a wide screen. Touch functionality is awesome, and using a mouse is not nearly as bad as some other reviewers have suggested. The AI is not 100% there: I've had AI opponents walk all over me, but I've also had an AI opponent play an entire game with their first-turn pick of Hordes of Amazons... Online play, Solo, and Pass 'n' Play all worked like a charm. I've had it crash out of the game twice during solo play, but I expect that will get ironed out in the near future. Overall, I believe it's worth the price for the base game and the DLC.

Simply put a Small World 2 is a huge land grab that requires a decent amount of thought and strategy. It also has a great tutorial for beginners and multiple game modes. (Solo, Pass’nplay, Local game, and online arena) Along with multiple game modes, it allows for 2-5 player in most game modes. Small World 2 also has three dlc that add different and cool races/combos. Small World 2 is very fun, but the only thing that really bothers me about this game is that it is very obvious that the game is made for mobile devices. This is not a huge issue, but this is very obvious and I thought it should be said.\nPros\nFun gameplay\nAddictive\nRequires some strategy to win\nGreat AI opponents\nSkipable AI turns\nPlenty of Race/combos\nOnline gameplay\nLocal Co-op\n\n\n\nCons\nMade for tablet/phone (Pass and play mode)\nNo full screen mode\nSome overpowered combos\n\nConclusion\nSmall World 2 is a great game that is fun to play with friends and even the AIs. The dlcs adds diversity to the race/combo selection. With all the different game modes and different races/combos to play with/against, I highly recommend Small World 2 to anyone that wants to have fun with friends or just by themselves.

I've watched let's play on youtube and Wil Wheaton's Table Top review of it, and it looked like a lot of fun.  Thing is, I haven't had time to play this with others yet, and I wanted to really Learn the game first, so I've been playing only solo matches against the AI so far.  I expect when I finally start playing with others, I may like the game even more.\n\nBasically this is a conquest board game for 2 to 5 players, any of which may be live opponents or AI.   A typical match shouldn't take even as much as a half hour and that's With the full complement of players.  The game rules and procedure resemble Risk somewhat, though in a fantasy setting rather than the real world.  It's all about conquering the world, though with a twist;  your 'army' only has a short lifespan and will inevitably be replaced by another army that you also control.  The goal is to build up gold units that you earn primarily at the end of your turn for holding territory, but also through special abilities your armies might have.  The armies are very diverse and represent fantasy races, from hobbits to skeletons, giants, and dwarves.  You get to pick which race you want to make 'active' but their abilities are randomized each game.\n\nStrong replayability is built right in as no two games will ever play alike.  The graphics are decent, though the game map/board is a little 'busy' with all of the counters, symbols, borders, and artwork vying for space and That can make things a little confusing at times.  The music is fun and matches the light hearted tone set by the art style.\n\nI don't have any major complaints, though I'm not fond of the nickle and dime aspect of the DLC.  It'd be nice if the developers had just bundled the dlcs rather than parcelled them out as they did, but I'm guessing it had something to do with rewards for the kickstarter investors.\n\nTL:DR?  Bottom line, if you like board games that involve a good portion of luck, you should enjoy this.

Also I didn’t notice any freezes, long loading times or waiting endlessly for any online opponents.\n\nPros:\n+ High replayability (different races and special powers);\n+ Dynamic, colorful, with many negative interactions;\n+ Working smoothly.\n\n\nCons:\n- Paradoxically to pros: many negative interactions (not for persons who doesn’t like competitive games);\n- Even if you really, really like your little friends… sooner or later they have to die;\n- Pretty map but hard to look at, the eyes get tired, because of too much chaos on the board.\n\nGoing to the last verdict: as for the visuals, audio and the game mechanics, Days of Wonder give us a fully satisfying product… but I still prefer the shared hours spent with friends at the game board.\n\nSee full review on my blog:\nhttp://iplaywithgreen.pl/2015/10/07/recenzja-aplikacji-1-small-world-2/","October 7, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After picking it up earlier this year, I can defintely say it was worth the wait. As far as electronic versions of board games go, this one plays quickly and intuitively, and you can run through games against the computer AI fairly quickly. Given the drag and drop controls, I do wish I had purchased it on iOS instead, but I enjoy it enough that I wouldn't mind owning both version. Unfortunately the online community is not terribly strong and it can be difficult to get a multiplayer game going, though I've found that creating a game and waiting usually results in a game within five minutes or so. The AI is actually quite good and presents a decent challenge if you are willing to play by yourself, although they can become exploitable at times. I see it on sale for $2, which is a decent enough price, though I feel the DLC is necessary to fill out the game and that will run you $8 total while on sale, which isn't as slick though probably still worth it. My hours are a little misleading because I've left it open before but I've easily gotten 12-15 hours out of this game-maybe more-and find myself going back when nothing else sounds tempting to play.","June 13, 2015","true","57.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The AI isn't too bad and often provides a good challenge, which is impressive given the number of different races and special powers they can be combined with. The online and local multiplayer options are truly superb. The game isn't without some bugs however, the android version often crashes but works ok when rebooted and the final scores occasionally disappear only to reappear a few days later. This can be quite frustrating when all you want to do is see who won. The DLCs only work on the platform they've been purchased on, so a steam DLC won't work on android or IOS - you can however, continue or join a game started using the DLCs on a platform where you don't own them.

Well, it does, but nowhere near as well as it should. Since this is a direct, very lazy port of the tablet/mobile version, there are no options to really configure anything: you can't even fullscreen the game. Playing online with friends is a possibility, but the horrendous UI makes actually connecting to a game a chore (did I mention this is a direct tablet port yet?), and the ingame chat censors you without mercy no matter who you are playing with. The latter could be acceptable if it didn't then immediately result in the game temporarily muting you in chat. Playing with the AI is not any better, since the AI either doesn't know what it is doing, or freezes all together with indecision, never ending its turn (Heroic Halflings in a 5 player game seems to stump the AI regularly for me if a bot gets it). As the game has no turn timers, if the AI decides to freeze in this manner there is nothing you can do to salvage that particular session.","September 8, 2015","false","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's probably easier for children to get into than Risk. It's cute and simple. AI acts as reasonably as another person, no suprises there. Looks nice, sounds nice, it's light and fluffy.\n\n- I wouldn't recommend this game as an introduction to Small World, the board game experience itself is just more fun. I'd also tell those who are expecting something more than a faithful adaptation of a simple board game to steer clear. Those not familiar with the board game beware, this isn't an edge of your seat strategy game about military conquest. Playing solo is like playing any board game with bots. It's like playing UNO with bots, it's fine if you're bored.\n\nI was a fan of the board game prior, but it's not a favorite. It's ok. The video game met expectations. I got the DLC with it, but it doesn't really matter. This version isn't going to replace the board in my gaming group, but that's fine.

It's fun, addicting and such an unparalled board game experience. You startled by the bad reviews on Steam? Don't be, and here's why:\n1. The second highest negative review is written by a guy who has poured in 4+ hours a day into a 'buggy' and 'overpriced' game.\n2. The three main complaints are as follows: no fullscreen, high priced DLC, multiplayer crashes. One of those is fixed, one of those can be emulated by pressing the large box on the top right corner of the application, and one is true in almost every other Steam game in there. Oh, by the way, did I mention that it's DLC? And that the DLC are not shameless plug-ins, but based off the original board game expansions? And that you don't NEED to buy the DLC to play the game?\n3. People have said that the SINGLEPLAYER mode of a board game is addicting. The SINGLEPLAYER mode. Of a MULTIPLAYER game. Does that not tell you how much fun you will have in the newly-improved multiplayer?\n4. People complain about the people who abandon online matches, yet there is a system that allows you to play with Steam friends, and on the forums you can friend people who want to play with you.\n5. The multiplayer is Asynchronous, meaning when you enter a match, you aren't forced to do your turn. Mum calls you to have dinner? Wait a moment, I'm not forced to rush my turn!\n6. Multiplayer being Asynchronous means you can have more than one multiplayer game up at a time. Waiting for a slowpoke to finish their turn? Play a turn in another game! The opportunity is there for you.\n\nTo actually review the game: it's diverse, and you never feel like you're doing the same ♥♥♥♥ all over again. That was one of my main problems with such board games like Risk/Catan/Ticket to Ride: I could figure out a way to win that was pretty much the same every time. In this game? No such luck. Completely and utterly replayable.\nThe reason my hours are low is because I've had stuff to do, and I play this game called Dota in the times when I'm not free. But I assure you, I'm playing this game a helluva lot more in the future.\n\nIf you do get this, and you want to play some multiplayer with someone you know won't abandon the game, feel free to add me. I'm open for business in this marvellous game. I guess it is a Small World after all.","December 14, 2013","true","24.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

The game is great. Has online play, which I admittedly didn't try. The bots do pretty well and can make some really vicious moves.\n\nCons: Bugs. Lots of them. The game froze several times. If heroic halflings hold less than 4 territories, the AI will lock up completely. If sorcerors swap out a pyhmy's tile, the pygmy doesn't get to roll for reinforcements. The A.I. is often very stubborn about going into decline, where it will stay even if its only got 1 or 2 tokens left. Also, even if you click the skip button as fast as you can, the game moves kind of slow. I wish there was an option for turning off animations. The menus are in dire, dire need of tooltips. There should be an indicator for the absolute maximum number of tokens you can have. I went werewolf skeletons and completely decimated everyone, but then it capped me at 20 tiles.\n\nDespite these misgivings, overall the game was challenging and fun. 3.5/5","June 26, 2015","true","54.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not. As far as I can tell, there's no full screen mode, and you can't adjust the resolution, meaning that playing at 720p requires hiding the task bar just to see the entire screen. To make matters worse, the fonts are small and hard to read from any distance you'd normally expect to view a TV from. If you're looking for a party game, look elsewhere.\n\nAlso - there's no in-game tutorial, only a video tutorial that inadequately explains the rules. Be prepared to read the rulebook if this is your first time playing. You might also be unable to view the video tuorial from ingame, as I couldn't, because the ingame browswer "doesn't support HTML5".

The complaints I hear about it from other people is that you have to drag tokens rather than just click, that it doesn't fullscreen right or at all....but these really seem like quibbling things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/235620/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","This game is the digital adaptation of a board game that I had never played, so I was a little skeptical about purchasing it; and if I didn't have friends with which I could play the game, I probably would have regretted my purchase.  However, this game does something that most other Digital/Steam board-games don't: it pushes notifications.\n\nDuring your game-play, you have a choice as to whether or not you actually want to be present.  You and your friends (I would not recommend purchasing this game for the single player) can play the game "live" or you can complete your turn and log off.  Your friends will have 48 hours to complete their turn before forfeiting the game.  This 48 hour window allows you to have a very "Words with Friends" style of game-play, giving you a 3-5 minute window of board game into your otherwise packed video gaming schedule.  You simply wait for Steam to alert you whenever its your turn, and you go about your business.\n\nThe actual game rules are pretty straight forward.  The rules are kind-of-sort-of similar to RISK, but with an element of randomness that prevents static strategies.  Every player selects a race with a random special power every game, and while the race bonuses stay static, the special powers are randomly assigned every game.  This can, unfortunately, lead to some relatively overpowered combinations; but so far I haven't encountered anything that has completely dominated the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the Steam integration needs some work though.  While it does, for the most part, link a "Days of Wonder" account with your "Steam Account" (which raises some concerns), it does not import any of your friends.  So you must manually add buddies, who may not have the same Days of Wonder handle, and then invite them into a game through the game's multiplier console.  Once a game is created, players do not receive a notification that they've been invited until it is their turn.  You cannot invite players through the Steam Overlay.  As many accolades as the game got for the notifications, it lost for the lackluster integration.\n\n6/10 - wait for the Christmas Sale.","December 17, 2013","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, much like the board game itself, this is almost totally confusing. The presentation is nice and entertaining, and plays almost exactly like the board game. What I noticed, though, is that a player has to have either incredible luck or an almost "genius level" of strategic skill or else suffer defeat after defeat. This can be especially frustrating, and if you're like me, you figure it's not worth it to be knocked down so often.

If you've never played it, then just watch the video, it's vair straight forward to figure out.\n\nThere's a major, and a minor, problem them; Trying to play online is like pulling teeth. Constant "authentication" problems with people trying to log in. Getting a game going is extremely frustrating because of this. (That said, when you're actually playing it's a smooth ride IME).\n\nThe other minor problem is something that the board game suffers from too but it can't be helped there... they could have fixed it here and didn't. I play games like this with my family; there's 3 of us that play. That means when we play the board game we're always stuck on the 3 player board... never used the 2, 4 or 5 player board. In the computer game although you can play against the AI in single player, you can't have the same bots in multiplayer... if you could you could have 3 people, and 2 AIs. A big missed opportunity.\n\nLike many people (probably) I got this from Humble, so it seems harsh to be negative about a game for charity, but if you're getting this for multiplayer, don't bother.

All the strategy is left in place while you no longer need to keep stopping to count your victory coins gained each turn.\n\nGraphically, the game is fine, maintaining the cartoony feel of the board game. It can suffer from some unusual ratios when opening, but maximising the window will address it. For some reason it appears to lack a full screen option.\n\nAI seems to vary between utterly foolish and amazingly prescient - so be prepared for issues there if playing solo. Where the game shines though is in hotseat multiplayer. In this regard it functions as a replacement for the board game that handles all the mechanical side of the game for you.","December 28, 2013","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The AI only has one difficulty, which new players may find difficult.  However, experienced players will get bored pretty fast with the computer-controlled opponents.  The multiplayer options work fairly well, although the ability to remove unwanted races or powers doesn't exist the way you can do it on the board game (I think were- and cursed- are terrible powers but I like the rest of that expansion).  Additionally, there are some strange bugs that occur mostly on AI.

You can also play with computer opponents or challengers from all over. I wish all my favorite board games offered this sort of gameplay!\n\nIf you're just starting out, I think the online version is a solid starting point, especially if you plan to move on to the physical board. I bought this after playing it briefly and it was a great refresher course but also got my boyfriend's feet wet before committing to the tabletop game.\n\nThe race and power combinations create a lot of replay value. There's always a new strategy to adopt or a new race/power combination to discover.\n\nIf you're a Small World veteran, you may be disappointed by the current lack of expansions available. I still have a lot of fun with it, there's a limited amount of DLC to add to the base game.\n\nThe one great advantage the online version has, for me, is that it keeps track of everything for me.

Basically, I recommend purchasing the game but strictly on a discounted price only! (at least 50% on base game, at least 75% on any DLC)\n\nMINUSES\n- The player is forced to register at "Days of Wonder" if wants to play online. This is very childish and unprofessional. Devs should use the damn Steam API provided for free and stop bugging players with registering at 3rd parties...\n- DLCs are minimalist and by that, overpriced\n- Sloppy-coded stuff... E.g.\n-- there's no button to quit the game. You either ESC until the game is windowed and use 'x' or ALT+F4 from it\n-- to see the tutorial, I had to re-install flash first (???), HTML5 compatibility was not recognized(found?) somehow... I don't even understand... And guess what, at the end it turns out there's an in-game browser window, and this is going to be the tutorial by playing a youtube clip for you... Gosh..... Why couldn't it at the first place?!\n- Not many options, basically just volume controls; what if I want to ignore the tabletop rules and play for let's say 15 rounds, not 10? (why not?). or I want to play in "free mode" and put together my race-special combo by hand? (also why not?), maybe for the bots too... What if I want bot difficulty levels? And so on...\n- The wizard's voice is very annoying, thank god one can hear him(?) in the 4 mins tutorial only\n- No way to see actual points/score of any players (including yourself)\n\nPLUSES\n- The game is not freezing or anything, so it's playable, i.e. I didn't experience any glitches or lock-ups (so far, after 1.2hrs play) mentioned by some negative reviews\n- The game is actually fun, pretty much the same as the tabletop version\n\nI understand the list of negatives is much larger than positives, but they balance out, really.","June 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So when I seen they made a steam version I jumped at the chance to try it out. Has a very simple interface and menu system nothing flashy and pretty rudimentary.

Gameplay is fun, tactical, and rewarding also only last 20-45 mins (relatively speaking). Interesting and familiar fantasy races to play that coupled with the seperate ability combos ensures you'll never have the same game twice. The toutorial video is a big help for newcomers and is a big help at laying down the basic rules.\nSo very fun, entertaining, and good practice until I can get a proper board game setup to add the human interactive element (which can be obtained by local hotseat play for those with only the digital version).","January 3, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't feel like that much time has passed, which tells me I enjoyed every bit of it. I owned the board game before this digital copy and family and I will play this with family when we're feeling like some light entertainment. But there's still a good amount of complexity there as well. This game fits that description quite well as it is not heavy handed in any regard. You have 10 turns to collect as many coins as you can via owning a certain number of territories by the end of the turn. Simple. The part that makes it complex is the sheer variety of game play as you have so many different races to choose from combined with a randomized characteristic. These characteristics can lead to wildly different styles of play with any given race. It's fun and it's quick!\n\nThe only complaint that we seem to have is not being able to adjust (increase) the number of total turns and also we'd like a little variety with the map design. We play the same map every time! It's balanced, don't get me wrong. But with races and characteristics being so varied each game, seeing a varied map (like in Settlers of Catan) would be an appreciated sight. Missing that element by no means ruins the experience. It's just a minor requested tweak. Recommend, play with friends, play with the computer, or take your chances with online players (I can't speak from that experience).","November 13, 2015","true","57.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really nice to not have to do all the set up and fiddliness. The game plays a good fraction of the time of the traditional game. A game can easily be played in 10 minutes (vs. AI, real players obiviously may take longer).\n\nThe only thing that I'm not fond of, it can be difficult to follow during another player's turn if any of your units or locations were just attacked. You really have to pay close attention or have a good memory of where all your locations were. Aside from that, I have little that makes me unhappy with the game.\n\nI've only played one game with other random players and it worked smoothly for me.\n\nIf you're able to get the game on sale, it is certainly worth it if you enjoy the board game. If you've never played the board game, I'd say it's still probably worth it if by looking at the videos and descriptions managed to grab your interest. Being that I got it on sale, I've been quite pleased with the purchase.

Gameplay is fun, tactical, and rewarding also only last 20-45 mins (relatively speaking). Interesting and familiar fantasy races to play that coupled with the seperate ability combos ensures you'll never have the same game twice.

At least for me, they appear to be gone. I cannot claim that the game now works for everybody, but for me, I can honestly say that after trying it multiple times today, I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.\n\nSecondly, the new game features.\nIn this regard the game has improved dramatically and became closer to the model of Days of Wonder's other digital board game, Ticket to Ride.\n\n- Joining/creating games\nThe "Search for a game" model has been replaced with a Ticket to Ride-like arena, with a lobby and a "create a game" and "join a game" option. This removes a problem that sometimes occured previously, when in cancelling a search and restarting it (with different or same parameters) you ended up in multiple matches at the same time. It also adds a lot more customization to the game, including but not limited to the number of players (also present before), the amount of time each player has to act, password protected games, ranked/unranked games (previously only matches with your "buddies" were ranked) and the option to play a single session game (fast paced, all players only play one game) or multi session (longer rounds, suitable for those who play multiple matches at the same time, or prefer relaxed long lasting games similar to correspondence chess).\n\n- Gameplay\nBefore the 2.5 update, you could spend 10 minutes or more waiting for an opponent to make a move, which made a match that could've been finished in 15 minutes, last an hour or more. A situation made worse when after 10 minutes of waiting, you got a message that the player disconnected which automatically aborted the game. The introduction of a timer makes matches run a lot smoother. It makes games (single session) shorter and more active, and the addition of bot replacements for disconnected players, means that the very frustrating situation of ending up with a 50 minute unfinished game is gone.\n\nConclusion\nI'm happy to change the review to a recommendation. Now the game is as it should have been all along. I just hope that new updates won't mess it up again. The only downside of the game right now, is the lack of players, which will hopefully change once the word of it's improvements spreads.\n\nAlso a recommendation for potential buyers of the game, who are not already familiar with the board game version. Check out the youtube show TableTop (hosted by Wil Wheaton) and their episode about SmallWorld, and get to know what the game is about in a very entertaining way.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld review (26.4.2014)\n\nWhile I do love the game itself, I simply cannot recommend the broken Steam version to anyone.\n\nAside from the high price (13.99 dollars/euros) and lack of features that would make online games less frustrating, the game simply does not work for a lot of people, myself included.\n\nUpon purchase I was able to play it with no problems and clocked in a lot of hours. Though playing time is actually deceiving, since most of that time is spent just waiting to find opponents, waiting for them to move and wasted on unfinished games once an opponent leaves. But after an update 4 months ago the game simply crashes on startup, or in the 5-6 times I  actually managed to get in, it never lasted long enough to finish a single game. Developers had done nothing to fix the issue and support tickets have been unanswered.\n\nI wouldn't be writing this if the crashing problem would happen just to me, but since a lot of people are dealing with this, chances are you also might, so take that in consideration before purchasing a potentially faulty product.","April 26, 2014","true","64.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

You can also play with computer opponents or challengers from all over. I wish all my favorite board games offered this sort of gameplay!\n\nIf you're just starting out, I think the online version is a solid starting point, especially if you plan to move on to the physical board. I bought this after playing it briefly and it was a great refresher course but also got my boyfriend's feet wet before committing to the tabletop game.\n\nThe race and power combinations create a lot of replay value. There's always a new strategy to adopt or a new race/power combination to discover.\n\nIf you're a Small World veteran, you may be disappointed by the current lack of expansions available. I still have a lot of fun with it, there's a limited amount of DLC to add to the base game.\n\nThe one great advantage the online version has, for me, is that it keeps track of everything for me.

Basically, I recommend purchasing the game but strictly on a discounted price only! (at least 50% on base game, at least 75% on any DLC)\n\nMINUSES\n- The player is forced to register at "Days of Wonder" if wants to play online. This is very childish and unprofessional. Devs should use the damn Steam API provided for free and stop bugging players with registering at 3rd parties...\n- DLCs are minimalist and by that, overpriced\n- Sloppy-coded stuff... E.g.\n-- there's no button to quit the game. You either ESC until the game is windowed and use 'x' or ALT+F4 from it\n-- to see the tutorial, I had to re-install flash first (???), HTML5 compatibility was not recognized(found?) somehow... I don't even understand... And guess what, at the end it turns out there's an in-game browser window, and this is going to be the tutorial by playing a youtube clip for you... Gosh..... Why couldn't it at the first place?!\n- Not many options, basically just volume controls; what if I want to ignore the tabletop rules and play for let's say 15 rounds, not 10? (why not?). or I want to play in "free mode" and put together my race-special combo by hand? (also why not?), maybe for the bots too... What if I want bot difficulty levels? And so on...\n- The wizard's voice is very annoying, thank god one can hear him(?) in the 4 mins tutorial only\n- No way to see actual points/score of any players (including yourself)\n\nPLUSES\n- The game is not freezing or anything, so it's playable, i.e. I didn't experience any glitches or lock-ups (so far, after 1.2hrs play) mentioned by some negative reviews\n- The game is actually fun, pretty much the same as the tabletop version\n\nI understand the list of negatives is much larger than positives, but they balance out, really.","June 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics for setting up and playing a multiplayer online game are confusing and irregular. Oddly worded prompts, multiple iterations of games set up by accident, no common game board at the start of the game, etc etc. It is just poor UI design choice after poor UI design choice.\n\nI think, since the game is receiving updates it's not impossible for these issues to be fixed, so I am still recommending this game.

You don't need the expansions in order to join a game that is using any of the expansions. You can play hotseat.

The UI could use another patch or a few, and improved functionality, such as seamless switching, multiple instances running, not having the game overwrite your current action when something is happening in the game, more clarity on some functions and how to use them, less clunky, and for the Dragon's sake stop plastering ads for paid DLCs everywhere.\nIt's still a port of Small World, which is a fun board game in itself, and if this is the only way you get to play that game with your friends, you may want to put up with what you're getting for your money here.","December 15, 2013","false","7.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It's everything entertaining about the board game.  When playing multiplayer with my buddies, they're able to use the DLC races because I owned them.  That's a nice touch.  My one complaint, aside from the crashes which're obviously a problem, is the timing.  If you alt tab during a multiplayer game, it "resyncs" you to the game, making you watch everything that's happened.  In a five player match, you'll be waiting two-three minutes to get back to your turn.  Then the next chap waits a few minutes.  This is solved by not alt tabbing, but come on.  Who doesn't alt tab?  Adding a skip option would make this game incredible.

It features online as well as offline play, aginst bots or Friends and has a huge amount of replayabillity through its sheer mass of possible combinations.\n\nThe Artstyle is very collorfull and high quallity, the Pictures for the abillitys are quite topical so they help you remember who can do what Trick\n\nWhen you start the game you enter as one of the 28 Races that has been paired with one of the 35 random abillitys.\nYou then try to conquer terretory, that fits the special needs of your race, the Magicians for example score more Coins from terretorys, that hold a source of arcane power, while the Dwarfs prefere Goldmines.\n\nThe huge amount of variety enters the game when you factor in the abillity´s that every race gets randomly assined, you could for example get an Army of diplomatic  Skeletons wich enables you to go for one player while forcing the other to sign a truce with you, or you can rampage the countryside with pillaging orcs, that get more and more coins by invading other races.\n\nOnce you run out of Warriors for your race or you just feel like getting a new one, you can send your Race into decline and pick a new one next turn. The old one will stay on the board and still score points for you, but it will be weakened and easy Prey for a Fresh Race, maybe even your own.\n\nThe Tutorial is presented to you in the Form of videos and a Rulebook, just like the boardgame these Rules are quite clear and easy to understand.\nAlso the rulebook can be accesed during the Game to make sure you make informed decisions.\n\nWhile the game does not have the incredible amount of deaph some other boardgames offer its great for a quick game aginst 1 other player, or for a longer one for up to 5 players.\n\n\nAll in all i reccomend this game for everyone that likes games that can be played in short bursts or just boardgames in general. My only complaint about the game is, that it features asynchronous play wich means you can make your turn, leave and come back later, this can drag a game out quite a bit but since you can start multiple ones at a time you can occupy your self otherwise.","December 12, 2013","true","7.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Apparently loads of people had heard of it as it was crowd funded successfully by some over seven thousand people and nearly got three times its kickstarter goal and according to Days of Wonder half a million people have bought the board game. I guess that I've just not being paying attention.\n\nHowever, it is also one of the worst tablet ports ever. There are no options other than changing the sound and music volumes. You cannot alter the resolution, enable full screen and as for colour blind options forget about it! There are also numerous other nasty things. Bugs, connection problems on multiplayer and day one DLC if you'd like something in the way of a choice of maps.\n\nThe game play while well explained with video tutorial and in game rule book, is solid but if you like this sort of thing why not buy the board game instead? What works great on the table top does not necessarily work so well on the desktop. Even with the full range of game play modes, solo, lan and online I doubt you'd ever have as much fun as getting a couple of friends around and playing SW on the table top.\n","December 13, 2013","false","7.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

A charming game that is much deeper than its whimsical appearance may suggest with a lot of replayability despite the (at least currently) singular map.\n\nI would love to see more expansions for it, especially the modular map, to come to the PC version and more races and powers means more options and crazy combos. Some of these combinations were laugh out loud funny (flying ghouls, peace-loving barbarians, etc.) so even more of these would enhance the game immensely.\n\nIt needs a fullscreen option and we had some minor hiccups getting our games set up (invite friends and bots, the go button wouldn't light up everytime, had to go back to the previous menu then select current MP game and then the button worked) but we encountered no other bugs.\n\nEssentially the objective it to hoard the most coins by fulfilling victory conditions while placing race tokens to conquer land. All races are matched with a power that modifies what they do and helps determine how many tokens you have to use for attack and defense. As your race spreads out it becomes harder to expand anymore so you will usually have to go into a decline and select a new race/power combo. A race in decline will normally be left weak and unable to do much but still accrues coins for you. These race/power combos are on the right side of the screen and you can take the top one or skip down for penalites if a combo isn't to your liking. Players take turns conquering and reinforcing, trying to get more coins than anyone else to win at the end of the last turn.\n\nThere's a lot of subtle strategy involved in both the races inherent abilities but also in the power they are attached too and how many tokens they can get. Pushing your self thin can net a lot of early coins but if the others gang up on you it can backfire and some races are much better at this than others. Knowing if and when to go into decline and when to take or skip a race/power combo as well as when and where to attack and is that last possible understrength attack worth risking that die roll for(?) combine to make it an excellent game. Highly recommended.","December 28, 2014","true","377.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I was shocked to see the sticker price, and the add on price as well...\n\n\nBut that aside, the gameplay is nice.. When it works... The game is laggy/bugged at an insane level. If you are going over the race/power combo's while your opponent is playing their turn.. it litterally pauses the gameplay.. causing a lag for the other player.\n\nIt is as if the developers themselves have not even attempted to play this game. I played enough of it to get my money's worth I guess... But the entire time has been an uphill battle. Game crashes mid turn, have to close/reopen and go to currently running games to resume... It has NOT been a good playing experiance at all.\n\n**Edit**\n\nSince my last review, they have changed the multiplayer to include a mandatory chat room thing, it makes finding/creating games a joke, I have not played one multiplayer game since. Solo play is alright, however after a few games you will start to miss the multiplayer games. Honestly, this company has ridden this cash cow as far as they can without completely reworking the game. They funded 100% of the development on kickstarter, but then still charge a hefty price to buy the game. Instead of using the online version to market their actual boardgame, they are sticking with a hit and run policy.","June 24, 2014","false","14.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I say this because every single time you tab out of the game, if you are playing live, you need to watch the moves of those who played after your last turn over and over again. Every single time. Even if you tab out for a few seconds. What this boils down to is that if you and 4 friends are playing (as was our case) 80% of the time spent "playing" the game translates to watching back previous moves while you laboriously await your turn. This is hopefully something that could be patched/fixed, but as this is a direct port from a tablet variant I don't foresee this happening.\n\nNext up, if you don't know how to play Small World, don't in any way expect this game to teach you. Thankfully, we had a seasoned pro of Small World playing with us so we had some idea what was going on, but the shear lack of tooltips, information and tutelage was kind of staggering. I'd say this is the type of game that is a) aimed towards someone who already plays Small World and b) a tablet device or phone.\n\nThe controls, the feel, and the entirity of the game just scream tablet game. And that's great! On a tablet. Sadly, as a PC title, it falls short.\n\nAfter enduring one hour long game with my friends, I immediately requested a Steam refund for this severely underwhelming game, which was rejected as I'd already used the title, so for everyone else out there: beware.\n\nThe title has great promise! Small World is a GREAT board game, but this digital port just does not deliver. Maybe the devs will pick this up and adapt it, and if so I'll happily edit my review and re-review the title; after all, Small World itself is a great game! But for now, again, beware.\n\nNilesy","December 29, 2013","false","0.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The interface was fluid and easy to read, and I really appreciate the fact that the developers went the extra mile to include tutorials.  I often had to look in the manual when playing the board game to clarify powers and the like…I didn’t have to do that here.  This makes the game extremely user-friendly.  Online play is certainly a bonus, though I have a feeling I’ll be making use of pass-and-play when I don’t feel like digging through my board game closet to find the physical board game.  My only concern is the lack of fullscreen and the fact that you can’t make the AI easier…beginners will surely become frustrated as the AI is pretty difficulty to defeat.  The game is only $14.99 (as of 12/18/13), which is about twenty to forty dollars cheaper than the board game (depending on where you shop)…making it a great (and cheap) way to buy into the “Small World” universe.  Based on the strategic gameplay elements, replayability, and accessibility, I’d have to say that “Small World 2″ is most certainly worth the investment."\n\nReview:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/small-world-2/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJE_K8445qw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQV4AfIxCV8\n","December 7, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

After several games I've yet to really win one against the four bots I've been playing, though I admit I only have a half understanding of which abilities are good, and when they're good.  Online play is also fine save for one missing feature: unlike Ticket to Ride, you cannot play with both bots and human players through the internet.  Kind of an annoying absence.\n\nI commented about the interface but it's not so simple as saying it's bad or good, as parts are fine.  While you're in game everything works and is intuitive, though I have yet to figure out a midgame score for other players (recently discovered that I can find my own score).  The trouble is that almost nothing in any interface is labeled and many of the icons are not self explanatory.  If you hover over --some-- things you get an explanation of what it means but you're otherwise left guessing as to what certain icons mean.  I've also yet to find a proper way to exit the game without either closing the window or crashing the game.  That's not to say one doesn't exist, but well, the interface is convoluted as I've already indicated.\n\nAnyway, it works, it's fine and most importantly it's playable.  Fun game with friends or even alone if you want to play but can't get anyone into it.  I would say it's definitely worth the price but there are glaring issues that I would have expected to be patched away before release.","April 24, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And I had to make a lot of really bad pot roasts to finally figure the whole dadgum thing out…and figure it out I did, thank the Lord above. And the verdict? Pot roast, when made according to a few fundamental rules, can be a totally delicious addition to your repertoire. There are lots of different, equally delicious ways to make pot roast. Today’s version is the first of many I’ll be profiling here.\nThe meat you use is important. My favorite roast is the chuck roast; it has wonderful marbling throughout the meat, and when given an ample amount of time to cook, chuck roast winds up being tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To understand the importance of adequate cooking time, you must understand that these tougher pieces of meat have lots of tough connective tissue that will only soften when cooked at a lower temperature for a long period of time. You can’t rush a pot roast; you’ll be disappointed with the result if you try. But if you reach deep down into your soul and find your patience—at least, the patience that was given to you by your Maker to relate to beef-related circumstances in your life—you won’t be disappointed.","May 17, 2014","true","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game basically plays exactly like that but adapted to a computer.\n\nIt's a fast pased, 8 turn long board game with a suprising amount of in depth strategy inolved.\n\nNow, some considerations. First, the game is complete in and of itself, there's no need to buy the DLC. But if you do wish to buy the DLC it can get a bit expensive.\n\nSecond, the game is slightly cheaper on Android Pads. If you want portability that's probably the way to go. if you want to play with your steam friends? this is probably a better bet.\n\nThird, there's no full screen mode, but if you want, you can maximize the window for much better detail without losing any of the board to cut off.\n\nFourth, the "tome of Knowledge" also known as the glossary of terms and rules, is slightly buggy sometimes. the information is easy enough to read once highlighted, but initially it sometimes shows up obscured (particularly when showing races and powers).\n\nOverall, this is a solid game well worth purchasing if you like board games in general, or the original Small World Board Game in particular.","December 11, 2013","true","4.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

This game does a good job representing the best selling board game. You conquer regions of the world similar to Risk but the randomized Race and Ability tokens make it so that no two games are alike.  There are some missing features that you'd consider standard in PC gaming like a proper full screen mode but I have hopes that they'll patch it down the line. The AI is brilliant most of the time but sometimes they stroke out and do stupid things.  Online support is good so if you get sick of playing against AI, you can take on some real people.

No solo campaign-type mode; only thing you can do solo is play a basic game against a few bots (can't even adjust difficulty) Hardly anyone even plays the multiplayer mode. There's no real variables you can adjust when creating a game except for the number of players. There is only one board to play on. There's none of the races, abilities, or places/relics from the Smallworld Underground board game. The DLC packs are pretty skimpy as well. I just felt like there was not enough content in this game for the ~$15 that it costed with DLC; I've played free and $1-2 games with way more content. However, I do still enjoy the basic game and isn't a bad way to spend 10-15 mins now and then. Overall, I would suggest saving your money until the developers add some meat to this game.","June 5","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
