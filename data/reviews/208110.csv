I even collected a few of the accompanying novels, I was that crazy for the series. To be honest, I wasn't even aware of any other games in the series beyond Myst IV (which I have not played yet), until recently. I really wanted to like this game, from the very start. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed by Myst V.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, like with any other Myst game. I couldn't help but feel the worlds were smaller somehow, though, and less explorative. Almost restrictive.  I can appreciate how they are trying something different compared to the other games in the series; I just don't enjoy the outcome of it. For instance, full motion video had been used in the first four Myst games--and used very well. You rarely had contact with anyone within the games themselves, which added to the overall isolation and atmosphere of the games.  And while Myst V only adds two characters into the mix, Escher and Yeesha, the impact just isn't the same due to predictable 3D rendered characters replacing the FMV. Their presence inside the game sort of ruins the notion of being isolated on some deserted world.Oh well.\n\nAnother small but vital complaint: the voiceovers used during journal readings. Just like the rest of the series, journals provide key insight and deepen the backstory of the game. I remember it being a very immersive experience in Myst, picking up a journal and reading and re-reading it to myself at my own pace. This time around, the journals are read for you, in the voice of Yeesha. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting of both Yeesha and Escher are very well done. It just ruins the experience of reading it for myself, and often ends up becoming an annoyance throughout the game.\n\nMy biggest problem with Myst V, though, are the puzzles themselves. When you think of Myst, you think of challenging, physics-based puzzles which require a good amount of patience. Even the hardest puzzle could be figured out eventually, as long as you paid strict attention to clues and weren't afraid to use a little trial-and-error. I never used a walkthrough for Myst, Riven or Myst III (and Riven was an incredibly difficult game). But I found myself breaking down for help several times in Myst V. The puzzles are frustratingly difficult, due to the fact that some of the clues are either misleading, or non-existent. I didn't really enjoy the use of the slate/tab mechanism, either, and found it frustrating as well.\n\nIf this game is part of some Myst/Cyan/Ubisoft bundle on sale, then by all means go for it. But I would not personally recommend this game by itself.","October 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 53 of 65 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","53","65","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/recommended/208110/","beardiman","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/","614 products in account","To really appreciate these games, one has to have read the books and beaten all the previous entrys. Wow that sounds elitist. Unfortunately, with Myst, it's quite true. Much like any other fantasy world (Middle Earth, Elder Scrolls, etc) the ages of Myst and your significance in them can only be understood in the context of the game's universe. Myst is about exploring ages, and figuring out puzzles, but in truth, its about so much more. Its about a lost tribe called the D'ni, and the legacy of the man who would eventually save them (Atrus). This is not a one part movie, but a story of which bits and pieces are scattered among other books and games. With Myst V you are getting the conclusion to a very long story. For that reason, it may seem short. But when you play the game with the knowledge of the other games, its an ending that seems mostly appropriate and is needed to cap off an otherwise endless story. Is it perfect? No. Does it work? yes. If you do not play the other games in the series, then it at the very least recommendable that you read the books. Not only do they fill in alot of blanks, but also give you some insight into the characters and why they are significant.","January 18, 2014","true","3.7"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

I played Myst and Riven when i was a child, I continued with Exile and Revelation and I absolutly enjoyed every single one of them. Unmatched when it comes to atmosphere and puzzles. I remember these masterpieces to be some of the brighest lights in my history of playing video games. So it was just a matter of time until i would pick Myst V and finally now when i found it (fortunatly being on sale, yay) there was no way around it. Sadly...I dont understand why this game wears the name "Myst". The story is flat, the puzzles are somehow boring and they didnt pull me into the game. I miss the once so excellent leveldesign and its awsome surreal enviroments who seemed so alive and fascinating. I also appreciated the real actors...its was one of the key features for me. Myst V at the other hand looks dead and flat. I dont feel any interest to go "deeper" into this.

My assuption was that it would feel different from the other Myst games. Many years later, on sale on Steam, I thought "for $10, why not give it a try".\n\nMy reveiw is mixed, first the pro's:\n1. If you know the Myst story, it is a fitting end in terms of plot. You should probably play it for the closure.\n2. The worlds (with the exception of the 4th Age with the arena, which was a snore) are still as beautiful and imaginative as ever. I was particularly impressed with the "Observatory" age.\n3. The game gives you the ability to place in one of several modes, from "classic" to "free-mode", so the change of format did not affect the game as much as I thought it would in that regard.\n4. The game adds new elements to the Myst world, so there is more to discover!\n\nNow the con's:\n1. The change from real actors to computer animated motion capture made a HUGE difference for immersion in the game world. Frankly, every time a character was on sceen they looked rediculous. Because of their rediculous appearance I found it really hard to accept the dialogue genuinely... something that never happened to me before even with some of the over-acting in the rest of the series.\n2. The puzzles were far too easy and the worlds far too small. I got through the game super fast (my log says 68 minutes but I think that's innacurate). Basically one day. I bought it Thursday morning and finished it Friday afternoon. That included all reading, puzzle solving, and even some down time where I went to do this and that but left the game running.  Myst took me a good week. Riven probably 2-3 weeks. Exile and Revelation somewhere inbetween, and Uru... well I never finished that ;). This was therefore the shortest and most dissapointing of the series in terms of bang for buck or immersability (whichever means the most to you).\n3. The plot was too predictable. The big twist at the end can be seen from... well, from the beginning. Myst is about Mystery, judging who will be evil and who will be good, and finally making a decision that will determine all (p.s. I died twice when playing the original Myst... like everyone else probably)! End of Ages was about the end of that mystery, there was no secret what should be done (though I tried the other options first in order to see the alternate endings).\n\nConclusion:\nI enjoyed the game, but it felt like a "Myst Snack" rather than a "Myst Meal"... and I was hoping to end my Myst experience with something like a Christmas dinner, not microwave popcorn. Oh well. Don't buy it unless you want plot closure or just to see the imaginative worlds.","October 17, 2014","false","2.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","4"

However, this game is still definitely worth your time if you are a fan of the Myst series.

Whereas previous entries to the series offer so much to entice the player, THIS game offers much, much more. It's got:\n\n* Empty, 2-dimensional characters whose struggles you can't possibly care about.\n*A vague, loosely-formed plot with new lore that is poorly explained and quite uninteresting for a Myst game.\n*The exploration of the differernt ages feels very restrictive and linear compared to previous games.\n*The soundtrack, which the Myst franchise has always been praised for, is unbelievably bland.\n*The introduction of new concepts that offer nothing to the story. In particular the use of the tablets is much more of an inconvenience  than a challange and are often frustrating to accurately use with a mouse.\n*Major characters from the previous games that feel like more of an afterthought.\n\nThey really phoned it in on this one. What is most insulting is that they knew that this was going to be the final installment and they opted to throw diarrhea in the faces of their small yet loyal fanbase.

First, the sadistic puzzles.  Here's an example (spoiler!): at some point you come across controls for a cable tram connecting two points.  One switch controls the direction (point A to point B, or point B to point A).  A nearby lever gives the tram a push in that direction.  When you discover these controls, you are at point A and the tram is at point B.  Point B is so far away you actually don't know that the lever is doing anything, but 37 (seriously) 5-second pushes of the lever later, the tram is at point A.  You get on the tram and discover a floor lever...that doesn't work, because the tram is powered from the other side.  Fine.  After more wanderings you get to point B via a completely different route, only to discover that the tram has to be in point B's dock in order for you to proceed, which requires you to go back to point A and hit that leverl 37 more times.  What was the point of this puzzle, Cyan?  To waste time on a mindless clicking goose-chase?  What part of this did the design team sit down and decide would be fun:\n- that the tram is not in the screen when you're pumping the lever, so you don't know what it's doing?\n- that it takes *37* lever pumps to get the tram across the gap?\n- that the tram doesn't actually work when you finally get it to point A?\n- that after all that, the tram actually needs to be at point B to proceed, so the player has to run all the way back and manually reset it?\n\nSimilarly, there are more "guess-and-run-for-a-while-and-check" puzzles -- things that require you to try random combinations and then spend a substantial amount of time running somewhere to see what, if any, effect it had.\n\nThe dialog also greatly detracts from the game, because most of it is vague, stream-of-consciousness wistful regret that's not related to the puzzles.\n\nOverall, I'm very optimistic about the upcoming Obduction game, because Rand Miller specifically said they're trying to harken back to the days of Myst and Riven.  Those were good games that had far more puzzles than sadism.  As for Myst V, I gave it my best shot, but the poor design of that tram puzzle warranted nothing less than a rage-quit.\n","April 27, 2014","false","8.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

This may be a big disappointment to Myst fans seeing as the previous games (Especially Riven) are very grounded and masters at storytelling through gameplay. But don't let that hold you back from enjoying what is otherwise a properly clever game.\n\nThe story revolves around a mad scientist and a hippie who battles for control over an all powerfull object (yeah, it's that dumb). The scientist is pretty cool as a character, although he is a bit over the top at times and nowhere near the trilling genius of Ghen (the scientist psychopath from Riven). The hippie however is cringeworthy and spews bad methaphors in an attempt at wisdom. Unless you enjoy that sort of thing it will take away some of your enjoyment.\n\nBut credit where credit is due: The solution to the final puzzle that wraps up the story is actually pretty clever and ties nicely into the gameplay. The pace is good and you spend most of your time in this game actualy playing it and making progress (not watching cutscenes like most adventure games).\n\nOther than a dissapointing story the rest of the game is pure joy. The visuals and atmosphere are AMAZING (even today). The game runs perfect on modern systems and has almost no bugs. Music is also good but not at the level of some of the other games in the series. The game is easy to play and works great both as a point&click and as a free moving FPS (choice is yours).\n\nThe puzzles are the main star and they are as good as ever. Many of them are really clever and will make you feel like a god when you solve them. They tie nicely into the game-world and helps build up that mysterious lonely atmosphere that Myst is known for. All of them are both interesting and fair, there is not a single "bad seed" that relies on stupid game-logic or pixel-hunting.\n\nAs always with Myst games the puzzles expects you to examine and undertsand the environment in which they are located and what the purpose of the machinery you are manipulating actually is. You must look past just the interactive objects and study the world as a whole to make sense of it all. Simple logic or "trying everything" will not get you anywhere.\n\nJust look past the horrible story/writing and have fun, gameplay is stellar here.","October 11, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Poor Yeesha, who was such a sensible, inquisitive little girl in Myst IV, has gone even crazier than she was in Uru. And the storyline of the game is focused around freeing a race of creatures called the Bahro, who pretty much came out of left field (they were mentioned vaguely, but never directly shown, in Uru).\n\nBut, D'ni storyline aside, the main reason I loved the Myst series, was as a "walking simulator", giving you the opportunity to explore exotic, beautiful, ruined locations, and piece together their history. This game delivers on *that* in a big way. The worlds are well realized, the puzzles and abandoned D'ni machinery are fascinating, and you get to see new parts of D'ni itself, which have been off limits before. And at the end you get a nice little closing scene, which puts a little bit of closure on the series.\n\nThe storyline would probably be pretty nonsensical if you haven't read the books and played the previous games in the series (Myst, Riven, Myst III, Myst IV, Uru), but I think as a walking simulator it would probably still stand up, as long as you don't mind a large component of mysteriousness. That said, you can get Myst, Riven, and Uru here on Steam (and on gog), so if you're going to play those, do play them first.

It was shoter than the other games, and doesnt seem to follow the story of the originals at all. Also, the puzzles are simpler, requiring very little effort to figure them out, and there are far fewer of them. The new gameplay mechanic of the tablets is intresting, however, and became an intresting way of creating puzzles that fit in the world, and didnt seem out of place, like creating wind to make a creature move (as a simple example).\n\nFor those who didnt want to read what I wrote, here is a simplified list:\n\nPros:\n- Better Graphics and controls\n- Unique gamplay mechanics\n\nCons\n- Easy Puzzles\n- Few Puzzles\n- Disconnected Story\n\nOverall, I would say not to get this game. However, if you are one of the curious ones, who plan to get this game regardless of this review, I would suggest getting it only while on sale.","June 3, 2014","false","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Which is a big shame because I am a big fan of the Myst games and have enjoyed all of them up until End of Ages.\nI bought this game on sale and I suggest everyone waits for the same. This game really isn't worth more than $5.00.\nSure it's worth a play through because it's a Myst title, but nothing more.","June 17, 2015","false","7.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I'll figure that out. As of the game you do have to be a skilled drawer as you have to draw on tablets to communicate to the Bahro. For instance if you want wind on your age you have to draw the symbol for wind exactly or pretty close. If you do it right other things can be done. For instance you draw wind and a previous creature who blocks your path can't see because things are blowing around and moves out of the way. Anyway it was a cool story, play through it once. I thought it was ok.","February 7, 2014","false","14.9"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","2"

The Myst story swan dives over the shark with the Bahro from Uru, shoehorning a class warfare storyline that should have stayed in The Book of D'ni where it came from, and where it applied to D'ni's long lost twin civilization.\n\nPuzzles are simple in the Uru tradition, with clues located fairly near to where they're needed. Other puzzles require stumbling through controls until you work out what it wanted you to do in the first place. Still others require reading Yeesha's whiny journals to find the symbol they want you to draw.\n\nThe drawing mechanic is just fine. Utterly out of place in a Myst game, but it's no worse than the godawful horns on Haven in Myst 4.\n\nPick it up to finish the story, or let the story have ended at Revelation, you decide.","October 26, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
