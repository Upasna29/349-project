Each session of the game is very different: your neighbours, the distribution of goods, your ministers, and most importantly the events that will occur are randomized, and this has made each playthrough very different and interesting.\n\nThe graphics in the game are, admittedly, retro, but the artwork is very well done and the animations are clean.  For a turn-based strategy game, it does the trick.\n\nThe writing of the game is often funny, and the voice acting is very good (and everything is voiced).\n\nRogue State is admittedly very challenging, but I like a challenge.  Managing the support of the four factions in your country, managing your budget, and managing the production of infrastructure and special projects is a tricky balancing act, and early on, I lost often.  However, when I won, I felt like I really earned it!  I found that I could get further and further on each playthrough as I figured out how to better keep everyone (or everyone that mattered) happy without going totally broke.\n\nThis game has that "one more turn" compulsion that I get with Civ.  I recommend it!","October 16, 2015","true","11.2"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","38","48","3","0"

It's a good mix between Sim Junta, Democracy 3 and Rulers of Nations. The simplicity and short gameplay like Sim Junta, the various policy selection and experimentation of Democracy 3 and the background complexity of Ruler of Nations.\nThe concept is simple, it is a turn-based geopolitical simulation game where you are the ruler of a newly established country called the People's Republic of Basenji and you must strive against unhappy citizens, a power-hungry brother, an imperialistic UN/USA and the desires of your neighbors. You will have events that pop up where you must make hard choices that will determine the fate of Basenji and affect your popularity with the 5 groups of citizens (Capitalists, Patriots, Fundamentalists, Liberals and Qariffi (I think that's spelled right). You also need to keep the loyalty of your own military or else your brother Farouk will swiftly eject you from power. You adjust policies that range from minimum wage requirements to your country's alcohol tolerance laws which will affect your standing amongst the various groups and will change from turn to turn. You also have the ability to maintain a military and invade your neighbors or garner the affections and attentions of the UN and US, either to your benefit or detriment. From the time I've spent with the game so far, I don't think you can win... you just do a little better each time and (like Plague Inc.) every time you complete a game, you're able to unlock more special modifiers to change up the experience.\nArtistically and musically, this game really excels. While neither are perfect, they really set the mood and help to immerse you in your new role as president of Basenji. I just love that everyone is voiced as well... it shows there is a lot of love and labor that has been put into the game.\nAll in all, I love this game. Simple yet addictive with a wealth of content for only 12.99, this is arguably one of the better low budget Geosims I've played in a long time. Highly recommended.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuB2VdRX2E","October 18, 2015","true","2.8"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","32","38","7","0"

WTF who am I kidding, you will always end up as dictator.\n\nRogue State  is probably a best  geopolitical strategy I played, it contains all aspect of leading a country.\nGameplay as I understand is based on achiving highest score you can, so it is only up to you and your decisions how long will you rule.\nI can say that game is 100% replayable because after every turn random events pop-out, which make this game super fun.\nI mean for real you can literaly take the gun and shoot your advisor, how fuc**ng awesome is that.\n\nStarting the game if you are new in this genre may be a little dificult, so call advisor often. Once you set up stable economy, your main goal is to keep everyone happy, and you can never do that, so balance it baby.\n\nI can safely recommend this game to everyone because it is fun good game, however on my personal opinion 12,99 may be a little too much for this type of game, but on 50% it should be instant-buy.","October 23, 2015","true","4.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

I've seen it grow into the immersive, challenging, and beautifully addictive simulation that it is now. I think that's a key point to make here - this may look like a game but it's more akin to a 'strategy simulation'. There is no 'easy win' path that, once discovered, works each time.\n\nSome of the other reviews here cover the main mechanics so I'll keep this short. The game is loaded with random events inspired by real life meaning that each play through is always different. You play with the hand you're dealt and see how the cards fall.  Certainly, the good decisions you make and the tools you implement along the way will help to swing things in your favour - be it a change in policies or a perfectly pitched national broadcast - but you can never please all of the people all of the time and the randomness of real life can quickly change your fortunes if you react wrongly. Then, of course there's your scheming brother Farouk to contend with.\n\nThis is almost a survival simulator as much as it is a strategy title - the goal being to stay in power for as many turns as possible. Some times you'll win, most times you probably won't - but you'll have a darn good time trying... because once you get comfortable in the dictators chair you'll be itching for the next turn... and the next... and the next... which seems to me an accurate reflection of the life of a dictator, and the hallmark of a good game.\n\nJust make sure to siphon off enough funds to enjoy your retirement... if you make it.","October 16, 2015","true","0.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

However...\nRogue State is a game where you rule over a middle eastern country, as a democratic ruler.\nReally? No ability to rule as a dictator/monarch? I understand what the game is generally going for, ruling a democratic nation in the middle east. Just feels dissapointing that you cannot rename/change your nation's name or flag. Or that you cannot change your government type.\n\nYou must manage 4 classes, which represent your overall population.\nThese four classes will randomly become more important/bigger during certain times in the game, such as a rising number of capitalists, or patriots. This is sadly random, and you have NO way of influencing the population to becoming more loyal to your prefered population.\n\nAs well, you must manage local diplomacy, negotians with the US, and the UN.\nAs unique as it is, having randomly picked nations to be your neighbors is intersting, your bound to enter war with one. You need a strong army, or your going to be crushed. Fast.\n\nYou must rebuild your country's infanstructure (AKA, Tech tree.)\nThough fun, it is quite basic, and it definently sometimes feels unuseful, or game changing.\n\nYou must manage your country's policies to meet the expectations.\nIt is almost impossible for everyone to like you, and your going to end up having revolutions appearing.\n\nUnique 'wonder' projects, such as a great firewall, space program, nukes, Great Dam.\nI call them wonders, because they are essentially the wonder buildings from Civilization.\n\nProtect your glorious nation against coups and civil wars!\nDoesn't give you much in-depth on what is actually going on in the coup. Besides that, you just need lots of soldiers, and you are sort of REQUIRED to fill out these little bonuses which will aid in fighting back the rebels. (Such as, building a great Firewall, having high relations with the US.)\n\nRandom Events every turn, constantly changing how your population reacts to certain policies, how much money you make/spend, and diplomatic changes.\nThese feels EXTREMELY random, and sometimes, being bombarded by certain similar events one after another, seem unfair. It's more of a luck game, then a strategy game.\n\nOverall, the game is good, a 7/10. It's a basic country ruling simulator, that is a bit unforgiving at times, as it can sometimes throw constant situations and events at you that make it impossible to stay alive for more then 20 turns. If your into roleplaying as a leader, go for it.\n\nSimilar games\n- Long Live the Queen.\n\n\n\nUnsimilar games\n-Bad Rats","October 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","21","31","6","0"

I found the Democracy series boring, Fate of the World was a bit too heavy and I never got into Tropico. I prefer this game to any of them, despite its current flaws. One game this title does remind me of is 'Conflict: Middle East Politics Simulator', although that game is 25 years old. I've always wanted a remake of 'Conflict...' but with modern technology. This is almost what I always wanted.\n\nThis game also has a sense of humour which works. Other political games attempt it and they fall flat. The only other political game that succeeds with this sort of humour is 'Papers, Please'.\n\nThe problem with this game is that it doesn't make you desperate to replay it once you've finished the story once. There are things you can unlock, which motivate you to replay - but what this game really needs is more events, crisies and different story branches.The developers are still quite active in improving this game, which is nice. The game is also still slightly unbalanced in places, which is being fixed. At the moment, it feels about 95% finished. I would love to be surprised by some stonking great new content, though - or even some DLC.","November 12, 2015","true","9.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Your wallet and patience will thank me later.\n\nAs always I reserve the right to change this ranking to thumbs up but right now this is a pretty poor game. I'd stay clear if I were you. I got it for $6 on the Steam sale and it's currently not even worth that.\n\nIt's a cute game of supposedly running your little kingdom after a coup d'etat put you in charge. You build infastructure, make decisions, talk with your neighbors, build a military and try to stay in office. I'd love to be the dictator of a third-world nation. The idea has so much potential to be both evil and good...but that potential isn't realized here.\n\nThe biggest flaw in Rogue State is that there aren't enough "levers" to make things interesting. You simply don't have the tools to cope with the types of disasters - financial, health, war - that you'll be confronted with. Much of the "strategy" comes down to which two resources you get. If they're good and they have synergy, you can get a robust economy going. This is important since EVERYTHING TAKES MONEY. Need military units? Money. Need to build infastructure? Money. Need to avert a natural disaster? Money. Need to spy on your neighbors? Money. If you don't have it you simply can't do anything but hit next turn. And since your resources drive much of your economy....basically you might as well quit out and restart if you draw crappy ones. That's not strategy, that's simply poor design.\n\nAs I said, you don't have enough levers. You have access to about a dozen sliders that are either generally on, mid-way or off. Once you've set these tinkering doesn't help much because they're long term sliders and, truthfully, there's very little evidence that they do anything substantial (more on feedback later). Need to boost your standing with your neighbors? There's no lever for that - there's about 5 conversation options and once those are exhausted (ONE TIME USE) there's literally no point in talking with your neighbors except to renew trade deals.\n\nUnemployment is another great example of not having enough levers. There's literally one option in the entire game to boost employment (foreign visas). If that's off already then there's nothing - zero, zip, zilch - you can do about unemployment. It doesn't matter if you're running a $30m surplus, you can't hire more people into the government (which is 1 of hundreds of things in the real world a government could do to boost employment).\n\nI said I'd talk about feedback. There isn't enough. Why did your surplus go from $30m to $22 this month? No idea and there's nothing to tell me why. Why is unemployment high? No idea. Heck, what is the unemployment rate? No idea. What's the GPD? No idea. What resources are in demand? No idea. Why does my neighbor not like me? No idea. What impact did moving a slider have? No idea. You get the point. No feedback + few options makes Jack a Very Unhappy Boy.\n\nThen there's the bugs...this game isn't Early Access. There are game-breaking bugs to be found - ones that will absolutely destroy your game. For instance, there are about half a dozen special projects in the game. They're not that exciting to be honest but they're there. If you decide to invest in one (you do so with an up front cost and a monthly fee) and somehow that project gets canceled or fails, the game will continue to deduct that monthly fee FOREVER. So you end up continuing to pay in perpetuity for a dam that was never built or a nuclear program that was stopped due to international pressure. There's no excuse for a bug like this, especially when it's been reported but not patched. That's just one of a few bugs that I've come across. *shakes head*\n\nThen there's the graphics (meh - looks like something from the early 90s), the tedium of watching your guy walk around the office, the lack of any real replayability and just the feeling that you're really not in control of most anything that makes it pretty bland.\n\nConceptually, I'd like to play a game like this. But Rouge State has too little content, too little feedback, too many bugs and is ultimately too forumalic to be much fun.","January 13","false","4.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","1"

The use of retro graphics (unlike many games) is not an excuse to use for poor graphics, the graphics are very well done, with a modern use of perspective-animation, good atmospheric voice acting (A rating sound and graphics).  The gameplay is engaging, the randomization is just enough to give you a great new play each time, while maintaining the integrity of a very well designed branching plot and poli-strategy.  The unlockables for new plays are well thought out.  It is not perfect, there are certainly very unusual characters/logos in the game, which scream indie developer forcing their own pet ideas.\n\nVery enjoyable game.","October 29, 2015","true","24.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Surviving is difficult, and unlike other mangement survival games like Long Live the Queen there is some randomness, which can ruin the experience for some, but it also increases replayability. Many things threaten your survival, revolts from factions within your populace (patriots, liberals, captialists, and fundamentalists), your power hungry brother, your military, your own government's cabinet, your neigbors, democratic rebellions, disease, envnironment and financial crises, and even the meddling United States.  It may take several playthroughs to see all of these threats, and the most problematic threat to your power is almost never the same on back to back new games.\n\nThough random, you do have hints to what you should focus on that are simple to miss, such as paying attention to random events, analyzing the breakdown of people who are in each faction or using information gained through your intelligence agency. However, that being said there are some good things that are always good -  keeping a large surplus of money around of diasters and investing into your economy and social programs with somewhat high taxes.   I also like how this game can be subtle.  You are actually a dictator and one of the scenarios confirms this when a group threatens your regime with a democratic revolution.  This is easy to overlook because the game rewards you for being a benevolent dictator, and the absence of elections during the whole game is easier to miss than you think when the game doesn't paint you as the stereotypical evil dictator.\n\nThis game may turn off some with its unpolished retro graphics and empasis on strategy over a story, but I believe it targets a specific target demographic well.  If you are ready for challenege, can overlook a somewhat dated presentation, and are aware this is more of a survival/management game that rewards for you playing to the situation faced rather than roleplaying as you see fit, this is the game for you.","October 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Land of revolution, intrigue, and grenade-based goat-focused sporting events!\n\nRogue State is a politically-themed roguelike infused with a surprisingly deep and satisfying level of strategy. The core of the game focuses on keeping your popularity high with your four key factions: capitalists, patriots, liberals, and fundamentalists. At the end of each round you are faced with a random event. How you choose to deal with these events may have positive or negative effects on your factions, on your neighbours, or even on your relations with the US. Balancing all of these factions can prove challenging, but after a few games you start to "see through the matrix" and understand how to best manage your country.\n\nThe game features a charming sense of humour that never overstays its welcome, and the writing is very effective. It's clear the developers have a strong understanding of political science and used that knowledge to help flesh out your role as the Glorious Leader.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who enjoys strategy games, political simulators, or indie games with a good sense of humour.\n\nWould dictate again.","April 9","true","16.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I played about 5 hours of the game (based on length of recorded footage), despite it saying I played 1.\n\nSummary:\nIt's type of game that solid in a lot of aspects, but doesn't stand out necessarily in any way. It does a good job of putting you into the shoes of a political leader as you have to balance the different factions and their loyalty while still attempting to keep your regime going and yourself in power. There's a lot of factors that play into that, as it creates a spider's web of different factors affecting your reign over the people. But I will admit that it may not be my cup of tea, as while the simulation factor has some good elements to it, it doesn't necessarily stand out in any single way. The visuals can be awkward at times, and the UI could be clunky and has scenes that are unnecessary. The randomization element does feel realistic, but at times can be horribly punishing as your house members ask you for things that are just not feasible. There are times where the game also is inconsistent in tone and goes one step too far, where it actually starts to effect gameplay. Rogue State is a solid game, but it's hard to sit here and say that it's going to stand out. It's a title I'd target in a sale, or for those who like geo-political games.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iwM8dEwbsI\n\nLists:\n+:\nThe difficulty of balancing different factions and still being successful in your overall goals delivers on a strategy and simulation element. Makes you realize how hard it would be to be in an environment such as this.\nDoes a good job of hitting on core issues in the current media environment, without taking sides on the issue as well.\nHandles the subject manner well without offending any one. This isn't necessary (I don't think it's necessary to make a game that makes everyone happy), but special effort was made to show all sides of things, which I appreciated.\nEffects of decisions have consequences both seen and unseen, but you can figure out what the unseen has done in the background. Makes every decision that much more important.\nLike the resource management of the game and how it affects your factions approval: smart use of export/import mechanisms.\nThe game can have it's humorous moments in small moments here and there, especially in the newspaper portion.\n-:\nSometimes the game's humor works against itself. It's great that they went the humor route with a chicken leader, but being unable to know what he's actually saying and having to react hurts the game in the long run.\nFelt like the 4 items a turn system was unnecessary to the experience, as most of the time it didn't get used unless you called up all the other factions over and over again (which could hurt you).\nSometimes the randomization element went too far, and asked for something that couldn't be possible for the time frame in question. While it adds challenge, it hurts the realistic portrayal of the game, as members of parliament asking for some of the ridiculous things they did after a regime was just toppled would get them laughed out of the real world.\nThe visuals, while not core to the experience, leave a lot to be desired. Certain animations and presentation elements work against the game from a time/simulation stand point.\nNever ended up using the military, it seemed way too hard to get it up and running over time due to costs. This is low on the list due to the fact that it may just be my incompetence.","October 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you are an Indie fan then I would definetely recommend this to you, though keep in mind that I personally do not feel as if it is worth the current 12.99 EUR they are charging for it - I bought it when it was on a 50% sale - in my opinion that is more apropriate of a price.\n\nPlease continue on making similar games, I will definetely buy them and can only re-iterate that this game is equally interesting and challenging.\n","November 25, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You are the leader of the new government of Basenji: a fictive country of Middle East based on the name of a dog. It's up to you to restore the pride and power of your state and create a reign that last for thousand years...\n\nGraphics: The intro is nice, based on pictures well drawn. The game takes place in your office and situation room. Every selections of menus makes your avatar ( a man or a women) move across the rooms and open/use appropriates elements related to menus. The game looks nice, only characters are a bit "frozen" and loose in realism. Something very nice is the presence of a newspaper. You can check some important info  and every headlines feature photographs depending of recent news. The only really problematic thing about newspaper is the color of text. When some white letters are on black and white photos it lacks in transparency!\n\nMusic: Nice oriental tunes that stick to the atmosphere of the tile. Voice acting is correct but not impressive. Nothing special to say about this aspect of the game.\n\n\nControls: Choosing the office of the character is a good and a bad idea. Especially if any menu selections forces you to wait for your avatar to move and activate the selected item related to it. Need to check relations and trade? Select the phone and wait your man or women to take it. Need to read newspapers... wait him or her to cross the room to open it. Ect... ect... ect... Very annoying especially about trading and diplomacy. But let's talk about gameplay would you.\n\nGameplay (the long part) : You are the leader of a so called Rogue State. After having created your president/future dictator, you must appoint your ministers and your brother Farouk to vacant roles.\nThe first issue of the game is the presence of Farouk, a general famous in the revolution and loved by the people.\nYou can't trust him and sacrifice a part of your ministry for him. Considering he's a burden, you are forced to put him in the worst job: intelligence. Every other seat are important and quite early shows the limits of the game:\nLacks of information (funny when you think that intelligence is a dark and useless aspect of the game).\n\nSo you have 3 others politicians, randomly generated and members of 1 of the factions of the country: Patriots, Capitalists, Fundamentalists and Liberals.\n\nThe game acts around turns where you have to do actions and try to give the best of the time you have at disposal.  To manage factions you have to choose Policies and try to balance popularity between every faction. In general to please your people acts around reading the newspapers to see how much percent of factions compose your country and after you try to balance the most important ones and please them with buildings and ministry favors. Consider that policies can change from a turn to another without any drawbacks and you have a first clue of how simplistic the game is.\n\nBut this is not all because in Rogue State you can build things...\nAt beginning you must rebuild the country and industries. Few choices with not much impact crosses your path, like amnesty for previous members of brought down government or not. This part sum up quite badly the reconstruction of a country after war. When done you can produce 2 resources and access to 3 panels: Army, Social, and Economic.\n\nVery simple, a building rarely give permanent bonuses and quite often asks for a lot of funds to give a one-time bonus that might be spoiled by a random event. Because events are common in the game.\n\nIndeed every turn has events, completely random that influence factions, popularity and loyalty.\nVery often you have to sacrifice a faction and even pay lot of money to get rid of these unpleasant events. 40 % of your country is full of capitalists? Only focus on money and do not care of environmental events.\nMany fundamentalists? Nevers authorize western corporations in your country. Ect… ect...\nExtremely boring, it is amazing to see ridiculous events such as the Meteorite when if you have a space program... you can put a device on it and change its course... But if you don't it will blow one of you buildings.\nGoodbye freshly built Stadium! Goodbye Sweetshop!\nRidiculous.\n\nBut that's not all. A building requires money. You can trade with the 3 neighbor country bordering your country.\nYou take your phone and give a call to each leader to find the best prices and sign contracts for export or import.\nResources are random and very often you won't have the one you need to please your factions.\nOf course good relations gives better prices, also the market influences the prices.\nBut to know what kind of resource your neighbor needs depends of intelligence... and if you remember that intelligence is a completely unexplained element.\nAdd to that the fact that every phone calls uses one of the 4 segments of time that composes a turn... you bet that trades are horribly basic and falls into boredom very quickly.\n\n\nRogue State tries to play at war too. That's why the situation room is right next to your office...\nYou can buy troops, influenced by Army buildings in terms of price and deployment time. Each unit has attack and defense. And of course, the more powerful the more expensive.\nThere is a situation map where you can move your "pawns" and declare war but without any infos about attackers or how to manage fights.\nYou can also manage intelligence and secret projects that takes time and money but bring (apparently) very powerful effects... but you won't have time to see them finished.\n\nBecause: You remember of Farouk ? Your dear brother waits a moment of weakness to turn upside down your government.\nAnd it's where the game fall into a waste of time because you are forced to mass tons of units and rally many favors to temporary slow the revolution prepared by Farouk (don't forget to click on the button on top right because the game doesn't even takes time to explain this...).\n\nIt is so empty and baffling that i never succeeded to survive this moment.\nEven if i had 3 factions pleased and a nice popularity but not much money... i've lost the game.\n\nBecause in Rogue State you build, makes your country a safer place by building tons of institutions and nobody gives a @@@ about it. Even taxes are unexplained and you can tax 50 % of your income and know absolutely nothing about its effects of the population....\n\nRidiculous.\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\nRogue State is a disappointment. Too simplistic, the game falls very quickly into boring text reading and random events that causes havoc into your miserable tries.\nEven managing your ministry is a joke where ministers acts stupidly and asks for ridiculous actions.\n"Move units to this country border!» Even if there nothing wrong with them! "Arrange a meeting with the President of The United States in few months"... and you don't know how to do it even if you invite dozens of time an ambassador with your lame speech...\nForeign diplomatic relationships where you have to wait for intelligence that never comes or so basic trade options that any decent management game wouldn't have dare to mix a camel/pony looking animal with a water bottle to create fast food that will make religious fundamentalists upset but Capitalists happy...\n\nThe most incredible thing in Rogue State are TV speech which are completely useless and empty.\n\nRogue State is a shame that shows peoples of middle-east as stupid and incoherent where random elements cripples a gameplay that could have been great.\n\n\nToo bad.","October 18, 2015","false","3.5"," 40 of 72 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","40","72","2","8"

Each year is divided into several turns.  Given the topical nature of the game and limited but repayable scenario I recommend it for those who want to experience a fairly standard government game with unique flavor.  The graphics and sound are functional and some of the touches, like having the U.S. ambassador answer the phone and meet you, are cute touches but one wonders if the time would have been better spent elsewhere.\nRogue State occupies an incredible is the sense of place and time.  The setup is that you’re managing a newly formed country after an Arab Spring style uprising and must appoint your more popular younger brother to the cabinet.  You must balance the wants of multiple factions (Capitalists, Liberals, the religious community, etc.), security concerns, economic growth, and foreign policy with three neighbors.  Overlooking all of this is the United States.  The Role of the U.S. is similar to the cold war powers in the Tropico franchise.  While able to be used as a boon too much negativity could lead to an unacceptable outcome.\nTo a gamer that has managed elf kingdoms, star empires, defeated the Allies and communist scum in WWII what Rogue State provides is a truly unique sense of place and time.  That the events are closely modelled on recent events in our world are truly interesting and show a great care by the creators.\nRogue State is as much an “art” indie game like Gone Home, The Novelist, or Papers Please.  By playing on a gamer’s sense of min/maxing it creates interesting choices between doing the “Right” thing, roleplaying a certain style of government, and winning the game.  Enough options exist to survive several playthroughs even with a fairly linear story that you will lose at least once.\nIn many ways this game feels more suited towards being an IPad or Facebook game.  The turn based structure gives incremental returns and at least one choice per turn.  The game typically is spent making a choice, waiting for the impacts to be felt, and managing a request from a faction or foreign power.  Balancing limited resources creates several “Ah-ha” moments during the first few playthroughs but a limited A.I. ends up making other subsequent games more about experiencing different story branches.\nI would recommend a purchase and play of Rouge State given the setting and interesting flavor.\n","December 15, 2015","true","35.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You're the chosen leader of an intermediary government attempting to rebuild the country of Basenji after the overthrow of a monarch. As you rebuild your infastructure and balance relations between the various factions of your society, you must keep an eye out on foreign leaders looking to exploit your vulnerable country. On top of all this, your brother is constantly seeking an opportunity to plot a coup deta against you. You have to keep a healthy relationship with the armed forces and your cabinet if you plan to keep your power in office.\n\nRandom events occur in every session, making every playthrough different. You will not know when these events will trigger, and they can disrupt your short term plans, leading to complete anarchy.\n\nThere are also interesting special projects that can be created in secret by your government. Some of these can lead to disastorous conflicts of interest between you and other nations, such as the United States.\n\nSome of these projects reflect actual real  life political conflicts of interest, while others are just silly and fun.\n\nAt the heart of this game is a satirical look at government overthrows, similar to the ones in Iraq or Libya. The game is more nuanced in its politics but parallels can be made in some of the gameplay and ideas represented.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the tutorial was not detailed enough to really learn all the features on my first playthrough. This made the game a real learning process in the first couple of attempts, but I was never mad or annoyed by this. I was never frustrated when I lost a game as for the most part failure was a consequence of poor long term planning. And when you finally do win, it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nGraphics - 7.5/10 I'm a sucker for retro and indie style graphics, and it was one of the things that sold me on this game. Granted, not everyone will appreaciate this art style, but it really fit the game. Some of the models for characters could have looked a little better, but overall the game looks nice.\n\nMusic - 8/10 Solid. Fits the theme of the game in every way, and any given piece of music fit an event in the game. The Basenji national anthem is possibly the greatest anthem ever made, right up there with Kazekstan.\n\nGameplay - 9/10 I can't praise the gameplay enough. This game is FUN. It's not as complex as civilization, or age of wonders, but its not trying to be any of those games. It has a unique gameplay style that is easy enough for anyone to learn that has the time or interest. No outcome is ever the same, because the challenges you face every time will vary.\n\nStory - 8/10 The story was fun. Depending on how long your regime survives, you'll see more of the story unfold. And because playthroughs aren't the same, you might see new story threads each time you play.\n\nIt's rare that I even recommend games, but I felt compelled to share my opinion of this game because of how much fun I had. Really. Check it out. If you're really on the fence about it, I'd recommend to pick it up during a steam sale. But if you're into strategy games, you will probably like this game. I think even adventure click game players might kind of dig this, The graphics and playstyle remind me of oldschool adventure games.","March 27","true","31.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is, at its heart, a resource management game.  This game is similar to democracy, with its sliders to change policies that affect public opinion.  Every turn, there are "events" that have implications on popularity, or resources.  For example, a newspaper prints bad things about you, do you 1. censor the paper 2. kill the author, 3. do nothing?  Each of those choices will affect a segment of your country's population.\n\nThe Good:  I love its zany atmosphere, and the game's ability to describe real-world "serious" into "funny."  The game got me wanting to see what happnens next.\n\nThe Bad:  I want to see what happens next.  After a while, some of the animation gets repetitive.  There are "dead" turns where all you do is hit "next turn."  There is also an issue with balancing (I feel) where min/maxing stats leads to a pretty droll game.  For example, putting taxes to 50% without much repercussion (even on hard) is weird.  Maxing out policy decisions for "good" policies like police or courts seems like a no-brainer, especially when the reward vs the cost is lopsided.  It should have negative to positive sliders for policies.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game worth the price of the discounted admission.","December 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Single events can either destroy or save you from a seemingly unescapable situation. I dont know whether this is a good or bad thing. It does prevent boredom and makes every playthrough different. But on the other hand, playing 'correctly' is not enough to succeed, which might lead to frustration if you just want to get your hands on the nukes (which I never did ;_;).\n\nThere seemed to be many possible events (of a few possible types, like every turn, or special events that I only faced once in the entire session)\n\nGeneral atmosphere was nice.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n-Too much randomness to my taste, needs more meaningful played choice. More ability to REACT to random events instead of just attempting to anticipate them (which is just a guess for whether that particular action will prove to be useful)\n-Cannot completely skip animations (you can click twice to skip most of it, but you cant skip ALL of it), kind of irritating once youve done the same thing 50 times\n-Not enough choices (less randomness would be required for more choices to work I think), like more countries, more detailed war system...","October 18, 2015","true","0.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The conecpt behind it is very well thought out. It was fun, but i would say that this game lacks major polishing. There was also i bug that appeared after about 2hrs of play. Random dialogue sections would skip, and your character would immediately jump to whatever you clicked on.  With the way the graphics are (retro graphics from the 90's? kind of appealing) and the lack of content and its diversity i would put this game at mid to late beta stage.\n\nWith some more work from the dev's this could become a real gem. I get the sense that dev's really liked this game but either had to much on their plate, or they wanted to rush this game out "as is" for some money. At a $9.74 pricetag i can say im not disappointed that i spent this much money, however i expect some more content, and a clearer set of instructions. (i could not find out how to sell military items instead of disbandment). This game is far to short to be considered more than a flash game.\n\n\nI give this game a 5.5/10 great first try, i hope to play this after an update or some such. (dont you dare try to charge me more money for DLC, in fact, dont even offer me any this would prove to me your intentions)\n\nEDIT: Also the military system is lacking. If i am attacked, i expect my military to have a report on our loses, (predicted) Enemy losses, and the enemy units that attacked. Anytime you use the military system, you are essentialy blind. Morale is a huge part of combat, if my miltarys morale is high i expect them to fight far better then if their morale is Meh. Also, ive had situations where an enemy makes peace, then immediately after attacks. As a side note, if i have excellent relations with the U.S. i expect some major help from them, in addition to other nations with poor relations with the attacker.","October 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For starters, it really depends on if you like this sort of strategy game if you should get it or not. Certainly not as complicated (not even in the same vein of complication) as games like Victoria 2 or EUIV, but still complex.\n\nMy biggest issues with the game, was that it was hard to grasp how the policies worked in conjuction with the parties, also I felt like certain policies should influence more or some parties should have more policies attributed to them. That being said, it's not very hard to keep all the parties in line, you just have to be careful.\n\nThe military doesn't exist. Like it does, but it's extremely neglibile and hard to grasp, the funds aren't really there to allow much freelancing with the military in the first place. It's also extremely difficult to fulfill the advisors requests sometimes, like they could just be out of reach and you either don't have the funds or the means to perform the tasks they're asking you to perform, which becomes frustrating very easily because next thing you know, shawty got low (low low low low) and your brother just took over the government cause all of your advisors hated you.\n\nSome of the infrastructure literally doesn't matter, like at all. I'm personally of the opinion that your game should be like a plate of food. Everything on the plate should be edible. Translated to gaming terms, everything should matter. If you have to spend resources on something, it should matter unless it's cursed or trapped or there's a specific reason why it doesn't matter.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting are.. Fine. I mean, they're not good, they're not bad. They're passable. I think better graphics and better voice acting and UTI would definitely help take this game to the "next level".\n\nYour speeches. Sometimes they'll end up making no literary sense, which is a risk you take when you have that kind of mechanic in a game. LUCKILY for Rogue State, it's a nice mechanic, just maybe should be fleshed out a bit better. In the same vein, diplomacy always feels a little clunky, and I wish espionage was easier or done in a better way because I shoot myself in the foot a lot and end up getting invaded from all sides like I'm Sasha Gray.\n\nFaro is a little ♥♥♥♥. Fluff that ninja, I hate Faro.\n\nAll of that being said, it's a fine game. Not a ton of replayability but replayability does exist. I think it simulates the parties well, I think it simulates the stress of running a country and making big decisions and taking risks and even managing a house of representatives well. I enjoyed it's simplicity, at times.\n\nIn short, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody that I didn't see struggling with games like Vicky 2 or EU4, but still loving strategy.\n\nOut of ten, Rogue State is my idea of a perfectly average game, so a 5/10. I recommend it, but don't expect a lot.","January 25","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many funny events and some easter eggs you get as you explore the dialogues and all the panels. It is actually a bit hard in the beguinning and I only managed to beat it after failing some four times.\n\nI found it enjoyable and would recommend it if you are into such gender and/or indies games, specially during sales.\n\nHowever, there are many features that I think could be changed to make the game way better. Although the first couple of runs may be quite challenging, once you get the hang of the ideal policies configurations and learn to never accept increases in your expenses during the events the game actually gets quite easy. It is relatively easy to be loved by all factions after some time and investments, if you remender to keep good relations with your neighbours so they do not invade you the game is already half won. The storyline events and crises to add some flavour, but end limiting the replayability after a few runs. Still, it took me quite some time to get the hang of it, and I still an trying to get all the secrect propjects, so I dont think the game is actually too short.\n\nThe main problem I see is the lack of depth given to some features. For exemple, there are many events, decisions and policies that affect the GDP, but these do not actually affect your income in any way. Should the economy and poliocies be revamped to have more variation and possible choises ( not an ideal perfect standar), the game would be way more interesting.\n\nThe war system is mostly uselless as of now, it costs a lot to build an army (mostly drones), and even when you win the batles you just loose some troups and nothing happens. Getting a positive armistice is quite hard and does not give any substancial amount of money. If the war system would allow for the conquest or great financial benefits with high political risks a whole new dimension would be added.\n\nDespite all this I did enjoy the game and will keep playing it some more as the secret projects and scenarios are fun, but with some more depth, simple changes and new buildings for purchases, I believe the game could become much much better","January 4","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/396090/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a free copy of this game prior to release for review. It is your right to disregard my criticism as invalid because of this fact. That said, I assure you that this has never affected, and will never affect, any of the content of my reviews.\n\nWhat is Rogue State?Rogue State is a management game, where you play as the leader of a middle eastern country. The whole idea is that you led the rebellion, man or woman, that overthowed a previous tyrannical power, and the people look to you to rebuild, and propel the country into prosperity. It is procedurally generated, with new countries, ministers, and events each game -- but there is one major constant that is present in every single game; your brother Farouk. He will be trying to undermine everything you do, and if you let your popularity dwindle Farouk will make his move and take over leadership by force. In addition to this you might have to deal with war, environmental and social issues, terrorism, financial crises, debt and more, so there’s a lot to pay attention to.\n\nPresentationI’m gonna begin this review at rock bottom. This game is presented abhorrently. It looks and plays like it was made 20 years ago. I mean, I don’t think there is any aspect of this game that couldn’t have been done in the 90s. Maybe aside from the resolution. In addition to the aesthetic issues, it played in a 4:3 aspect ratio and 30 fps and I don’t think it’s possible to go any higher than that. To me this reeks of trying to be overly-ambitious with the visuals; personally I think a top down pixel approach definitely wouldn’t be anything special, but it would be a lot cleaner and palatable than this; just as an example. If I try and twist it into a positive, then maybe you’d like the presentation if you have nostalgia for 90s point and click games? That’s the kind of visual vibe I get from it.\n\nMechanicsPresentation is important, but it can be completely overruled by solid mechanics. I thought about this for a while, but I think the best description of what this game is like, is Long Live the Queen but randomly generated. I feel like, at first, that seems appealing to Long Live the Queen fans (which I’m one of by the way, I loved that game) but actually that makes the game extremely challenging. I feel like if you knew everything in advance that was going to happen, you could maybe beat this game and reach the final turn 50. However, since you don’t know anything that’s going to happen, other than a few key events,  it becomes a game of luck rather than one of strategy. Everything can be going perfectly for you, but if suddenly you have a terrorist problem and you have to begin putting money into the intelligence agency, you can quickly find yourself in debt and you reach a point where, even if you stop the terrorists, your country hates you and Farouk takes over. This is compounded by the fact you are constantly pressured into spending money in the events that occur every turn. It’s very hard to deal with these situations when you are given such a tiny timeframe to combat them in. One of the more cool mechanics, though,  is that you have to make a speech every year and you pick what the leader says in the speech. Again, it’s cool, you have to make sure you don’t contradict yourself and stay relevant,  but even then it does get repetitive and eventually I just found it unreliable and clicked through it out of boredom. There are some fun ideas here, but ultimately everything is tainted by that unfair difficulty.\n\nStoryThe story is really just furniture, but the theme is pretty interesting to me. I like that you have the opportunity to run the country in whatever way you please. It’s a pretty good role-play game I think. There’s some social commentary mixed in with the turn-by-turn events which is interesting, and there's some pretty funny writing here and there. There’s a potential neighbouring country you can have called Chickenstan, and you can unlock a perk which allows you to understand the ancient chickenstan language. I will say that there are a couple of groaners in there in terms of the writing, but I have a suspicion that was what they were going for in those situations.\n\nVerdictNow it’s time for me to say whether I think it’s worth it or not. The game is $13 at launch. I’m just going to be blunt; for most people I wouldn't recommend this game. I was kind of joking about this earlier, but if there really are people who are nostalgic for this kind of look, and are really into the idea of role-playing as a middle-eastern leader then yeah sure I’d recommend it -- but I feel like that is an incredibly tiny subset of people. Frankly, you’re only really going to like this if you're big into management games, and even then there are better management games out there. Prison Architect is a great game that allows you to actually build the prison as well as set things like policies, prison schedules etc that offers everything that Rogue State does only better. Even smaller games like Game Dev Tycoon and Long Live the Queen get a bit of an edge over Rogue State. It’s a shame, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles. I'm excited to see more from this developer, but Rogue State is one you’ll probably want to give a miss.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video version of this review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xut2Sn_Q2W0\n","October 16, 2015","false","6.2"," 29 of 57 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","29","57","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/396090/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","To read my full review, click here; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/rogue-state-review/\n\nRogue State offers a nice balance of legitimately challenging and outlandishly bizarre. As the leader of a small nation, you’ll have to make tough decisions; either run your nation as a democratically elected official or as a selfish dictator. While I wish there had been a little more, there is a surprising amount of content to be enjoyed here. Choices you wouldn’t consider important might break your career between all the nations and citizens you have to keep happy. Plus, there’s a country of sentient chickens. The game gets a couple extra points for that alone.\n\nI’m not sure I would make a good leader. This was my thoughts as I made trade deals with the glorious nation of ‘Chickenistan’ for their goats. It comes down to communication, and I don’t speak Chicken. As my economy tanked, and my approval ratings dropped like a rock, all I could think of what how those sneaky Chickens would use my missteps to their advantage. Now, that may sound racist- but it’s actually animalist.\n\nRogue State is obviously a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does provide a difficult challenge to those who want to take a stab at being the head of state. You’re elected supreme leader of Basenji (which I guess makes you a nation of dogs) after the nation has overthrown the previous government. You’re left to decide which way you take the developing land- from dictatorship to democracy. Sure, you may want to be a liberal bastion of pot smoking hippies- but what’s to stop the other nations from steamrolling over your little drum circle?\n\nThe game has a system that looks complex at first but becomes a breeze shortly after learning the ropes. You’re able to make policy changes, such as your rules on alcohol, minimum wages, and death penalties. The more you alter them, the more you’re bound to upset one group or the other. If you approve public executions, you’ll make the nation’s ‘Patriots’ happy, but the ‘Liberals’ will not be pleased. You might want to make them happy by enforcing a livable wage, but then the ‘Captialists’ will be on your bad side. Allow businesses to run on the Sabbath, and suddenly the ‘Fundamentalists’ start sharpening their knives. Obviously, making any group happy is a hard task, and the game quickly becomes a game of “who do I want to ♥♥♥♥ off less?”\n\nSince the previous party left the hall a mess, you’ll have to take your modest income and rebuild your nation. You can do this by cranking up the taxes on individuals, or trading with other nations. No matter what you do though, you don’t want to end back up in a recession- otherwise you’ll start to see even more rioting in the streets. So, do you focus on rebuilding your commerce, your education or just slap a bunch of uniforms on loyalists?\n\nEvery day begins with an event, with you needing to make a decision. It might be an oil spill off your beautiful tourist-filled beaches or a dead cabinet member, but each time you’ll have to make a decision that may destroy your reputation. You may discover that you’re building that brand new hydroelectric dam on top of an endangered species of rodents. These decisions could negatively affect either of the four main big groups and might even look bad abroad; so choose wisely. Once you start sliding, it’s hard to recover from the political tailspin.\n\nOnce you’ve built your infrastructures, laid out your policies and settled all of your trade deals, then it’s time to build your defenses. You can invest your money into soldiers, or you can dream bigger by throwing a ton of it into developing weapons of mass destruction. These choices are well designed, and usually leave you debating your morals against your self-preservation. I’d like to think we’d all try to be as altruistic as possible, but it seems the game is played best with a dash of Martin Shkreli thrown in.\n\nAllow me to explain a little about my first shot at the big chair and how it all horribly ended. See, I tried to be very liberal on my first playthrough. Mostly Democratic- maybe a little more left-leaning than I should’ve been. With every progressive choice I made, the Fundamentalists ate me alive. Soon came the capitalists, and the Patriots; I couldn’t do anything to win any group. Tough crowd this middle-east area, am I right!?\n\nSo, after they ousted me and sent me on a plane to my own private exile, I tried again. This time, I decided to start talking out of both sides of my mouth. This strategy worked well for a short time, but after awhile I found out that it really didn’t work any better. I told the other nations around me that I hated America (kinda weird that the USA is the only vilified outside nation), that I didn’t trust the United Nations and that we shouldn’t ignore the ‘Old Ways’. Then, when it came to policy, I simply voted down the middle of the road. I guess that made me a do-nothing president, because despite my excellent 90% approval rating, my army suddenly left me. I was quickly attacked by another nation, who wanted all of my money. I agree to the extortion, and shortly after a rebellion overthrew me. Those damn Chickens; I gave them a hell of a deal for our electronics, and they sat back and did nothing.\n\nOutside of that, there’s not much more to this game than your main office and the war room. The game does do a great job of creating the impression that there’s a whole land outside of your little building, so it does feel larger than the three screens you’ll see. Every decision you would think you could make is here, and it should provide a nice distraction if the prospect interests you.\n\nI guess in closing, I imagine it’s a good thing I’ve never thought about running for a political office because I’m awful at it. Simply awful. At least this game allowed me to have fun with that knowledge, and I learned a lot about my laurels in the face of trying to appease my voters. I enjoyed my experience with the game, and I would recommend it to anyone with illusions of grandeur. Rogue State requires a nice balance of loyalty and fabrication and an ability to balance several different groups; that is if you don’t want to end up like the last guy.","October 26, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also, factions seem to randomly hate you or like you for no obvious reasons, even though you haven't changed policies whatsoever. Too many turns, I found myself with basically nothing to do and just skipping to the next turn. Maintaining even a half-way decent military is virtually impossible, and actually gaining enough intelligence to use that military well is equally impossible, as it takes huge amounts of money to do either.\n\nOverall, this game basically presents you with an enormous mountain to climb, and gives you absolutely none of the tools necessary to even begin to remotely even consider climbing it. It has generally just been a terrible, frustrating experience to play. I wouldn't even remotely recommend it unless you like to play games where the objective is to get as frustrated as possible without ever having any fun.","October 25, 2015","false","10.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Why does one have to "walk around the office" to interact with everything? Why not just have a view from the desk and spend the time on animating that, rather than some zombie-shuffle across the screen to look at a map?\n\nBetter to save your ISKies on a Crusader Kings DLC.","November 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gameplay is too simple. The animations are slow and some can't be skipped, so annoying. The devs seem to have balanced policies (and the "papers" policy unlocks) how they think they are, not what they really do. A lot of the policy papers unlock "bad" things, like weapons dealing and counterfeiting goods and money.\nWhile the gameplay is too simple, there are looots of menues and screens to figure out. All with those dumb animations between opening them. At regular intervals you make speeches to the people, and can make promises, but you can only fulfil those promises if a random event pops up that gives the option. There is no education spending policy?\n\nAll in all, this game doesn't simulate anything resembling a real country, just has random events and odd policy areas (read: budget expense policies). Maybe younger gamers may like it, but it will not give any educational benefit in how countries are actually run.","October 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","2"

I was initially impressed after my first playthrough, but after a few more the randomness became annoying.\n\nThe policies feel like they do absolutely nothing and are counter-intuitive and not well explained.  While there is a basic link that shows what GDP, for example. is affected by regarding the policies, the constant reports of "recession" and "high employment" never go away no matter what you do.\n\nAnd if there is a way to improve them, they aren't at all explained.\n\nChanged my "recommend" to "not recommended" after familiarity with the game.\n\nBy the way, your "ironic" headline of "Rally against apathy draws little support" isn't at all ironic or funny.  People who would rally against apathy would show up.  People who were apathatic would not.  It would be ironic and funny if it was "Rally in support of apathy draws little support."","October 18, 2015","false","4.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

You can buy an item you already bought which increases your wealth an infinite amount of time or buying an item that increase your approval an infinite amount of time. This makes money or approval not matter anymore, hence the game is just a series of repetative events.\n\n\nThe war board where you attack other nations glitches and turns your screen black for a couple of minutes or crashes you.\n\nConcept is amazing, but the game is poorly designed.\n\nPrice should not be more than $0.99-$3 as you are playing once.\nI know the game creator spent a lot of time on this, but it's not good enough I am sorry, but your concept is amazing.\n\n\nWays of making the game better? Stock market, actual wars including movies and footage, increasing military power (not 50 units maximum the entire game which makes USA the strongest), increasing the number of countries (entire world), when being invaded you run off with limited wealth and coup another country, increasing military options, etc...etc...","October 30, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

The graphics and game play are choppy and the animation is worse than the Lord of the Rings animated cartoon from the 70's.  Take my advice, The Democracy series gets you the same mechanics with a hell of a lot more options and fluidity; without the choppy gameplay and god aweful color schemes.\n\nThis game is a Pass.","December 31, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
