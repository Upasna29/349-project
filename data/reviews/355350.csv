The graphics are fluid and colorful and the screen can get pretty loaded with bullets and enemies at times without the slightest hint of slowdown or stuttering.\n\nWhat shines the most about this game is the ability to equip your ship with different weapons. You can position weapons anywhere on your ship and even change the direction of fire. There are a lot of weapons and I've unlocked seven so far. But it doesn't end there. You can modify weapons so that they behave differently. That blaster that you added to support your stock weapon? you can modify it so that bullets home into enemies or spread the shots. Add a few of those blasters to your ship and you have a fearsome killing machine.\n\nYou pick up the weapons and modifiers as you fight through each level. It seems the loot is randomised and some of the weapons can be different from their stock varient. I picked up a bunch of lazer weapons only to come across the "Zapper" which is the lazer weapon modified to home into enemies. Awesome!\n\nI'm really digging this game and I can say it's one of the better shooters on Steam.\n\nHighly recommended!","August 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You can even adjust the direction of the weapons and upgrade them with modifiers and all of a sudden your laser beam splits into two beams or gets a bigger range.\n\nTen difficulties can be chosen between every checkpoint. [corrected]\n\nEvery 5 stages there is a mini Boss and every tenth stage there is a huge one. As far as I have played they are pretty easy if you learn their pattern. The game as a whole is not that hard and it becomes easier the more you upgrade your trashcan ... sorry ... your fighter. But with an almost infinite amount of stages in the game you will sooner or later reach your limit.\n\nThe controls are simple: Move around, fire (all weapons at once), shield. That's it. Use a controller or your mouse if you like - both works well but adjusting the firing angle of a weapon with an analogue stick is just a pain in the ♥♥♥.","August 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Each mod drop will also have a rarity level with rarer mods having stronger effects and costing more to apply thus driving you to clear a few more levels to see what you'll get and/ or gather enough scrap to mod your favourite weapon. Last but not least you can decide exactly where to place each weapon and at what angle to point it, want some weapons firing directly upwards or downwards? Just rotate them and you're set: in fact certain enemies or bosses might be easier if faced with an unconventional setup.\n\nReign of Bullets has enough original concepts to make up for its lack of story or straightforward gameplay, it might not hold your interest for as long as titles with more depth but it is a good game nonetheless and a great way to spend a few hours shooting stuff up.","December 28, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think Raptor: Call of the Shadows was a better game and I was playing that back in the mid 90's.  The flexibility in this game is tremendous, you can totally customize your ship, which normally I find really enjoyable but in this case I feel like it's a bit over the top.  You can just spam 7 weapons on your ship and upgrade them all with targeting and bouncing and piercing and then all you do is just hold the left mouse button and win... I feel like there's not enough space on the screen for proper dodging and aiming and since ALL weapons can be configured for targeting it pretty much removes the need to AIM your weapons.  This genre is one of my favorites but this one really doesn't have the flow that I was looking for.","September 20, 2015","false","6.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/recommended/355350/","gsuorez","Grayson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/","291 products in account","Excellent job balancing a variety of upgradeable loot against increasingly-difficult enemies. Later levels require more skil, as enemies have new behaviors, bullets and patterns. This isn't a "that blue enemy is red and has twice as many hit points, this time" kind of shooter. Serious care was taken to make sure that the difficulty is progressive and well-balanced.\n\nMeaningful differences in weapons and their variety of upgrades, with good reasons not to have all your guns facing forward.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty casual, even on the hardest setting. You'll have to replay most 2 or 3 times to get a perfect score (which affects drops), and you'll occasionally come up against a level you don't scrape through with a C rank, on your first try. Died 3 times in the first 20 levels, so not too bad.\n\nThe worst inventory management interface ever developed. The button labeled "(un)equip"? Neither equips nor unequips weapons. When I want to unequip a weapon, I either sell it off, or click the "(un)equip" button and wave my mouse around the screen clicking for a few seconds, before it returns me to the menu and the item isn't equipped any more. Still haven't figured out what I do to make that happen.  Weapons have upgrade slots, you can rotate them any direction, and are in a list of easy-grab menu boxes. But there's no drag and drop. Every change you make requires as many clicks as you could conceive of it possibly taking. There are detailed stats measured in arbitrary, meaningless units (wonderful! My gun fires 10 "titan miles." After completing the first 20 levels, I still have absolutely no idea how far that is). It's an obtuse, clunky, horrendous inventory system.\n\nAnd the menu bleeps sound exactly like Skype alerting you to a new message. Why would you do that?","August 19, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Despite the name, this isn't one of those Japanese "1 hit 1 death" bullet hell games, and that is a good thing. Although the amount of bullets flying at you at certain times is pretty high, the game still provides you survivability with upgradable health meter and shield.\n\nThe challenge is good on lower levels, but if you want to test your skills to the max, you can always up the difficulty level (which this has about 10 to choose from). This also increases your chance for better loot. The loot consists of different weapons, weapon upgrades and scrap, which you use to upgrade your ship and weapons. The loot system is nicely done and I felt like most of the weapons have their purpose.\n\nThe story isn't a story at all, but you don't really need it, since this game clearly focuses more on level and grinding type of gameplay (clear the levels as well as you can -> better rank). Also the music is really bad and bland. I was hoping for a more pumping and epic soundtrack for this, but you might aswell just mute the music and play your own.\n\nAll in all it's a nice SHMUP "snack", but not worthy of a "dinner" -status. Still, in my opinion everything was done right in this type of game except for the music and level variation.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics (10/10)\n- Gameplay (9/10)\n- Controls (keyboard in game, mouse in menus) (9/10)\n- Loot system (9/10)\n\nCons:\n- Level variation (4/10)\n- Music (2/10)\n\n-- Final Score: (7/10)\n-- "If you like SHMUP-games, you should definitely give it a try"","October 16, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
