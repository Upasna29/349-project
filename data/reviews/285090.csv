So much that it feels more like a buggy reskin of the game instead of its own. The lanes, the resource gathering, multiple types of enemies, even the units are all copied from there, but with hardly the same amount of polish that PopCap used on their title. And to boot, while PopCap is still an active dev, at the time of this writing the dev for Robowars hasn't signed onto Steam in a year. An entire YEAR.\n\nI tried making a profile, made a male one. Wanted to see the female, a text box in Russian pops up. Try entering a name, nothing happens. Game is essentially locked up, had to restart.\n\nUpon entering again, we're given cheap dialogue with grammar errors abound, followed by gameplay that barely explains its quirks and mechanics. There's no details, no stats. No way to tell other than looking at life bars how much damage a turret does. Or how much we heal for.\n\nThere's no explanation for how to activate some things, like the tower that supposedly powers up your turrets. Or how long it works. Or if it's even passive. Same with the PvZ Garlic clone; no telling HOW to activate it, so enemy soldiers took it down and kept going.\n\nThe windowed / full-screen button is in the level hud right above the Repair / Dismiss / etc functions, not in the actual menus. The pause button is over there, no ESC key here.\n\nThere's no reason given for why some units cost money, while others are from the resources you collect. Or if you get them back at the end of the level. Which, if they're destroyed, creates a limited economy that threatens you to conserve them, or just not use them otherwise.\n\nThat's a problem in itself, though, since you're barely given enough time to start a defense layout (unlike PvZ where the ramp up was well done) before enemies swarm you. So you HAVE to use your limited use units, from your extremely small (5 cards up to the 9th or 10th stage before I quit) selected hand to take down waves that don't stop.\n\nEventually you can get up a defense, but at that point the game becomes a Repair spam city as your turrets and units do mystery damage to enemy units whose own details are scant at best. And all of this is wrapped up in a sci-fi military tone too blasé to care about.\n\nDo yourselves a favor, Comrades. Skip Robowars, go get PvZ if you haven't already, and play a good tower defense game.","November 11, 2015","false","1.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

And that these units will only be around for 1 battle.   So you spend a few thousand to buy units and beat the level which gives you a thousand, surprising you without those units next battle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoanoS/recommended/285090/","SoanoS","SoanoS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoanoS/","986 products in account","Basically a mediocre Sci-fi themed lane defense. Think of Plants VS. Zombies but with robots. There is nothing really original about this game, the game mechanics are directly lifted from Plants VS. Zombies, including manual pickup of a resource that pops out of the reactor (sunflower). This game feels as if the developers spent half an afternoon wondering which game they could rip off and almost 20 minutes on the story, and 15 minutes coding this.\n\nIt tells a lot about this game that the first time I tried this game I was able to break the tutorial level because I did not place my towers exactly in the designated spot and the only way I could exit the game was ALT+F4. The game has many bugs like that where the player is able to break the appallingly poorly scripted "missions" and end up stuck with no other option than to quit the game.\n\nNow, the graphics are not terrible but they are mediocre at best, and the enemies are uninspired and dull. The talking heads narrative is stereotypical and dry, and the dialog is badly written and rife with spelling errors and broken sentences. The story is the typical "They found some magic mineral on planet X and now they are at war!"-tripe and it feels like it was written by a third grader. The grammatical errors in the game are just embarassingly bad and stick out like a sore thumb. While I understand that the developers may not speak English as their native language they should have at least TRIED making an effort.\n\nI think that for the asking price of €12.99 this is straight up robbery. Only buy this if you get it 90% or more off.\n\nTL;DR:\nAn overpriced, weak, unfinished and buggy scifi-themed Plants VS. Zombies clone.\n\n3/10, would not recommend.","February 29","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's like PvZ, but yet it has some interesting features (expendable units and traps for example). Initial levels in the game are very easy to complete. Once you hit around level 7-8, the levels get much harder though. There are a lot of different towers, units and traps you can build up in your deck. At last the game looks very nice indeed for a tower defense game.

You do get cash at a fair rate during each level, but the game doesn't tell you that any vehicles and infantry used can be REFUNDED BACK INTO YOUR STOCKPILE.  This is necessary to know in order to progress.\n\nI got this game for free, I played it for the cards, and I still felt this was a waste of time.  In another time, this would have been a browser game.\nAvoid.","March 16","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
