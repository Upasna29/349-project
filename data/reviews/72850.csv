"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112775620/recommended/72850/","76561198112775620","Dovah","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112775620/","68 products in account","I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.\n\nPart of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.\n\n\nIt contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.\n\nMany times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.\n\n\nKilling a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.\n\nNot only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.\n\nSkyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.\n","June 14, 2014","true","100.2"," 2,264 of 2,520 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","264","2","4","56"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended/72850/","fancyfishie","Fancy Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/","796 products in account","THE ELDER SCOLLS V: SKYRIM - An open world RPG of epic proportions, a true masterpiece\n|| 9.5 ||    Score    Comment        Graphics    9    Skyrim has a free High Resolution Texture pack available as DLC (and if you can run it I would highly recommend it), but even without the graphics are clean with nice details and textures. Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods (readily available from the steam workshop) gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas, highly realistic characters, followers and NPC's. With over 24 thousand mods (at the time of this review) you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine (the sky really is the limit). There is of course a performance trade-off when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so I recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you.        Audio    9    Music is grand and epic, very fitting to the feel of the game. Sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat. Personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit: M'Aiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester: Cicero.       Gameplay    9    Skyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow - no problem. Skyrim is often compared to its predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind) to highlight some of flaws in the game, and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused (oh? another cave filled with draugr you say?) and there are other occasional glitches, considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor. Skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series.         Story    10    So much detail, so much depth, the lore and background to the Elder Scrolls series is second to none. In Skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from children's stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands. Talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center. Skyrim is rich with background and story, as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world. Quests are (with a few minor exceptions) interesting, challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it.        Replayability    10    You only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much Skyrim has to offer. Personally I had already completed this game many times before I got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg, I'm sure it wont be the last time I play Skyrim either. Modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations, characters and quests.         Overall    9.5    An outstanding game, if you haven't tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience. The DLC's available (Dragonborn and Dawnguard) are worthwhile playing and some mods will require them (so pick up the GOTY if you can).\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

I mean, the map's all over, they expect me to actually walk to each place, there's barely any quest markers, I don't know where the hell...Screw it, I'm going to walk in that direction and see what I find.\n\nDay 5: Hey, this game's starting to flow a bit now.  The quest system is starting to make sense.  It's kind of fun to wander about and explore these random caves and what not. Plus, my toon looks pretty cool with this helmet with the big horns sticking out.\n\nDay 10: I'm uh...I'm not sure, but I think my wife may be angry with me.  I told her I was going to go play some more Skyrim, she said 'fine, whatever I'm going to be."  Hope I'm not spending too much time with the game! I can't help it though, now that I figure out how the quests and exploration works, it all feels pretty good.  I think I'm going to play with some graphics mods, that realism mod sounded kind of cool.\n\nDay 15: How in the hell do I have 110 hours played in this game already? That can't be right!  I didn't think I was playing THAT much.  Then again...I haven't seen my wife and kid for a few days now that I think about it.  I uh...maybe I should go check on that, make sure they're okay.  I'll go just as soon as I'm done forging these iron daggers.\n\nDay 20: My new wife Lydia becons me back to to Breezehome, I've been gone so long.  The Dragon of North Summit is no longer, so it is time to return.  I feel sorrow for leaving her and the children alone as the war with the Stormcloaks rages on around us, but I am Dragon Born and I have a duty to keep Tamriel safe from the scaled death that soars high in our snowy skies!\n\nDay 50: I was once an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.","December 19, 2013","true","40.9"," 1,050 of 1,176 people (89%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","89","050","1","17","34"

Bethesda improves what has been done with Oblivion, putting a cure realization and amount of content that we never expected. After about forty hours of play, apart from the main quest, we did not come at the head of almost anything, many are content, things to do and those that perhaps we will never make. There is some venial sins and approach the statistics to which we must get used to, but the fact remains that Skyrim is a masterpiece, the kind that has a duty to live if you love RPGs and those video games that only some software companies are still able to do.","June 11, 2015","true","306.5"," 372 of 409 people (91%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","91","372","409","30","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/72850/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action RPG open world game, developed by Bethesda. This is the fifth installment in the series, being released worldwide on all platforms in November 2011.\n\nSkyrim is renowned for its vast open world that allows players to explore, in a first person or third person view. You begin the game and create your character in the same way you do with every other RPG game, choosing from various number of races which all have their own traits which suite different styles of play. After the opening scenes the world is your oyster and you can do pretty much anything you want. The main aspect of the game is completing quests for other characters in the game; and buckle up, because there are plenty to do. I spent the first twenty four hours of my play through just completing side quests for the random characters in the game, ones which have no major story behind them but still had their own plot to follow through the progression of the quest. This allowed me to explore the world to an extent that let me see plenty of interesting sights and to equip my character with new equipment, spells, and abilities.  Throughout the game you will come into contact with “guilds” these guilds offer you a chance to join them, but you have to complete a long quest line in order to help their cause. This adds another 20 hours onto your play through with an extremely interesting story line to each of the guilds, as well as some captivating game play and mission objectives.  After all that, you have the main quest, which one of the most  interesting I have played. Taking you from being a prisoner of war, right the way to being the Dragonborn and slaying dragons at will; the plot could be taken straight out of a movie, it is that good.\n\nGraphically, Skyrim on its original release does look good. It has a flush environment that pleases the eye, as well as some stellar animations. But as we all know about Skyrim, the graphics can be modded to extreme degrees using mods. I only used a handful of graphic enhancing mods, but it increases the visual fidelity of the game tenfold. The mods are incredibly easy to install if you use Nexus Mod Manager, and they just make the game look so much better.\n\nSkyrim is fully voice acted, every character that you come into contact with will more than likely have their own dialog choices to choose from, letting you dig deeper into lore if you so desire. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too, and the soundtracks throughout the game are some of the most memorable you will hear in an Elder Scrolls game.\n\nThe game can be played on various difficulties; I played on the medium settings and was moderately challenged. You will die, so you should be remembering to quick save often, and I was actually quite happy to be dying since I don’t enjoy games too much when I am an overpowered character just slaughtering everything in my path; there needs to be a risk of failure to make it fun.  Some quests and bosses are more challenging than others, as well as a good amount of puzzles that you have to solve too.\n\nSome people complain that Skyrim is as big as the ocean but has the depth of paddling pool; I do not believe that to be the case. There is so much content in this open world, it is hard to do it justice. Every building has a story to it, something of interest that you should be checking out. There are hundreds of books about the history and lore of the world you are in to be found. Hundreds of side quests that will keep you going for days on end. There is adventure to be found in every direction that you turn.\n\nI am in the middle of my second play through of the game, and I have put about 50 hours into it so far. My first play through took me about 120 hours to complete, and bearing in mind, this was my first play through so it should be remembered that I was exploring more than usual. I am expecting my second play through to finish at the 120 hour mark as well, due to me wanting to finish all of the side quests and guilds quests too.  Even after you finish the game, there is still plenty to do with the modding scene still going strong; you can download new quests and adventures to play through. The possibilities are endless with this game and you will not be surprised to know that people have got their hours into the 500s+.\n\nAs with all Bethesda games, the game was launched with a number of bugs and glitches; most of these got ironed out in post launch patches, but you can still find bug fixes online to patch up any left behind. I would strongly recommend people play the game with the mod SkyUI. This makes the game’s interface much more user friendly for the PC player using keyboard and mouse.  It should also be noted that you can play the game with a controller; but for the optimal experience, stick to your trusty keyboard/mouse.\n\nTo sum up, everyone will probably have Skyrim, and most will have even played it – I put off playing Skyrim for years because I was put off by the amount of content on offer and I felt I would be swamped by wanting to see it all. But of course, I had to take the plunge at some point. I plead to anyone, who has been putting off playing this behemoth of a game, to just do as I did, and take that plunge. It is simply amazing and it still continues to amaze me even to this day at how good this game is. This is a show case as to how good gaming on PC can be, and you should definitely be experiencing it.  The game’s regular price is just £9, 99, which is absurdly low, so if you can get it at the sale price of £2, 49, you are practically stealing. You will easily break the hundred hour barrier with this game so you are well and truly getting your moneys worth.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.\n\nBut once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.\n\nIf you are interested in modding the PC version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxQ1JN_X-_Y&index=1&list=PLE7DlYarj-DdhDG41roBVJfNCqvO5MmKP","December 29, 2014","true","250.6"," 1,217 of 1,597 people (76%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","76","217","1","74","27"

Only other game would be Fallout New Vegas for its clean slate no story already laid out for you like Fallout 3 and 4. Both Skyrim and New Vegas allow you to be whoever you want because you start both games off with little or no back story ( Idk about other elder scrolls they probably like Skyrim also "freedom" wise but I never played any other).\n\nAll I have to say it's a fantastic game, Way better than Fallout 4 in tons of ways performance wise and content. Ive replayed the game 100 times and I still find places or people Ive never seen or met before. Not only that, the DLC's are wonderful as well and modded questlines and items give you 1000 different ways to play.\n\nYou could be a noble knight\nor maybe a thief\na mage\na spell sword\nan assassin\nan archer\na ranger\na hunter\na vampire\na werewolf\na bandit\na tomb raider\na soldier\na trader\nthe obvious dragon slayer\na vampire/werewolf hunter\na drug dealer\na blacksmith\na bard especially with mods\na mercenary\na priest\n\nAll these things and anything else you can imagine you can be, make up any back story you want and ta da, a whole new game to play.

But as i´ve got the request from a friend, i will give you my impressions nonetheless - So, please excuse me in advance ;)\n\nAnyways, what´s so great about Bethesdas latest part of the Elder Scrolls saga (i´m ignoring the Online part willfully here)?\nIs it the great story and rpg aspects? Uhm... i would guess not, as the story is there and it´s enough to give the open world some background plot, which you can follow or ignore.\nRegarding the rpg.. one has to say as hardcore roleplayer Skyrim was kind of a letdown from it´s predecessors (especially from Morrowind) with it´s double hand action and the great "streamlining" of skills and attributes.\nNaturally that helped though to attract a wider audience for this game, which further helped it to shine where it has it´s strengths.\n\nBut where are they now really? Surely Skyrim fully opened the Open World Hype, which was copied in various ways, for example some good (Witcher 3), some not so good (Dragon Age:I). Nowadays though it has lost it´s unique place in that regard.\n\nSo what makes Skyrim still one of the most played games on the Steam statistics? Naturally it is the modability, which i think is still unmatched by any other game in this genre and which let´s me even today wonder about the many screenshots players post of it, where you wouldnt even guess the base game anymore.\nMods, created by one of the most impressive and innovative modding communities out there.\nThis should also never be forgotten, nor from the mod users as well especially from Bethedesa etc. when thinking about wanting to milk money from that source.\n\nConclusio: Skyrim deserves it´s places in the alltime games rankings, ignoring all the shortcomings it may have, it offers an unbelieable variety of possibilities to use and play in.\n\nPoint Scale: 9/10","September 16, 2015","true","128.5"," 165 of 189 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","165","189","13","12"

The game does not shine with impacting story as much as other more focused RPG's because of the freedom it offers. That doesn't stop it from being a great experience to most and memorable at that.\n\nThe main quest takes a couple of hours but there is 300 hours of side content to go through beside it.

I had around 700 hours on it at that point with Skyrim :'( lost but never forgotten.\n\nOh Skyrim how I have loved you, part of me thinks of you fondly when I am outside and wonder if a dragur will appear from behind a random tree. Or a hole in the earth that the city excavates to fix the sewage system, is it time for the dragonborn? Never has a game had this much impact on my outward life like Skyrim has. It joins the ranks of Grand Theft Auto in my possibly going insane I need to stop playing phases. But it isn't your fault Skyrim, you are just what the doctor ordered for me. From the smooth visuals to the peaceful mountain tops or soaring on a dragon that minutes ago tried to eat me and killed my thousand dollar throw away horse.\n\nIf you need help deciding on this game then I have to say that there is no amount of words placed together that could convey what Skyrim is. Sure the main story is linear, it does not feel as epic as past Elder Scrolls games. But the sheer amount of fun and imagination that you can have in this game is leaps and bounds past any sandbox game I have ever played. But if you must hear my words and need reassurance then I will try my best. For Skyrim deserves a two part review.\n\nVanilla:\nI hate vanilla, not skyrim vanilla, but the flavor vanilla. Yeah that is off topic but I always assumed that people call base unmodded games vanilla because they share the hatred of the flavor with me. Unmodded Skyrim is beautiful and has depth and a heart that is unmatched, you can do anything, be anyone, but at the end of the day you either go home to your wife and children or battle legions of dragur in some cave for hours. Where is daddy? That deadbeat is picking pockets and forging daggers so he can pay for that glass case he wants to put in the armory to show off his junk.\nOr maybe daddy has a secret.....maybe daddy is a vampire who lives off the blood of others in the darkness of the vale. Or as youtube has shown me.....daddy likes elaborate hidden basements where he stores the bodies of his dead O_O\nSkyrim vanilla has it all and more, it is a work of art that deserves your time.\n\nModded:\nNow in a more serious tone I must say that this is now a different game. You can be anyone, do anything, create anything, and never run out of custom quests. You can upgrade the visuals to a stunning degree and bask in the hd glory. If you want skyrim you need to mod, you have to mod, it will call to you and you will answer and the sickness will set in and you will never be the same. But you will love it and you will never turn back. I can not go into further detail because I just can't, there are too many mods to even begin a proper review of modded skyrim. Maybe you want to weild a ♥♥♥♥♥ sword while dressed as Finn from adventuretime while pikachu follows behind you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asteo600/recommended/72850/","asteo600","Asteo600","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asteo600/","581 products in account","After 600 hours put into this masterpiece (and after I hopefully started to understand most of the lore behind the Elder Scrolls universe), I think I am ready to write a review for Skyrim.\nPersonally, the best feeling I had while playing this game was getting back to my home, after 3 days of fighting dragons, exploring dungeons and talking with NPCs. My kids were eager to see what I got them, so I gave them a lot of toys I have found in the huge landscape. They also had surprises waiting for me, plenty alchemical ingredients, and even coins.\nThere are many races to choose from, my favorite one being the Khajit, a cat-human appearance specialised in Sneaking and Thieving. Players who don't like this playing style, but generally want to play as a Khajit (or any other race) will be happy to see that Skyrim lets them make the character THEY want. If you want, for example, a Mage Argonian, it will be, of course, harder work than for a High Elf, but as much rewarding, because you will notice how your character truly evolves during the adventure. You have tons of options, tons of playing styles (which you can mix or even change at any point in the game if you feel like it).\nBut enough with characters. Other aspect which really felt unique and incredible was the size of the land. Not only Skyrim itself is huge, considerably one of the biggest maps seen in a video game, but it's also fullfilled with things to do. I never went from one hold to another without finding plenty of puzzles, chests, dungeons into my way. And, if you're like me, you don't want to rush through the main story and prefer instead to explore more or do miscellaneous quests, you'll be glad to take the side roads whenever you see them. They will take you to caves, mines, villages, farms, dungeons, and even dragon lairs. The exploration never had an end for me, not even after so many hours spent into the game.\nYou are probably curious about the combat system. While technically not one of the best I have seen in a RPG, I must admit that it had massively been improved since Morrowind and Oblivion. The ''Luck'' factor is not present any more, so you can't miss a shot when you clearly were very close to the enemy. The third person combat camera is now immersive, with tons of new animations and a new feature which I like a lot: the killcam.\nOne final aspect I'd like to talk about is the length of the game. While the main storyline is relatively short (took me around 10 hours on hardest difficulty), the side quests and guild quests make this game incredibly long. If you get Skyrim and plan on beating every single quest, clearing every dungeon, finding every landmark, you'd better get prepared for a very, VERY long journey. I myself haven't completed a quarter of the entire game yet (checked progress with a mod).\nThis game is by far my favorite RPG at the time being, its biggest rival in my opinion being Dragon Age: Inquisition.\n\nPros: + incredibly large landscape, mixing bioms from tundra to winter, from pine forest to stone holds;\n+ a lot of locations, free for player to explore; hundreds of dungeons, caves, which at their turn are themselves long and filled with enemies, puzzles, traps which will reward handsomely the player at the end;\n+ plenty of quests, most of which don't require the player to have completed the main questline;\n+ the introduction of dragons as enemies, for the first time in the Elder Scrolls games;\n+ residents of cities and villages all have their own lives and families. In the morning, they will leave their home and go to their job, in the afternoon they will take a break for eating, and in the evening they will close their shop and go back to their home or at the inn for some mead, where after a few hours will go to sleep;\n+ random encounters will let the player find more about the game; fugitives will tell you to keep their stolen item for a short while, followed by a scene where the owner finds you and asks you whether you have seen the thief (at this point, you can lie, you can tell him where the thief went, or you can be most honest and give him his item); couriers will once in a while give the corespondence to you, which can lead to impressive new quests or will update your map with new locations; you can find farmers giving their cows as sacrifice for the giants, and many, many more other events, all unpredicatble;\n+ the leveling system has been improved since Oblivion: after you have a high level, you will no longer see ALL enemies wearing the Daedric armor, instead you will continue to find packs of bandits, some of them having leather armor and others having more powerful armor and items;\n+ player can buy home in 5 holds, where he can place his loot, take his wife and kids and take a rest; this, personally, felt like a huge immersive feature in the game world;\n+ new powers added to the game world, called Shouts; will let you find out more about it x);\n+ you feel that your character truly evolves as you progress; more over, you can make what you want of your character: a good warrior, archer, thief, mage etc., by using perks;\n\nCons: - interface is worse than at previous games; you can't sort items by criterias (feature that had been available in Oblivion), you can't search for a specific item when you have plenty of loot in your backpack, and the aspect is generally bad; thus i recommend using a mod that changes inventory;\n- while reasonable, the game is filled with bugs, some of which can even break a quest; again, i recommend using the Unofficial Patches;\n- some textures and meshes haven't been vigurously worked by developers and they look bad for 2011;\n\nPersonal rating: 95/100 - Masterpiece","April 28, 2015","true","980.4"," 134 of 150 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","134","150","12","3"

Her reply\nechoes in your head, a shout. It's been days since\nyou last heard Summer-Rain talk to you, having\nbeen avoiding you in school. Your grades have\nbeen slipping, and the boss at the bookstore is\nunrelenting in his idiocy.\n\nAfter a hot shower and instant noodles cooking\non your desk, you sign in to Steam once more,\nthumbing through your games before seeing\nwhat many consider to be one of the greatest\ngames ever made.\n\nTHE ELDER SCROLLS V:\n\nSKYRIM.\n\nCold chills run down your arms and your head\nbows down a little in a small form of reverence,\nas you remember you have heard many things\nabout Skyrim, but never got around to playing\nit because of your runaway relationship with\nyour ex-girlfriend, Ms. Novocaine. After a few\nbite-gulps of your noodles (chicken broth, no\nless) you click 'Play'.\n\nYou enter Skyrim a prisoner, taking almost an\nhour to make sure your character is perfect\nfor this game. Alduin, the World-Eater dragon\nruins your execution and the world of Skyrim\nis now yours to freely explore! Join the rebel\nStormcloaks trying to free Skyrim as a nation\nunto itself, the Imperial Legion, who wish to\nreintegrate Skyrim into its borders or simply\nskirt both sides, choosing neither.\n\nA million and one side quests keep you\noccupied and then some, with a vast array of\nweapons and armor sets for you to go nuts\nover. The mods are insane, with you downloading\nall the Assassin's Creed outfits and taking a liking\nto running around in Shay Cormac's templar\nuniform from Assassin's Creed Rogue.\n\nIn time, you break a supernatural curse that\nafflicts the Thieves Guild, become a Nightingale,\na sort of superpowered Thief hero for the guild,\nwhile after another series of missions you save\nthe Wizards College and even become their\nHeadmaster. You lose track of time and black\nout, at the critical moment where you trap Alduin\nwith the 'Dragonrend' shout.\n\n"Hey." A voice calls you from the blackness.\nYou wonder if this is Oblivion, and the voice\nsounds sweet as honey. "Wake up... please\nwake up." Your eyebrows scrunch in a raised,\nquizzical way. Is it Meridia? No... too sweet.\nAzura? No... the voice sounded too kind.\nPerhaps she was Noctural? The voice was\ntoo sensitive, and not like Nocturnal's regal\ntenor. You open your tired eyes.\n\nOnce more it seems you're on the floor of\nyour room, and Summer-Rain is cradling\nyou with your head in her lap as she peers\nover you. "Welcome back, truant." She says\nin a Noctural-like way, sounding more like\nthe Daedric Prince herself. You struggle, and\nfeel bristles on your face brush against your\nhands when they accidentally graze you in\nyour stupor. Stubble.\n\n"It's been 10 days since I last saw you in\nclass, truant." Summer-Rain scolds you,\nfolding her hands and pouting in her\ntsundere-like style. You feel your face\nagain, and think of how the most beautiful\ngirl in the world has seen you at your absolute\nworst now, and all because of this game.\n\n"Hey!" Summer-Rain snaps her fingers in\nfront of your face, her face growing redder.\n"You listening to me, Truant? You can't\nplay games like this all the time and skip\nclasses! I won't always be there for you all\nthe damn time-"\n\n"Summer." You state plainly, and it is\nenough for her to fall silent. You look at her\ndeliberately. "I wanted to lose myself because\nout of all the things I've lost or I've had to\nbear, I cannot stand the thought of you\ntreating me like Ms. Novocaine did."\n\nTears sting your eyes and roll down your\nface as Summer-Rain looks down, looks\naway and holds herself with her own arms,\nas if she has seen something impossibly\nstrong break. "It's how you've been\ntreating me after that call, Summer." She\nlooks up and tries to reach you, but you\ncannot. Not after the truth and memories\nthat you once knew this girl for the longest\ntime in the past, and she ignored you out\nof some misplaced sense of nobility.\n\n"No, Summer. No." The words are spit out\nin desperation now, as you shrink from her\ntouch. "Get out." You hiss. "Get out." A\nsharp crack echoes out in your room, and\nyou feel a sharp pain across your face.\n\n"Truant!" Summer-Rain shrieks, her face\na mask of insane fury and a half-smile,\nher eyes watering from holding back her\nfeelings. She shouts at you once more.\n\n"My teeth to your neck!"\n\nWith a crash, both of you end up on the\nfloor, Summer-Rain staring into your eyes,\nboth of you wild-eyed and frantic, afraid of\nwhat the other might do. A few seconds\npass, and Summer-Rain lets her eyes flutter,\nlooking overcome by your emotions.\n\n"Nivahriin joore. What twisted words have\nyou uttered my way?"\n\nShe holds you fast, there and then, quietly\ncrying in the crook of your neck. You hold\nher, your Summer-Rain, and you know even\nif things go back to normal later, for this\nmoment, the girl you've known from your\nclouded past is truly yours and yours alone.\n\nAfter a time, both you and Summer-Rain\ndisentangle yourselves and she busies\nherself at your computer, ordering you to\nclean up and not be late for class tomorrow.\n\n"I'm going to make sure you come tomorrow\neven if it means I have to come breaking into\nyour house to check up on you again."\nSummer-Rain states, taking over your game\nin Skyrim as you bathe and re-civilize yourself.\n\n"So... nothing happened again, Summer?"\n\n"FUS... RO DAH!" The shout echoes from your\ncomputer, Summer-Rain having finished off\na Dragon with a shout from your character,\nwho is running about with Shay Cormac's\ntemplar uniform and brandishing the sword\nDawnbreaker with Mehrune's Razor.\n\n"That's right, truant. Clean up and get some\nrest okay? I'll see you tomorrow."\n\nLittle would you know that tomorrow would\nbring the key to make Summer-Rain yours\nand yours alone, after an eternity of waiting.\n\nTHE ELDER SCROLLS V:\n\nSKYRIM.\n\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","375.2"," 132 of 161 people (82%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","82","132","161","106","9"

It can be 23:00 when you start playing and after what feels like 10 minutes it's actually 1:00. The grassy planes around Whiterun, the mountains in the Reach, the swamps in the Rift and the snowy tundras of Winterhold will make you want to quit real life and just live in Skyrim for the rest of your mortal life.\n\nBut beware adventurer! The province of Skyrim isn't all fun and games. It may appear to be a peaceful place, but once you enter the deep caves or get lost in one of the treacherous swamps you will see its true face. For Skyrim isn't just the home of the Nords, but also that of many dangerous predators. There are the Draugrs, who live in the many tombs under the face of the earth and will attempt to kill you if you enter their final resting place. Or the frostbite spiders, who will attack you with their poisonous webs once you're close enough.\n\nThe most famous predator in Skyrim would perhaps be the dragons, who are returning to Skyrim. It is your goal as the 'dragonborn' to put an end to this. Though you speak their language, which offers many advantages, they will not think twice about attacking you.\n\nSkyrim offers many options, like talking and helping out the townspeople, other adventurers or complete strangers as sidequests.\n\nWhen you're not busy with the main storyline or these sidequests you'll find out the province of Skyrim has alot more to offer. Roaming around Skyrim will make you realize how big it actually is. However, make sure you are prepared before entering the wilderness because as I said before, many predators will attempt to put an end to your life.\n\nThe $19,99 you pay for this game is a very fair deal when you consider how much time alot people put in it.\nI hope this review convinced you to buy this masterpiece.","June 1, 2015","true","691.0"," 75 of 82 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","75","82","7","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairAndFear/recommended/72850/","DespairAndFear","Senpai Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairAndFear/","766 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action role-playing video game series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\n\nSkyrim's main story revolves around the player character (called Dovahkiin) and his/her efforts to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set approximately two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. Unlike previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim does not require the player to select a character class at the beginning of the game, negating a problem which the development team felt that previous entries had by forcing the player into a rigid play-style too early into the game. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.\n\nThis game is so cool. I have played it several times and all times I played it differently. The story is great and it depends from your choices how the story goes. The world is huge so you can explore it as much as you want. I really like that you can be every type of fighter at the same time. You can be a wizard who shoots fire balls from one hand and hold a sword in other, so you can cut ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemies. I very enjoyed playing with bow, because when you kill the last enemy, sometimes you are rewarded with a slow motion replay. The music is good and really nostalgic for me. Whenever I hear one track from this game I want to grab a sword and go looking for adventures.","July 22, 2015","true","51.8"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","70","78","5","1"

With it's barren vast open world landscape & it's cast of interesting characters skyrim is the definitive RPG experience that you will ever get to play. In order to elaborate on this, I am now going to give you the reasons as to why you should get The Elder scrolls V Skyrim.\n\nPros Flying mammoths\nGorgeous game world with 512 x 512 & 256 x 256 textures ( 1024 x 1024 with the HD texture pack )\nExcellent companion AI that hinder quests by stepping on to traps as well as triggering them for you in order to make you feel more immersed in the game as well as blocking doorways & always being spotted by the enemy especially if you want to roleplay as a sneaky character. This is another feature that makes you feel more immersed.\nNo dependence on mods. Unlike the other games in the franchise Skyrim is not dependent on mods to keep it interesting even after 300+ hours of gameplay cause who doesn't love replaying the same opening sequence for the 6th time.\nEasy & glitchy dragon fights. Who needs challenging boss battles when we can just kill dragons & feel like gods. Screw timing & skill required in your average game boss fights. Skyrim did it right so much so that you don't even have to lift a finger in most fights. You can just let the other Npcs handle it for you. It's not like the game says that you are the only one who can kill the dragons.\nBroken quests. This is the most important feature of the game as it encourages the player to keep playing the game again & again in order to complete that quest. And at times it also forces the player to delete saves & hence reducing progress you have made so far in the game.This further increases your game time. Bugthesda are one of the true pioneers of this feature & other games have also started adopting this.\nPaid mods is the latest innovation that bugthesda in collaboration with valve have brought to the table for skyrim. Although Skyrim is not dependent on mods but it is still a good option for the players cause who doesn't want to pay for something that may or may not work & could possibly harm your saved game.\n\nTo be honest i can't think of a single con for this game cause it's just so perfect and i think i have made that very clear with the features mentioned above. I think my only gripe would be that the soundtrack is just so meh in my humble opinion.\n\nFinal verdict : 11/10\n\nSkyrim is a game that definitely deserved the critical acclaim that it got back in 2011 although it was released in the same year that saw games like i don't know Deus Ex Human Revolution, Batman Arkham City, Dark Souls, Uncharted 3, Witcher 2 but hey those games don't stand a chance against skyrim & all of it's innovative feautures.

I suggest you read his first.)\n\nCounterpoint\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\n\nWith about 300 hours invested in the game, yet only 23 (of 75) achievements under my belt, I think it's pretty obvious just how irrelevant Skyrim's social and civil problems were to my happiness there.\nIn fact, most of the quests that I actually did complete, were done so, coincidentally.\nHonestly, it didn't take long for me to realize there were little, or no, rules, in Skyrim, and after 2 or 3 hours I had my own thing going on.\nI had a nice, cozy house, several loyal companions[i.imgur.com], and I made a comfortable living by treasure hunting, and burgling.\nI seldom took on odd jobs, and stopped, altogether, doing other people's dirty work.\nWhen the war finally broke out, I joined both factions, received various missions and supplies, then, promptly marched off to spend the next 160+ hours just vagabonding. Through gold leafed woods, over frigid white mountain tops (often in my skivvies) I wandered through the wonder, of Skyrim, doing pretty much whatever I pleased.\n\nI invented my own challenges and achievements...\nI ran into a Stormcloak encampment, stripped off my uniform, and shouted "♥♥♥♥ the army!" while mounting the captain's steed. They totally killed me the first 2 tries, but I did get away with it, on the third.\nImaginary Achievement Unlocked: Section 8 (Perform and survive 3 consecutive insane actions against the military.)\nYes!\n\nI wanted to find ways to see beyond Skyrim's physical beauty[i.imgur.com], and explore all her other aesthetic qualities, like art, music, literature, and such.\nFor instance, Skyrim is littered with books and letters, and so, it made sense that we form a Traveling Book Club. During our journeys, if a book caught our eye, we'd stick it in our inventory. Then, after our evening meal, one of us would read their choice[i.imgur.com], aloud.\nAranea was partial to books on history, Erandur indulged his voyeurism with journals and diaries, and Lydia.. well, Lydia always chose cook books. Though she took no real interest in the art of cooking, there was something about recipes that she considered profound, and she would read them as if she were reciting a beautiful poem.\n\nAnd so, we traipsed through Skyrim.\nMinutes to hours, hours to days, days to...\n\nThen, one evening, somewhere around hour 290, I looked at my map and realized that I had been everywhere, and had seen, pretty much, everything. I had promised my allegiance to many, but had given it to none.  I had looted the dead, and robbed the living. I had read every damn book[i.imgur.com] ever printed.\nI had done Skyrim to death.\nThe war was still raging, the dragons[i.imgur.com] still owned the skies, nothing much had changed in that respect. But, that was mainly because the people of Skyrim had been just standing around, waiting for me to make it all better.\nInstead, I had decided to teach them a valuable lesson about depending, too much, upon others.\nAs Erandur might've said. "Mara helps those who help themselves."\nTo which, I would've added. "Hey, I never asked to be Dragonborn."\n\nI filled my companions inventories with jewels, food, and clothes, then sent them on their separate ways.  Then, I walked to the nearest, highest, snow peaked mountain, and shouted. "Game over!"\n\nIt was an alternative ending.\n\nThat was months ago, and looking back, now, I'd still say I had a good, long life, in Skyrim.\nI may not have much to show for it, stat wise, but a 900+ screenshot legacy, is nothing to sneeze at, either.\nAnd, yes, it's true that Skyrim is no better off, now, for my having lived there.\nBut then, after all is said and done, I kinda doubt that the real world will be either.\nSuch is the life of an underachiever.\n\nFootnote: I actually went back into Skyrim, while I was writing this review. Partially for some reference info, but mostly, just to sneak a visit to my old Whiterun homestead.\nI guess, it's supposed to be a comfort knowing that life goes on[i.imgur.com], without us?","January 19","true","294.4"," 49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","49","50","20","2"

It takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and I guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover.\nIf you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game has pulled off something I have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. It has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. World is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop.\n\nWorkshop:\nWhy does this deserve a special tab? Because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. Don't like any part of the game? Change it! Modify it! Add to it!\nA huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. Name what you want to do, it exists. ALL OF IT.\n\nCons:\n- Few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out.\n- A bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. A lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. This happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. I ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. But once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did.\n\n\nWho am I even writing this for? Is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? BUY IT. NOW.

Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. The game returns you to the continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.The combat in Skyrim is the  tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.Some death blows result in Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. All in all, Skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant RPG.","September 20, 2014","true","388.3"," 62 of 71 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","62","71","0","2"

I really have no clue from where to begin so ill JUST!DO IT!!\n\nOk, So Skyrim is one of the most perfect games (BETHESDA!) that I've ever played, fully honest with you guys, this game is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!\nThe incredibly great and wide open world, The unique missions (SO DAMN MANY!!), The huge amount of weapons you can use, from rocks to war hammers to balistas (mod..), bows swords - every middle time weapon you can imagine IS IN THE GAME.\nOne of the things I find which makes this game really unique is the huge amount of NPC's and different inviduals that you can communicate with, fight against (or get allied with), buy, sell, trade, deal, EVERYTHING is in this game,\n\n-Graphics: There's no argue in here, this is an 2011 game, and for that time this game was just a fantastic mind blow when it comes to graphics. The NPC's movements, the cruitures, the battle scenes, its all looks so sharp and great and so relaistic its sometimes even scary (For example, a bigass dragon that stands 1 inch from you and blowing fire on you. Thats nasty).\n\n-Gameplay: Well the gameplay of Skryim is just addictive, you can just play and play and keep on playing for days with out stopping cause of all the fun and joy this game can give and make to a player. The gameplay man, its just awesome! so many different fighting movements, arenas to fight on and just destroy your mouse and keyboard from the stress and feel you give into this game when you're in combat. To anybody who's into fighitng and combating, you really should try the Arenas in Nexus-Mods. They're just awesome.\n\n-Voice Acting & SoundTracks: GOOD JOB!!! As always, Bethesda knows what they are doing when it comes to Voice Acting in their games. "Can It Be?... YOU Are The New Dragonborn?" oh man, every NPC get his part on this game when it comes to voice acting. From fancy lords to warewolfs and vampires, from a cute little bunny to a nasty troll, the voices and soundtracks man... Also the whole environment sounds, its just magnificent!\n\nSo, before I summary Skyrim, lets talk about the different DLC's this game offers, ill summery them shortly ;) :D\n\nDragonBorn- I'm starting with this speciffic DLC because its my favorite. On this DLC you gain a whole new map in the Skyrim world. You gain a new city with new quests and NPC's and new unique weapons and cruitores. So I wont spoil you guys more than that ;)\n\nDawnguard - 1 word, VAMPIRES.\nThis unique DLC adds you the old days myth and war of Vampires VS. Werewolfs.\nannnnnd thats pretty much summerys it.\n\nHearthfire - So this speciffic DLC I can only recommend to people who feel like building their own house and having their own property... Nothing really to spoil, the whole DLC is that you get an offer to buy a land, build your house in there (Which takes huge amount of time...), decorate it however you want, putting 1 NPC in there to be the Guardian of the town or the leader of whatever... and thats pretty much it. I recommend buying it on some sale tho its only 5 bucks....\n\nSummary:\nSkrim, oh skyrim, 260 hours of my life I wasted on you and I dont regret not even 1 minute I playing you.\nDefinitely one of the greatest games of the century so far.\nThis game will WOW even the most sceptical guy on Earth. and Narnia.\nHighlly recommended!","March 18","true","259.8"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","94","50","53","14","11"

Skyrim. When I started the game, I did not knew how strong I will be hooked to the game. I am glad I bought the Legendary edition with all the DLCs.\nSo after completing the main quest, I've decided to write an review. 77 hours is what steam says, but probably 2-3 hours and loading screens and pause screen so around 73-74 hours is okey to write an review.\nOf course I like completing all kind of side quests and you can get the main quest much faster, but I love how the world is alive, I love to explore the beautiful land and interact with the NPCs. I've found many interesting stories, many interesting quests, funny moments that kept my addiction to the game and of course, even after so many hours, I still have many quests to play and I still did not complete the two DLCs- Dragonborn and Dawnguard.\nOf course this game is amazing and thanks to mods, the game is becoming quite unique. I am using some mods that tweek my game and make it very special for me and of course there are so many mods out there- Nexus (I have not tried it yet, steam community and many other sites).\nIt is up to you to chose a mod and play it.\nThe music is outstanding and it is contributing to the lovely atmosphere of Skyrim. The sounds of everything are very high quality and sometimes I just enjoy sitting on my balcony of my manor that I've build and just enjoy the weather, the birds flying in the sky and animals passing by.\nThe graphics are beautiful, even without any mods for it. Yes, the mods can make the graphics much more different and beautiful but know that you will need much better hardware to run it smoothly.\nAs for the gameplay, well it is a open world game and you actually can do almost everything you like- you can kill innocent people, kill bandits, animals, vampires, monsters, orcs, elfs, DRAGONS, trolls and many more.\nOh, yes, dragons.\nIn the beginning of the game you don't want to encounter a dragon, but when you level up and start making your character stronger, you start to hunt those flying leviatans. When you kill a dragon, you absorb his soul and this soul is needed to learn a new "shout". The "shout"s or the Thu'um s are pronounced with the dragon language, which sound like ancient nord language.\nAnd of course, you are the Dovakiin- Dragonborn with a dragon blood and the world needs you to stop the World eater- Alduin to stop devour the world. Will you do it or will you lost in the labyrinth of the mods, it is up to you to decide.\nI will continue playing the game, because there are so many things to do, so many mods to try, DLCs to play, naked chicks to watch, oh, boy, oh, boy.\n","December 21, 2015","true","128.5"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","54","60","20","6"

This was a difficult decision, but none the less my career will be full of adventure and creativity im sure.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nI stumble upon a small village in the middle of a lush green valley. The town is very cute and has lots of character, The trees lay down gently caressing the mossy roofs of the residents old homes. There is a quiet calm stream the flows through the center of town. yes.... this is my ideal place to begin my career.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nI start by scanning out the town guard's positions, from what I can tell there are only 3 of them. With such a small town who would ever think to need more guards?.... perfect... Now we just need to carefully pick our victim. I scan around, I see a few older ladies, a few older men, A boy walking with his dog.... But who do I choose? ... so many choices\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nWhile scanning the small crowd of residents I hear a women's voice from behind me say some type of vulgar insult about my clothing. I turn around to see a ugly women with a sneer on her face. She sticks her nose in the air and shoves passed me. I can hear her mumbling something else as she walks away but can't quite make it out. I think we found our first victim :)\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nI decided to quietly follow her, she goes to the market and picks out fruits and meats, she wanders over to the stream and glances at it for awhile, she makes small chit chat with another women. Finally she starts walking out of town down the road for a ways. I quietly take cover in the forest and sneak along. She leads me to what appears to be a small mill on the edge of town. She walks into the older looking home next to the mill. Its still daylight and I don't want to risk an attack that she can escape from... better wait till night.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nI wait until about 1am, its pitch black out and all seems quiet.... time to get a closer look at her home. I lockpick the door and sneak inside. The walls are decorated with all manner of animal heads, swords and shields. She has the fire lit and the light from it bounces off all the corners of the room. I find her quietly sleeping on a bed in the corner, I pull my dagger from my cloak and raise it. With one mighty stab she gives out her last breath and sprawls out silently on the bed. Now to leave my mark, earlier on I purchased a small quantity of blue flowers from a market, this will indeed be my insignia. I position her arms so that they are across her stomach, I then gently place the blue flower in her chest. A respectful position and a perfect mark for my career.\n\nJournal entry 7\n\nI have cleared out most of the valuable items in the house....*Door slams*.... "OH NO" I hear shout from behind me! Its the husband! I should have done my research better, I should have noticed the large pair of boots next to her bed, they were far to big for her... How could I be so stupid. The man turns and runs out the door... I'm going to have to catch him or else im done for. I give chase, as I burst out of the door I can see that he will get to town far before I can catch him with my dagger. I pull my bow out, im only going to get one shot, if I miss im going to have to make a run for it. I take a deep breath and steady my aim, I carefully pitch my bow up and down... trying to gauge his distance as he runs. I release my arrow, it sails gracefully through the air... then I lose sight of it....Did I miss??.. I wait...Horrfied... hoping... begging.... I see his body fall face first to the ground, a perfect shot, a perfect kill.\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nI quickly run over to the mans body, we are now only about 20 feet from town but luckily there are no guards walking by yet. I grab hold of the body and drag it into the woods. I decide that maybe its time that the guards know they are not in control anymore. I drag the body to the mouth of the stream that flows into the town. I pull him into the water and let go, the stream's current is weak but its enough to float him into the town. I proudly strut into town to await his body's arrival, the guards are all gathered around the center of town with lit torches talking. I wait patiently beside the market.... then I hear one of the guards yell "A Body!" The guards and 2 other residents run over to investigate, gasps and mumbling begin to develop around the group. I turn away and start heading out of the town.... My work is done here... Many more towns to visit in skyrim :)","June 1, 2014","true","34.1"," 98 of 129 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","98","129","0","6"

The story centers around Vietnam vet John Wayne, a devoted husband and loving father troubled by his past. When Jarl Snowden summons John to his court in Bethlehem the player is given the first key game mechanic, the "look at stuff" feature. This feature is innovative and fresh, giving the player a new way to interact with the game. Using the mouse, the player can move John's head and experience what stuff looks like through his eyes. Or, if you're a pro like me, you'll want to toggle to third person so you can see John's back aswell! This new feature has never been seen before in any game, and renders the genre fresh again.\nAfter Jarl Snowden talks to John about some N.S.A. leak scandal, you must take on the role of John's alter ego, Rage Cage, and spend the next day and half walking to Hyrule. Once there, King Hugh Jayniss informs you that you could of just fast travelled here instead of walking.

I doubt there is anyone who doesn't know of skyrim by now but i'll give you my two-cents. Skyrim is a action-RPG that plays out in a masvie open-world with thousands of side quests,things to plant/gather, and to fight. Skyrim is in a bloody Civil war between the Storm Cloaks and the Imperial army. But under the surface even more factions are fighting for turf, The Thieves guild, its glory long gone, strives to reclaim their title as masters of darkness. The Dark Brotherhood, crumbling and in despair seeks out new opportunities to return to the day when people feared them and respected them. The College of Winterhold, a old school for Mages, that fell into hard times after half of Winterhold fell into the ocean, uncovers a powerful relic that could allow Infinite wisdom or Infinite Destruction. That is just a sample of the deep story and background of skyrim. the world of skyrim IS alive and many a writer spent long hours making a amazing and life-like world.\n\nThe Best part about skyrim is there is so much to do! want to be a Vampire? you can do that! want to be a werewolf and murder people? you can do that! want to kill people and eat them for dinner? guess what? you can do that! (<-- You know that is a slight bit creepy.) but really, skyrim is an open-world dream. the main storyline is fun and engaging the side quest sometimes turn into their own winding paths that take hours to complete. this makes skyrim a HUGE source of fun and gameplay.\n\nthere are a few problems with Skyrim however. The game crashes often on some PCs. but some mods on the Nexus mod site will help with that. and of course with some a HUGE world there are also bugs a-glore. and with Bethseda gone off to The Elder Scrolls Online, chances are that they wont get fixed. But! the mod community has dealt with these bugs and most can be fixed by downloading the Unofficial Patch.\n\nthe Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods provide an endless source of game-changing content, from new armor to flying houses to brand new branching quests. and that there is the BEST part of Skyrim on PC, The mods available explode your game-content. you play as a king of skyrim, you can marry (and kill) multiple wifes. you can get thousands of new weapons, even lightsabers! Gamers with epic gaming PCs can download the free ULTRA HD texture pack from Bethsdea themselves, and if you want to take it a step forward you can download Ultra ENBs. Skyrim Really is a different game with MODS. . some players may feel that the game is too easy. there's a mod for that. some players may feel that the cities are too empty, there's a mod for that. some players may feel like there should be more NPCs. there's a mod for that. my point is that with the MODS available on PC you really can custom your Skyrim experience to what you want,so even if you already own Skyrim on PS3 or Xbox 360, you should still pickup The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Steam store.\n","April 2, 2014","true","158.0"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","63","78","0","3"

My journey with TES series is based on this very definition. I journeyed into TES starting with Oblivion. At the time, I didn’t find the game all that exciting nor filled with “wonderment.” I was bored with the game, I found much of the game” broken” and a lot of “bugs & flaws” within the game. The dungeons were long…tiresome and a chore to really go through.\n\nSo when Skyrim came out, I was very hesitant on playing it. When the time came to play it, I was moved. The Score of the game is absolutely stunning. I own the soundtracks to Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim (all composed by: Jeremy Soule) whom is Legendary in his music composition. Skyrim (let alone the entire TES series) wouldn’t be as is without him. He makes up a large “piece of the pie” of the greatness of TES: Series.\n\nTES:V – Skyrim what is expected to those anew to the series? Here is my exposition:\n\nI recommend the player to accomplish as much (if not all) the “Achievements” they can. The achievements for Skyrim will introduce the player(s) to Three Things:\n\n1.	Exhibition – this opens up the player to much of the great “creativity and artwork” displayed throughout Skyrim. The amount of “work” that went into this game (The Fine Arts: smithing, archane, enchantments etc…) there’s many classes to exhibit from. I myself Mastered: Archery, Smiththing (The Art of Forging Weaponry) archane, enchanting and sneaking... The Journey of the classes of Skyrim is to be “savored” and they will be rewarded.\n2.	Exploration – TES series is known for its “open-worlds” Bethesda has done exactly that in the Country of Skyrim of Tamriel. The amount of Scenery is to be examined. I myself was in awe on how much Beauty is throughout the game (from landscapes to the “heavens”) astonishing… There’s also the exploration of being introduce to the many side-quests that fleshes out the game’s story (understanding TES story-lore) to Skyrim itself on how much you really want to immerse yourself in TES Universe. I truly recommend if you want to enjoy the game’s full-potentiality.\n3.	Accomplishment – the “achievements” of Skyrim is to “flesh” out the game’s performance in full. To acquire the full-potential of the game’s nature. It’s to be enjoyed, savored and in the end when the player reaches that Last 75th Achievement he has fulfilled all of the game’s value. He has “experience” what Bethesda fully intended each player of their fan base.\n\nDoes “one” have to do all 75 of the achievements in Skyrim? No. Do I recommend it, yes because I’ve seen and experience (and from it) the appreciation of the amount of: Work, Creativity, Passion, and Value that went into this game; I truly look forward to the next installment of the series.","August 31, 2015","true","288.2"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","44","49","3","6"

That was the first Elder Scrolls game I was acquainted with and I was disappointed. Who knows how many times I started playing it and I always gave up after an hour or so.\n\nConsidering the above, I didn't expect much from its fifth instalment called Skyrim. But hey, I thought, I should at least try it and give it a chance.\n\nSo, there I was, couple of hours in the game, hacking and slashing the enemies and doing silly things like reading the books I've collected during my travels. Couple of hours after that, I bought a house and started stacking those books on a shelf inside. The weird thing was, the game wasn't about buying a house, books and reading and stacking them on bookshelf at all!!! A new threat has risen and you are a Dragonborn, warrior destined to do many great things. You must fight and prepare for what is to come, you must save the world!! But, as it happens, you can do many things besides that: read, buy a house, collect weapons, become an assassin, thief or a mage.\n\nThe world is so vast and it gives you freedom to explore and do your quests as you see fit and when you see fit to do so. Along the way, you will collect some awesome rewards. You will become the enchanter and blacksmith, you will be able to craft dragonbone armour and improve its characteristics by enchanting it. You will do many things.\n\nAnd that is what makes The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim so enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, my opinion of the series improved and I really can't wait for the next instalment of the Elder Scrolls franchise.\n","March 1","true","71.4"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","0"

I can honestly say this is one of the best games I have ever played and I will tell you why. I have had around 500 hours invested into this game across multiple platforms and playthroughs. (PC is the best version) First is the graphics, I've added mods but just the standard game is one of the best I've ever seen. The trees, grass, animals and the level of detail that the game includes is amazing! I literally spent about 4 hours the first day of its release back in 2011 just wandering through the world examining the different things in amazement at how detailed and beautiful it was. The second thing that makes this great is the commentary, it's all voiced and basically everyone can be spoken to in the game and everyone plays a part. (More on that later)\n\nNext is the content 100+ dungeons around 10 major cities and a few extra small towns there is much to see and explore I can honestly say through about 500 hours of gameplay I still can find new places or things I've somehow missed over the hours. Quests and random events are all throughout these places you will not run out of things to do (and if by some chance you do there are mods! haha). Now that being said most everyone in the game is "killable" and if you kill them it may stop a certain small side quest from being available. So you really have to make decisions wisely. Choices matter and if you don't watch yourself you can miss out. Which can hook you into another playthrough like I was. You can play mostly as a mage, as a sworded warrior, an archer or create something of your own it's all up to you! Now before I'm done I will add that the 3 DLC packs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn) are all great additions. If you have the money buy the Lengendary Edition of the game it's worth it. Dawnguard adds some extra gameplay and features, Hearthfire add the ability to build your own home and adopt children (actually really cool additions) then Dragonborn adds a whole new questline and location to play on. They are all worth the money and you will not go wrong buying this game. Only minor things not even worth mentioning are problems in this game and I would not hesitate to give it a 99/100 easy.\n\nBut as one final warning it is possible to lose yourself in this game. I've spent roughly 500 hours playing this one game and still far from laying it down. It can take your life and give you a virtual one (think with Hearthfire; home, wife, kids... A whole life!). It's an amazing game and I highly recommend you buy it.\n","December 2, 2013","true","33.6"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","12"

However, this is not implicated with the variety of weapons and armors in Skyrim, since there are too many equipments here for players to get, we can either choose to be an arc-sniper, a warrior, or a magician, they also differ from strength, which should be pretty obvious as an RPG.\n\nAs to the graphic designs, Skyrim does not disappoint us being a game released in 2011, we can see detailed artwork as well as decent visual effects.\nAbout soundtracks, the presence of many types of music is also shown in the game, be it in action, adventure, harmony or leisure strolls.\n\nAltogether, I cannot really find any major flaws in Skyrim, thank you for reading my review until here. Albeit I know that this game is very popular and most people are already professionals of this game, I hope that it has still been helpful maybe to some of you.","May 22","true","108.5"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","6"

Last I heard, Skyrim is already in the top 5 of the most played videogames EVER.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the game is flawless, infact, far from it. Bethesda has somewhat of an history of releasing games that at the first glance seem to be only half-finished. With Skyrim, this manifested in the form of countless bugs, strange situations,factions and story that many felt was inadequate and other issues. Yet despite all that, the game is the favorite of many and more.\n\nThe answer is community created content, ie. mods. Players saw these flaws in the game that bethesda didn't seem to acknowledge, and attempted to fix them, or improve the game, or add something new to it. The mods that the community has created for this game rank from the absurd to amazing. You want to replace all the dragons with the Thomas the Tank Engine models? Easy. You want to turn the game into a hardcore survival experience in a cold, hostile land? Easy peasy, Lemon-squeezy. The possibilities are near endless.\n\nSo, as an idea, the game is very good. As an actual product, it's clearly flawed. But when considered it as an platform for all these modifications? It's excellent. To me, the game with mods offers so many possibilities, it's mind boggling. I am the kind of guy who gets bored rather easily when doing the same thing over and over again. Thus, when playing  Skyrim, instead of trying to do everything with one character, I will focusing on to only a few key aspects of the game, and create a new character to explore the others. It is not a game to win, it's a journey to be experienced.\n\nSo, is this game worth buying? Absolutely. I recommend you get all the dlc's s well, so just go straight to the Legendary Version. And in the possible case that you are new to the modding and don't know where to start, both Steam Workshop and  the Nexus Mod site for Skyrim mods[www.nexusmods.com] offers a good way to start. And I am sure you can find help on the many skyrim modding forums on both internet and steam itself.\n\nA reminder here that you can only mod a PC version of the game. Console players are sadly out of luck in that regard.","November 29, 2015","true","871.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","31","34","11","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerMunger/recommended/72850/","DerMunger","[KHC] Munger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerMunger/","145 products in account","Let me take you back to mid-2011. When I first heard of Skyrim coming out later that year, I wasn't thrilled at all. Having played Oblivion briefly in the past, and not being convinced at all, Skyrim became the most over-hyped game I could think of. When it eventually went on the shelves and I had a few glances at the Let's Plays that popped up all over YouTube, I looked at it in sheer disbelief. It looked awful, very awkwardly wet textures, that was one of my main issues (honestly!). I decided, however, and that was after the initial euphoria with the gaming community had died down a bit during the frosty nights of early January of 2012, I might give it a go, once a legit price drop had occurred and the big hype had completely dispersed.\n\nSo then, in April of 2012 I finally ordered a retail copy from the UK. I had ordered it together with a dear friend of mine, that regularly orders games from the UK (on account that they are much cheaper there than in Germany), and he encouraged me to boot it up.\nI had a good time with it, but it was, well, just good. I had tried a few mods from the Steam Workshop for my first time playing, mainly the HD Texture Pack and a few other minor tweaks.\n\nI continued to play the game and eventually I became aware of the much larger modding community of the Nexus Pages. And this is where my interest in the game finally sparked immensely. Modding became more of a challenge and I needed help. This help came in the form of Gopher's modding guides. Gopher offered a variety of concise and easy to follow guides to modding games on his Youtube Channel, as well as, and that was the gist of it all a very entertaining series of Let's Plays of Skyrim. His play style is somewhat different to what I had had in the past, but it so verily applied to how I feel about games in general. Games are the perfect medium of literary immersion. A game can engage you on so many more levels than a book or a film can ever dare to. And that is exactly why Skyrim eventually became such a dear game to me.\nSkyrim is a game that rewards engagement in its lore. It can become so lively, so intricately designed, but only if the player is willing to go further than bluntly playing the game. It is a living, breathing world with a back story so rich, that one can not ever learn all of it. I myself regularly lose myself reading through the articles on the Elder Scrolls Wiki Pages, stepping from one topic into the next.\n\nThe Story of Skyrim is very iconic in the way that it is written. Joseph Campbell's "monomyth" or "The Hero's Journey" in which the Protagonist is called from his normal life to adventure, on a quest to save the world. There are obstacles along the way, wise teachers and climactic action. The Monomyth is a pattern that works well and it does so in Skyrim too. The internal development of the Dragonborn hero however, is up to the imagination of the player, and this is where immersion comes into play again. If you are not willing to immerse yourself in the game and identify with the Dragonborn, the game will have no lasting value to you.\n\nThe gameplay also intrigued me. Having slight prior experience with RPGs I have touched the basics of typical RPG game play. Skyrim however stands out from the crowd by making levelling an organic process. You swing a sword at an enemy - you get better at sword fighting; you get hit - your experience with armour increases; you mix ingredients together - you learn their effects and become better at creating potions. This process, this "learning-by-doing" feels very natural, very logical. Much more so than the typical RPG practice of gaining experience through completing quests or fights and then choosing yourself what you want to become better at.\nAnother great implication of this levelling model is that it essentially resolves the issue of class-restrictions. You can be whoever you want to be: you can be a heavily armoured mage, you can be a lightly armoured, two-handed weapon wielding killing machine, you can combine magic and one-handed weaponry, and, most importantly, you are allowed to do all of them at once if you choose to.\nThe Combat itself runs in real time, like its predecessors, and there is no automatic hit-and-miss calculation involved like it was the case in Morrowind for example, ergo, you hit - you hit, you miss - you miss; an action-style combat system. However, and this is a big however, there is no locational hit detection, so that head shots or blows to specific body parts on enemies generally have no different effect from hitting any other body part. This is made up by the fact that certain perks add chances of critical damage to their respective weapon types.\n\nThe world design of Skyrim at times is stunningly beautiful, awe-inspiring vistas, gloomy caves and warm, inviting inns. And then there are times, when everything looks a bit dull. This is owed to the fact that Skyrim is such a resource heavy game, that in the development Bethesda had to work with a lot of ambient lighting which is not always practical and doesn't look very good. Vanilla (modder's jargon for "the unmodded game") Skyrim, therefore suffers a few drawbacks in regards to its looks.\n\nAnd so, we come to my final argument. This argument may be the strongest of all, because it might eliminate all of the issues that I have with the game. It is the “moddabilty”. Through the use of mods, that can also be created by the player itself using the free Creation Kit that came with the copies of the game,  every mistake, every bug, every minute inadequacy can be remedied. If you don't like the look of something, you can mod it. If you don't like the way something works, you can mod it. If you feel something is missing from the game or something it is need of, you can mod it in. If something is broken, you can fix it with mods. Modding can add to the game in such a grand way, it can change your experience entirely, or it can just enhance it. And it can make Skyrim play the way you want.\n\nThis is what "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is all about: player choice. If you will, you can play it for a couple of hours and then never touch it again. But if you are willing to engage yourself further, there is so much more you can do with it. It can become your very own epic poem.","June 30, 2014","true","831.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/contentiously/recommended/72850/","contentiously","Contentiously","http://steamcommunity.com/id/contentiously/","477 products in account","Once upon a moon, there lived a khajiit called K'Lem.  K'Lem was not a bad khajiit, but K'Lem liked to collect things.  This is a story of K'Lem collecting things.  K'Lem had come into a land called Skyrim in K'Lem's quest for the collection of things, and because of the basturd legion imperial scum, K'Lem had lost all of the many things K'Lem's had collected, but that is not this story.  And so K'Lem had to begin K'Lem's collection anew.\n\nThe legion scum had even attempted to kill K'Lem, but that is not this story.  And what's more, sometime in K'Lem's recent past in a story that is also not this story, K'Lem was found to be a thing called dragonborn, and because of this, K'Lem was given a servant called Lydia.  K'Lem was not sure how this happened, but K'Lem was glad, for Lydia could carry many things, though she did not seem to like K'Lem very much.\n\nK'Lem needed a place to store the many collections of things that K'Lem planned to acquire.  K'Lem had lost all of K'Lem's things and coins, and the local places were far more costly than the coins K'Lem had, and so K'Lem decided to earn coins doing favors for the locals.  These favors bade K'Lem west, and so that is where K'Lem and Lydia set paw.\n\nVery soon, K'Lem and Lydia came upon a fort filled with bad men.  Bandits they called themselves.  They were bandit scum.  K'Lem was smart and thought it wise to avoid such men that called themselves this, and so K'Lem carved a wide path around the fort.  However, the bandit scum were quick to attack regardless of K'Lem's unprovocations, and Lydia was quick to reciprocate.  And K'Lem felt it K'Lem's duty to join Lydia in her reciprocation.\n\nK'Lem and Lydia fell the bad bandit scum with much mightiness!  The scum fell easily before the might of K'Lem and Lydia!  What wonderful moons that blessed K'Lem and Lydia that day!\n\nWhat's more, the bandits had things!  Many things!  Shiny things and not so shiny things!  And K'Lem was smart and had an idea.  K'Lem need not collect all of the things!  K'Lem could sell some of the lesser things to buy his collection place!  Maybe even this fort would provide enough lesser things to afford the place!  Thus it was that K'Lem and Lydia set paw inside the fort in search of more bandit scums and their things.\n\nInside the fort, K'Lem and Lydia were sneaky and killed many scums.  The scum bandits fell easily in this way, one and two at a time.  But they also found a not scum inside.  There was a nice Nord lady that gave talk and niceness, and K'Lem was not a bad khajiit, so K'Lem and Lydia let the nice Nord lady be.\n\nSoon, K'Lem and Lydia came upon a mighty bandit scum that called itself thug bandit.  Thug bandit was very mighty, indeed, and hurt K'Lem time and again.  One swing of thug bandit's mighty two-handed hurty thing made K'Lem's head go fuzzy like too much skooma.  The battle was hard fought and very long, and it took Lydia distracting thug bandit’s attention while K'Lem shot thug bandit with arrows for thug bandit to fall.  The mightiness of K'Lem and Lydia had vanquished the entire bandit band!  And K'Lem was glad and gave thanks to the moons, and relished in K'Lem's victory and all the many things K'Lem had won.\n\nBut K'Lem and Lydia could not carry all the things.  There were too many things!  But, Whiterun was still in sight, and K'Lem was smart and K'Lem had another idea.  K'Lem decided to return with Lydia to Whiterun to sell all the things K’Lem and Lydia could carry.  K’Lem planned to quickly return to the fort to collect the rest of the things.  K'Lem was amazed at K'Lem's smartness!\n\nK'Lem had not finished exploring the fort, however, and K'Lem was most curious about the unknown upstairs, and so K'Lem ran with most haste to Whiterun, and K’Lem and Lydia ran with such speed that even the deer were amazed!\n\nHowever, when K'Lem returned, the basturd legion emperial scum had taken over!  As if they had been waiting to move in!  The fort was completely renovated by the imperial scum, and all K'Lem's hard won things were gone!  All of the things!  What’s more, the basturd scum had gall enough to tell K'Lem that K'Lem did not belong!  That K'Lem should leave!  But this was K'Lem's hard-won fort!\n\nK'Lem was not a bad khajiit, but K'Lem had lost all his hard-won things, and so K'Lem was angered, and K'Lem decided to take the legion scum’s things as payment.  And so, once again K'Lem and Lydia were sneaky in the fort, and they took all the things they could carry while avoiding the basturd legion scums.\n\nAnd the nice Nord lady was still there serving the imperial scums.  K'Lem thought that maybe she must come with the fort.\n\nCertainly K'Lem could not leave without exploring the unknown upstairs and satiating K'Lem's curiosity, and so K'Lem went to the unknown upstairs to find that the basturd imperial captain had made it his own place.  And as K'Lem was looking and wondering what the unknown upstairs was like when it was the mighty and worthy thug bandit’s own place, the basturd legion captain attacked K'Lem!  For trespassing!  This was K'Lem's hard-won fort and K'Lem was being attacked by the basturd legion imperial captain scum!  But captain scum was no match for mighty K'Lem, and basturd captain fell easily!  And captain scum had so many things for K'Lem to take!  And K'Lem was no longer angered.\n\nK'Lem and Lydia went downstairs to leave the fort while carrying all the things K'Lem and Lydia could carry.  The basturd soldiers were still hostile, however, and one of them attacked K'Lem for trespassing!  Soon all the basturd soldier legion scum were attacking K'Lem and Lydia!  Many soldiers!  At least 8!  But they were no match for mighty K'Lem and Lydia!  Even 15 against K'Lem and Lydia!  Or maybe it was 25!  Mighty K'Lem and Lydia vanquished them all!\n\nK'Lem no longer wondered why the basturd legion imperials had moved in with such haste.  Certainly they had been no match for the mighty thug bandit, and they needed a mighty warrior like K'Lem and Lydia to vanquish the bandits before they could move in.  K'Lem decided the basturd legion scums deserved the death they received and K'Lem was glad.\n\nThen it was time for K’Lem and Lydia to gather all the hard-won things to collect and sell, but this time K'Lem took no chances and weighed K’Lem and Lydia down with everything in the fort.  All of the things. All of the many imperial things.  And it was a very long and tiring and laborious short trip to Whiterun.\n\nAnd that is the story of how K'Lem bought K'Lem's collection place.","March 13, 2015","true","474.4"," 66 of 92 people (72%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","72","66","92","75","6"

Wield or dual wield the countless amount of weapons in Skyrim and start slashing peoples!\nYou want to be a Sneaky Basterd? Level up your One-handed, Sneaking, Speech, Lockpicking & Pickpocketing and you can be silent as f*ck killing people and grab their $$$ or talk your way through to get things go down your way!\n\nIn this game, you imagine what you cannot achieve in real life.

After 3 years of its release, this game is still living and mod is one of many reasons Skyrim still one of the most played game. I myself play this game with using mods that increase immersive such as RnD and I imagine being a Solo-Player like Kirito with Elucidator & Dark Repulser.\n\nDo what you want, be what you want.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yomamafag/recommended/72850/","Yomamafag","Lad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yomamafag/","32 products in account","I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.\n\nPart of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.\n\n\nIt contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.\n\nMany times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.\n\n\nKilling a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.\n\nNot only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.\n\nSkyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.\n\nThe game has one of the largest active modding communities of any game. This helps to spice up gameplay and graphics. With new residents, new weapons and armor, incredible house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. You can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of Skyrim. It is worth to note that you should know the game to an extent before modding, as it can corrupt save files if not done properly.\n\nIf I'd have to rate it, it would be a 10/10.","August 28, 2014","true","346.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","2"

When this game was first released, it was still unfinished. There were many bugs and issues, some of which made playing the game difficult to say the least; However, it was still one of the best games of 2011. Over the years, these issues have largely been addressed and the game is now more stable. The visuals in Skyrim were stunning, absolutely stunning, when compared with it's predecessor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, released Six-years earlier. Using the then new Creation Engine, Skyrim is a hyper-realistic world for the player to explore much like Morrowwind, with a size similar to Cryodill in Oblivion.\n\nSkyrim has several DLC packs, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn all of which are a part of the Legendary Edition. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is a game every RPG gamer should have in their library. Most of the bugs and issues, present when the game was first released have been resolved. There is also a library of Mod's available for Skyrim if you know where to look to personalize the game the way you want it. If you enjoyed Oblivion, you should also enjoy Skyrim, as it has a more realistic world design from Oblivion, though is similar in actual overall size.\n\n~Potential Spoilers~\n\nSkyrim, takes place 200 years after the events of Oblivion, in the Northern Lands of Skyrim on Tamriel. You play as the Dragonborne, someone who has the ability to absorb the souls of a Dragon and call upon the magical ability, Thu'um, known as the Shout of the Dragon. While navigating the story to understand what this means, you are also caught in the middle of a civil war between the Empire, who are now allied with the Alderi Dominion, and the People of Skyrim.\n\n\n","June 23, 2015","true","75.1"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","30","36","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/72850/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","It probably already goes without saying, that if you don't own or even heard of Skyrim, (which you will give me a heart attack, if you haven't.) you're really missing out on a fantastic game. Borrowing many elements from this game's own prequels, everything from the leveling up system, to the wide arsenal of magic to be learned or discovered, the untamed, fearful dragons and monsters that lurk around every corner of the game's world, The carefree and quirky races that inhabit the beautiful lands, villages and meadows, and the many different hobbies with skills involved, such as cooking, weapon smithing, magic crafting, item synthesizing and studios book reading, This game is what I call 'fantasy ectasy' and is a king amongst most action, role-playing games.\n\nEach unique race has a special ability, that again is unique only to them and solely based on the player's personal preference. Such as the Argonian race, being immune to poison and the gills with skills to breathe underwater. Or maybe the wood elf, being the deadeye master of the bow and arrow. As you can tell, there are many races and strategies that would help out either sooner or later in the game, depending on the race of character you have chosen. What's best about this is the vast ways you can customize the physical appearances of these races, ranging from nose types, eye types, ear types, hair types, body types, etc. Even I'm guilty to say I've spent countless hours trying and failing, to create a Nord, reminiscent of my appearance. And if you ever need a helping hand with extras, look no forward to the mod community. They of course definitely help out not only with your character's physical appearance, but also along with everything else.\n\nThe world of Skyrim is diverse, solid, beautiful, secluded, peaceful, amazing, creative, magical and the list goes on. You could explore for hours upon end of this game's landscape and not be surprised on how much detail and development has been put into it. From the untouched wilderness to the ancient mythical buildings that dot Skyrim's land, it's definitely no surprise on how this game keeps you occupied and truly captures the imagination of magic and mystery in the process. It's as if a lucid dream came to the unconscious mind of a sleeping, video game geek, who is subsequently pitching a tent.\n\nThere's the main story with the long-whinded yet slightly repetitive missions, where you play as your main character and eventually learn that you are the legendary 'Dragon-born' and depart for one hell of an adventure, to save the beautiful land of Skyrim while causing a ruckus for bandits, wizards, giant spiders, the undead, the royal knights and all around powerful dragons at the same time. But, what this game truly dishes is out is simply a marvel to behold. And when I say this, I mean that this game is offering an immense load in the side-quest and mini-game section, along with the many uncharted locations and hidden caves that are just waiting for your epic hero/heroine to discover. With rewards and many different possibilities and alternate outcomes to unlock in this wonderful game. If you go out and mind your own business by robbing the local residents, just make sure to blatantly put a vase on top of their heads so they don't suspect you of theft and go into a killing frenzy. Just a tip for you all.\n\nIf you're into huge epic tales set in a fantasy and mythical environment, or just blatantly love a great storyline and narrative, with a huge variety of memorable characters, creatures, dungeons and dragons, this massive game of amazing preportions is definitely for you.","November 8, 2014","true","15.5"," 293 of 488 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","293","488","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/72850/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is built solely on the idea of discovery. In the very beginning you have no idea who you are, where you are, or why you’re aboard a carriage filled with condemned prisoners. All you know is you’re an outsider, and once you’ve reached your destination, your execution awaits.\n\nThe caravan arrives in the small forted village of Helgan, where you’re pulled from the carriage. Your captors fail to recognize you; they’re just as puzzled by your appearance as anyone else. Are you a man or woman, an Argonian or Breton? This is your first opportunity to ask yourself who you are and who you want to be in Skyrim; it won’t be the last time you ask yourself this.\n\nLucky for you, the execution fails, granting you an opportunity to escape Helgan. This is where Skyrim commences and where your story within Bethesda’s world begins. You’ve been told to visit a town not far north of your escape, but nothing other than the word of your new friend is there to compel you to visit it. The entire province is at your fingertips.\n\nSkyrim is structured in a loose manner, allowing the player to discover its world and various narrative strands at the pace that they desire. Characters will tell you where you should go, but there is never any real urgency to do any of it. The world is cluttered with distractions and what makes this experience unique is the distractions form the very heart of Skyrim. The core narrative, as it is, is a mean to an end, an excuse to pilot you from one corner of the world to the other. It’s hard to imagine anyone following a single narrative strand when it’s impossible to travel from one quest point to the next without stumbling upon some sort of ruin, cave, encampment or fort. The narrative has its high points, but it’s always made secondary by the next undiscovered location on your compass; and that’s because Bethesda wants you to pave your own story.\n\nUndiscovered locations dot the entire province of Skyrim, leaving the map a venerable piece of swiss cheese after a few dozen hours. Discoveries are the actual loot and tracking every single one of them down is the addiction that thrusts players headfirst into Bethesda’s fiction. Every location, small or large, is populated with its own personal story, which makes every journey feel special and rewarding. There’s an understanding that this world, this place, existed before you fell upon it; there’s also an unshakable feeling that it’s all been staged for you.\n\nSkyrim would have you believe it’s a dynamic world that’s constantly in flux, when in reality it’s more like a car stuck in neutral, waiting to be put into gear. Characters go about their daily routines but they merely exist to bestow quests or impart dense records of lore; no-one is truly alive when you’re not engaged with them. One of the principal quest lines revolves around the Imperials and the Stormcloaks, two factions waging a purportedly bloody, savage civil war that has split the region in two. In each and every town across the land nearly every single person is happy to share an opinion on the war, telling you how dire the situation has become. But there is no war, no conflict, not unless you decide to take part in it yourself; you may see hundreds of random encounters in this Nordic land, but you’ll never see the ‘War for Skyrim’ unfolding.\n\nFiction aside, Skyrim is a vast, majestic world to discover. Bethesda is unparalleled when it comes to world building and when you’re wading through brooks, scaling mountains or eviscerating another cave full of bandits it’s an absolute joy. It’s a remarkable, liberating feeling that this province was crafted specifically for you; a huge playground with apparently no rules or boundaries. That isn’t the case. Skyrim has its rules; they’re specific and they have a nasty way of reminding you this fiction was written in binary.\n\nEvery city subscribes to a simple bounty system: commit a crime and you’ll be struck down, pay a fine, or spend the night in jail. There is a clear consequence to crime, but it’s merely an illusion. On my first evening in the town of Morthal I snuck into the Jarl’s house and then into the private quarters of her daughter, where I then attempted to pickpocket the young sleeping woman. Without the deftest of hands, the girl arose, alerting the guards of my treachery. Not wanting a fight or untimely death, I submitted, volunteering to pay my bounty and spend the evening locked up. The following morning, strolling from my cell, I bumped into the sleeping girl once more: she asked me to deliver a letter of utmost importance for her; she trusted me.\n\nThe bounty system is a dirty way to gloss over any real consequence for your actions. There is no gray area; everyone is either a friend or foe. When an enemy is nearly defeated they may beg for mercy, pleading with you to spare them. You can sheath your weapon but they will never flee, every single one will get up and rush you. Once, a villager followed me into a vampire’s hideout, hoping to avenge the death of his wife. Madness erupted and amid the scuffle I inadvertently grazed him with a fire spell, turning him immediately against me (note: the vampires who killed his wife were still very much alive). Afterward, instead of arriving to a town full of indebted villagers, I returned to an armed welcome and an outstanding bounty. There was no way to explain how the town learned of my accidental deed and no way to silence the vengeful widower – I tried killing him several times.\n\nOnce you’ve found the parameters that Skyrim works with, it’s not difficult to play by its rules, and even enjoy it. There is a huge, jaw dropping world to discover at whatever pace you desire. Along the way you’re free to author your own story, defining your unique character and experience through whatever style of play you prefer. When you’re lost in its rich landscape and enthralled within its fiction, Skyrim thrives, and is truly unparalleled; it’s when you take a closer look, you can’t help but discover the seams holding this tapestry together.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 8, 2014","true","133.3"," 242 of 401 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","242","401","5","2"

It was flawed, unbalanced, dated and had DLC for horse-armour, and yet it was still loved because despite these things, it was still one of the best games of this genre.\n\nSkyrim is Oblivion but without the bad bits.\n\nI still don't understand why there aren't more games like this. You are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want. The closest games to it would be MMOs or Grand Theft Auto, but Skyrim is a single-player experience. You'd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding, but you couldn't be more wrong. The entire world is lovingly hand-crafted. Every character you see had to be placed there. They had their face, personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game... and then you're free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade. Or not. The choice is yours.\n\nI didn't expect much from this game. I had kind of seen through Oblivion and it became lifeless for me, and I thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldn't be a large leap, but I was so wrong. I couldn't wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it, accompanied by the amazing LOTR-style soundtrack. I happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where I've accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me, or where the game glitches out spectacularly. What ever happens, it's a joy to behold.\n\nEven if you're not a fan of this sort of genre (come on, who isn't? The Elder Scrolls games are a genre in their own right!) you need to play this game. Get it when it's cheap and you'll more than get your money's worth, even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do. You can live a virtual life as a fisherman, merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off, this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable.\n\nThe down-sides? The dragons are too easy to defeat, though this game has since been patched to include harder ones. You'll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own (damn you, radiant AI!) and you're left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff. You'll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up, transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead.\n\nBut really, who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like? Who hasn't seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game? They make the vanilla 100's of hours of gameplay turn into 1000's. You'll have no life for weeks after picking this game up!\n\nIn short: buy this game.","November 27, 2013","true","190.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","1"

A FPS RPG so to speak. Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls as a series are games that let you do what you want, play how you want. If you want to be a big axed barbarian, a thief, an archer, a mage, a healer or any mixture of them, you can do it. If you just want to mess around and shout goats off of cliffs, go for it. You'll be able to select a race, each with its own look and perks. You can even be a lizard Argonian or a cat Khajit. Whatever floats your boat. You'll even be able to turn into a vampire and werewolf. The NPCs are a lot more diverse with facial hair, body sizes and so on, its a good step forward to bring Elder Scrolls to what other games have had for a decade. The game offers nice diverse gameplay for any style, you can stealth around, avoid combat completely or just run in swords blazing! The game has excellent killing animations that are new to Skyrim. You can sink hours, days, months into this game and even if you were to run out of things to do, mods would still provide a lot more content.\n\nSo what's the story? Dragons are back and only you can save Skyrim after one of them levels a town. The story is unimportant. Its basically the same story from Oblivion.... portals pop up and destroy a town. You are Dovakin and gain the ability to shout. What is shouting? Its like magic with a button of its own. Its really nice having a quick magic button. Much better than the former way of having to call upon a spell. Now in Skyrim the game, you can equip each hand with weapons, shields or spells. So dual weilding magic or weapons if you want or a big weapon in both hands. It makes for something fresh and new healing in one hand, fire spelling in the other all while shouting to stun your enemies. The combat feels a lot better and less generic than before. The spells are a lot more fun to use with good visual effects.\n\nThe dragons are notably awesome. They fly around burning down villages, mercilessly killing everything and they'll follow you. You'll see them burn down towns, not because its scripted, but because that's what the AI is programmed to do. You'll see villagers pull out daggers, clear out of houses all to fight these dragons. Once a NPC is dead, they're dead. So if it was your favorite shopkeeper, they're gone. Sure there are spells to make them return as a zombie and fight for you, but the game is forever or at least until you console hack. You'll be able to fail quests if NPCs die and you don't get that quest back.\n\nThe AI and its interaction has always been interesting in the Elder Scrolls series. You'll see guards defend towns against attacks. You'll see bandits attacking people. Now in Skyrim you'll see wolves hunting lesser animals like goats, chickens and foxes. It makes the game feel alive and you can use that AI to your advantage. Since nothing is scripted, its all your experience. You can talk about how you were saved by a ranger on a horse or how you baited a strong bear to a group of hunters that killed it.\n\nThe game has an abundance of dungeons and each one feels like a healthy chunk of gameplay, especially for explorers. The Elder Scrolls series has come a long way since Morrowind. The prefab dungeons that all look alike are gone. Every location looks beautiful, dungeons, exteriors, vistas, and they somehow even made the sewers diverse, gorgeous and rich with color, style and interest. There are plenty of monsters and seeing giant spiders is just nightmarish. Even playing all of the horror games I do, no other game has made me as squeamish. Enemies have random levels, random loot, weapons and armor so you're never really fighting the same enemy twice. The cave entrances are a lot more realistic and actual caves rather than doors. While that's not exactly important, the game is really all about the look. That seems to be the big takeaway that I get from this game.\n\nFor those that don't like deep dungeon delving, other than the first dungeon, you don't ever have to enter another dungeon. You can hang out in cities, exploring the wilderness, hunting, thieving from people, murdering everyone, running from guards, mixing potions from ingredients, doing quests, making spells and a beautiful new system to make armors and improve weapons. It feels much better and realistic than the old method of using hammers generically. Now you need to find a blacksmith, use his forge and grindstone. Enchanting and alchemy are similar processes, you can't just do them on the go, you need to find an alchemist and enchanting table. It makes sense and it doesn't seem like a step back from what it was, it just feels more realistic. You'll also be able to mine for ore and chop wood for gold.\n\nThe game has a healthy length, more than most games and that's even when you use the game's fast travel system. Exploring is a lot of the fun though and you can't just fast travel to a new location, you need to find it and there is something around every corner. On your way to ancient ruins, you can climb a mountain, find a bandit hideout and do everything but actually reach those ancient ruins.\n\nSkyrim is a cold wintery place inhabited by mostly nords. It is very reminiscent of viking culture and that's a good thing. It makes the game feel far different than Oblivion and Morrowind.\n\nNew to the series is a breakaway from typical direct face to face dialog. Instead you'll be able to talk to people as the world around you still lives. There is a new minimalistic menu instead of a giant text box at the bottom of the screen. It is all designed to look like a photograph and not break immersion. Everything is fully voiced and masterfully voiced, but the only catch is there are only a few voice actors for thousands of lines of dialog. Speaking with someone is a typical dialog tree, and this game, more than the previous games make me feel like this game matters with the things you say to people when given a choice.\n\nLike all open world games and previous games in the series, there are bugs and flaws. NPCs have a daily cycle and you'll see them disappear in front of doors as they enter. The animation is pretty awful and stiff fro the NPCs, watching them run, turn, then run some more is painful to watch. You can easily knock clutter around, but not nearly as easily as Dead Space. None of this is a game breaker. These are small prices to pay for a game so good and it never really breaks the immersion as much as I make it sound.\n\nSince the game has been out so long, its been on Steam sale several times, along with the Legendary Edition that comes with all of the official DLC. The game also makes full use of Steam's workshop to easily add mods and keep them updated. This is an amazing game, if not the best of its console generation.","June 25, 2014","true","114.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","2"

And no, I'm not 11 years old... :p Add 40 years to that. Yes, 51. My life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. The Elder Scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun I have found and Skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! Do download the DLC (Downloadable contents) right away as the latest DLC (Dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive TWO perk points when reading ability books!\n\nBUT! Yes, there's a but. The game is so vast that there are some bugs... You need to play this with the Elder Scrolls Wiki (http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Quests_(Skyrim)) opened in a browser (ideally in a separate monitor) when playing to see the various issues with each quests or dungeons (like how not to completely mess up the "Blood on the Ice" quest so you can get to finally buy the somptuous Hjerim house in Windhelm).\n\nBUT number 2. Yes, there is another issue. You may SERIOUSLY consider adding a few "mods" to your game since they may fix some of the "bugs" mentioned. For exemple : adding the Dawnguard DLC will make Vampires appear and KILL potentially VITAL characters depending on the sort of build your are trying to achieve for your character! Geeez. You would think they would have thought of a way to hold these attacks until you start the quest? NO they didn't! But.... There's a "mod" that actually does this for you : preventing ALL vampire attacks (which may KILL city vendors and other characters) until you actually start the quest! Yep, this means, sorry lad, but you REALLY should take a stroll around the modding area, easily accessible in Steam by clicking the Workshop button under your PLAY button in the Games Library (once you've selected Skyrim). There are a few really cool mods I like apart from this one. One is called Run for your lives! And also makes all villagers run inside when there's a DRAGON attack. Again, preventing important characters from simply being wiped out before you get a chance to kill them yourself! :p\n\nApart from that, the game is just insanely good... I have played it from beginning to end many times and still discover new things. :)\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","989.8"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","2"

It's worth every $ that it's listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. I have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but I can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content.\n\nHere are some key features that hooked me into the game..\n\n1. Dungeon Complexity - When I say complexity, I mean that the design for the game's dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. You just have to keep exploring and you'll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. At times.. I ALMOST felt as if I were playing the latest Tomb Raider once again. I also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles.\n\n2. Playstyle Freedom - I'm sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. It's definitely a step up compared to games like Kingdoms of Amalur. Do you enjoy melee combat? How about magic? How about a balance of both? There's a lot of possibilities.\n\n3. Expansive Lore - As I've mentioned, the game has a ton of content. Playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quest's lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture.\n\nSkyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that I really wanted to highlight. They stood out for me and it was for these reasons that I ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. With that said, I paid $30 for the legendary edition. Wouldn't you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? How many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. Just remember, multiplayer games don't count!\n\n10/10.

The best thing about playing Skyrim is the feeling of freedom. You can create any character you want, play any style you like and change it anytime, since you’re not restricted by choosing one class, go anywhere you want (straight up a mountain wall too) and do almost anything you want (leave chickens alone though, better go pickpocket a ghost).\n\nSkyrim offers big open world with countless quests and places to visit – from a small shrine not even marked on a map, through bandit camps and caves to massive ancient ruins. The graphics is not as breathtaking as it was the year it was published, but it still has it’s charms. Soundtrack, in turn, haven’t aged at all. Music composed by Jeremy Soule is just marvelous.\n\nAlso, mods. The absolute freedom, limited only by the power of your computer. With them you truly can achieve anything you want from your game, whether it is changing things you don’t like, adding new content or striving for insanely realistic HD graphics. Or just, you know, changing the dragons into trains.\n\nOverall, Skyrim is highly addictive and easily one of my favourite games of all time. Yes, some game mechanics are ridiculous. Yes, there are bugs and glitches. Yes, some things are just plainly stupid. No, it doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and memorable experience.\nTo put simply, it’s a masterpiece. 10/10 without any hesitation.\n\n800 hours of gameplay when writing review.","March 2","true","832.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","18","18","5","0"

Picked it up when it launched on the Xbox 360 in fact.\nI must've put about 30 hours into it before deciding that I've seen it all.\n\nLet me break it down a bit. When I played Skyrim I did the following: I left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. Morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. With Skyrim, I felt like some cog in a Dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. I mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! These jerks are worse than cliff racers. At the time I figured that I might as well play an MMO, at least then I could get some rare drops.\n\nSo what happened? What's so different about the PC version that I would put 700+ hours into it?\n\nDo you really have to ask?\n\nModding Skyrim is the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland. You don't get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. You certainly can't climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. No, you will fall in that hole. The only light you'll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in Skyrim. In the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the Steam workshop. A weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. But then you look at what other people are doing with their Skyrim. They've got the 4K textures, the dramatic ENBs, the glamour models with their noses just right. Now you may be thinking that you don't need all that garbage, and you probably don't.\n\nBut you do.\n\nNext thing you know you're on the Nexus. It's been 10 hours and you haven't even started the game yet. Stability is the last word I'd associate with Elder Scrolls, and that's without piling on the mods. Getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than Skyrim itself. You've started the game, you're wandering around, and then...Crash To Desktop. What caused it? How do you fix it? Is there a way around it? Are you going to lose your saves? After a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. My Skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and that's fine.\n\nEventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. I'm going to spoil Skyrim: You are the most awesome. Everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. Nobody will even do anything unless you're somehow involved. Sometimes being the most awesome is fun. It's escapism at its purest. A lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. At worst, Skyrim inconveniences you. This game doesn't say "YOU DIED." or "HEY POOR PLAYER!" It just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. There's something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but it's hard work trying to be the least awesome.\n\nThere's a phrase I like to throw around when discussing videogames: "Making the game yours."\n\nUsually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in Resident Evil, or beating Megaman without any power-ups. It's not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. I remember reading about a Morrowind player who spent all of their time in the Ashlands. They'd camp out in a Chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. They made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. This doesn't sound appealing, but I have to respect the hustle. That person totally owns their game of Morrowind.\n\nWhen all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, there's not a lot one can do to create their identity. This is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). Your alteration level could be so low that it couldn't levitate an earthworm, but that won't stop you from becoming an Archmage not long after stepping foot in the Winterhold College. I remember when being an Archmage was such hot ♥♥♥♥ in The Bard's Tale, now it's just a title any Dragonbum can get.\n\nWhen everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? If anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. When I play Skyrim, I play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as I can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. It's disturbingly compelling, and that's without discussing the mods themselves. I don't settle for being the most awesome, I want to become omnipotent. Only after I've constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do I actually play it. At this point I'm fine with being the most awesome, because I feel like I earned that right. This is the time I put some Genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose.\n\nPerhaps my comparison to Alice in Wonderland is a bit off. The way I remember it, Alice falls in the hole and arrives in Wonderland. With modded Skyrim; Wonderland is a neverending hole. Inevitably you'll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. You want to see where your curiousity will take you. You might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. You could even find yourself in a lab.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is that Skyrim is what you make of it. The game is fine on its own. It's certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. However, Skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. To me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by Bethesda's next single-player RPG.","April 1, 2015","true","729.8"," 37 of 51 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","37","51","8","3"

The story is about the return of the dragons that lived thousands of years ago along with them appears the dragonborn whose objective is to stop their return. I do not want to spoil anything beyond this, that's why the story explanation is brief.\n\nTLDRFor those who didn't want to read a lot here's a short part of the review.\nSkyrim is a very large RPG with lots of things to do and you can be pretty much whatever you want to be. It's hard to determine how much time you will spend playing this game, its very unclear and it depends on you the most. There are numerious quests and events for you to do. Skyrim is vast, beautiful and dangerous, take your time to explore it. It certainly won't be wasted money, you'll have a lot of fun playing this game. Eventually if you find the game "lacking" you can always look for mods to enrich your game.\n\n\nCharacter creation\nWith each release Bethesda strives to improve their beloved Elder Scroll series in every extent. The character creation system has a lot of options once again and they really outdid themselves with the presentation of each of the races, they look very immersive and lore friendly. Next we have the attributes and skill system which is quite simplified in comparison to the previous release. Sadly, while this is not entirely negative, some might view it as so, because with the removal of attributes and merging of some skills they have limited the building of characters in a way. The removal of the class selection is one of the most disturbing, but its not all that important to your character build. Although it is one of the important features of RPG games. And finally the birthsigns, while they were never really cleverly balanced, I kind of appreciate their usage in Skyrim because of their "weak" impact. I also despise them because you can simply choose which one you want if you find it and afterwards you can always change it. I forgot to mention the skill perks that were first brought into Oblivion then altered in Fallout 3 and finally finetuned in Skyrim, a very good feature if I may say so, makes the game feel like it has more complexity. You're gonna have a lot of fun creating a character or its gonna be a pain, it depends. Take your time.\n\nWilderness, landscape and habitats\nThey put a lof of effort into this. The landscape is very breathtaking, immersive and worthwhile. Take your time and explore the great and vast lands of Skyrim. This is a very big plus, they really spent a lot of time on making the surroundings very detailed and immersive. Besides enjoying the game with its gameplay itself you're also presented with the option of absorbing the environment without actually indulging yourself in some pointless slaughter and you can have a companion who will from time to time say something interesting. I do not want to spoil too much of this either. The cities are very immersive and they look great, some of them look too similar, some too small , I guess this is something that they still need to improve. The dungeons and forts looks pretty good, they still lack a bit of morbidness and darkness though depending on the denizens. I think this is the greatest feature of Skyrim, please do take your time to absorb the environment.\n\nThe creatures and humanoids and others\nThe AI is dumbed down, at least that's my impression of it. I think the creatures behaviour is better than that of the NPC's. Once again they've added some creatures that will most likely rip you apart when you're low level and playing on adept or higher difficulty, a good example would be the saber cat. I'll be honest with you, I'm scared of that beast. Just like in Skyrim, in Oblivion it was the mountain lion or a Yao-Guai in Fallout 3. I'm glad that the trolls are still depicted as dangerous and annoying. The wildlife is very rich and quite immersive in this release ( disregarding the occasional random behaviour ). I like the presentation of most of the enemies, they all feel very lore friendly. The city folk are still a bit lacking in my opinion, but that's about it. Finally the dragons are a big disappointment. Not their looks or the animations and so on. It's that the combat is poorly designed for them. Not to mention that the dragons are very weak. Storywise well presented in general.\n\nQuests and Events\nWhile some are immersive, some are very poorly designed. I think they made progress overall in comparison to the previous game. Some quests are really worth the time, but still a lot of them lack challenge. I think it's still worth to take the time and try them all out. I think the player is given too much freedom sometimes, which results in some events and quests looking a bit poor.\n\nMods\nWhen trying to use mods, execute extreme caution, you might end up having to reinstall the game a lot of times before getting them all to work well. Feel free to ask me for any advice since I have years of experience with this. Luckily for us, we have a very solid modding community since the days of Morrowind. There will be plenty of amazing mods out there for you to choose from. While new players tend to stick to cosmetic mods and adding more "stuff" mods, there are plenty of quest mods that need to be given thought.\n\nMusic\nOnce again the music is composed by the legendary Jeremy Soule, his music enchanted the experience of the previous installments ( Oblivion and Morrowind ), including this one. I hope The Elder Scrolls will continue to be blessed with his music of epic proportions!\n\nWhile this review is long, I still could have written a lot more, but I don't want to include some spoilers. Looking forward for the next release. Still having fun playing this game. A big thanks to my friend who gave me the game, King Viking!\nThanks for taking your time to read this.","November 17, 2014","true","217.2"," 73 of 115 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","73","115","3","9"

Which isn't really saying much because I'm casual as frick and haven't played many open-world games, but WHATEVER\n\nI dig the soundtrack, I dig the world, I dig the lore, I dig the characters. I dig being able to create pretty much any character I want, even if I eventually wander back onto the path of the Sneak Archer. I love completing dungeons, I love learning words of power, I love looting the crap out of everything, I love collecting hundreds of bottles of booze and stashing it all away in the cabinet in Honeyside.\n\nAs much as I love this game, it does have its faults. The combat can be clunky at times. Some dungeons feel repetitive. (oh boy, more draugar.) The physics engine is hilariously buggy, though this can be a definite plus if you enjoy watching inanimate objects get flung across the map if you breathe on them wrong. The main questline feels somewhat bland at times, though it's a good incentive to branch out and do the more interesting sidequests. Some of the character interactions are awkward. I forget the name of the argonian guy in the Bee and Barb, but I helped him craft a wedding ring and then I extorted his lover as part of the Thieves Guild questline. Now whenever I talk to him, he tells me how much he loves me and then promptly tells me to walk off a bridge because I suck. Also vanilla Skyrim won't let me marry Faendal, even though he has been my best bro since Riverwood. Oh well, I guess that's what mods are for.\n\nAdditional points of interest: mods can really help you tailor this game to specifically meet your wants and needs. Also if you suffer from first-person-games-make-me-want-to-vomit-because-I-am-sensitive-as-hell-to-this-kind-of-stuff syndrome like I do, then rejoice! This game can be played in third person for an experience that is much friendlier to your stomach.\n\nOverall, this game is freaking gorgeous and I love it. It's not perfect, but if you love to explore, this game is right for you.","September 6, 2015","true","195.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","22","26","7","2"

Both solid games, so I had built an idea of what the next one was going to be like. When this game came out though, it literally blew away all my expectations.\n\nI don't think there's a single thing wrong with this game, to be honest. It's one of those games that have hardly any flaws, if any at all, and stand the test of time for years to come. There's practically nothing you can't do and nowhere you can't go in this game and I think that's one of the biggest points in this game for me. From stealing a horse from a stable to being infected by vampires to slaying dragons to slaughtering guards in a hold just for the sheer hell of it, this game instantly became one of my favorites due to just the flexibility of player choice.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I think of V is probably the mod support.

AI are smart as difficulty goes up but it's good enough on normal difficulty for it to be fun. The skills system is extremely modular and can go which ever way you want making it the ultimate RPG game. There is an infinite number of quests that are randomly generated but the normal game content of quests is enough to keep you going for a few hundred hours. UI and menu and items from loot to smithing to alchemy are all well done and can be changed or improved on by mods.\n\nGraphics 8/10\nThe base vanilla game has some pretty low textures in comparison to some next-gen games and the colour filter of the game is really grey and boring but can be changed yet again with the help of mods. With mods, the graphics get changed to 10/10, sometimes even competing with next-gen games and look even better.\n\nAudio/Music 10/10\nThe voice acting in this game is superb even if you can hear the same voice actor over and over. All dialogue is voiced and most NPCs have interesting back stories or lines of dialogue. You won't start hearing dialogue appear over and over until you've played the game for a couple of hours but it doesn't at all take away from the immersion of the game. The music is fantastic and one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard. Jeremy Soule does an amazing job as usual creating a tone and setting for the world of Skyirm. The game sounds from the world are really well done. From the sounds of fire burning away at corpses to the cries of the wolves or bears. The ambience of travelling through the forests to the blowing winds of the snow peaked mountains to the ambience of dungeons and the soothing relaxing tone of the taverns, Skyrim makes no mistakes when it comes to immersing you into the game world through music and audio.\n\nContent/Replayability 10/10\nThe amount of content this game has is far beyond any other game I've ever played. With only 2 large DLCs being Dawnguard and Dragonborn, it still manages to have content of which I've never seen before. This game's size in terms of content could match even that of large scale MMO titles and is not as repetitive as those games due to the fact you can play this game however you want. Skyrim is the game that'll define a genre of RPG games and Bethesda has not compromised much in terms of content in the game.\n\nOverall 9.5/10\nNo game is ever perfect but The Elder Scrolls Skyrim comes close to being one of the best games over made in my opinion. The sheer amount of work put into this extremely immersive world is beyond that of any RPG I've ever played. Though after a few hundred hours, the vanilla game may feel dry to some gamers like myself but due to the fact that Skyrim houses hundreds and thousands of mods just makes the experienece even better.","December 6, 2013","true","536.6"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonhasid/recommended/72850/","Argonhasid","Argon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argonhasid/","162 products in account","It's the moment that has always defined the Elder Scrolls series. That palpable feeling of freedom and adventure as you gaze across a vast, beautiful landscape. Skyrim is not a great leap from Oblivion, or even Morrowind, but it is the finest chapter in the series to date: an unforgettable journey into another world. When you start Skyrim, the only things you get to choose are your race, sex and appearance. The editor is fantastic, frankly, with a wealth of sliders and presets. Each race - of which there are ten - has its own special ability, which includes passive effects that are always active, and spells you can use once a day. Nords, for example, have 50% frost resistance and a Battle Cry ability that makes enemies flee in terror, while Argonians can breathe underwater and cast Histskin to rapidly regenerate their health. Still, besides these initial bonuses, how your character develops depends entirely on how you play the game. Say you use greatswords a lot in combat; this will see your two-handed weapon stats improve every time you strike an enemy. Or maybe you prefer to keep your distance and use bows; every arrow that hits its target will improve your archery stats. It's, of course, still possible to avoid traditional combat altogether, sneaking through an area undetected, silently killing enemies without alerting their allies. The stealth isn't much better than it was in Oblivion, with twitchy AI that becomes aggressive way too easily, but it gets better when your archery and sneaking skills increase, and you find enchanted equipment, like boots that muffle your footsteps.\n\nIf Oblivion's world was green and colourful, and straight out of a Tolkien novel, Skyrim's fantasy is much more hard-edged, drawing inspiration from Norse mythology to create a world that's both stunningly beautiful and incredibly convincing. At all times, it feels like a real place, with a real history. It's a snow-blasted land of icy peaks, boggy marshes, leafy forests and barren tundra, and it's a joy to explore. Tiny details play into the believability of your surroundings too, like the way the weather changes depending on your elevation. In the lush, forested valley to the southeast, a thick fog hangs in the air and it's almost always raining. As you head north, snow appears on the trees and the wind begins to howl. Then as you get higher, climbing one of Skyrim's many mountain ranges, a heavy blizzard rolls in, obscuring the path ahead. When night falls, the sky is illuminated by Skyrim's equivalent of the Northern lights.Thank you for reading my whole review or just scrolling all the way to the bottem. Remeber to give a thumbs up and play Skyrim!","October 5, 2014","true","153.5"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","4"

It's more popular than a picture of Jesus holding a pug with a bowtie, and rightfully so. Most of the series issues are countered by the fact that talented, sometimes downright disturbingly obsessive modding community probably modded them out and Skyrim is no exception. Even if you sink more than hundered hours in vanilla version, you can still find something you haven't done and want to do. Want to spend all your time force-pushing chickens around town ? Sure ! Wanna put buckets over NPCs faces while they're delivering important pieces of exposition ? You got it ! While I'm usually opposed to "make your own fun" kind of games, doing your own thing is bread and butter of Skyrim, and that's what makes it so popular. Yeah, it may be a bit more simplified (for the sake of accessibility) than older TES games and maybe enviroments and combat get a bit boring and repetitive after a while, but it all falls flat when you can summon 5000 wheels of cheese and roll them down the mountain on unsuspecting goats.","September 25, 2014","true","178.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

And, might I add, to the amazement of various friends none of whom have ever even completed the main storyline - despite having several hundred hours themselves - this was ALL ON ONE CHARACTER.\n\nWords cannot express how much I love this game. The gameplay... the freedom... the constant Googling whilst I tried to figure out what to do and where to go to get the coolest stuff and why I keep dying...\n\nTell you what, though, you have to be DETERMINED. There comes a point where, if you're on PC, you HAVE to work out how to use the console. You can't help it. The game is GLITCHY. Most of it's harmless, most of the time you don't really notice or mind, but sometimes you come across a real whopper and you HAVE to use commands to fix it. For me, this was when I bought the legendary edition and downloaded the dlc, and Vampires started attacking towns - and they killed one of the characters in one the towns (Markarth, if anyone cares) who was vital to the MAIN STORYLINE FOR THAT TOWN. I tried to bring him back (easy enough) but the quest refused to start and then another quest in Markarth went wrong, and, in the end, I had to salvage what quests it would let me (using the console) complete, and abandon the rest. Normal NPCs dying is a problem too. They tend to run AT danger with bunched fists. Living in a town with no surviving shopkeepers is a pain. I resurrect anyone important.\nSome quests are just broken. You'll come across them. You'll google them. You'll find forums full of information about their various glitches. Most of the time, it really doesn't matter. Half the glitches will pass you by, anyway.\nThe KEY THING is to quicksave, a LOT. And don't let those saves get on top of you, it can get confuing. I'm on save five thousand or so, and I try to save over most of my saves whenever I'm in particular dungeons, but it's useful to keep a few saves from various places you've been, so you can go back to as many points as possible. Saving before and after missions is a given, if it glitches out you won't be in trouble. And don't even get me STARTED on pickpocketing. Most of my backlog of undeleted saves are of the back of people's legs as I'm about to pickpocket them and don't want to get caught and lose all my stuff, or be branded a criminal (you murder someone in the wilderness where no-one can see you, and loot their body? No problem. You steal a cabbage by accident as you tried to press A to talk to someone - YOU WILL BE MURDERED BY THE CITY GUARD, OR GO TO JAIL FOREVER).\n\nAs to modding... I have tried various mods. Nothing that changes the game, no way, just simple stuff, like bug fixes (I didn't like the unnofficial patches, they seemed to create more problems than they solved, for me at least), enhanced graphics (sometimes the people in skyrim are just too UGLY), and a couple of house mods, so that I could have somewhere better to live (hearthfire is good because you can get hearthfire based mods that make the normal houses good - hearthfire itself is glitchy, and the manors more trouble than they're worth). Other mods are quite useful, it depends on what you want to do, but mod at your own risk, and always back up. You will almost certainly, at some point, feel the NEED to find some sort of mod to fix this, or improve that - and skyrim nexus makes it pretty easy.\n\nSpeaking of the dlc, it's worth getting, for sure. Dawnguard is excellent, and the better weapons that come with it are very nice, the best in the game. The storyline is also really cool, I like killing vampires (never could be bothered to BE a vampire, too high maintenance with the blood and whatnot). Dragonborn is awesome, I really like that you get to leave Skyrim and meet new people and find new types of dungeon and quests. Riding dragons is a waste of time, I don't know why they bothered (you can't control ANYTHING), but that's not what most of the dlc is about. The new types of armour and weapons would be nice earlier on in the game (I got the dlc late), so if and when I play again I'll go to Solstheim earlier and get some cool stuff. There are also some vary nice bonuses you can pick up from Solstheim, the Black Books and so on, and they allowed me to reach a bit of a Godlike status when it came to the sheer power of my weapons and armour. Hearthfire, I've already mentioned, is OK, and mostly it's good because the best housing mods are made with hearthfire stuff in them.\nI'd certainly recommend the Legendary Edition, although I don't know what it's like from the beginning of the game (especially with the vampire attacks). I'd probably turn off some of the dlc until I was a high enough level to feel comfortable fending off vampires and cultists and whatnot.\n\nThe game is beautiful, the lore is awesome, the characters all voice acted beautifully (you get over the fact that there are only so many recurring voices fairly quickly, they're very NICE voices anyway, it's just a bit odd when your loving wife has the same voice as the evil sorceress you just murdered in her bed in a cave on the way home), and the levelling and gameplay are wonderful (mostly, apart from the grinding). By late game, you have to really focus on levelling some things up, if you want the best stuff, or to get to the endgame stuff (around level 80). I spent the last ten levels of that holding up my shield to a giant and letting him hit me again and again to level up blocking. But you can mostly avoid grinding, if you're not too bothered about\nThe only problem I have with the gameplay is magic. It seems like a waste of space to fight with, and potions are much easier to heal with than spells, which require the use of a hand whenever you want to use them. It also seems to me that, while when I use it magic is useless against the weakest enemies, it's extremely overpowered in the hands of enemy mages. Even at my level, with my insane damage and armour rating, a master pyromancer can MURDER me in seconds if I don't quickly equip some magic resistance or shoot him in the face before he can burn me alive. Magic is only useful sometimes, and I did the whole mage storyline with a greatsword and heavy armour, and I became the head of the magical college without using a single spell.\n\nAll that said, this game is an Experience. You can play it casually (mostly) or do what I did and play it obsessively and do everything and get everything even after nothing can possibly be better than what you already have. You can level up moderately and do the main and interesting questlines only, and the bossfights will be harder but still doable (I may have three hit the end boss, not my fault, I had it on a high difficulty). Being overpowered is fun, but even I used weapons which I hadn't levelled up on lower level enemies so that it would be more, well, not violent, well, a bit violent, but a bit harder, anyway. Other things to consider are the music (beautiful), the storylines (there are so many, and so varied, although of course there are a lot of randomly generated misc quests, and 'go fetch this, go kill him' quests but you can mostly ignore them after a while if you want), the graphics (very nice, so nice in fact that I can't play any of the older games for fear of trying to kill myself, or possibly just trying to paint on my screen to make them prettier), and, of course, the gameplay mechanics, which are the nicest I've ever played with, I especially LOVE first person.\n\n11/10, and I MEAN it. Most of the games I've played are GOOD, but this is... something else. This review is long and will probably sit at the bottom of the review pile on steam forever, but I wanted to write something about, for all its flaws (a LOT of flaws, I'm afraid), one of the most amazing games I've ever played.","August 22, 2015","true","416.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"

It actually is kind of an article between, a gameplay review, a "role-playing" guide, a mods compilation, and story of a character. If you are not intrested, I suggest you to pass it right away.)\n\n(Content is written all by me. Please do not distribute without permission.)\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, is undoubtedly one of the greatest PC games ever made, personally the single best RPG and open-world game I've seen. It is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime FRP lover like myself. There really aren't many words to describe such perfection.\n\nFirst of all, best thing about Skyrim is the fact that, things you can do is literally endless. Content is literally endless. I am at around +2.000 hours of Skyrim gameplay (Also played it a lot before my Steam copy.), and everyday, I still keep discovering some totally new things. Vanillia game with DLC's, has at least over 2.000-2.500 hours of gameplay (Around 1.500 hours without any DLC's, maybe?), if you do nothing but quests. Endless number of mods you can apply, will make gameplay way, way longer. And again, this is only possible if you do nothing but quests; no sightseeing, fast traveling all the way, skipping lore, and forgetting about the identity of your character. Still, it's your choice to play Skyrim in the way you want.\n\nI have 3 characters, and I'll talk about one of them, whom I mainly play. (Vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths (except main storyline) for 3 seperate characters. You also can alter main storyline to a degree.). But first, I'd like to talk about mods which I actively use in all my characters (Plus, there are some particular ones for each character.)(No visual mods included.)\n\n- First of all, most indispensable mod for me, is probably the "Disable Fast Travel". I think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game. I never fast traveled before (Neither in Skyrim, nor Oblivion. Morrowind didn't had it anyways. Damn, I love Morrowind.), never will, and I hate people who fast travels. Fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to Skyrim, but when it's being used, that's half of the games beauty gone. Some people play it just for the other half anyways.\n\n- I very much like the "iNeed" mod, which adds a streamlined approach to needs. You need to eat, drink, and sleep once in a while, for full effectiveness of your character. It has some nice details, like for example, you can carry a flask, drink your water from it when you are thirsty, and fill it from any water source when depleted (Even from rain!).\n\n- Static Mesh Improvement, an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension, with actual 3D meshes. It adds a whole new level to details all around Tamriel.\n\n- SkyUI, a must-have interface overhaul\n- Cloaks of Skyrim\n- SkyrimSpeeds, speed adjustments\n- Improved Dragon Shouts\n- Command Dragon, for manual control\n- Alternative Crafting System, helps role-playing without abandoning your gear potential\n- ImmersiveFP, for first-person dragon & horse riding\n- A quality world map with all roads\n- Touring Carriages\n- FNIS, custom animations engine\n\n- And, Falskaar! It's an amazing mod, which adds a new quest line, a huge new map, and a very solid lore. Very professionally done, almost like an official DLC.\n\nThe character I want to talk about, is my female dragonborn assassin, last member of the Dark Brotherhood, and guildmaster of Thieves Guild. She's the character that I played the most, although she's not the character I first created, or beat the main storyline. I beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time, and I wanted continue as an assassin, created her. After completing the Unbound quest (Which is the very first quest.), I literally quit the main storyline, and completed The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild storylines (Yea, you can do that. You literally can complete almost every side quest in Tamriel without touching the main story.). By the time I return to the main storyline, I already was a master assassin, (Skyrim has an NPC progress system; it doesn't let you level up more than usual before story, and one-shot every NPC. You'll still have an adventage tho.), so I progressed through it at ease (Except the dragon parts, where I needed to go head-on.), and I completed it, as she completed her personality. She's not a type of assassin without honour, she's not like killing random people just for money/fun, or she's not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain (Spidey-philosophy), instead, she actually delivers justice, and avenges the downtrodden. She's more like Batman, The Dark Knight, except the killing part. And all that Thieves Guild, 'stealing' part, is also like the phiolosophy of Robin Hood, or at least the Cat Woman. In the end, she's a very righteous character, in her own way.\n\nI completed a billion small quests, and some big ones like Civil War and The Companions storyline (Actually, all the big ones as far as I know.), and married with Aela (Yep, Aela is a female. Yep, I'm a female. Yep.) before heading to Dawnguard DLC. I've completed Dawnguard as a vampire. I got cured afterwards, but I'm still not sure about being a vampire, since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows, but there are too many downsides; I won't ever be using the Vampire Lord form, since it's totally irellevant with my character, and I don't like its benefits/aesthetics anyways. After that, Dragonborn came out, and I also finished it, which actually fits perfectly to her personality, since the purpose is (kind of) assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin (because of being a dragonborn) who can do it, and became a complete Dragonborn. Since then, I'm traveling short distances with Shadowmere, and long distances on a dragon (Not dragon fast-travelling, I'm navigating manually.).\n\nI do some unusual things in my spare time in Skyrim, which many can find weird, but I enjoy a lot. For example, I have some favorite places (Which I won't be sharing. Be assured, finding your own places would be much more satisfying.), I sometimes toggle off the running mode, and randomly walk at these places again and again, for hours, never getting bored. I also find books in Skyrim very exciting (There are countless in-game books which you can read. Each one of them are written exclusively, with its unique content.), I have a great intrest in collecting and reading them, and I actually find some of them way more intriguing than many 'popular' real books. Some of which I can recommend: Rising Threat (4 volumes), The Wolf Queen (8 volumes), Kolb and the Dragon (That's probably my favorite book in the game. Not in terms of its story, but it is actually a "choose-your-own-adventure" type of book.), The Black Arrow (2 volumes), A Dance in Fire (7 volumes). As a side note, in my honest opinion, books in Oblivion were better...\n\nBefore finishing, here are some mods that I use especially for my assassin:\n\n- The Dance of Death, a kill-move mod\n- Higher Jump\n- Martial Arts\n- Realistic Crime Radius\n- Throwing Weapons Redux\n- Faction Crossbows\n- Stealth Immersion\n\nAnd, I suppose, that's all.\n\nIn terms of characters, as you can see, making a character totally unique is pretty simple, it's just a matter of will. Skyrim, or any game for that matter, can only provide you the visualization and tools of role-playing; you have to use your imagination for an advanced FRP experience. And in terms of gaming perspective, you now should have an idea about how I feel about Skyrim, and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game.\n\nIn the end, conclusion is actually pretty short, and simple: Skyrim is a must, must, must, MUST have game, and a masterpiece to experience, just like a Mozart concerto, a Shakespeare play, or a trip to one of 7 Great Wonders of the World.","July 8, 2014","true","750.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Skyrim is full of things to do, dungeon to explore, quests, ways to play, classes and weapons!\nThere's so much to do and you will always want to do something and forget to do something else. Epic battles, addictive gameplay, good storyline and a big free roam world to explore. I'll try to explain myself with one single word; Epicness!\nI recommend a lot this game if you want an RPG which mixes exploration, battles and much more stuff.\nUnfortunately, there are some problems: for a game of such hugeness there are lots of bugs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/recommended/72850/","mysterd","MysterD "The Gaming Toaster"","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/","1429 products in account","Skyrim (Base Game) - REVIEW\n\nWhat is there to say about this game? Where do I even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the Skyrim base-game? We're not enough counting the DLC's here...yet! The Elder Scrolls (TES) is 1 of those series that are loaded w/ tons + tons of content, offering up an insane amount of value + "bang for your buck". To experience all of it at once - IMHO, at least for me, that's probably not the wisest ideas. This game has so many different storylines, quests, areas to explore, factions, things to do (i.e. get married) - it's a game you play for numerous hours until you've hit that wall (i.e. "I need a break for a while"); just go away from for a bit; & then it calls you back for more. Very few games do this to me - Test Drive Unlimited 2; Far Cry 3; + Skyrim all come to my mind here.\n\nClass systems are gone here in Skyrim. Just practice the attributes you want to want to improve (i.e. sneak around, improve that skilll; swing a 1-handed sworded and hit someone, that improves; cast a spell from a certain school, that improves, etc); + select new abilities from those attributes to learn at level-up time. Since you're constantly improving your attributes + leveling-up like there's no tomorrow, this can be addictive - think like that Diablo-like kind of addictive.\n\nSkyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor. Graphically, on the technical side, the game is much better than Oblivion. Girls actually do look more so like girls (in the face, namely), this time around - thanks for finally getting this right, Bethesda; it took you long enough! While many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy + interesting as Oblivion's Shivering Isles expansion (my favorite area in any TES game since starting in the series w/ Morrowind). These lands have a Nordic influence on them + most of them truly do look fantastic. Likely, if you see an area way out in the distance, there's a great chance - you can go there + explore it completely, which is fantastic.\n\nCombat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than Oblivion - but, when compared to others, it certainly is still a little bit clunky (like most TES games) + does not rival the combat of other games like Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning + Dark Souls (those games certainly do specialize in combat) - it's still pretty good here in Skyrim. One thing that's new -  you can now dual-wield weapons; can even wield magic in one hand, a weapon in another; dual-wield different magic spells in each hands; and/or even dual-wield the same magic spell (for double the power). Simply put - these are great additions to this game's combat system.\n\nNPC's in the game-world actually have taken a page right out of the Gothic play-book, as you will see NPC's doing things to immerse you into the world - i.e. blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment; NPC's acting on schedules + doing things together on their own; + things of that natures. As usual, there's even more books added to read, for those who want to dwelve into the ever-expanded + ridiculously-sized Lore of the series.\n\nThe main story here is this - dragons have returned to Skyrim, you're to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the Dragonborn (a human that can learn dragon skills), learn Dragon-style shouts, & take the Dragons out once + for all - which is typical fantasy stuff. While the main quest is decent enough + is solid, it really feels like it's just another quest in the game - like many of the main quests in Elder Scrolls base-games since Morrowind. While Bethesda is no BioWare + no Obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative, prose + dialogue - where Bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w/ tons to accomplish, if you like what you're doing. Trust me - this is another addictive sandbox from Bethesda, in which you won't know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while, it will eventually get you coming back for more. While not everything here is a home-run, there are also many good-to-great plots + storyline strings here - such as the Thieves Guild's quest-line + especially Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, that I don't even know where to begin.\n\nSkyrim will generate some random quests on its own, which often do wind-up in the Misc section - which could keep you going for a long time. As if the base-game couldn't do that enough already, making this game such a time-sink - throw in also that the game ships w/ the Toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there b/c this series has an extremely heavy modding community + fanbase - you could live for 100's of hours in Skyrim, even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that Bethesda has already provided.\n\nIf there's something about Skyrim you don't like - i.e. the UI isn't that great, again; even though it's improved immensely over Oblivion - trust me, there's a mod out there to fix your issue w/ the game. For example - SkyUI Mod vastly improves + fixes Bethesda's UI-system immesely. By offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do (from questing to exploring) here, Skyrim succeeds in proving again why Bethesda + their Elder Scrolls is 1 of the best - if not, the best - at providing addictive time-sink RPG's. Bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here; I'll certainly drink to that + from that. RPG fans looking to get lost for 100's of hours, it's almost impossible to rival what Bethesda does in their games - & that's especially true here in Skyrim. Simply put - another RPG masterpiece from Bethesda.\n\nFinal Grade = A+","July 23, 2014","true","181.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/72850/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a 2011 fantasy role-playing game that critics and players raved the game with great awe. Since the game was released, Skyrim still managed to be on the top most-played game on Steam. With a large area to explore, so many quests to do, or just do the heck you want, should you get the PC version of Skyrim?\n\nSkyrim is one of those games that you can “skim” through the main story and then play a different game, completed parts of the main story then you forget about it, do side and miscellaneous quests, or explore the world on your own with massive amounts of hours dumping in into this strangely addicting game. There’s a good chance that the player would have more than 100 hours on Skyrim and still have plenty things to do. You start off as a prisoner bound to be executed until a dragon shows up and the people of Skyrim went wild that the dragons have returned. As I’m writing down this review, I am not halfway through the main story and that might be the point. Skyrim is a game that you’ll probably not going to finish the main story since Skyrim has so many things to do. Like the previous Elder Scrolls titles beforehand, the game is immersive and sucks you in. The side quests are pretty solid like the Companions, the Dark Brotherhood, and among many others.\n\nWhat separates the PC version from the Xbox 360 and the PS3 are the mods. That’s right: M.O.D.S. Mods can extend the replay value to almost infinity and there’s a good chance that you find a mod (or mods) that you are looking for.\n\n1. Do you want to visually overhaul the graphics from the vanilla version to ultimate high definition graphics? There is.\n2. Do you want mods that enhance your immersion up to the next level? There is.\n3. Do you need community-made patches for Skyrim that Bethesda Games Studios forget about? There is.\n4. Do you want to find mods that remodel the female body structures to something attractive, beautiful, and probably lusty? There is.\n5. Do you want to find mods that remodel the female followers and companions like Serana, Aela the Huntress, Mjoll the Lioness (along with plenty others) to beautiful and s*xy, and you say to yourself: “Hot d*mn, I love Skyrim mods!”? H*ll yeah there is!\n\nThere are two mod managers: the Steam Workshop and Nexus Mods. I strongly recommend to use Nexus Mods since Nexus has a lot more to offer than Steam Workshop (for obvious reasons). Once you mod Skyrim with visual overhauls or retexturing female followers, there’s no going back. Arguably, this is the best part for the PC version of Skyrim and I’m glad that Bethesda has giving modders the tools to create such imaginative mods.\n\nIs there some flaws or criticism for the game that is universally well-recognized, won multiple Game of the Year Awards in 2011, and still considered as one of the most played games on Steam? Every game has some flaws and it’s not perfect. The dialogue writing is decent in most cases, but it should have been better. Some quests in Skyrim feel “short” like the Companions side quests/plot as an example. I terribly missed the Fighter and Mages Guilds from the previous Elder Scroll titles. If you played the quests from the previous titles, the plot in each guild is pretty solid and gives you a good amount of hours to do. Miscellaneous quests in Skyrim are mostly fetch the required items and returned to the quest giver and there are a lot of those quests. Bethesda has a reputation for not fixing some of the major bugs and no longer supporting the game to fix these issues, allowing the community to nitpick and hunt every possible bug that Bethesda failed to address or didn’t bother to do so.\n\nThe criticisms for Skyrim are relatively minor and doesn’t affect the immersion very much. The only possible concern is how Bethesda deals with mods in future titles (like Fallout 4, which we will have to be cautious on Bethesda’s moves). Other than these entanglements, Skyrim is a great game and the mods definitely makes a difference. With Skyrim installed, you will end up having one of the greatest adventures in your lifetime. With mods installed, you are in virtual reality.","October 30, 2015","true","174.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","2"

I felt that ESIII: Morrowind brought more to the table for its time than ESIV: Oblivion but believe this game has done even more. I have enjoyed it on console, on PC and gone through the DLC which is worth the extra cash. The only thing missing is co-op/multi player but Elder Scrolls Online is running now, although I wish they would have done things a little differently on that game..\n\nEven if your not an Elder Scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up.\n\nI did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until I found out how to fix my save. They could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them.\n\nOverall I'd say 9.5/10 for what it is as I can't complain about missing features that just weren't supposed to be in the game although I think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.","August 13, 2013","true","19.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/72850/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","Disclaimer: Before I purchased this on Steam in October 2015, I had 1,456 hours put into the Xbox 360 version, and 68 hours in the PS3 version, so hopefully that puts my low PC game-time in perspective.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time. I was excited for the release back on 11/11/11, as I am a fan of all of The Elder Scrolls titles. The previews of Skyrim were beautiful, and though the game world was obviously smaller than some of its predecessors (Arena and Daggerfall in particular), the game would still prove to be larger than most modern games of its type. Skyrim was the first game I pre-ordered in over three years at the time of its release. My expectations were sky high, and yet the game surpassed them. I spent 101 hours in the game in its first week. Very few games can pull me in so mercilessly, and I play hundreds of them.\n\nThis intro brings me to the subject of why Skyrim deserves your time, if you're not already one of the millions of people who own it. Skyrim is an open world action RPG that does not control how you play it, throwing hundreds of possibilities at you in terms of how you level, explore, complete questlines, et cetera. The world is packed full of content and secrets, to where I am close to having lived in this world for 2,000 hours of my life and am still discovering new things from time to time. You can choose a character from a variety of races with their own perks and abilities, and the character creation system is quite impressive. From there, you complete an introductory quest, and are set free to explore the world as you wish. You can choose to rush through the main questline, or you can spend hundreds of hours ignoring it. There are multiple full questlines for you to choose from. You can choose to complete them all with one character, or choose only a few depending on how you are building your character (an assassin build may choose to utilize the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood questlines and ignore the Companions and Mages' College questlines, for example). In addition, there are hundreds of side quests and objectives that can be picked up from conversations with NPCs, reading books that speak of legends that you can actually go out into the world and explore for yourself, or even walking through the right place at the right time. Completing quests can sometimes yield you new quests, even if not right away (completing some quests will cause the quest giver to write you a letter later, for example, updating you on events and asking you to return, even weeks after you finished the first objective).\n\nThe world is lush with detail. NPCs will change their opinion of you due to things you've done, and some will even like/hate you depending on your race or who you've decided to align with on quests. Some will also agree to come on your adventures with you--permanently (or until death...which, I suppose, is still permanently). They will fight by your side and utilize anything that you give them, from armor to weapons to potions, so you can have a two person team at all times if you wish. Bards will sing tales of quests you've completed, if applicable, and people will hire thugs or even the Dark Brotherhood to hunt you down if you've somehow wronged them (including stealing from their homes or shops). Small details are in the world, from a burned down house with a corpse that has a fire scroll in its inventory, to two skeletons on a freezing shoreline, with one of the skeletons stuck in a bear trap. Hundreds of books are scattered throughout the world to give you insight into some of the lore of the world. Characters from past Elder Scrolls games are mentioned in conversations or journals/notes from time to time, giving a welcome nod to your adventures of the past if you've played previous games.\n\nSkyrim is one of the few games that rises above a "game" for me and almost becomes like a second life. Its level of rich detail and ability to completely immerse can make players hold grudges, make friends, and even work and make an honest living in-game, while going home to your family every once in a while (in a home that you built, if you have the Hearthfire expansion, which I highly recommend). If a companion dies, you can go to her/his hometown and visit the tomb, if you so wish. This is also one of the few games that is so much fun to go through while choosing to play it unconventionally (for example, I've done playthroughs where I've refused to directly kill anyone, using only defensive magics and conjuration spells and having a companion, and playthroughs where I refuse to use fast travel). I've heard that mods are great for the game, though I don't personally care for mods and play the game in its vanilla state.\n\nTo address criticisms of the game, Skyrim is not and will never be its predecessors. Its world is just that--Skyrim--and will not have the majestical fantasy landscapes of Morrowind. Magic is quite simplified as compared to Oblivion, and the leveling system is not quite as exploitative as the fourth game in the series, either. You can become overpowered in the game, and you can end up having so much money in your coffers that it's ridiculous. I love the other games in the series, but I love each one for its uniqueness. Skyrim happens to be my favorite of them all, quite possibly because of its ability to feel so personal, like you're truly in this world and truly making friends and a difference. So while it is a bit "modernized" compared to the previous games, the world is so vast and there is always so much to do that it never quite feels like a video game; it feels like an entire world to escape to.\n\nSkyrim is so vast and wonderful that it is impossible to do it justice in such a review. I could go on listing this game's strengths and end up having a novel on my hands. I recommend this game more than I recommend most, and is one of the few I can legitimately give a 10/10 to, even considering its minor flaws. Do yourself a favor and pick it up if you haven't tried it yet; chances are that you will enjoy it immensely.","November 2, 2015","true","61.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/recommended/72850/","vaagur","Vaagur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/","2091 products in account","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an Open-world RPG with an awesome story and it has one of the biggest world to explore in any games ever made! In this game, you play as the Dragonborn, the chosen one that is meant to protect Skyrim from dragons.\n\nHonestly, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is probably one of the best game on Steam. The ambiance and everything is just so great! It's still one of the best selling games on Steam even 3 years after it's release! If you haven't played it yet and are you not sure if you should buy it, you can check my personal score below.\n\nCategory        Rating /10        Details                Gameplay        8.1        The game is very well designed. You can set hotkeys for multiple spells or weapons at once, you can do questlines and misc quests at any times as long as you have the requirements, there's tons of content to explore... The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim doesn't offer anything new to the genre, however, and it's not very well balanced. Some dragons are easier to kill than some types of undeads found in dungeons. Also the AI can be quite confusing: sometimes monsters stands still and let you kill them, sometimes enemies do not even notice you walking in front of them with a high stealth level. Everybody can play the game due to good difficulty settings, but keep in mind the controls are poor and there's some weird balance going on!                Graphics        8.0        The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim graphics are nice. Some things like Snow and NPCs are not very appealing, but during the time you play, you will find tons of amazing landscapes, skies, buildings and forests... That's for the base game of course, because you can make the game more beautiful with mods. As for the animations, most are fine, but rolling and ragdoll deaths are not so well done. The interface is simple and has just the right amount of information.                Atmosphere        8.5        The music is totally amazing. It really fits the game: fighting music is intense and while exploring, the music really sets the atmosphere. Sound effects are alright, though repetitive. My opinion on voice acting is a bit more complex though. Honestly, I am impressed by some characters voice acting, like Cicero, Astrid, Senera, Sheogorath... They have very unique and amazing voices. On the other hand, some NPCs shares the same voice; like, litterally not just the same voice actor, but the same actual voice in game on multiple NPCs.                Performance        4.8        Here's the weak point of the game, definately. The amount of bugs is just catastrophic. I could write a paragraph longer than this review to list all the bugs i've experienced while playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for around 140 hours. Game breaking bugs where you cannot complete certain quest and hope that you can complete them with the console. Sometimes you need to restart the entire game from the start if you absolutely need to complete a certain quest. Your character can fall through the floor, monsters fall from the sky randomly, playing at higher than 60 fps will cause your game to act weird, some areas will just make your game crash upon loading... I know that the mod "Skyrim unofficial patches" can be downloaded to fix some of these issues, but with the game as is, you are going to be annoyed really quickly with the tons of bugs you will encounter during your playthrough of the game. As for the overall performance, the game runs quite smoothly at 60 fps at least.                Story        9.2        The story is another very strong point of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Some questlines in particular will get you so addicted to the game, that you will play it through until it's done. The fact that almost all of your choices affects the outcome and scenario of almost every single quests is just crazy. The amount of work put into this aspect of the game is huge! You can be a good guy, a bad guy or simply do just what you want. A certain character annoys you? Kill him! You recovered a powerful artifact that somebody asked you to get for him? If you want to keep it, you can! That's how much you can control your character's fate.                Singleplayer        8.5        Well, since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim only offers Singleplayer, this is just a resume of my review. The game is fun to play by yourself, it doesn't get boring at all and it's totally worth trying out. Just keep in mind, that bugs and crashes will affect your experience by a large margin unless you mod your game heavily. Even there, you might still experience some annoying bugs with mods, but it's definately gonna be better.                Multiplayer        --        This game features no co-op or multiplayer.                Playtime        10        The game is known for excelling in this aspect. It took me 140 hours just to go through essensial parts of the game to complete all achievements. I have only done a few questlines and there's tons and tons of misc. quests that I have not started. Just in 1 playthrough you can spend from 100 to upward of 1000 hours depending on many quests you wanna finish, you many things you want to personally accomplish and if you want to craft full sets of gear, get to a very high level, unlock all magics, find all books, etc... Replayability is definately a strong point too! You can create a new character to try out a different race, look, build or just to re-do some questlines you might want to approach differently, because your choices in some quests will completely affect what happens during and after the quest.                Prices        9.0        For the amount of content and playtime this game offers, US$19.99 (As of late 2014) is a steal. Sure the DLCs are quite expansive, but if you get the Legendary Edition for US$39.99 you will get much more content and a better price than individual DLCs by far. This game is totally worth buying at the listed price.                Steam Features        10        It's got all the features you would hope for! The achievements in this game are super fun to work towards with only a few missable ones that you can easily manage to do if you read-up well enough before starting your game. It's got trading cards and most important, steam workshop support! As of late 2014, there are over 23,000 gameplay mods, items, quests, creatures... The list goes on. The modding community is extremely active for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim! It's also got partial controller support and steam cloud.                Game Score        8.1\nInformation        Hours        Details                Time required to complete the game.        ~30 hours.

There is 2 sets of playable perspectives, an immersive first person view and a sweepable third person visual which allows you to rotate view around your character while your weapon is sheathed.\n\nSkyrim is the newest addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise, it repeats the tradition of freedom and choice that players can make in the game. As with any Elder Scrolls game, exploration through an open world is key, explorating every inch of the map is an integral part of Skyrim. It's addicting to uncover new areas of the massive map and will make you want examine every sector carefully since Skyrim is not a flat land but elevation and depth of the environment helps to hide caverns, lairs, castles and dungeons.\n\nThe game's combat is very basic and easy to learn. Whether you're an Archer, a Swordsman, or a Mage, everything is easy to understand and Bethesda has made it feel comfortable for the player to get a grasp on with a variety of weapons, tools and spells for the player to fill the role they want to achieve convincinly.\n\nJoining a faction/guild is another huge aspect of the game and gives you a direct sense of belonging. There are a number to choose from, each which have their own story and quests for you to get entangled with. Ranging from knights to theives to a clan of vampires. You are sure to never get bored with experimenting with how your role within your alliances affect these factions and cause them to react accordingly, making it appear as if you have an impact in the lives of npc's around you or at least their procedural agenda.\n\nSo what's new this time around? Besides making a bigger and bolder game than anything they could have achieved before, Bethesda has taken liberty to add dragons this time around and these fire breathing beasts seem to be the main attracfion as the story may feel a bit underwhelming at times - especially if you've played Obilivion.\n\nPros  Infinite mod support\nEndless hours of replayability\nFull controller support\nSteam trading cards\nCons  Ugly without mods\nMap is somewhat empty without dlc and mods\nStoryline wasn't written as nearly as well as Oblivion's storyline was\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe game overall is a decent game out of the box, of course it can look a bit last gen so don't expect anything that will wow you but if you mod it rightly, you can make this game look truly next gen, taking advantage of any new hardware on the market. User created mods will afford you the opportunities to make this your dream game, check the Nexus and have fun!\n\nRating (8.4 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 12","true","47.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","4"

Even the side quests and the downloadable content is very good, my personal favourite of these being the Dawnguard questline, though that is largely due to the new characters but will mention that in a bit.\n\nThe world is absolutely beautiful, from the snowy environments and forests to the dungeons and caves. The detail in the world is immense and you could tell the team behind the game put everything they had into it, creating a unique land and filling it with unique characters and creatures. The Dawnguard expansion had some of the best environments not just in this game but in any game. The Forgotten Vale is unbelievably beautiful and it's extenuated by the musical score. I've heard that Jeremy Soule is the John Williams of video games and before this game I didn't think much of him. But in this game I'm completely sold on him and it feels like the timing and mixing is spot on. When you see something beautiful or threatening you get the perfect musical accompaniment for it. Obviously the main theme is epic, one of my favourite pieces of music of all time.\n\nI only have two issues with the game. One is the bugs and there are quite a few of them but with such a huge game there's bound to be a few. The other is the dragon riding mechanics they introduced in Dragonborn. It doesn't give you the freedom I wanted, and it's something that another one of my favourite games, Drakan the Ancient's Gates, trumps Skyrim. I desperately wanted something like that in the game but for what I got I liked it fine, especially seeing the world from that height.","April 4","true","36.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","2"

Skyrim is a huge, immersive, lore-filled, immense world full of character. You can explore, fight, collect, or just wander around like a tourist taking screenshots. Even after playing for a couple of years, I still constantly find new places to explore and new experiences to be had.\n\nEverything about this game is extremely detailed and well thought-out, from the crafting system to the player homes, from dungeon layouts, to the races of the different NPCs you encounter and the way they use their culture to express themselves in their clothing, armor, weapons, homes, and towns.\n\nIf the hundreds of hours offered by the game itself isn't enough, there are literally thousands of mods for Skyrim, offering everything from texture enhancements to full cinematic lighting effects. There are hours and hours of additional fan-made quests and storylines, in addition to the three official DLC expansions offered by Bethesda. New NPCs, pets, followers, houses, towns, armor, weapons, food, ingredients -- you can probably find a mod to change or add to almost any aspect of Skyrim. In this way, you can keep the game fresh and new, even after hundreds of hours of play.\n\nIf you break it down to dollars spent per hour played it's probably one of the best deals in gaming.","July 13, 2013","true","437.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Al igual que el logro de hacer un objeto con el mineral del DLC Dragonborn, que si o si necesitabas Herrería a 80 y el perk de crear armaduras de ébano para poder hacerlo.\n\nUna de las cosas que tiene muy a favor el juego, es su grán comunidad de mods, tanto en Workshop como en Skyrim Nexus, una gama de mods gigante de distintos tipos y para todos los gustos (yo opté por los gráficos y poco más la verdad, no me gusta llenar de mods un juego hasta el punto que ya deja de ser Skyrim y se vuelve otra cosa, obviamente respeto al que lo haga, pero si tienes que llenar de mods un juego para que te guste.. Deh, para eso no lo jueges, no?.\n\nUn pequeño punto malo, que no es del juego sinó de los mods, es que pueden bugearte o cagarte misiones, como me pasó a mi con la Hermandad Oscura, que jamás apareció el ♥♥♥♥ mensajero que SI O SI tiene que darte una nota para comenzar la misión, hay formas de iniciarla igualmente con comandos en la consola, pero es inútil, ya que más adelante, al forzarla con la consola la misión, hay personajes que no aparece donde tendrían y bueno, pasa lo que pasa.\n\n\nResumiendo todo el Corán que puse arriba, el juego me entretuvo porque son mi droga los juegos de exploración y con muchas misiones secundarias, pero en cuanto a historia principal tambalea y creo que mucho, siento que todas las cosas que hago durante el juego apenas influyen en Skyrim más que en diálogos forzados o situaciones que hsata me dan verguenza ajena como me tratan de restregar las cosas que hago para hacerte sentir "Hey, salvaste el mundo!" y todos cojiendo en las granjas sin siquiera saber que Alduiun casi se los viola, tiene demasiada fama el juego, y por lo único que lo disfruté es por la enormidad del mapa, el Lore de los dragones, los Dwemers y los Elfos de las Nieves (Falmers) Por eso es que disfruté más la trama de los DLC's que la del propio juego (Salvo la misión del "Muro de Alduin" la parte donde Esbern narra todo, es lo único que en serio me interesó profundamente de todas las misiones primarias, además del asunto de los Thalmor.\n\nEs un poco triste que me haya atrapado más esas historias internas que salen en libros o en misiones secundarias, que la propia trama principal en si misma. (Tengo que aclarar que los libros son CIENTOS y algunos son de verdad HERMOSOS porque te cuentan cosas que el juego creo que ni siquiera tendría las herramientas para hacerlo).\nRecomiendo comprarlo cuando esté en rebaja, el precio de los DLC's me parece exageradísimo para   lo que duran jajaja, aunque la historia para mi valiera la pena de los 2.","June 6, 2013","true","294.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Bethesda went above and beyond what game developers nowadays (aka 2015) would promise :^ . One thing I found interesting was how Bethesda gives you a large, open world to ride around in and discover (that feeling you get when you discovered some place no one knows about is simply awesome) :O, where you never know what might happen next- a dragon could attack you, a pack of wolves could spring out and ambush you, a courier could run up to you with a message- anything could happen, at any time. Another thing that I loved was how the game made me feel. Their manipulation of your feelings, as a matter of fact, nearly made me fear the dark! The soundtrack is simply amazing- every time I throw myself into battle, I can literally feel my heart pounding and my palms sweating as I charge forward, hoping to halve my enemies with my big awesome battleaxe. And finally, you get to choose what you do, and how- you could be a sophisticated magician, a bloodthirsty warrior (like me), a mysterious necromancer, and so on. It's amazing.\n\nAs I said before, Skyrim is too awesome to be described in words. If you want to know how utterly amazing the game is, buy a copy and play it. You won't regret it.

It’s one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. It’s also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. You can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. Speaking of quests, there’s an awful lot of them.\n\nThe main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world. Pretty soon, you find out you are the legendary Dragonborn, a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls. It’s your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace. two thumbs from me! because the game deserves it.","November 29, 2013","true","143.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

You begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become.  It is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels.  This in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like it's a quarter of the way through!  This is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in Skyrim.

After dedicating even more time in TES IV Oblivion, I eventually got Skyrim in 2012 and I will admit that after creating all kinds of characters I did eventually get tired of it, that was until I discovered MMOxReview on Youtube (Great guy, check him out :)) I then started modding my skyrim game, and a once Great game turned into something legendary... Now to be honest I wasn't all THAT fond of the Main quest, BUT the thieves guild and Dark brotherhood in these games has always really inspired me, I just wish they could have made them both longer :( Unfortuantly I have never played the expansions for Skyrim seeing as though I can't afford it :( Yeah i know, sad isn't it, But that hasn't stopped me from playing Skyrim over and OVER again... TES Online... let's just say I probs will never play it because I just don't really like the looks of it. And I am VERY keen for TES VI (I think it is going to be set in Hammerfell) Please tell me if you would like me to write a guide for this game, I am quite happy to and I promise I won't use any of that noob language if i do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chelovekurbatov/recommended/72850/","chelovekurbatov","CheloveKurbatov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chelovekurbatov/","373 products in account","There are many reasons why we play games. Some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. Alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. Skyrim is the latest world offered by Bethesda to live in, and it seems like its Bethesda’s finest accomplishment yet.\n\nSimilarly to the two Elder Scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. Just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. You are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with Shmagonborn).\n\nBethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. Skyrim isn’t just a series of buildings, environments and NPCs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. The sense of freedom found in Elder Scrolls is unparalleled, and Skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. The main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. As you go exploring dungeons, assisting NPCs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world Skyrim is. It is compelling to learn more about Skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world.\nThrough all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. The main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. You can complete missions for The Companions (Skyrim’s equivalent of the Fighter’s Guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in Skyrim, or join the Mages College and be looked down upon by Nords who believe that magic is for sissies. Even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a Dark Elf against a bunch of racist Nords can be satisfying. Standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm.\n\nThe games graphics have been talked about endlessly. Now, Skyrim’s graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. Yet it terms of detail, they don’t hold a candle to games like Rage and Battlefield 3. Yet Skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of Skyrim’s aesthetics. Bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in Skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. Part of the reason Morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than Oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while Oblivion came off as a standard European fantasy setting, Morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. Skyrim returns with the art direction that made Morrowind so unique. While the location might not be as exotic as Morrowind, Skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. The buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give Skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life Scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it.\n–~~~~~~~~~~~~–\n\nThe combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous Elder Scrolls, is drastically improved here. While there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but it’s not as bad as it was in previous games. The biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. You can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. I personally went sword and staff, Gandalf style. There is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. This is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons.\nDragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. You will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. A few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. Killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new ‘shouts’. Shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. Shouts are a welcome addition to the game’s combat system, and further adds to the combat’s tactical quality.\n\nNow this is a Bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. I have experienced a few unresponsive actions from NPCs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. However, this is an area I can’t criticize Bethesda much about. In a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. To their credit, Bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. We can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. Bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking.\nSkyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you aren’t particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you can’t help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. I can’t point to a single part of the game and say “that is the best part”; the entire game is an experience. It stays firmly rooted in Elder Scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make Skyrim stand on its own. After experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of Skyrim, you can’t help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as “open world”.\n\nGood: Vast yet incredibly detailed world, Incredible Depth, Interesting Story, Improved Combat System, Gorgeous Graphics and wonderful style\nBad: Buggy, some standard 'fetch' missions\nPrice: AED\n9.5/10","November 23, 2014","true","30.1"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","0"

Otherways, you will end after 30 hours.\n\nFrom my personal experience, If you have a good imagination, then you will forget what real life is.\nI remember, how I got this game for christmas before 3 years. Well, I did not have much friends or other hobbies, so I started to play it. I imagined my self-created stories with my characters, like: my elf character is cursed bad guy and etc. Then I met my girfriend, so I had to say "goodbye" to skyrim. I think If I did not have her, I could have over 1000 hours on it.\n\nBut now seriously, that was my personal though, now let´s say something more about the game, shall we ?\n+ 6 main campaings:\nDragonborn (not much plot-twists, but that´s what the game is all about.)\nCompanions (Mercenaries, few plot-twist, sympatic characters in it. Aela is hot by the way)\nMage University(I don´t like to play as mage, so I didn´t like it much, but it is worth it)\nThieves Guild( I liked that one, contains really rememberable characters, many plot twists, AWESOME)\nThe Dark Brotherhood(Assassins, I though being murderer won´t be job for me in skyrim. But damn, this campaing made me play the game many times. It has sympatic characters and unforgetable plot twists. With the Thieves Guild, this was the best one for me)\nAnd the last one - Empire vs. Stormcloak Rebelion (civil war. Both sideshave  truth in something, but only the Stormcloak Leader is sympatic)\n\n+DLCs include\nDragonborn - New whole island, new campaing and about 25 hours of doing everything there.\nDawnguard - Two new factions - Vampires vs. Vampire Hunters. Sympatic Girl Serana. And Crossbows.\nHearthfire - "The Sims DLC" - you can build 3 houses, adopt children\n\n-Game was released with many bugs, which doesn´t bother me so much,but physics in specific parts of this game can´t be forgiven.\n\n- I DON´T LIKE, when someone says that Skyrim is the best RPG game of all the time. There are better RPGs like the Witcher, Gothic etc. Skyrim is one of the better ones, but not the best one.\n\nDo I recommend you to buy it ? Of course I do !  9/10\n\nBut... I regret that time wasted on this game. If I spent my time better, than... I don´t know... I maybe had more friends than I have now. Who knows. So don´t be like me. Don´t be no-life kids as I was. Get a girlfriend maybe xD\n\nThanks for reading, if someone did. It´s been an honor to tell you my opinion. Thank you for your time.","February 20, 2015","true","729.1"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","26","39","10","2"

If you have a penchant for magic or the dark arts, join the Mages College, or if you prefer assassinating people for fun money, The Dark Brotherhood beckons you!\n\nYou can do so many things in Skyrim, you can become a Vampire, a Werewolf or just be the dragon slaying badass you were meant to be!\n\nLike any open world high fantasy RPG it's a great game but the flaws are mostly held to heart by console peasants gamers who demand shiny things to be flawless. However, it is not flawless as glitches are common as they were in the previous games. It's almost becoming a 'style' in the Elder Scrolls series to have games that are so full of bugs that ant eaters are circling Bethesda studios as we speak. But bugs aren't that bad some can be funny and some even make you laugh for hours on end!\n\nThis game is more engaging than a lock on a public bathroom. Once started you have a rather generic high fantasy experience of running around figuring out what's worth stealing and what's not. After a while though you might tire of the combat and fetch'em'all missions and then you start another character.\n\nWho or what you start as in Skyrim matters little, who you’ll become means everything. So it doesn't matter if you’re a local Nord, an Argonian, or an Orc. It doesn't matter if you’re partial to axes, arrows, or great balls of fire. It doesn't matter  if you’re driven by your storyline destiny, or driven to explore, sooner or later you are going to find out that every path WILL lead you to distraction, sometimes a quick and easy looking quest will turn into a 2 hour long expedition into a huge underground cavern, or just give you a nice surprise in the form of treasure!\n\nDLC List\nDragonborn\nHearthfire\nDawnguard\nSkyrim High Resolution Texture Pack\n\nMods\nHere I will list all the best mods for Skyrim\n\nThe best site for Skyrim mods[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nTamriel Reloaded - Textures and Parallax [www.nexusmods.com]\n\nHoth - A companion mod[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nDuel - Combat Realism[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nRealistic Needs and Diseases [www.nexusmods.com]\n\nFrostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nFalskaar[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nSkyrim Script Extender ( You need this to be able to use quite a lot of mods)[skse.silverlock.org]\n\nNexus Mod Manager ( The best mod installer for Skyrim[www.nexusmods.com]\n\nProsYou can do anything you want to\nYou can go anywhere you like.\nWonferful music\nInteresting quests\nHighly Moddable\nSuperb visuals, voice acting, soundtrack\nThe world of Skyrim is gorgeous and feels alive\nMain quest line is an improvement from Oblivion\nBugs abound, especially with physics\n\nConsTechnical issues could ruin moments for some players\nDoes little to take advantage of the PC platform besides the improved visuals\nYou will forget what it means to sleep or have meaningful social interactions outside of the game\nCompanions are dumb as a bag of rocks\nNo multiplayer mode\nBugs abound, especially with physics\nMenus and interface are not too good (But can be improved with mods)\n\nRating\nSkyrim in all of it's glory clearly deserves a\n\n9.5/10","May 24, 2015","true","21.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","16","21","5","1"

This game is amazing.\nFirst impressions upon playing the game; where do I start\nImpressions on 'finishing' main story lines;  Now, what will I do next.\n\nThere are loads of quests, hidden secrets, hidden lore, tones of areas to explore and loot - Then beat the game and start again with a new character.\nAlthough there is a fast travel system in the game; don't use it. It's an RPG - go exploring. Discover the land and her secrets.\n\nWith more than 800 hours offsteam and 800 more, this is possibly the game that I've sinked the most time into.\nAnd I still sink time into.\n\nSure skyrim is really "dummed down" compaired to older TES titles, but then mod it up - there's a mod/overhaul for everything.\nReally hard to dislike anything in the game.\nAlso, avoid Steam workshop - Use nexus mods and stick to the Nexus Mod Manager or LOOT. Save yourself from massive headaches.\n\nAnd hey - No paid horse armour!\nThat is all. Crap review over.

The DLCs were so-so, Hearthfire being my favorite of the three; but the mods and the modding community were what made this the premeir experience in PC gaming. I play Skyrim using 3D glasses and headphones and with the amazing mods like Frostfall, Wet and Cold, Immersive HUD, realistic needs and diseases, and Hunterborn it felt as if I was really there in Skyrim! With my role playing and dead-is-dead playstyle it was truly a magical experience, fulfilling the promise of video games that was only hinted at when I saw Dragon's Lair in the arcade as a child.\n\nThis game was worth it at full price, and today is a "must own" when you can snag it on sale for 15 bucks or less! I have subscribed to Nexus in the past for mods, and will do so again, usually when I plan on playing Skyrim heavily for a month or more. I will now start to support modders ranging from a few cents to a few dollars depending on the amount I use it and the quality. What Valve, Bethesda and Nexus need to do is sit down and really hammer out a user friendly donation system. I want to be able to donate directly from my Steam Wallet or a Nexus Wallet with a minimal number of clicks. As it stands, it is a hassle to throw a few pennies at a mod and when I am trying to relax after a harrowing day at work, I don't want to fill out a bunch of forms! If Valve, Bethesda and Nexus need to take a tiny slice (5% max) of that donation to offset the cost of that system, I am OK with that.\n\nFinally, three and a half years into its lifespan, Bethesda is prepping to announce Fallout 4 and we are going to start the long march to Elder Scrolls 6! What should the future hold? Bethesda needs to think big: the Elder Scrolls Online was a failure not because of what it was, but because of what it wasn't. People want a co-op Skyrim experience not an MMO. Even now, Bethesda could and should realease a no more than 10$ co-op DLC for Skyrim, or at least get the ZeniMax lawyers to stop embargoing modders who have gotten to the prototype stage of development. Imagine traversing the vast lands (and seas!!) of all of Tamriel as the inevitable war between mankind and the Thalmor erupts across the continent and perhaps the entire world of Nirn and beyond!\n\nThis is where Bethesda needs to get the modding scene right! Bring those who want to do this for a living and parcel out sections of Nirn to them so they can build it to completion as formal, supported and integrated DLC! Imagine a seemless world where you and you good friends can campaign in full virtual reality!\n\nWe should work to rebuild the community and to fulfill the promise hinted at by Skyrim!\n\n- Thank you!","April 27, 2015","true","647.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

Но лично для меня Скайрим  один из лучших игровых миров. Скайрим огромен, красив, разнообразен и хранит огромное количество тайн. У него есть своя история и культура. Но также он крайне опасен, он населен разными мифическими существами, среди которых есть и драконы способные уничтожить весь Тамриэль (континент на котором происходят все места действия TES) .\n\nМежду этим Скайрим раздирает кровопролитная Гражданская война между Братьями Бури и Имперцами, разделившая Скайрим на два лагеря. Большинство Гильдий потеряли свое величие и еле-еле сводят концы с концами. И во всем этом хаосе появляется герой Драконорожденный, который должен установить порядок и уничтожить главное зло, пришедшее из далекого прошлого, способное уничтожить весь мир, Верховного Дракона Алдуина.\n\nГеймплейная часть довольна приятна. Механика ближнего и дальнего боя хороша, но есть недочеты. Магия бесполезна на ранних этапах игры, без должной прокачки, но магическое лечение иногда спасает. Чтобы лучше обучиться магией и научиться новым заклинаниям, лучше вступить в Гильдию. Крики это уже поинтересней, чтобы ими обучиться нужно знать драконий язык и уметь прочитать их. Чтобы обучиться новым крикам нужно найти своебразные драконьи стены, их найти в принипе не так уж и трудно. Но чтобы изучить этот крик нужна драконья душа, а убить дракона на ранних этапах игры довоольно сложно. Героя можно настроить под себя, стать можно практически кем угодно, в этом и есть вся прелесть ролевых игр Bethesda.\n\nИтог:\n+Огромной мир. Один из лучших миров за всю историю игр.\n+Красивая графика, живописные пейзажи.\n+Полная реиграбельность.\n+Отличная атмосфера и приятные персонажи.\n+Разнообразная прокачка и редактор персонажа. Героя можно буквально настроить под себя.\n+Интерактивность и свобода выбора.\n+Отличный саундтрек.\n+Много контента.\n+Живое моддерское комьюнити.\n+-Баги, но без них не обходится не одна игра.\nИтоговая оценка 10 криков/10.","May 6, 2015","true","126.6"," 37 of 60 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","37","60","12","0"

All the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. Managing to build his own house and have a family.\n\nThe main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you won't be bored for a long time. So don't just rush the main story and assume you seen it all.\n\nOut of the DLC's, the best would be Dragonborn. It offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons.\nWhile the Dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and Hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes.\n\nThe worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. But only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest won't finish or continue.\n\n8/10 Only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. You get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. So I say when you learn the game better, go on Master or Legendary difficulty for a challenge.","January 10, 2015","true","911.5"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/recommended/72850/","256color","michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/","315 products in account","This game is not a "love it or hate it", it's a "love it AND hate it". Sometimes while playing I think to myself: "This is THE game, it's just a dream come true, is it real?", but the next moment it might change to: "This is the most stupid waste of time I've ever paid for". First of all, it is HUGE. It is enormous. I've done 300 hours into it and I'm still in the middle of the main quest. It's got everything: fights, spells, potions, horses, dogs, children, marriages, dragons, clothes, bookcases, treasure maps, grocery stores, pagan worshipping, war, armageddon, waterbreething, dead naked sorceresses in bikinis, mysterious ancient civilisations, glowing mushrooms, mammoths, zombies and lots, lots, lots of bugs. It is very beautiful, especially at night, when you see the northern lights shining, but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you.  It's got so many quests, tasks, characters and places, I think even developers don't know them all. It is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves. Each cave has something in it, each ruin might conceal a secret, each village might have a mystery to uncover. The freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural. You can be a werewolf, a vampire, a mage, a warrior, an archer, a thief, an assassin, a blacksmith, a miner, an alchemist, on top of the dragonslayer and The Chosen One, and most of that you can be at the same time. This schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay. You have swords, bows, daggers, maces, spells, magic staffs, magic scrolls, and dragon shouts, all of which you can use as weapons. You meet all sorts of enemies and you're free to deal with them by any means you prefer. There is no special weapon for a giant. You don't really have to use spells against a mage. Moral choices are also a blur. There is no "proper" or "right" way, really, you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result. It's not a bad thing to use conjuration spells, necromancy is not punishable, poisons are as legal as healing potions, there is no white or black magic. Sometimes it's impossible to understand if you're doing good or bad. I think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests. If developers would remove the quest lines as such, turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence, at any time (and preferably at any place with any character), it would make the game a triumph of freedom (and a complete mess). So, Skyrim is a beautiful, ugly, strict, messy, very stupid and very clever game, which everyone should play at least once. On the easy level it is almost casual, no effort is required to deal with the fights. It can be played on a Mac through Crossover.","November 25, 2013","true","321.0"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

Jujur saja saya tidak terlalu melakukan Main Objective di game ini, saya hanya berjalan jalan saja untuk membuka semua marker di map dan juga mencari pemandangan untuk dibuat foto, dan terkadang saya juga lebih sering untuk modding karakter ketimbang memburu Naga.\n\n2 tahun berlalu sejak modding menjadi suatu aktivitas yang mengasikan hingga datanglah hari ini dimana Valve atau Steam, membuat fitur baru untuk menjual mod, ya, Menjual Mod. Saya mengecek beberapa mod yang saya endorse dan download, beberapa diantaranya sudah di Hidden atau bahkan di Remove oleh para pembuatnya. Setelah berkeliling sebentar, mod mod tersebut nongol di Steam Workshop dengan harga yang sangat tidak masuk akal, atau bahkan bukan pembuatnya yang memasang harga, tetapi orang yang baru saja bermain Skyrim dan meng-upload mod orang lain, saya cukup prihatin akan hal ini, dengan sistem baru dari Steam ini saya menjadi enggan bermain game ini lagi, Sudah cukup mengeluarkan biaya untuk membeli base game dan juga DLC dari game ini, Mengapa mod lebih mahal dari pada Main Files-nya ?","April 23, 2015","false","86.7"," 163 of 293 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","163","293","14","15"

I'm sad to see this happen to such a beloved game, and for such wonderful companies to sink so low. If you love this game, or any modded game, please considering donating to them through paypal, and skipping the 25% for the creator mess that Steam has created. Everything should be optional paid, and at the least 50% of revenue to the modders. For shame Steam. Please, do not support this microtransaction trend, it hurts you, it hurts the gaming community. I highly reccomend checking out the Nexus creators forecast, and response to this whole ordeal HERE: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/news/12449/? and the forecast HERE: http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/12444/? . It paints a clear, and concise picture of how this hurts the community, and how many issues can arise with such an action.

I would discuss all of the faults and failings of Skyrim, of how Bethesda took the generic route for more profit while selling out essentially everything that made Elder Scrolls worth playing, all while butchering the lore to cover their changes.\n\nClasses, a starting birth sign, the total nerf of all things magic, things like hand to hand being rolled into perks, the removal of stats, a whole class of armor being removed, reduction of armor pieces, the lies about spears, the broken marriage system, the dull civil war, the normalizing, and thus dulling effect on battling dragons, lore and plot hiccups and so much more could be covered.\n\nBut instead, I can summarize it all with one message; I only bought this game because it could be modded. Really, the only reason why I even have well over 1000 hours in Skyrim is because of mods. On its own, even without ripping into every flaw, mistake, horrible design choice, the mountain of bugs and the aging engine that they still haven't bothered to work out flaws like the stuttering, Skyrim is not worth playing for more than a few hours. It holds no merit on its own, other than being open to modding.\n\nPeople can disagree, of course. There are a lot of people who still play it to this day on consoles, without the ability to mod. To them, I do not ask why, because it would solve nothing. I would still disagree with them. To me, this game is a flawed mockery of Elder Scrolls and the only thing that saved it is the modding community.\n\nI hold no hope for the future of Elder Scrolls, not after this game, and not after the way Bethesda so causally almost destroyed the community with their greed.","April 24, 2015","false","440.9"," 184 of 332 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","184","332","9","3"

Paywalling mods is not the way to go as it introduces too many complex issues into the modding community that brings no benefits to anyone other than the Valve and Bethesda's pocket filled with money.\n\nI support the idea of getting the modders paid for their hard work in enriching the games but putting a paywall is not the right way. I support donations for modders as it is fairer as everyone has different level of perceived value for something.\n\nThe only scenario I support paid mods is when a mod had done exceptional work where it can be essentially a full game or an official expansion with fair amount of new content and reasonable price tag, such as Age of Empires 2's Forgotten Empires mod that became an offical expansion.\n\nI would gladly pay for exceptional mods such as C&C Generals Rise of the Reds, Dawn of War's Ultimate Apocalypse or Homeworld 2's Complex mod as these teams had outdone what the developers had done with the original game and also provided a fresh and vastly expanded experience to the game. A sword or a handful of quests in Skyrim does not provide the fresh experience like those mods mentioned above.

In light of recent events, it has occurred to me that Valve and Zenimax no longer care about the customer or communities. It is a disappointing turn of events, and I wish the right thing would be done. Unfortunately, I see little chance in that happening; the damage is done.\n\nREASONS FOR NOT SUPPORTING PAID MODSIt opens up opportunities for theft.\nGabe Newell stated that it is "impossible" between the community and Valve at this happening. Yet it's already happened, several times in fact, with the first bundle of mods released. What's worse, if modders want to see if their work is being stolen, they must go through the arbitrary paywall.\n\nIt dissolves the intertwining of mods.\nIt's not just entire mods being stolen, it's also assets. What Zenimax and Gabe Newell do not understand is Skyrim has mods that are related to other mods, mostly through the use of the same resources. Modders release resources(for FREE) online to share FREELY with other modders. So what happens when a modder makes something with their hard work, and asks money for it? How will those other modders who shared their resources get paid, or even be aware their work is being used like this? Not even mentioning the fact that many modders who create things in software like Blender or Photoshop don't even have licenses to monetize on them. This is why it's a terrible idea, the mods depend too much on each other to have some of them put behind a paywall.\n\nIt splits the community.\nPartly for the reasons above and for many other reasons, the community is damaged through this action. Gabe Newell said that money is what drives a community, perhaps for communities that are money-driven. But he doesn't realize that the modding community has worked for well over a decade with little issue. And here Valve and Zenimax enter, destroying that sense of community in just a few days. Great job.\n\nThe modders get shafted.\nI'm not saying modders don't deserve money for their hard work, or that I'm unwilling to pay. If you take a look at my Steam library you'd know I pay for my products. My problem with the current system is that it is a very insulting way of going about it. When the modders do all the hard work, they get 25%. In what way is this a fair deal to them? That insinuates that Valve is getting 30% and Zenimax is getting 45%. Why do either of you deserve that cut? What have you done except provide the tools and service to distribute these mods? Does a car mechanic give the majority of his cash to the car manufacturer and tool makers? The deal is a raw one, and frankly it is an insulting one. If people want to support these modders, it is best done through donations where they get all the money they deserve.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I request that you cease and desist this morally, legally, and creatively stunted attempt at making an extra buck.

But a donation button seems reasonable for people who might like to say thanks with their wallet for all the hard work modders have done. The Skyrim modding community is an incredible and unique and for Vale and Bethesda to attempt monetize it has left me questioning my relationship with these two companies. It's pretty disingenuous to release the Creation Kit for free, then YEARS later say we want $$$! I have a feeling that some lawyers at Bethesda realized, after four years, that mods are an untapped revenue stream for their shareholders and decided to capitalize on it, without having any idea how that would effect the community or their company's image. With Fallout 4 and TES VI on the horizon, this looks like a cash grab by Bethesda, an attempt to solidify a money-making scheme for future releases.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Briggsred/recommended/72850/","Briggsred","✡ Daddy Dabooris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Briggsred/","360 products in account","I am no longer recommending this game or Steam's service as of April 26th 2015. In light of recent events, it has occurred to me that Valve and Zenimax no longer care about the customer or communities. It is a disappointing turn of events, and I wish the right thing would be done. Unfortunately, I see little chance in that happening; the damage is done.\n\nREASONS FOR NOT SUPPORTING PAID MODSIt opens up opportunities for theft.\nGabe Newell stated that it is "impossible" between the community and Valve at this happening. Yet it's already happened, several times in fact, with the first bundle of mods released. What's worse, if modders want to see if their work is being stolen, they must go through the arbitrary paywall.\n\nIt dissolves the intertwining of mods.\nIt's not just entire mods being stolen, it's also assets. What Zenimax and Gabe Newell do not understand is Skyrim has mods that are related to other mods, mostly through the use of the same resources. Modders release resources(for FREE) online to share FREELY with other modders. So what happens when a modder makes something with their hard work, and asks money for it? How will those other modders who shared their resources get paid, or even be aware their work is being used like this? Not even mentioning the fact that many modders who create things in software like Blender or Photoshop don't even have licenses to monetize on them. This is why it's a terrible idea, the mods depend too much on each other to have some of them put behind a paywall.\n\nIt splits the community.\nPartly for the reasons above and for many other reasons, the community is damaged through this action. Gabe Newell said that money is what drives a community, perhaps for communities that are money-driven. But he doesn't realize that the modding community has worked for well over a decade with little issue. And here Valve and Zenimax enter, destroying that sense of community in just a few days. Great job.\n\nThe modders get shafted.\nI'm not saying modders don't deserve money for their hard work, or that I'm unwilling to pay. If you take a look at my Steam library you'd know I pay for my products. My problem with the current system is that it is a very insulting way of going about it. When the modders do all the hard work, they get 25%. In what way is this a fair deal to them? That insinuates that Valve is getting 30% and Zenimax is getting 45%. Why do either of you deserve that cut? What have you done except provide the tools and service to distribute these mods? Does a car mechanic give the majority of his cash to the car manufacturer and tool makers? The deal is a raw one, and frankly it is an insulting one. If people want to support these modders, it is best done through donations where they get all the money they deserve.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I request that you cease and desist this morally, legally, and creatively stunted attempt at making an extra buck. Save your reputation before it's too late.","April 26, 2015","false","261.1"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","0"

Personally I would never charge for a mod I've done, I'm giving back to the community that's given me so much enjoyment. But a donation button seems reasonable for people who might like to say thanks with their wallet for all the hard work modders have done. The Skyrim modding community is an incredible and unique and for Vale and Bethesda to attempt monetize it has left me questioning my relationship with these two companies. It's pretty disingenuous to release the Creation Kit for free, then YEARS later say we want $$$! I have a feeling that some lawyers at Bethesda realized, after four years, that mods are an untapped revenue stream for their shareholders and decided to capitalize on it, without having any idea how that would effect the community or their company's image. With Fallout 4 and TES VI on the horizon, this looks like a cash grab by Bethesda, an attempt to solidify a money-making scheme for future releases. This nickle-and-dimming people to death has no place in PC Gaming. Find a better way to do it because you're turning your fan base against you.\nTL:DR 11/10 before, -1/10 after the decision to take a 75% cut of revenue from modders.","April 27, 2015","false","219.4"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","0"

I probably have over 400-500 hours on that version before I bought it again on steam for one reason: I was missing out on the steam workshop mods to mod my game into complete oblivion. Which I did.. several times.. crashing my pc.. BUT HEY I had a great time doing it!\n\nNow off to the game.\n\nStory\n\nYou are the Dragonborn. you can kill dragons and use their voice and language. as a matter of fact. you can actually absorb their souls. As it goes around the land of skyrim is in danger because of the dragons returing after being dead for years and years. You are the only one that can kill them and stop Skyrim from bruning up into ashes.\nThe story Mission are good enough but the story lacks a bit and falls short due to the rich world surrounding it. You will be sidetracked by pretty much everything you see on your way to the next story mission. I was around 200 hours in and I had not even finished the main story quests yet. I was just doing every single sidequest that I could find. The world of skyrim is so rich and full of things to do that you wont even notice the world around you is falling apart. The story itself is decent enough and so is the voiceacting in the game. But what the story lacks in content, the rest of the game makes up for that.And when your done with the main story there are plenty of things to do.  Write your own story.  Become the next legend. join the brotherhood of thieves etc etc\n\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe core combat system and being able to choose between 3th persona nd first person really makes the game more enjoyable. The combat is nothing special but the mods man.. The mods make everything more immersive and better. I think I spent more times in nexus mod manager than actually playing the game. The combat itself is a fluid enough and being able to fast travel around the world if you have discovered a location comes in handy. Every interaction with the world comes down to your own choices. Maybe you want to murder everybody. Or become a hero. its all up to you. The dialogue in the game is rich and intresting. I just said that you can fast travel anywhere in the world but the game is also great to just wander around in on foot or with a horse. The landscapes are great to look at and there is so much to discover. To keep it short. its pretty damn amazing.\n\nGraphics, performance\n\nSkyrim is pretty to look at. The game is full of good textures and enviroments to explore. BUT, some of the textures on the other hand are horrible. And thats where the mod community steps in! The community made tons and tons of texturepacks and complete overhauls for the game. They are amazing and make skyrim a enjoyable world to explore. It doesn't have the best graphics but it fits the world well in my opinion.\n\nThe game runs well. I have nothing to complain about that. I still have a solid framerate even after I activated all my mods. As for the glitches and bugs: There are some bugs and glitches in the game like npc's who suddenly go completely mad and your horse... it can apparently climb 90 degrees mountains without breaking its legs. anyway, most of the bugs and glitches are more hilarious than annoying and it didnt take me away from having a great time.\n\nAnd speaking of the community. its still huge after  years. Its amazing what modders can come up with. There are so many mods for this game that add up to a even greater gameplay experience.\nGo check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse.\n\nwell to wrap this review up lets go to the PROS and CONS of the game before we move on to my verdict.\n\nPROS\nEnough content to ruin your social life.\nAmazing mod community\nDLC's are worth buying\nRich world to explore\nA good progression system\nIntresting sidequests\nMain story is decent\nVoiceacting is good\nThe amount of weapons and enemies doesn't lack\nVariety in missions\nto much in this game is good.. the list is goes on and on.\nCONS\nOccasional bugs and glitches\nCorrupted save files. ( save often if you have mods insstalled and make a backup)\nThe story falls short\nDon't have enough time in my life to finish all the content I have for this game.\nConclusion & Final verdict\n\nTo keep it short. where the story lacks the rich world makes up for it. enjoyable combat system and a rich full world to wander around in. You will not be able to lay this game down once you discover the mods after you finish the main story. Oh did I already tell you how great the MODS for this game are? Well im telling you again anyways. I loved every second of playing this game and I have never gotten bored while playing. I personally recommend this for anyone who likes a good RPG, or any game in general really. Now on to my final verdict.\nMy final verdict for The elder scrolls V skyrim:  A 10/10 MASTERPIECE.\n\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

No joke. I feel like I started playing this game only yesterday, and yet here I am, already close to 100 hours and more than 70 hours of gaming these past 15 days. I definitely recommend it, unless you don't want your life to be taken away from you.\nEnglish isn't my first language, but I'll try to put my feelings into words anyway: Excellent game, with very good graphics. I stopped counting the numbers of screenshots I took of the sky, aurora borealis, mountains and forests. So many quests to do, so many possibilites. Everytime I play I can feel all the work that has been put into the making of the game. So many details and things to discover. You can also relate to many characters, so it's amazing.\nI really am in love with this game. I'd say the only negative thing I could say about it is that it has taken my life away from me... But hey, at least I'm having fun, so is this really a bad thing?\n","June 3","true","111.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

There is currently no RPG like it besides earlier iterations in the Elder Scrolls series.\n\nThat being said, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I say this because modding is the largest reason why I have come back to Skyrim time and time again as I am sure it is the reason so many other people have come back again and again. I would venture as far as saying that mods are the only things that keep games alive so long after release, especially Skyrim.\n\nAfter a several month break, I was considering playing the game again with new mods recently, but upon my opening of Steam, I discovered this despicable and shallow update introduced by Valve, who I had once trusted so much, and Bethesda, who I knew was litigious, but I didn't know they were asses too.\n\nWith the introduction of paid mods, I've stopped playing the game. In fact, I can't play the game. All of my save files no longer work because a few of the mods I used are locked behind a paywall which I refuse to break down because it is ridiculous that I have to do so in the first place.\n\nI was infuriated when I learned what Valve pays for the mods when they rake in profits. 25% to the modders when Valve just distributes the game? That's practically robbery. That's like taking 75% of a taxi driver's income because you built the car.\n\nEven more so that the Gestap... I mean Valve is now temp banning anyone who speaks out against this whole debacle on the forums.\n\nWhat's next? Paid patches?\n\nTo be honest, I wouldn't entirely mind paying for mods if a few simple changes were made:\n1) Fix quality control. Who wants to pay $99 for a pair of horse testicles?\n2) Donations only. This is a basic feature, Nexus has it, it's much nicer and less intrusive/cash grabby.\n3) Pay modders more. Pay modders more. Pay modders more. Do I need to say it again? Taking 75% of the cut is ridiculous, yeah, you need to keep the servers running, okay, that's fine. I'm sure you can do it with 15% or even 10% of the cut. 75%? Are you kidding me?\n\nValve, this is a chance to regain the trust of you former loyal fanbase/consumer base. Learn from your mistakes and fix them.","April 26, 2015","false","82.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

Choosing to divide the pay wall structure this way results in an inferior product.","April 26, 2015","false","576.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

I had not noticed the Steam paid mod controversy until after I purchased this game.  I purchased a game I have already owned for 3 or 4 years because of the opportunity to try free mods.  I now regret my purchase.\n\nThe idea that Valve and Bethesda would charge for something like this is bewildering, and the percentage of the profits they keep is as well.  My biggest issue is the lack of quality control.  You have no way to determine the quality of a mod before purchasing.  No way to determine if the next update makes it stop fuctioning.  Mods are mostly made by amateurs.  Even if they are paid, this does not mean they have the skills necessary to produce quality mods that will not negatively affect game stability.  I would never purchase a product with so little guarantee of quality.\n\nThis will inevitably lead to sweatshop, gold-spammer-style cheap content that drowns out the quality mods we are used to.  I have in the past donated my talents to producing mods for the community to enjoy (I provided voice overs for multiple Dragon Age mods.)  I would be far less willing to do this in the future.\n\nLet me add, just not buying mods is NOT a solution.  The existance of a market in and of itself impacts the quality of content.","April 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

There is currently no RPG like it besides earlier iterations in the Elder Scrolls series.\n\nThat being said, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I say this because modding is the largest reason why I have come back to Skyrim time and time again as I am sure it is the reason so many other people have come back again and again. I would venture as far as saying that mods are the only things that keep games alive so long after release, especially Skyrim.\n\nAfter a several month break, I was considering playing the game again with new mods recently, but upon my opening of Steam, I discovered this despicable and shallow update introduced by Valve, who I had once trusted so much, and Bethesda, who I knew was litigious, but I didn't know they were asses too.\n\nWith the introduction of paid mods, I've stopped playing the game. In fact, I can't play the game. All of my save files no longer work because a few of the mods I used are locked behind a paywall which I refuse to break down because it is ridiculous that I have to do so in the first place.\n\nI was infuriated when I learned what Valve pays for the mods when they rake in profits. 25% to the modders when Valve just distributes the game? That's practically robbery. That's like taking 75% of a taxi driver's income because you built the car.\n\nEven more so that the Gestap... I mean Valve is now temp banning anyone who speaks out against this whole debacle on the forums.\n\nWhat's next? Paid patches?\n\nTo be honest, I wouldn't entirely mind paying for mods if a few simple changes were made:\n1) Fix quality control. Who wants to pay $99 for a pair of horse testicles?\n2) Donations only. This is a basic feature, Nexus has it, it's much nicer and less intrusive/cash grabby.\n3) Pay modders more. Pay modders more. Pay modders more. Do I need to say it again? Taking 75% of the cut is ridiculous, yeah, you need to keep the servers running, okay, that's fine. I'm sure you can do it with 15% or even 10% of the cut. 75%? Are you kidding me?\n\nValve, this is a chance to regain the trust of you former loyal fanbase/consumer base.

Now, I have not contributed to Skyrim mods, but I feel that I have enough experience on modding itself that I can at least have a justified opinion on the subject of Valve charging for mods.\nBasically, it is a terrible idea.\n\n"Why is that? Don't good modders deserve support?" some may ask. Absolutely. Black Mesa, for instance, is a good example of a mod that might deserve monetary compensation. Counter Strike started as a mod too. As a modder and a human, I like money. But this isn't the way to go about it.\n\nThis situation Valve started is terrible, because it has resulted in, or will result in, the following:\n\nFirst, Valve, you have now made "modder" a dirty word here on the steam forums almost overnight. Thanks a bunch. You have now divided PC consumers and modders, when we used to be a pretty tight bunch.\n\nSecond, I now see mods going up that are little tiny swords and whatnot going up for sale. Bundles already that cost more than the game itself. In other words, I am concerned about a complete influx of mods that are completely useless and tiny and unsupported and updated, just because of money-grabbers who want a piece of the pie.\n\nThird, this leads to microtransaction hell. Hell for consumers, and a deluge of stuff to compete against for us modders. This isn't healthy competition. It is gonna be cutthroat. Thanks again for taking the fun out of it.\n\nFourth, there will be inevitable stealing of other's people's content and then selling it as their own. Some may claim that because they modified another mod's content, they now have created their own mod and are free to sell. I disagree. They are making money at the expense of others.\n\nFifth, you have a "return policy," if it is even worth of the name, that is full of holes. First, 24hrs isn't much time to test if a mod will glitch out or not. Ever heard of a standard 14 or 30 day return policy? Let's say a consumer buys a mod, then one week later the modder releases an update. This update has a bug, and the game crashes or glitches out. Then let's say, for whatever reason (even a good one. Like real life got in the way) the modder doesn't release an update to fix the bug. Before today, big deal. You could either uninstall the mod or revert to a previous version. Given it was free, most people wouldn't complain too much. But NOW, a consumer will likely be stuck with a useless piece of software they paid good money for. Software that now is worth zilch. They will be, understandably, really upset, with no way to get their money back.\n\nLastly, you, Valve, are likely hurting good, legal sites like Nexus Mods as some greedy people take their mods, or the "premium versions" off the site in favor of posting to the Steam Workshop. These sites rely on advertising revenue to run, and you will very likely hurt this revenue. Why do that? You used to have a reputiation of siding with the underdog. It is not like you are in competition with people like Nexus. It is not like they are EA, taking a corner of the market. And it isn't even like you really need the money Valve. This just feels to me like a cash cow. A move EA would be proud of, sadly.\n\nAs a modder, I disapprove of this move Steam. This may have far reaching consequences, for everyone involved.\n\nAs for the rest of you, if you are still reading (thanks by the way) please support the effort against this initiative by Valve. Sign the petition here https://www.change.org/p/valve-remove-the-paid-content-of-the-steam-workshop\n\nMore importantly, speak with your wallets. The best way to change this policy is to not spend One. Single. Cent. on mods. No matter what.\n\nKeep mods free!\nAd Astra per Aspera\n\nPS there is a protest group you can join here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BoycottSteamWorkshop","April 24, 2015","false","96.4"," 122 of 218 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","122","218","4","2"

FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU CAN'T / DON'T WANT TO READ IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT, MODS MAKE THIS GAME WORTH PLAYING. PAID MODS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND]\n\nSo, I've been a fan of the elder scrolls since I was very little, starting with Oblivion, moving on to skyrim, and ironically falling in love with Morrowind and playing the modded version more than any other non-mmo I've ever played. I love the incredibly rich, metaphysical, surreal backstory, as well as the roleplaying / simulator aspects in Morrowind.\n\nI just uninstalled skyrim today after realizing it just wasn't worth it anymore to keep trying to make it work. It's a buggy mess, and when I try to pad the game with mods that make it less shallow and more fun I just have to deal with all the bugs and issues involved with the mods as well. It's just not worth it anymore.\nFor me, the novelty of skyrim wore off very quickly. As many people say, it's an ocean wide and a puddle deep. It leads you to believe there's more to it than there is.\n\nUnlike previous games, every character I made felt pretty much the same: an oafish, clumsy nord. This was in part due to design decisions, and also due to developer overlooks. The removal of athletics and acrobatics removed an entire playstyle that allowed your character to be agile, jumpy, and nimble, which killed bosmer / khajiit for me. The fact that I couldn't do a sprinting jump, and instead have to sprint, wait a full second (And bump into the object I'm trying to avoid) THEN jump, left me feeling like a clumsy stupid nord every playthrough. The fact that staves dissapear when you sheathe them, everyone is the same height in first person, and your off-hand weapon just randomly appears in your hand makes the game seem lazy and breaks my immersion.\n\nUnlike in morrowind, guilds are less about simulating a role / job for your character, and more about following a preset storyline. That would be fine if the storylines were actually GOOD. My god the narrative mess that is the College of Winterhold still haunts me to this day. And don't get me started on the Bard's College. The thing that really irks me about these questlines is that they all just devolve into random dungeon crawls. I counted: you only need to use magic thrice in the mages guild. Advancing through the guild has nothing to do with actually using magic or being skilled. You're just watching a poorly developed story unfold, not rising through the ranks of an esteemed guild of scholars.\n\nThere's no way to distinguish your character or give him a personality through dialogue or your race / class. This was a stark difference from fallout 3 and New Vegas, where your perks gave you extra dialogue options and could change entire questlines, and you could choose dialogue options that really gave your character an interesting personality. Skyrim game seems afraid to give you any consequences. Argonians aren't allowed in Windhelm? Except for you! Khajiit aren't typically trusted in the cities? Funny, no one even seems to realize I'm a khajiit in the first place. Not even a unique quest for argonian players to gain entrance into the city. You may say "This would've been too hard for the devs to implement" but it makes me wonder why they present these plot-points into the game if they're not willing to actually follow through with them. There's not even a single mention of your race throughout the entire game other than the occassional quip from a bandit. My altmer was walking by some dominion soldiers, and I was surprised they didn't even have any unique dialogue. They just treated me like I was a nord and shooed me off, not even scolding me for being a "traitor" to my kind. Entire quests could have been more unique by acknowledging the unique aspects of my player instead of pretending they don't exist.\nThe quests give you the illusion that you'll be able to influence the world or change things, then snatch away the opportunity at the last minute. The Civil War for example: no matter who you side with, no high king will ever be crowned, and no one in the world will ever acknowledge the war is over.\n\nIn the Markarth quest you can side with the forsworn but there are no consequences. The forsworn will still be hostile to you and nothing ever comes of your allegiance. You can come up with any excuse you want to explain these things, but the fact remains that Bethesda CHOSE not to take these choices further.\n\nSo what you're left with is a shallow dungeon crawler with a lackluster combat system, removal of many rp aspects, a weak narrative, and....well that's it. I know the other games had issues too, but I expect a developer's work to improve over time. Not to mention the massive amount of game-breaking bugs that exist. Am I the only one that thinks it's ridiculous that MODDERS ar ethe ones that have to make "unofficial" patches to fix the bugs in this game? Isn't that embarrassing? If this was any other game company that would be unacceptable. How much longer can bethesda get away with these oversights and bugs until fans get sick of it? I know we like to explain it away by saying "They made an ambitious open world game! It's hard to get rid of the bugs!" Well if you're going to be ambitious, don't you think your work and polish should reflect that? Ambition is worthless without execution.\n\nI guess the main thing that I personally didn't like about skyrim was that it never felt like a roleplaying game or at least not the type of rpg I like. Morrowind felt like a roleplaying simulator, where you were dorpped off in a world and left to your own devices, free to simulate any role you wanted to. In the mages guild you actually did research and find magic artifacts and learned about history, in the imperial legion you actually felt like a gallant knight who used his brawn and his wit to keep the people of vvardenfell under control. Morrowind had a LOT of issues, and is incredibly outdated, but for what it was I think that it did a better job of this than Skyrim. In Skyrim, I just feel like I'm on soft-rails in an open world, watching the pretty killcams and interacting with the world, but I never felt like a living person in a living world.\n\nTL;DR The only saving grace for Skyrim are the mods, but they often become too much of a hassle to make it worth it. With steam's new introduction of PAID MODS, Skyrim has officially crossed the line into "not worth it" territory. Unless you want to pay for a full game AND the dozens of mods you need to make it a great game, then just go back to Oblivion or Morrowind, or hell, download Morroblivion, the mod that combines oblivion amd Morrowind into one game. It's great.","April 25, 2015","false","406.5"," 129 of 231 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","129","231","6","6"

I would be putting a thumbs up here but Valve and Bethesda have done the unthinkable. They can now charge for mods. Mods are part of what makes PC gaming superior and now they are being treated as DLC or microtransactions, nobody likes these. This is damaging to the ethos of a PC gamer and is taking the platform in the direction of consoles or *shudder* mobile games. If Valve and Bethesda have any common sense they will stop this and focus on less damaging ways to make money, like releasing worthwhile games. (ie: Skyrim w/o paid mods).\n\nTo conclude, Skyrim is amazing with and without mods, the paid mods are horrible and damaging.

Valve's decision to introduced paid-for mods threatens to decimate this community. Now, first and foremost: Do modders deserve money for their hard work?\n\nIn many cases, yes, a thousand times yes.\n\nHowever, is this the right way of providing such a monitary incentive?\n\nNo, a million times no.\n\nAll this current system does is create a paywall that looks set to divide the community. Instead, Valve should have added a donate button. This way we could still reward those modders that we feel deserve a little something for their work, without creating this massive schism.\n\nI would urge anyone reading this to not support such a practice. Vote with your wallets and make this another 'Horse Armour' scandal. If there's a mod author whose work you really admire, instead of subscribing here, head over to the Nexus and contact the author about making a donation. And if the mod you like isn't on the Nexus any longer, find another mod.\n\nIf you're a mod maker, please think twice about making a Steam-only release. The Steam Workshop is not a good mod manager for Skyrim. Anyone serious about Skyrim modding will need to use tools such as NMM or Mod Organizer, alongside other programs such as LOOT if they have any desire to have a stable experience. The Workshop only makes this process more difficult.\n\nIt's as simple as that.\n\nThis is an awful, and ill-advised move by Valve.

There's a ton of content for sure, and that gives me a lot of stuff to do, but what fun is it if I find the combat so damn boring?

Recently, however, Bethesda and Valve have gotten greedy and now the mod scene for this game is crumbing in on itself.\n\nFor its current sale price it's a pretty good deal, and I would say everybody should probably play it at one point or another because it's generally considered a classic, but please don't buy any mods.  Buying mods tells these companies that we're okay with them making money off of every single aspect of gaming, even work they never did.

It's amazing to me how two of my favorite developers could move to the opposite end of that list in the course of a day. Enjoy the read and don't forget to write your own:\n\n"I'm sure you're getting a lot of these, so I'll keep it concise and non-abusive. I loved Steam. In fact, my account is sitting at about 655 games at the moment. I didn't just buy those games because I'm madly in love with gaming. No, I bought them on this site because I bought into a vision -- a vision of a community passionate about games and social interaction. And at the epicenter of that was a company that was one of the good guys, a company with an ethical code, respect for its customers, and a down-to-Earth leader. I loved that company, but I don't see that vision anymore.\n\nAll I see is a company that, while drowning in money, can't seem to have even mediocre customer support or basic quality assurance. But I always glossed over those flaws. I loved you and stayed loyal despite the increasingly poor customer experience. But paid modding is the straw that broke this camels back. Every single aspect of it wreaks of the kind of shady behavior we've seen elsewhere in the industry. I'm not opposed to modders making a buck, but there were so many other ways to do this: a donation button, reasonably low pricing, giving the author more than a mere pittance of 25%. or only allowing a small list of very high quality mods to be paid.\n\nBut what you've built now will only result in an influx of poor quality, broken, copyright-infringing mess of mods and the death and exploitation of a beautiful and vibrant community of creativity. And I won't support it. Until this is rolled back, I'm not buying another game off of Steam. If that means I have to go to sources like http://gog.com for my games, then so be it. But I won't accept what Valve has become. You need to learn to listen to your customers again."","April 24, 2015","false","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

There's a ton of content for sure, and that gives me a lot of stuff to do, but what fun is it if I find the combat so damn boring?  Few of the attacks seem to carry any real weight, and magic feels underpowered to me.\n\nMy favorite part of this game was the modding community, and how you could take a mediocre game like this and make it something different and beautiful.  Recently, however, Bethesda and Valve have gotten greedy and now the mod scene for this game is crumbing in on itself.\n\nFor its current sale price it's a pretty good deal, and I would say everybody should probably play it at one point or another because it's generally considered a classic, but please don't buy any mods.  Buying mods tells these companies that we're okay with them making money off of every single aspect of gaming, even work they never did.  They shouldn't be making a dime off of these mods, and in fact they should be paying these modders for driving more people to their game.","April 26, 2015","false","39.7"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","0"

This may not even be possible. For something like a dota item, you have a reasonable expectation that the item will work even years later. You don’t have this expectation for mods. EDIT: I stand corrected, the dota 2 arcanas have apparently been bugged for years. ♥♥♥♥ing seriously, that's sad.\n\n\nLack of guaranteed compatibility means any mod you buy might clash with any other mod, effectively wasting your money. I’ve encountered mods that take longer than 24 hours to figure out that they don’t work together, so the ‘refund’ in steam dollars doesn’t help. (Again) with a dota item, you have the reasonable expectation that the game will still work even with any combination of them.\n\nIncreased proliferation of ‘cashgrab’ mods has already been seen. The poster child for the paid mods scheme, the Shadow Scale Set, is a single piece of armour, and requires that you add it via CONSOLE. No quest, no recipe, it’s not even located in the world. It’s also only modelled for male characters, and stretches oddly on females. I could go on, as a lot of the items immediately released are little better.\n\nThere’s probably other problems I haven’t thought of, but even at first glance this seems like a terrible idea.\n\nEDIT 2: With the removal of paid mods, this review is no longer very relevant. But, let it stand as a mark of what valve tried to do, and a warning. Good game, but paid mods will likely ruin it.","April 27, 2015","false","278.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"
