The asymetrical co-op is phenomenal. Having two distinct agents which are separate, but inextricably codependant upon each other, is just brilliant. Each must rely on the other's unique skill set to proceed through the mission.\n\nImagine if Deus Ex had a love affair with Uplink.\n\nPlaying as the operative, you enter each mission with naught but a pistol and a fist full of tech gadgets. Like a newborn babe with a PPK, you crawl blindly through the missions, guided only by your senses and the information provided to you by your hacker co-op partner as you carry out objectives and respond on the fly to changes in the AO.\n\nPlaying as the hacker, you must intrude into a series of networks, spoof systems, control surviellance, decrypt information and feed intel to your operative. You watch the map, keep eyes on the guards patrols, prevent cameras from seeing your operative, find codes to allow them to open doors, sift through information to find the dirt that allows the operative to pressure people during interrogations, and send in the cleaners when your operative starts droping bodies.\n\nThe synergistic nature of the gameplay just blows my mind.\n\nI have had more fun and entertainment, more epic moments, more feelings of being a super spy than I have ever experienced playing any Sam Fisher, Jason Bourne, or Ethan Hunt games. The attention to detail is great, and the pacing is just right. The NPCs respond to how you approach missions, if you are loud and murder everyone, they notice and will make comments about it. If you are a super ninja, they praise you for your ninja skills. The point is, you have options, and only one mission so far has a fail state for botching stealth and going loud.\n\nSure, it has some blemishes. The animations are sometimes wonky, Katya crouch-walks like she has a pistol holster in her keister, and you can occasionally use the melee prompt to teleport enemies to you from around corners, through walls, and even through the ceiling. The voice acting feels forced at times, but after a while it gets better. The lip syncing animations are hilariously bad.\n\nHOWEVER, I can look past ALL of those minor things. Why? Because the gameplay is so damn good.\n\nBottom Line: If you enjoy stealth action games, espionage storylines, and you have a dedicated co-op partner, this game is AMAZING. To me, it has been a better, more engaging game than those twice or three times the price. I can't wait to play more of it. Sadly, my hacker had to sleep, and I am blind without him.

Yes, it looks like it came straight from the Playstation 2 era and this is not at all encouraging to modern gamers. It even has some occasional issues with the performance, bugs that are somewhat obvious, clunky movement and controls, and it definitely does not look like it brings much new to the stealth genre.\nBut then why the positive recommendation?\n\nBecause where the graphics and performance are questionable, the gameplay itself is solid, the writing is great with excellent attention to detail, and the co-op is a good way to spend time with a friend working things out together. and getting through the story. Which, by the way, changes based on what you do. If you kill everyone because dead men don't tell tales, then you will have a different experience after a few missions than if you went through as a ghost, unseen and unheard.\nWhile some things are easy to see coming from far away, the story as far as I've experienced it makes sense and is intriguing enough to keep you coming back for more. As for the co-op gameplay, it does exactly what many people wanted to do for their stealth games. As the spy, you will rely on your co-op partner to hack into the computer net, get you the information you need to play your undercover role out, block cameras from seeing you, and mess with anything electronic that needs messing with. As the hacker, you will be multitasking to hack into their system in one screen, check the cameras for guards approaching your partner from behind, and work with a map to make sure your partner doesn't get lost in the facilities you're infiltrating. Both roles are rewarding, and working together as a team makes for a unique experience that so far I've not been able to find anywhere else in a game.\n(I have not played single player, so I can not mention much on that)\n\nClandestine can be a real hit, something you will remember for years to come and will hope to see more of if you can see past the obvious flaws and outdated graphics. If you can, I can certainly recommend it.\nBut if you are big into graphics and are easily frustrated it may not be your kind of thing. Clandestine is a flawed gem.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/290530/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nClandestine, a two-player co-op game that's unique in the sense of how it plays where one of the players takes the role of a spy, that plays in the third person view, where you have to complete the objectives presented to you like stealing data, or killing a whole bunch of people..etc, without getting spotted or killed. The other player takes the role of a hacker that's behind the scenes, away from the action, providing intel for the spy player like spotting enemies and cameras, where you can disable and/or use for your advantage, and hacking a door systems to get the code to give to the spy for him/her to open the locked door, and more like sounding alarms for distractions..etc. Also it's worth to mention that you can play this solo, hoping from the hacker to the spy and vice versa. The game is a hard stealth game by the way, as in like one or two shots and you're dead.\n\nThe game also has, for the spy, two types of clothing/armor where one of them would be spy gear with more protection and whatnot, but you would be instantly suspected and spot if seen wearing it, while the other choice is wearing normal civilian cloth which decreases your spy abilities in some ways, but removes all suspension in certain levels when seen, unless you go to restricted areas, go on and kill some one..you know, the thing that one does to receive suspicion, and that's kind of a nice touch.\n\nTo me this is a great idea, combining two different gameplay types in a coop like mode, and haven't seen a game do this kind of thing before ( at least for me ) and it has my support and recommendation as a great game with great innovative potential, but it needs a lot of refinement / improvements in terms of how the game controls on both sides of the game ( the spy and the hacker ) with how the gameplay feeling really clunky seeing as how it's on Steam Early Access as version 0.1. And i hope they improve the tutorial as the hacker, also improving how you hack seeing as it's time consuming and annoying to hack something and then moving to hack something else, a click and drag system would be better, and if you're wondering what i mean by this is as a hack you have sort of a squid icon and you have to move it with you're arrow keys in certain lines, which becomes a pain really fast when using it.\n\nThe game is in development and i want to play more of it once it has been polished, and will get back to it on another new post in the future once the improvements are in place, and i want it to improve because i like the idea behind it and the fun coop gameplay that comes with it, and so if you want to support the idea, help developing it by getting it and providing feedback, wanting to see this game shine, then I'm with you, it also has a handful of levels to play with if you're wondering, but if you're thinking that it 'looks cool' and don't want to deal with how a game is in development with it's bugs and un-refinements, then i suggest you wait.\n\nShameless original link[www.ksalue.com] to post.","November 1, 2014","true","1.1"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","47","55","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/290530/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[Please note: this review covers only the single-player aspect of the game.]\n\nIntroductionClandestine is a third person (two player co-op) (action-)stealth game that personally reminded me a bit of Alpha Protocol. Both are heavily focused on stealth and hacking, but both also control kind of similar.\nLet it be known, however, that Clandestine is a game of its own and while there’s definitely room for technical improvements the game in this state is already fun to play. That’s right, even in single-player. It’s still best played with a friend or partner, though, since the game is focused on a co-op experience. In any case; let us talk about the single-player aspect of the game a bit more, which is was I played for myself.\n\nGameplayYou’re pretty much dropped right into the first level without too much of an explanation. You’re then taught the basic movements and how to hack electronic devices. If you play by yourself then this information might be a little overwhelming at first, especially if you’re being taught the hacker side of the game. Still, it’s nothing too complex and with a little practice you should do just fine.\n\nThe first level is, for a prologue, rather large, and after an introduction of about 10 minutes, you’re tasked with planting several bugs (optional) and getting to the basement, preferably without being seen/spotted. As a single-player experience you will have to do everything yourself and this in turn lowers the tension a bit, which is to be expected and I’m not going to blame the game for it. In co-op, however, each player will just see his or her part of the game: the hacker will see the four panels (camera, map, network and console) while the other person will have to physically get through the level by (quietly) moving around, collecting data and killing/knocking out/distracting enemies.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539246451\nThere are a total of 7 levels, excluding the prologue/tutorial level and each one can be played with a completely different playstyle. You don’t have to use stealth per se. The choice is yours: if you want go to through a level trying to remain undetected that’s fine. And if you want to go in guns blazing you can do this, too. And if that still doesn’t suit you then you can mix things up and use a combination of both, for example. You are completely free to choose how you want to approach each level.\n\nControls wise – and this is for the third person part - the game plays a bit similar to games like Alpha Protocol or the Gothic or Risen series. It doesn’t feel really fluent or even connected, but it doesn’t feel weird or slow either. I think people call it ‘janky’ these days. If you’ve played the game I just mentioned then you should understand what I mean.\n\nThe third person part of the game is really good and feels grounded: enemies don’t have superhuman sight or hearing and they react mostly realistically. It has an authentic, realistic feel, while also still feeling like an actual game. I appreciated that a lot personally.\nShould an enemy notice your attention then a meter fills up until you get either out of sight or kill him/knock him out. If the meter fills up entirely then all guards in the nearby area will be alerted. Same goes for being detected on security cameras, by the way.\nEnemies don’t have the ability to ‘one-shot’ you but they do inflict a lot of damage if you’re reckless. If you’re caught between several guards then it’s likely you will not even survive the fight so it’s important that you’re careful and just take your time. Overall, the game seems to have a good balance in difficulty.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539246341\nPlaying the hacker is a little more passive, but I think it can still be very rewarding if you can pull of the perfect mission. Although it may be more passive it’s in no way boring.\nAnyway, as a hacker you will have to keep an eye on things with the office and building cameras and tag potential enemies for your buddy to see. Tagged enemies can be seen through the walls so it’s a good way to prevent your team member from getting spotted. You will also have access to the map so you can give directions and whenever your buddy logs in to an electronic device you can then try to hack it. Sometimes you will also have to get access codes and these then have to be sent by chat (or remembered in case of single-player) which adds to the authenticity of it all. It’s a really cool and neat idea.\nBoth characters play completely different and that’s why it’s so great to have a game like this.\n\nWhile the game is pretty linear - as in: there’s really only one way to complete a level - there still are plenty of big areas and rooms where you can take a different route. But these routes nearly always end up at the same location so it’s more an illusion of freedom, really. But it’s still way better than making/keeping everything linear; I appreciate the effort that was put into making it feel like you have freedom, although ‘true’ freedom would obviously be better (but I understand there are constraints to game developing).\n\nAudio & VisualsThe audio is pretty good. Characters use their native language (Russians speak Russian, et cetera) and the voice acting is mostly solid. Sounds effects are also generally well done.\n\nGraphically it isn’t the most advanced game. Characters have just enough detail but the faces could definitely use some work. The textures range from okay to good. The environments on the other hand sometimes feel a bit empty. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but this is yet another game that’s all about the gameplay and not the graphics. Still, there’s some work to be done.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539246408\nLength/Replay ValueIf you each take your time each mission could take anywhere between 30-60 minutes to complete. And then you can switch characters. Or try go get a better score. Or try a different playstyle. I think that with a solid friend/partner you could put at least 15 hours or more into it.\n\nConclusionFor single-player it might not be completely worth the full asking price, but if you can find someone to play it with then it’s well worth your time, and money.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ A great mix of stealth (active) and hacking (more passive)\n+ Large, semi-linear, levels\n+ Feels realistic/authentic\n+ Cool, asymmetrical experience\n\nMixed:\n+/- Enemies aren’t terribly clever/observant\n+/- To get the best experience you really need to have a friend or partner.\n\nCons:\n- It still has a bit of a janky feel at the moment\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 7.7 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruger392/recommended/290530/","ruger392","Ruger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruger392/","117 products in account","Dear God. This is EXACTLY the game that I've been looking for for a long time. A friend and I recently started playing, and already it is evident just how fun this will be.\n\nClandestine is a stealh game where one person plays as the operative (Katya) and another person plays as the hacker (Martin). It pretty much takes the TV shows and movies like Person of Interest and turns them into an amazing game. Both the operative and the hacker depend on each other to complete the mission - Katya does the ground work like knocking out guards and grabbing written documents and pieces of intel but she can't move through the map without Martin's help in getting past things like lasers, code-locked doors and cameras. Martin sits in his van and connects to the security network that controls elements that surround Katya - he can control cameras, call pagers, hack computer systems, remotely retrieve door passcodes, shut down lasers and knock out guards with pulses of electricity from nearby power lines but he can't access any written documents or ledgers or closed networks and so he needs Katya.\n\nThat's enough regarding what this game is about. Moving on to my personal experience and why I recommend it so highly:\nThis game can get very intense very fast. VoIP of some sort is a fundamental necessity if you're playing with a friend (which I highly recommend doing). Every minute that the mission goes on Katya needs to be constantly checking her surroundings, looking ahead and behind, timing her movement so she isn't spotted, judging situations and communicating with Martin about any obstacles in the way while Martin needs to be checking cameras, marking guards, hacking e-mails and door codes, clearing Katya's path, avoiding the system administrator and alerting Katya to anything that might be trouble. One mistake by Martin could lead to Katya walking into a bad situation or being spotted by a camera whereas one mistake by Katya could incite a chain reaction that ends in her death. Both roles are intense and require concentration and reasoning. On the higher difficulties, guards can see Katya from across parking lots and the system admin moves fast, requiring the skills of both players to succeed.\nIt can make for some fun, interesting and memorable experiences - for example, my friend and I were playing recently and things got wild. A special ops team started moving in on our mission AO, forcing my friend to start making a quick exit and me to start checking all the cameras in the building to find out the locations of the enemy team members. My partner was waiting behind a corner to knock a guard out when one of the team members that I couldn't see burst into the room and saw him. He quickly turned around and shot the spec ops guy, but the guard down the hall saw what happened and moved forward, calling for backup. My partner took the guard down just as I alerted him to more spec ops coming up the stairwell. One of them walked in, my partner shot him, sprinted down the hall and ducked into cover just as bullets from the rifles of more enemies whizzed by. The enemy team split up, some going one way and the others going a different path. I tagged part of the team heading down to my partner's far right so he knew they were flanking him. He got hit but killed the guys that came through and not half a second later the other part was about to round the corner when my partner performed a takedown just in the nick of time.\nThat whole ordeal happened over the course of just a few seconds, believe it or not. It was probably one of the most nerve-racking experiences that I've ever had and it was insanely fun.\n\nThe only downsides to this game are that the singleplayer mode (to me) is not very doable. I've tried it a few times and on the difficulty settings I have, it took me an hour to get past the tutorial mission. Being just one role like I did with my friend required concentration and trying to switch between them both as needed simply wasn't efficient enough. I'd be switching cameras or hacking a door as Martin and Katya would get found by a patrol officer or I'd be running between cover as Katya and get spotted by a camera because I didn't have enough time to switch over. Although being spotted isn't a game-ending event, it makes the mission much more difficult because alarms summon reinforcements from outside the AO. The voice acting also could have been better and the graphics and animations are a bit sub-par but if you can see past those things the gameplay is truly great.\n\nTL;DR Great game, asymmetrical co-op is very well done. Voice acting and graphics aren't great but the gameplay more than makes up for it. 9.7/10 (My opinion).","December 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/290530/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","You play as Lilu Dallas or David Spade, and your handler, Martin Lawrence, has this weird glitch where his Halloween costume paste on goatee clips through his face whenever he talks. Things happen in the story, which I'm unfamiliar with because my partner kept skipping all cutscenes because of how incredibly immersive the voice acting was. He just didn't want to get drawn in too much, so he was forced to skip it. Really, the devs outdid themselves with the facial animations as well, because it really captured SAG-AFTRA members Microsoft Sam and Anna's facial features while talking. But yeah, stuff happens and eventually Lilu thinks it's a good idea to change her appearance when they go on the run, so she goes undercover as a chemo patient by shaving her hair(rather than dyeing it). Why? Because a bald woman with a (fake) Russian accent is far less conspicuous, than looking similar to the hundreds of thousands of women with brown or black hair in various cities around the world. Luckily David Spade retains his image, because no one is looking/seeking him anyway after the disaster known as Joe Dirt 2.\n\nEnough about the story, it's less important than you think. The graphics are indeed dated, but anyone born prior to the year 2000 remembers the times when good gameplay was what mattered. And good news! The stealth and shooting are, according to my friend, incredibly clunky and further hindered by poor performance due to lack of optimization at times. Animations are, thankfully, pretty janky and further pushed to the point of hilarity due to rag doll physics. Seeing Woody from Toy Story collapse when Andy walks in the room, everytime you shoot someone in the head never gets old.\n\nSo why recommend it? Because honestly playing as the hacker is a lot of fun with a friend who is present on VoIP. I would not recommend this game otherwise. Solo you're literally going to miss out on half the experience, and due to lack of quality of life features(such as being able to place markers down for the operative as the hacker) make coordinating outside of VoIP needlessly more complicated than it should be. So, if you or your friend is willing to take a back seat to actually being in the field, and being the video game incarnation of Tank from The Matrix(the operator on the Nebuchadnezzar), you'll likely have a lot of fun with this title! There's even a point where the operative/spy woman is getting overwhelmed by heavily armed forces, and I found myself thinking of the chase scene in The Matrix with me even telling my friend as he ran, "the door on your left. No, your other left!".\n\nHowever, game is short. Just shy of 4 hours in, my buddy wanted to call it for tonight. He said we only really have 2 or so missions left. Wait for a sale if you're interested, because I can't see much longevity out of this title unfortunately at a $25 USD price tag.\n\nEDIT: And we beat it in about 6 hours. Yikes. May be some replayability in there, if you swap up playing as Hacker/Spy, but still...Game's overall content and quality doesn't warrant a full price buy. It's still fun though!","November 5, 2015","true","6.5"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","76","44","58","28","3"

However, putting some faith into this game I took a risk and bought it straight-out. It was the right choice... kind of.\n\nThis is a third person stealth game with a female lead, which is rare nowadays given the genre. However, that isn't why this game has potential, it's the old school "PS2" feeling Clandestine holds that held me all the way through. If you didn't play many PS2 games, don't worry, you can get to experience a modern outlook of what stealth gameplay use to be like. The game is fun if but flawed but then again this is the first releasse of an alpha and there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nThere are nice touches here and there, but also problems here and there. The character model, certain animations, gameplay mechanics (like the hacking) I can tell have work put into them but this game needs more money and polish put into it for it to really exceed. The problems being janky controls to it, no, not the tank control your character has, but actions like calling an elevator, using the cover system, feels.... off, not fluid enough. There's also the lack of any graphical options, shadows, atmosphere, any decent music, hell, voice acting. The shooting is quite bland, the NPC models are generic and the UI could do with a less clean look, in my opinon.\n\nSo why am I recommending this game then? Because it has the promise, and potential, to be amazing. Also I want to see more games like this instead of the cluster♥♥♥♥ of cloned 2D games we're all seeing now, this game feels like a breath of fresh air and to its credit, it did keep me entertained. All this needs is more man hours put into it!\n\nOh yeah, this has co-op functionality, so there's that.\n\n---reviewed playing alpha 0.1, 1st November 2014---","November 1, 2014","true","0.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

The game has gotten several patches since this was initially posted, so I might be shining a slightly harsher light on it than it now deserves.\n\nWarning: Unmarked Potential Spoilers Ahead\n\nThe game is definitely rough around the edges, there's no denying that.  I discovered in Copenhagen that I can grab guards through walls (they'll just teleport to me), and I've had some other assorted bugs, but on the whole my friend and I had a good time playing the game.  Overall I think I'd give it a 7/10; the cutscene graphics definitely drag it down a bit, and the voice acting could be better, but the core concept and gameplay are well done.\n\nSome negative observations/thoughts:\n\nThere's kind of a disconnect in between what the spy is doing and what the hacker is doing.  It took me a while to figure out that little blue cross cursor is what the hacker is currently accessing, which helps.  Maybe the asymmetry of it took us some getting used to because my hacker friend seemed to be doing things more fluidly after a while.  The disconnect comment comes right from him.  Also, marking more than three enemies would be useful; three seems to be a tad too small.  EDIT: The hacker bug mentioned previously (hacker can't move in the HQ between missions) was acknowledged as a bug and quickly fixed.\n\nThe game could use some better explanations of how the various mechanics work.  The starting tutorial is good, but could use some more explanations of things like Footprint.  EDIT: The confusion with breaking locks has been cleared up in the forums and an improved tutorial bubble has been implemented /EDIT.  Copenhagen was an utter disaster in terms of getting spotted; at the end I had seven bodies.  My friend went to use Cleaner, but we didn't know exactly how it worked.  So on our way out, having failed to use it properly, the bodies were discovered, leaving witnesses and a giant footprint.  What's the difference between crouching and walking, if neither makes noise?  Maybe I missed it, but why would you use one over the other?  How does the hacker gets more/refill their abilities?  I know they unlock via Intel scores, but do they refresh every mission?  I think so because I haven't found a way to buy any.\n\nAs I said above, I encountered a bunch of bugs.  I didn't get any gamebreaking bugs, but I would say they definitely qualify as something bigger than minor.  For example, while in the crime scene in Copenhagen, I was able to grab one of the guards through the wall.  He just teleported into the room and I went through the knockout animation.  In Warsaw, after the conversation with Baxter, I chose to knock him out and my hacker partner didn't see the knockout; just him falling over.  Also in Warsaw, I had an ammo drop fail to give me any ammo for my PPK; it said that I had refilled my ammo, but when I went to use the PPK it said I had no ammo left!  I think there was an issue loading, though; I had just blown my cover a minute earlier (the ammo pickup worked fine then) and had to reload the checkpoint, after which I got the buggy ammo pickup.  Fortunately, I didn't need the PPK again that mission.  The game could also use a pass over the collision detection, as well.  I had a handful of clips through various objects/NPCs during the levels.  A Bug Reports subforum would probably be of use.\n\nCrashes: a few for both of us.  One of his crashes was related to mine, I believe, because I crashed and he followed suit a moment later.  I think my crashes were related to using NVidia's Dynamic Super Resolution, where it renders at at 3840x2160 and then downsamples to 1920x1080; I set the resolution just to 1920x1080 and I haven't had a problem since.  Of course, I verified the game cache, and it validated all the files.\n\nThe graphics could use a pick me up.  They're not terrible, and I'm perfectly fine with the mission graphics, but the cutscene graphics are pretty rough for a 2015 game.  Sarah especially looks like she's perpetually sucking lemons.  EDIT: Unfortunately, Josiah's fumanchu no longer does that hysterical clipping with his chin (aka it was fixed).\n\nPositive observations/thoughts:\n\nThe core idea is brilliant.  I compare it to a coop Alpha Protocol, a game which was panned by critics (and similarly buggy lol), but a game I personally still love and play through every now and again.  Where this game really started to shine was the London and Warsaw missions.  Not every mission is like Mexico or Copenhagen, where you have to always sneak around in the shadows.  It was really thrilling to be wandering around the London office and the Warsaw party blending in with the enemies and then branching off to quickly do a task.  I think it was wonderfully executed, and I hope the same pattern continues for the last few missions.  This is, I think, where the game really shines and excels.\n\nI think the spy's controls were well done.  There's nothing too crazy to do as the spy, but the movement and mantling especially felt much improved even just from version 0.9, which is when I picked it up.  It seems like you've got a good range on your cover takedowns, although I wish the enemies didn't teleport a foot or two over if they're too far.\n\nGunplay is decent.  You're not quite as in trouble if it comes to shooting as you would be in older Splinter Cell games (can't speak to Conviction+), and if you're quick on the draw you can shoot before your enemies draw, but the gunplay isn't anything out of the ordinary, either.  I feel like a tightening of the cursor over time would be of benefit instead of the quick shrink to the size that it is.  There's no zoom either, which is ok I guess since it's close range, but it would be "nice".\n\nOnce you get into a groove, it's possible to really synergize well with your coop partner.  The game would have benefitted from in game voice chat, however, having played both with the text chat and on TeamSpeak with a friend, there's just no substitute for the voice chat.\n\nOverall, like I said, I think I'd give it a 7.5/10.  It's rough and it needs a good coat of polish (EDIT: Which they seem to be sticking around to give), but there's a solid game under there.  I bought multiple copies during an Early Access sale (sorry to see the two pack go!) and I don't regret any of my purchases.  We both had fun tonight, and will definitely continue even after we beat it; it'll be my turn to be the hacker and we'll see if we can beat our previous performance.  I believe there's some element of randomization in the levels so hopefully it won't be just us memorizing patterns/locations.\n\nI don't want to make it seem like I used reams of paper for the negatives and just have a few tiny paragraphs for the positives, but I wanted to a) be specific about the negatives in the hopes that it can help improve the game, b) I'm a little tired, but more importantly c) I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words for the positives.  It's easy to point out the bugs and the things you believe need improvement, but aside from saying I think they have a wonderful idea here and really nailed some of these missions (Warsaw!) with how you weave in and out of clandestine actions (pardon the pun), it's hard to describe it.  I don't make YouTube videos but I hope someone can make some and show off more gameplay post-release to give people an idea of what I'm talking about.\n\nAnyway, I hope this will give prospective buyers a decent look into the state of the game immediately post release, maybe help assuage some fears, or pique some curiousities.  I mark it as Recommended, but caveat it with "if you're planning on playing coop".  Singleplayer, I think the roles are two complex to try to multitask them.","November 5, 2015","true","17.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

The only way to avoid the mistakes is to have a good friend in the van monitoring you and planning ahead of time. This is a stealth game where non-lethal playthrough is rewarding because the non-lethal options are numerous and cool, whereas the guns are pretty much all the same and do the same thing without much skill needed. No advanced objective requires a kill. You will succeed or fail based on your preparation, co-ordination and skill alone. Exploration is rewarded but not capital.\n\nSimilar to\nIt's a mix of Hitman's social blending stealth and lethality counter among missions with Splinter Cell's cover hiding. The "hacking" is more akin to Volume's top-down approach with movement and action execution timing down to some of the abilities, and gives access to a map similar to Hitman's.\n\nAlso Katya kicks ♥♥♥ and doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ you're judging her looks while she does.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy piece of opinion and experience\nClandestine perfectly captures the tension of spy team effort. Remember those spy movies and series where you get fast cuts between an agent in infiltration, struggling with a security "wall" and anxiously looking back at the incoming guards, while their technical counterpart nervously types in as many commands as possible on a computer to bypass the security? The tense exchange of words as the mission's success and usually the agent's life are at the mercy of the techie's ability? The exhilarating relief when, at the last second, the obstacle is overrun and the spy swiftly slips through and the guard passes by completely oblivious of the feat that was accomplished? This is what Clandestine is about.\n\nThe gameplay feels a bit like one of the player is a ghost, while the other is a zombie: Katya can do impressive stuff but more often than not will get killed easily when spotted; and since she's basically blind to the layout, security systems placement, guards routes and precise localisation of her objectives, there is a lot of room for fatal mistakes. On the other hand Martin is invulnerable and nearly all-seeing, he can be anywhere at a click and learn everything, but his digital fingers can't touch a dossier. You will need a friend to take that role you don't fill, and you'll both need to have voip and a good headset because things will get chatty.\n\nI play as Katya with a friend. And I'll trade her anyday for a Solid Snake or a Sam Fisher. Katya doesn't have all the  gadgets porn arsenal and that's exactly what drives the thrill of the infiltration, doing it all on your personnal skill as a player. I actually don't even pick a gun in my loadout so I'm not tempted to shoot people in the face. I just wander around using her cool non-lethal takedowns or plainly avoiding contact. Even the gadgets (I usually go for pager, banshee and modem) can be completely discarded. What matters is Martin.\n\nThrough Skype I can hear my friend frantically exploring the level and the computer network. He looks for the best route to the objective and takes care of the security devices while tagging guards, plans how to exfiltrate, gathers intel on the security measures, avoid the system admin and work towards secondary objectives. Usually all at the same time. His screen is split to offer a complete layout of the place showing everything linked to the network, a grid view of said network to access the hardware, a camera feed to keep an eye on Katya's point of view or cameras', and a log for objectives and retrieved passwords (if you use the text chat I can't predict a good future for you). But as he goes, there is a hard limit to what he can do. Some hardware can be on a different, unplugged network, or a location is so well guarded it's just simpler to go around and have a modem installed to get in from a different location. Objectives always require a physical presence to either get or steal paper dossiers or making contact with a human informant. No matter how technologically advanced / skilled Martin is, he can't physically alter stuff. What matters is Katya.\n\nAnd that's why this co-operative duo works so well.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMiscsKatya has a killer character design. She totally owns her punk style and doesn't take ♥♥♥♥ from people whether they want to take her down, comment on her outfit or chat her up (go check on the security guy at the office for more on that).\n\nThe voice acting is really cool. Granted it's not celebrities voices but honestly I'm very glad for the quality of the acting and of the writing. Some lines could be delivered a little faster for impatient players such as myself but considering the importance of the majority of the elements of the briefings that's not much of a problem. There's also a ton of optional dialogue to uncover, mainly in the offices, to reward exploring the universe.\n\nI also really dig the fact the Katya speaks fluently russian (and not russian yoghurt) when she can, guards from the first / tutorial mission speak spanish among themselves in Mexico etc. As in other medias (my favourite example is Inglorious Basterds), the language adds a very grounding element to the game and makes it more realistic while reminding you that you are indeed travelling a lot. It may come as a small detail (I remember Splinter Cell Chaos Theory having thai dialogues), but coming from a small indie team I love the extra effort it must have been.\n\nAnimations are maybe the weakest technical element. While Katya has killer hand to hand combat movements, more mundane animations like running and talking were clearly rushed. Can't really blame LA animator(s?) for getting their kicks animating action stuff, but it's also very hard to not be stupidly fixated on people's mouths doing bizarre movements when they talk.\n\nKatya has no way of knowing how injured she is unless Martin tells her. You can't tell whether she was shot zero or six times by looking at her or how she moves, only by asking your operator in his van to check her vitals. While a health bar for the agent would supress the delightful tension of a non-numeric health system, "subtle" graphical variation on her body or animation would be perfect in my opinion to convey her general state.\n\nFinally, I hope it comes as no surprise that the hacking gameplay is actually not hacking ;) It is however the best "make you feel like you're hacking" experience I've played in a game that doesn't focus on teaching people what hacking is like. For those who want a better hand at "realistically" fiddling with computer systems I'd rather recommend Hackent or else Heart.Break().","December 2, 2015","true","12.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Strangely, veterans from both the CIA and FSB are rapidly being found permanently terminated under rather curious circumstances. This prompts both agencies to create a new bureau in the attempt to find out who is behind this trail of eradicated veteran operatives!\n\nClandestine is a stealth/action/hacking type of game where you play a team of two, shall we say two newbies promoted to the arena of super spies. You will play Katya Kozlova and Martin Symborsky, Katya will be the field operative with a very light armoury (a PKK and her hand to hand combat ability) and will need to rely on stealth. Martin will be in the van hacking computer systems and taking control of camera surveillances to help her through each level.\n\nI really enjoy the way you can quickly change from a 3rd person view (Katya) to the hacking control system (Martin) by pressing one button. Essentially, the hacking system is divided in four on your screen: The first part is the console which will show you dialogue and objectives; the second one is the camera feeds where you can take control of a specific camera and study the area around it (enemy movements) or going through undetected; The third is the network view, the hacking system, this is where you send your Node to bypass firewalls, take over computers and even surcharge electric boxes to create an explosion. Time it when a foe is next to it and you will take him down. The fourth is the tactical view which will give you the layout of the level as well as show you where the cameras and computers are placed.\n\nOn the solo mode, you can choose from four levels of difficulty. They have put a bit of humour here where the easy level is Bond (007) and the extra hard level is Leon. Also, make sure you gather Intel’s as you will get additional points at the end of the mission for doing so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/290530/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","(Review copy supplied by third party contact)\n\nA clandestine world with a unique concept, the world needs more of these...\nClandestine should be held up as an example of "Games the world needs more of" in terms of original, creative ideas. It's a two player co-operative game that is highly asymetric, yet both parties are effectively co-dependent on each other to make the mission a success. When it goes right, and you have two players who know what they're doing, Clandestine is quite possibly one of the greatest spy thriller games around, even making allowances for the numerous faults. When it goes wrong, and it's mostly due to those faults, you'll be ripping your hair out and wishing that the developers, Logic Artists, had more of a budget.\n\nIn Single Player mode, where I spent the bulk of my time preparing the review, the game works just as well, allowing you to zip between the two viewpoints, as long as you plan your moves ahead of time, it becomes a game of cat and mouse, moving Katya into cover to allow Martin to work his magic in peace and quiet, before having Katya on the ground do her thing. If you're forced into panicked movements, then the illusion falls apart somewhat, because the game doesn't quite react so well to things happening at speed.\n\nIt's the late nineties, in oh so many ways...\nWithout spoilering the story too much, the game focusses on the cold war, and the remnants of it, along with a secret department which has been formed to work out where leaks are coming from within the intelligence community. The plot itself is very much late nineties spy story stuff and the kind of thing you'd readily find in a nice thick book with a bullet and a rose on the front, usually with the authors name in big letters on the top. It's not quite Tom Clancy levels of crazy, but it does get pretty serpentine.\n\nLess welcome is the late nineties level of voice acting and the late nineties level of animation quality. This is where the lack of budget begins to show, noticably. The game most definitely had lofty ambitions, and mechanically it does succeed to varying extents, but some of the animations are -painful- to watch, others are missing altogether, and as for the voice acting? I'll be kind and say "It's not quite World of Warcraft circa Cataclysm" but that's really not saying much for it. This brought me screaming back to the late nineties in all the wrong ways.\n\nThis also goes to some extent to the controls, which did have a nasty habit of glitching, there'd be occasions where they'd lock up or highlights would get lost in the mess of context sensitive information (such as picking up an item would be mixed in with mantling an object). Again, this all points to a game that quite simply didn't have -enough- money to fully achieve what it set out for itself. A very ambitious title, and when it comes together, if you squint your eyes, you can see the game it's trying to be, and that is a game that would set the standard for spy games to come, but it needed money, more of it.\n\nA very rough diamond then?\nClandestine stands out to me as a diamond that never got fully polished. That's how it should be viewed as, it's a game that should be held up as something we need more of. If there's -ever- a sequel for it, one with a bigger budget, it'll be an amazing follow up, because the gaming world needs more games like Clandestine, games that change how we play, and view games. If however this is a one off project, then this Tiger will be a bit saddened, because in Clandestine lies a lot of unrealised potential, but as ever, it would need an almost Ubisoft like budget to make the reality match the concept it was trying to achieve.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nIt's a bold game, and a game that could have been something truly original. It is a game that does stand out from the crowd in that awkward hipster way, which is a damn good thing, but if you get into it, know that it's not a hundred percent polished, and that it's probably never going to be entirely smooth. There's a lot to love about a game that tries something different, and I can almost, almost forgive the flaws, but that's as a reviewer. For a consumer, for someone who will be paying hard money, that's a much tougher choice.\n\nVerdict : Cautious Recommendation - If you're looking for something -different-, this might be it. But know that it does have it's share of rough edges. If you're unsure, wait for a price drop or sale.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

I'm positive not even in the 90's did people walk like that.","November 5, 2015","true","12.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","15","20","7","0"

Bugs, glitches, terrible stealth stickyness hamper a really clever idea for asymmetrical stealth.\n\nI don't normally mind games that are simplistic in their graphics, but this one is outright ugly. The game takes place in 1996 in more than one way.\n\nThe dialog and overall story is extremely cheesey, which would be fine if we didn't have levels where we just had to walk around and talk with NPCs to try to build some semblance of story. If the building section was removed entirely, the game would benefit. Combine that with the utterly over the top stereotypes that the PCs fit into, and it's a miserable story experience. It would be better to have a bunch of entirely unlinked missions with no background.\n\nHacking is fun, but could stand improvement. For one, there is absolutely no indication ANYWHERE that you need to press the magic button "v" to jack into remote systems. In addition, most nodes are useless and don't do anything. It'd be fantastic if I could actually disable cameras for a few minutes instead of just babysitting them and not being able to see anything of the agent.\n\nStealth suffers severely from bad sticky mechanics, and forcing doors is painful - there's no ui hint and it's easy to alert a lot of guards. It'd also be nice if stealth had some semblance of a map that the hacker could point things out on or draw on instead of "Go East... now go South.. Now go east again"\n\nGreat basic idea, bad execution. Would love to see this remade on a remotely modern engine. Might be a viable buy if it's < $5.","November 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","34","56","4","3"

Playing as a spy in co-op you depend if not totally, then heavily at least on the hacker.

The hacker's screen is OK (as much as I played hacker, it didn't strike me as insufficient), but the overall graphics in "real life" feels really old and unpolished (lower res textures, movement is kinda awkward and sometimes unpredictable, which in a stealth based game is a shame).

I’ve enjoyed my fair share and I think the mechanic is useful in plenty of different genres, but when someone tells me that’s the genre of game I don’t know if I have the patience for it. I’m a child of shooters. Born into short attention spans and explosions. I still like solving puzzles and playing all sorts of games, but I went into Logic Artists’ new co-op stealth game Clandestine I was shaking in my boots.

In fact, Clandestine is a good game. A friend of mine and I purchased Clandestine and played through, co-op and streaming online the blind run. I played the Spy, my friend the Hacker. Some things were goofy, especially the controls. For one thing, you don't smoothly leave cover when you try to walk away, you have to press the cover button again. Doorways can catch you for seemingly no reason. Giving directions (Left! No, right!) can be silly when the camera the Hacker is using faces the direction the Spy facing while you have the camera facing another direction. Some game mechanics are unintuitive (Reloading, for example: hold R, scroll mouse to another magazine, then release R). Animations are wonky, and the faces on a few characters are... well... I may see Sarah in my nightmares tonight.\n\nBut when we ended for the night, we both agreed that we had had fun. The netcode didn't hiccup, which is a great plus in a heavy co-op game. The stealth is a great blend of tense and forgiving, and getting caught doesn't signify the end of the world. This is one of the few stealth games where getting caught doesn't necessitate an immediate reload. Finding the right path is not a chore, but rather an interesting puzzle. There are consequences to your actions in the after-mission debriefings, and the story, while not seat-of-your-pants-exciting, is still better than quite a few games out there.\n\nOverall, the game has its flaws. The controls and animations could use polish. But the game does well at being an enjoyable game, blending together things in a way AAA game makers should note. If you have a friend, get this game and play through it with them. Especially if they like telling you where to go.

While it was clearly made on a small budget, and potentially limited game design experience ( I don't know these things, I'm just guessing ) it shines as a very unique, memorable experience when played with a buddy.\n\nStory feels rather forgettable, and the NPCs all look really strange - I kept making fun of this one guy who looked like a Sim from the Sims 2 - but there are some fun parts in what I've seen. The dialouge seems rather dynamic, and the NPCs will react to how your missions go down and some other small things - My friend wandered into the men's restroom in the hub area, for instance, and when he went to talk to the big boss guy he asked that they please refrained from doing so.\n\n...The spy is female, for those unaware.\n\nThe characters will either compliment or berate you based on your performance in the missions - How lethal you were, or how much of a trace you left. Some of them have different overall desires in how you handle things, but I don't think it affects anything aside from dialog.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that later missions may get harder if you leave more evidence. It was brought up during a mission briefing that the security on the level would be low, because the previous mission was so flawless they just assumed it was an inside job, and that there was no reason to step up security.\n\nThe gameplay, while unrefined in some ways, is very unique and engaging. Controlling the Spy feels clunky and awkward at times, but you can get the job done easily. The Hacker works like a charm, though, which is impressive considering how they manage and keep track of four different windows.\n\nIf you want more specifics, read other reviews - But I have to say that this is a big recommend - If you get a friend. The solo seems just a little too scatterbrained with switching between hacker and spy. And if you get a friend, you should probably keep in mind if they would like the Hacker or the Spy, and what you would rather play yourself. A scatterbrained hacker is not something you want or need.\n\nI recommend Clandestine to anyone who enjoys co-operative stealth games that require some planning, and a bit of experimentation.","February 22","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s a throwback to original Splinter Cell titles like Chaos Theory, with a heavy focus on cooperative play with very contrasting roles. The graphical style is not too dissimilar to Life is Strange, with some modern qualities and other slightly dated ones. It also features a footprint score at the end of each level, detailing how obvious your mission was to outside parties. Single player is entirely possible, but in order to capture the true depth and quality of the game, a second partner is needed for best results. As such we’ve had two people helping us out taking turns in each role. Can an indie title live up to the standards of Sam Fisher that it aspires to? Read on to see if the dint was big enough.\n\nStoryline\n\nYou play as Katya (or Martin in Co-op as the second player), the first operatives in a low-budget intelligence start-up. Josiah is the head of operations and sends you in to an area in Mexico to gain some intel on a hostage situation involving an agent. You’re the only qualified and capable wet work agent, and after some quick changes to the plan involving a rescue, you quickly become the agency’s main operative for espionage and neutralisation. Martin is your partner, a hacker who takes control of cameras and gives you on the spot information to help complete missions with as low a footprint as possible. There are some curious deals going down involving a rogue operation called Adrasteia, and it’s your job to find it, discover who’s in charge and shut it down.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay is a whole host of ups and down, particularly in multiplayer co-op. In singleplayer it’s very much a point and click sort of situation with a load of sneaking, but co-op makes the whole experience a whole lot more team based. The tutorial is certainly good enough, unless of course it breaks due to any resolutions above 1080p when it’s teaching you the hacker parts. I have no complaints with the tutorial, if anything it’s only ever irritating due to game-related problems. The tutorial is part of the first mission, and while it’s not hard, it’s not a total breeze either. It’s challenging enough in single player, but multiplayer makes the whole affair more complex, the reason being that the hacker is the only one with a map. This is where the first issue arises, and that’s because in the first mission walls don’t appear on the hacker’s map view in multiplayer.\nThe whole game is split across ten main missions, and between these you can take part in the four challenge side missions available. The missions are relatively long and typically split between two parts with multiple floors. Some maps have secondary and primary missions scattered amongst all of these, as well as dossiers and intel collectables. Once a primary goal is completed, you’ll be asked to reach an extraction point. Primary goals can be a range of things, including hacking onto a isolated network somewhere in the level, neutralising a target (kill or render them unable to report you (KILL!)), or simply just gaining information from someone or something. Your approach is your own; the game makes it very clear that you can achieve most of these objectives any way you see fit.\nDossiers unlock additional assets for your hacker to use, which may assist in the current mission in some way. Intel is stacked up and unlocks new outfits, weapons and gadgets for later missions. I only collected about 60-70% of all the intel in the game and managed to unlock almost every bar the final pistol unlock. Weapons range from super accurate to highly damaging and loud. You can even select certain types of ammo, some good against armour, some for quick damage, and others for non-lethal approaches. I opted for the highly accurate but low ammo MKII and aero-foil bullets, because it made for the perfect non-lethal low-footprint mission completion. The hacker can use assets to clean away bodies, reset alarms just before they go off, provide health and ammo drops mid-mission, and even bribe guards to ignore you. There’s plenty to collect, and plenty of gadgets and gubbins for you to muck around with in your loadout. You play how you like, and the game gives you the tools to do so. My only qualm is the lack of small automatic arms like an MP5 or UMP. It’d be nice to have the option to go more in force, and accept the larger footprint score. All this said, the unlock system is a little inelegant. I’d prefer to spend the intel I earn on weapons and gadgets I want, not have it automatically unlock weapons in a specific order. This I think would be a welcome change.\nLevels are extremely varied. Incredibly varied in fact, and even the hacker has a pleasant time learning new network layouts. Cameras are all over for alarm and hacker purposes, enemies are scattered around on bizarre patrols, and there are tonnes of doors and rooms to explore in every instance. There are even some levels where you go under cover and are allowed around certain areas but not others. Door codes are scattered amongst hacking nodes, notes in the world and various emails, and there are a number of hidden or alternate paths to take to reach the same goal. The core layout is there for an extremely personable experience, but unfortunately the AI is so full-frontal-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it often ruins the whole thing. There are doors which cannot be opened for confinement purposes, but they were quite low in number which is quite pleasant. A couple of areas in certain levels absolutely murdered my PC, but for the most part it was fine. I don’t think I recall any game breaking bugs in any of the levels though – bugs and glitches seem to be largely in the visual presentation and animation department.\nAs I said before AI is mostly terrible right now. Couple the peculiar movement paths for AI with the fact that aiming is a ball-ache from behind cover and it’s a recipe for agitation and unending anger. Silent melee takedowns can be down, but only from behind cover, and only if the AI isn’t in an alerted state. If they see you and you’re out of bullets, you’re screwed. There is no hand-to-hand combat in the event you alerted everyone, so it’s very much a run or gun situation. One thing I’m a huge fan of is the bullet management. You start the mission with a gun, and three or six clips depending on outfit. Your first clip that’s inside the gun will start with a missing bullet – because it’s chambered. You can also switch clips for alternative ammunition, and then remove the chambered bullet to switch out immediately for any given situation. It’s really quite cool. You have to manage your clips, because unlike most arcade titles, ammo doesn’t magically fill other clips. Bullet count is persistent in each clip. Plus there’s no auto-reload, so the gunplay is relatively good. Unfortunately it’s let down by aiming behind cover. Wherever your cursor aims behind cover is ignored when you actually lean out and aim-down-sight, because your entire character and aiming reticule shifts across a foot or so. It’s massively irritating, and doesn’t allow for much in the way of quick situational decisions.\n\nUnfortunately I can't fit my entire review on here.\nTo read the full review, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/clandestine-review/\nTo read the performance analysis, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/clandestine-performance-analysis/\n","November 20, 2015","true","9.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I say hardcore because it takes 3 shots to kill the Spy. Sometimes guards get headshots that insta-kill you. Anyway, this game is asymmetrical in the fact that there are two modes: the Spy (Agent, Spy, they're called different things) and the Hacker. The Spy plays a lot like stealth games you see in other places. There's cover (clunky at the moment), takedowns, all that stuff. However, the Spy herself doesn't know where any guards or cameras are, or even where her goal is.\n\nThis is where the Hacker comes in. This is the most interesting concept of this game in my opinion. The Hacker has access to all of the cameras and alarms and stuff, as well as a tactical map (minimap, but no color or depth, just wall outlines). The Hacker's job is to tell where the Spy to go, disable any cameras that might be an issue, and tag guards (when the Hacker tags guards, the Spy sees a number over that guard that can be seen through walls). However, the Hacker has opposition of his own: he has to avoid the "system admin" so that he doesn't get disconnected from the network. When he gets disconnected, everything the Hacker has done resets, so cameras turn back on, door passcodes change, etc.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing on co-op mode. One person plays as the Spy, the other as the Hacker. I can see how some people would think that being the Hacker could be boring, since you just manage things and keep an eye on a map for the entire level. But it's actually a lot of fun, and I prefer being the Hacker than the Spy. It's fun warning the Spy of a guard, or telling him where to go next, and it's also fun being fed that information. Of course, failing gloriously is always a possibility, and it's a ton of fun anyway. One mistake on one person's end could kill you.\n\nThe game is okay on solo mode as of now. You have to fill in for both roles, which can be tedious. You'll move forward into cover or some other place as the Spy, then go into Hacker mode and scout things out. Note that when you switch into Hacker mode, the Spy can still be seen and shot at, which can be really frustrating.\n\nVersion 0.7 is on it's way, which contains the first story mission and a better tutorial level, as well as some other additions and optimizations. So it might be good to wait a bit until that comes out. It'll have a nice polish om it by then.","December 30, 2014","true","16.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Grab a buddy and play as the spy, who sneaks around, shanks guards, rescues targets and retrieves intel. OR play as a hacker and hack into the environment, manipulating cameras, water mains, and transformers, all while avoiding the security systems, which kick you out of the system, give you the blue screen  of death and reset all your hard earned anarchy.\n\nAs the first game of its kind, Logic Artists could've done better, but they certainly couldn't do any worse. They could've easily made this game such that the hacker just sits there, occasionally opening a door while the spy sneaks around and knifes everyone in the room, or the spy hiding in a corner while the hacker bursts water mains and explodes transformers left and right. Luckily, the game is fairly balanced, and both parties involved have to have good communication skills to reach their objective. This is definitely the game to play with a close friend or significant other. Although they have public matchmaking and single player options, it's clear that this game was made for friends. While I wouldn't suggest getting it in early access (as there's a pretty good amount of polish that needs to go into this game before it's done), be sure to keep it on your radar, as it sets a precedent for both co-op and stealth fans alike.\n\n","October 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","4"

I probably spent 40 minutes or so just running around the agency building marvelling at it all.\n\nHad this game been set in a more modern era I would deride the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of it for being a terrible waste of money. In my honest opinion the AI and stealth is mediocre, the guns and gunplay are ♥♥♥♥, your gadgets are ♥♥♥♥, controls are ♥♥♥♥, the "social engineering" is shallow if you give it so much as a second glance and the graphics are atrocious. Unreal 3, anyone? Now 4? What about Unity 4 and now 5? These kind of graphics really aren't excusable for this kind of genre.\n\nAll that said though, whether by design or luck, it all ties into and feeds off each other to create something entirely 90's. Those clunky controls, bad guns and gadgets, the dumb AI, that fairly bad voice acting and occassionally buggy cutscenes. This ♥♥♥♥ is glorious, when I play I feel like I'm playing a game in the 90's (Realtalk: It plays how games back then worked when thinking back with nostalgia, not how terrible they are when you actually try). When there's a cutscene, I'm so interested in what's going on it practically feels like a movie from that era. The emails you hack and read? 90's. The stuff laying about that you can read? 90's. The speech, the clothes, the stereotypes all of it 90's.\n\nWhat really brings this game together in the end is the sheer amount of detail put into the levels, the dev's clearly put in a lot of care and attention to get everything just right and without that everything else would have fallen flat. Poking around and just looking at things takes up most of my gameplay.\n\nAs it is, I think 25 USD is a more than fair asking price.","November 8, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The hacking and stealth aspects remind me of Watch_Dogs in some ways, which I thought was a great game (On PS3, heard of bug issues on PC). However, it is very clunky. I can run most AAA games without lag, but even with the graphics down to a very low setting its still not smooth.\n\nThe controls can be a bit clunky as well and not always responsive. With the gamepad, when I try to change the camera view when walking it is crazy slow, so if you need to react to something good luck or move blind if you need to change directions quickly. Also got stuck a couple times unable to move.\n\nI also made it to a checkpoint when I was being attacked and it keeps restarting and I die instantly from enemies. Since we have no control over saves, I would think you would restart in a fairly safe manor. So it looks like I will have to restart the whole game due to that.\n\nThose are easy fixes though aside from the lag despite very modest graphics. I will probably change the review as I play more (hope that the developer sees this and considers some of these fairly basic changes that can make the gameplay much smoother), but its a bit rough around the edges so far that drains some of the fun. I really like the concept and want to support it tho. These are just my first impressions and issues.","March 15","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metriste/recommended/290530/","metriste","Jaint Siub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metriste/","501 products in account","This game has its flaws, and it's not going to appeal to everyone - or even most people, probably. It has a certain PS1-era charm to it that may resonate more with "older" folks that don't necessarily care if every single texture isn't 4K and animations are bemusingly clunky. When it comes to content, the actual experience, there's a lot here to love. The asymmetrical approach to coop works very well, as long as the hacker player doesn't need to be engaged in high-adrenaline activity every second - there are periods of time where the hacker will be doing little other than observing their partner, and that's ok. So far, I've been playing the field agent while my friend plays the hacker, and I tend to be slow and patient, preferring maximum stealth and to avoid contact whenever possible. This very much feels like the way the game is intended to be played; getting spotted is almost always a quick death.\n\nMy biggest and really only complaint is the seemingly inconsistent checkpoint system. There have been a handful of occasions where I've spent 30+ real-world minutes completing several objectives, only to be spotted by a guard, restart, and find myself having to redo all of it. But then, on my second or third attempt, a checkpoint will trigger where one never did before. It's little more than a mild frustration if you're patient, in which case it doesn't happen very often, but it is something that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe tutorial is also a little bit lacking, as there are certain features that aren't explained very well and need to be figured out by accident or through trial and error, but once you know what you're doing, everything actually works and works well.\n\nOverall, highly recommended. Certainly worth a purchase if it's on sale, and even at full price - $25 is more than fair for what you get.","June 3","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/recommended/290530/","celessia","⠀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/","745 products in account","On the outside this game looks like an unoptimised mediocre game with glitches, enemies who look like each other, unpolished piece of software one could easily pass on the market. And in solo game it absolutely is just that a 6/10 mediocre game about spy stuff (which i might add are rare and few, almost no one really makes games about spyies these days).\n\nHowever, the game really shows what it was made for in a 2 man co op this is when the game from a blank canvas with a few brushstrokes over becomes a masterpiece to remember and to set example for generations to come. Its sort of like that old spy trick with invisible inc or concealing something in the plain view - game is so much more then it is when there are 2 people playing it at the same time. The camera monitoring, escaping people on the ground and admins in cyberspace you are both are gonna be always under pressure with just brief moments of respite in between them.\n\nAI is not very good, and difficulty mostly just amps how fast they spot you, with no reaction to opening doors, blood on walls or dropped shell casings.\n\nMaps are few but done with a lot of effort (except tutorial which is absolute garbage). Speaking of tutorial, in game there is a 'footprint' mechanic which tracks down how much evidence you leave behind. Not only does it not explain in detail what counts towards it, whats the error margin, OR you cant check how much you accumulated during mission, i wasted 2.6 hours crawling around for my 'perfect' completion of a single level only to find out that somehow i tripped the security network via hacker interface which i didnt even touch for 99.9% time of that mission. Proposterous.\n\nFuthermore the footprint is supposed to give away how much your activity leaves things visible for all those who want to see on the macro level (the CIA , FSB, MI6 etc) even if we take in my total ♥♥♥♥ up count in an entire playthrough, which were: 1 broken lock, 1 tripped cyber alarm without me tripping it  (THATS IT) the game goes out and says: "Oh you know, you did great and all but we still found you : ) enjoy the base getting wrecked!" Which leads me to think that even if i did it with 0 footprint they would have still found me. Picture this: no visual of me ever caught, not a single gunshot, no one saw me, no camera footage, no KO'ed or killed people.... they still somehow by some miracle know you are there and coming.\n\nYes it matters for gameplay a bit, since if you are quiet there will be less security the less aware enemies are of your existance, but those few extra guards wont ammount to anything really, it is the macro scale that is supposed to matter.\n\nNext up: inventory ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Before you start mission you need to pick your inventory AFTER that is a briefing. During one of those i hear 'you'll need a gun' i didnt take firearms with me, and im not allowed to drop by the armory to pick one up. Which ultimately worked out great ( NPC just believed that i have a weapon which i didnt scene was hilarious). However for the last mission where i specifically didnt pick a weapon main character WHIPS IT OUT no problem out of thin air like a magician for the cutscene. I wish i could get pagers that way.\n\nAll in all game is good, there are very few people who own or even heard about the game making the co op part hard, but its really worth it. For the bold effort and innovative gameplay i give this game a total score of 8/10. It lacks polish, its not very good but it did things AAA projects wont in half a decade. And i know some things could have really made it easier like say pinging on the map to mark things, but this is 1996 there was no such technology back then, hell the bloody entire hacking thing is under a big questionmark as to could you really do all that crazy stuff back then from such distance?\n\nFinal Score: 8/10                   (Co-op: 10/10  Solo: 6/10)","January 30","true","19.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I tend to avoid early access as they are limited but having played this with a friend I can tell you that it is incredibly fun. The game itself has a huge amount of potential and honestly I can't wait till the storyline comes out and I can play that with my friends.\n\nHopefully the devs will read some of these reviews as well though as there are some obvious problems. The cover based stealth is a total ballache as it's frankly really glitchy. The transition in to and out of cover is clunky and it really needs to become a tonne more fluid before it will feel useful. It can feel like a total hinderance at times, as at points I could not leave cover quickly enough to stealth kill enemies.\n\nThe hacking side of things could also do with a little work. The fact you have to move the worm around to hack terminals makes the hacking process feel laborious rather than challenging. I would much prefer to click the node I was to hack. I could see there being so awesome mini games and even more depth to the hacking gameplay though which is great and I hope the full potential of this is reached. I would love to see the hacker become more reliant on the spy to add modems so that more of the network is accessible as frankly the spy seems to need the hacker more than them needing each other.\n\nI would also be interested to see 4 player co-op. Maybe that would be hard to implement given the style of the game so far but it could be interesting having two 2-man teams heading off against each other to gain intel or eliminate their rivals.\n\nI have let's played the currently available maps on my channel.

I was skeptical when we bought it in EA in March 2015, but it has been worth every penny.\nGraphics: Not as vivid as most new games, but I feel it makes the 1996 setting more realistic.\nDialog: Amusing. Clearly the lead actress is bilingual, which makes it more impressive.\nGameplay: Incredible. Getting to see it morph from it's orignal EA edition, it's amazing.

It's not without problems, but the concept and co-op dynamics made it a really fun and enjoyable experience. If you read about the premise of the game - asymmetrical co-op with one person as infiltrator and one as hacker support - and that sounds really intriguing to you, go for it. They pulled it off well enough for it to be a lot of fun for us. Could it have been better executed? Sure. But overall I found it really fun and satisfying.\n\nThe story from mission to mission seemed incoherent at times, as if they just took a string of random maps and tried to write a story around them (which may well be what happened, I dunno). The graphics aren't really up to speed with recent games, but personally I found the fun design and gameplay made it easy to overlook those things. Here and there I saw a few clipping issues or weird glitchy things, but not often, and not game-breaking. I can't say I'd recommend this game for solo play, but if you have a partner who'll get on vent and play with you, and the concept sounds up your alley, my advice is to give it a go.","December 22, 2015","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Stealth/Action Game Clandestine. Clandestine was released on Steam on November 5, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Logic Artists.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/p_9rtsaVDJc\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nToo pricey considering you really do NEED a Co-Op partner to fully enjoy it, IMHO.\n2/5 for Solo. More for Co-Op?\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nClandestine actually has a fantastic concept behind it, so let us start off with some of the positives of this game. You essentially have a Stealth game here, featuring some light "hacking" elements as well. Ideally, these roles are split between yourself and a Co-Op partner. One person taking on the Action/Stealth role while the other provides Support in the way of hacking various doors to relay their passwords, hacking cameras, plotting/mapping the course, spotting enemies for the other player, etc. All in all, this is really an awesome idea and great way to execute a game. That is where things kinda end for me, though. The graphics, unfortunately, are somewhat dated for an action game. The controls are frustrating at times (you cannot run while your handgun is equipped???). The voice acting is kinda painful at parts, as the female voice almost seems like text-to-voice software. It really hurts the immersion, to be honest. I tried several times to get into this game and just couldn't. To be perfectly fair, I think I would've had a lot of fun with a Co-Op partner, but as a single-player game it is very lacking and you can tell it's not the same at all. Unfortunately, the price point ($24.99) makes it incredibly hard to find a friend willing to buy in. There is no discount for a two-pack, which would probably help expand the user-base some. I am really on the fence. The only reason I could find to recommend it is because I can FEEL the awesome potential for a great Co-Op game here, I have just been unable to get a partner and that is largely due to some of the concerns about the game. Hopefully, I can give an update in the future as to how a Co-Op session feels. As is, I would say look to something like Thief for your stealth needs. However, don't ignore it. It has potential. Unfortunately, a Solo Campaign isn't good enough at all. 2/5 and $25 is just too much and a big part of that score.\n\nHappy Gaming!","January 12","false","1.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

There haven't really been updates for way too long. And the updates they brought before were not really big. The game is nowhere near "playable" currently.\n\nThe game feels really slow. Everything you do takes ages (running, aiming, hacking).\n\nBtw: On my current machine (i7 4x4.0GHz, Geforce 980GTX 4g, 8GB DDR3 RAM) i get a mere 51 FPS on middle Quality. I can play "crysis" 2 on 3 Monitors on a resolution of 5700x1080 with around 100FPS on highest Quality. But i cannot play this game at 60FPS without reducing the quality to "fastest"?\n\nAlso, the slower the FPS, the slower the game. Usually, walking from Point A to B in a game always takes the same time, whether you're getting 144FPS or 20FPS. But in this game, slower FPS slows the character movement and the aiming down.\nTo get this, you have to code something really wrong.\n\nLast bot not least, i don't like games that try to be overly realistic on one side, but are nowhere near realistic on other sides.\nFor example, pressing the key to "sprint" doesnt make the char sprint instantly like in most games. She has to prepare for 2 seconds before she actually "sprints", though she is not much faster than "sneaking".\nOn the other hand, a spy like her needs like 5 Seconds to aim? And then she is still quite inaccurate. She sometimes misses even if the crosshair covers the whole face of the target ....\n\nGood think i didn't buy the game. Got it from a friend who wanted to play this together. I feel bad for him.\nThis is actually not "early access", but more like "early scamness".\n\nIF i get a popup in the future saying "Clandestine has been updated", i'll gladly change this review. But currently just don't buy this ... "game"?","May 22, 2015","false","1.8"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","11","26","2","0"

Clandestine is fun to play singleplayer, having to switch between field op and hacker, however it is even more fun, yet easier, playing Clandestine in co-op mode. The co-op mode is where one person plays as the field op and the other as the hacker, working together, and making it much easier to play. Co-op really lets players get into the experience of being the hacker helping the field op or being the field op and using different tactics to take out or sneak past enemy guards. In all Clandestine is a great game for stealthfully navigating enemy locations as a sneaky field op with a hacker at the ready.","January 15","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will even affect later levels.\n\nMy final verdict is that this is definitely a game that is worth the amount you pay for. HOWEVER, it has its flaws. The control scheme for the spy is a little awkward. The way guns aim pushes you away from runing and gunning as an option. There are no neat high tech gadgets or gimics in this game. You have a mediocre pistol, a few diatractions, and a vareity of grenades. You hack networks by plugging modems into them. I like to think that all these glitches and bad mechanics is because they  are trying to emulate a game from the 90s.  The hacker will not have anything to do between missions, as you can't interact with the side missions like the spy.","May 22","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
