It is cute but at the same time disturbing and cruel, dealing with serious and complex topics like mental illness, psychological and physical abuse an murder. Additionally, this is full of pretty weird and morbid creatures that reminds me of Tim Burton's work.\n\nIt is clearly visible that this game was made with a lot of care and love. As far as I understood, Killmonday barely consists of two members who created this little gem all by themselves. This leaves me even more impressed and you can clearly tell the difference by the personal effort they put in it in comparision to big game developers who create games in mass production.\n\nSo if you like point and click adventures that are not AAA-title-polished but have their very own beautiful style and if you have strong nerves to deal with the twisted themes in this game, I can only recommend you to buy this game and help Killmonday sell this game well so we can look forward to many new interesting games from them in the future!","August 27, 2015","true","12.8"," 191 of 204 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","191","204","6","3"

This game is the most amazing game I have ever had the chance to play. I am not a person who usually plays games like this, I donated to the greenlight project of this game becuase I thought the usage of different things were very intresting. But I went into this game having average expectations, I expected getting a game that was maybe 2-3 hours long, with an average story and average gameplay, but god was I wrong.\nFran Bow is absolutely amazing and really boogles with your mind, hard puzzles,weird questions and answers that makes you question your own ideas of how things are, disturbing pictures that makes you wonder how you would have reacted if you were in Fran's spot.\nI know many people with mental illnesses and after this game I have so much more respect for them, I already knew they had it hard, but thinking that this is what some people have in their head (probably in a milder form tho) really makes me amazed.\nI love this game, I love the story, I love the characters (All of them, they are so creative), I really love Fran and Mr.Midnight, I love the puzzles, the music, the animations. I just love everything with this game, except for one thing.\nThat it had an end.\nI really hope there'll be more Fran Bow in the future, but that's probably having high expectations.\nI rate this game 10/10 if it was possible to give it more I would most definitely do so.","November 1, 2015","true","14.9"," 92 of 93 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","92","93","0","1"

What starts as surreal and terrifying only escaltes. It took me aback several times with how creative and strange it could be. Beautiful music, art, and writing all come together to make a game unlike any I've played before. It's not for the faint of heart, with geninely upsetting themes like suicide, abortion, medical abuse, sexual abuse etc, so be wary of that.\nThe puzzles stumped me several times but, never to the point where I gave up. There's always just enough information (except for one or two parts) to keep you going, to keep searching.\nA cross between charming and bizzare, between horror and fantasy, this is a lovely game.\n\nIt reminds me of The Cat Lady for many reasons; dark story, creative themes, point and click etc.\n\nThe ending left me feeling a bit...lacking? I think I understand everything that happened and it is nice to have a 'happy' ending and know that Fran will be okay, but I guess as the player I would like to see her being alright.","August 28, 2015","true","15.5"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/362680/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Fran Bow is the story of the game's titular little girl who, at the start of the game, experiences the death of her parents and is stuffed away into a mental institution. Fran is determined to get out of the loony bin and meet up with her cat, Mr. Midnight, who she is convinced will help guide her and form a new life with her beloved Aunt Grace. However, some form of shadowy demon warns her to stay in the mad house, for if she leaves he will hunt her down, and do worse things than she could ever imagine. The game's got clever writing, interesting characters (with Fran Bow's childish yet twisted thought-process and approach to things stealing the show), mixed with interesting imagery, thoughtful but not entirely too difficult puzzles, a gripping story with themes of psychological horror, satanism, and cult behaviors, the twistedness of children, and real horror ranging from pedophilia to the history of mental care.\n\nFairly early in the game you get a jar of pills, which lets you switch at anytime between the 'real' world, and a twisted gorey world full of shadow monsters. Sometimes switching between these worlds provides interesting symbolism and visual imagery, but at other moments it can be crucial to progress. As the game goes on, it becomes questionable if this other world is truly just a hallucination, as things done in one world seem to effect the other.\n\nDepending on how much you take to exploring and getting through puzzles, I'd estimate the game at around 7-12 hours long. They switch up locales and some gameplay stuff enough to keep things interesting, between the 5 chapters you visit 7 different 'main' locales, and four of those locations have two different versions of the location to travel between (and the fifth one has four different versions of itself). In-between main locations, there are often some optional mini-games, which you can skip if you wish but I found most to be a joy. Minor spoiler, but my personal favorite of the mini-games being a nicely timed Frogger reference,\n\nMusic is worth mentioning, it is very stylistic with some tracks sticking out, with some melodic tones and synth sounds mixed in. There's no voice acting, but the ambiance sounds are good and captivating. Presentation also gets high marks for some nice animation, visual flair, detail, and some stylization in certain scenes (like the storybook maze scene).\n\nHigh recommendation if you want a twisted point'n'click. The game isn't scare-your-pants-off terrifying, but there were a few scenes that made me jump, a few kind of chilling and disturbing moments, a sort of grotesque fairy tale feel that resonates most of the game. While reflecting I think I might like the first half of the game more than the second half, it's a fairly paced title worth playing through to the end, and can be an absolutely engrossing experience. Lead by interesting characters is a bit less interesting but still engaging story, excellent writing, great presentation style and audio, and capturing the perfect tone of a twisted little girl's mind in a just as, if not more, twisted horrific world. Fran Bow will most certainly become one of the greats in horror point'n'clicks, it's not perfect and without saying too much, while not an abrupt ending it kind of feels like a sequel hook and a bit anti-climatic, and I feel the middle sections of the game was a bit too long and disjointed from the rest of the title that there was a bit of a slump after the segment to get back into the game's main narrative and atmosphere... But it is entirely worth playing and is a macabre little girl's journey that's twist, turns, and cross-world traveling is more than worth experiencing.","August 27, 2015","true","14.7"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","0"

I also contributed as a backer to the Indiegogo campaign which funded some of the development of this game.)\n\nI absolutely adore this game.  If you like point and click adventure games,  please give this one a whirl.  And if you've never tried a point and click adventure game, I think this one will make you love them forever.\n\nThe art is gorgeous, the animations are beautiful to look at, the sound effects are plentiful and well designed, and the ever changing music adds so much to the ambiance of the game.  But above all, the story of the game is so detailed and rich and keeps you interested to see what happens next.  If you're like me, when you finish the game, you'll definitely wish the story wasn't over.\n\nMany people complain about puzzles in adventure games being illogical and that it's difficult to figure out what the game developer had in mind for a solution.  Well, the puzzles in Fran Bow are very logical, the items needed to solve the puzzle are always within a screen or two of where they are used to solve the puzzle, and solving the puzzles always gives the player a good sense of satisfaction when they are completed.  Solving puzzles without the need for a walkthrough is one indication that a game is well designed, and, in my opinion, this game meets that test--I think the puzzles can be solved by an observant player without a walkthrough.\n\nThis game has two major game mechanics which are truly original and inspired designs of the developers.  Both make the game a joy to play and allow the player to see even more of the delicious art design of the single artist who designed and single-handedly drew all the art and animations in the game.  There are so many little details built into the game, involving art, animation, and programming--the footprints made in the snow, which are made as the characters walks over freshly fallen snow, which then fill in as the snow continues to fall, with the sound of crunching snow as the character walks, for example--that absolutely show the level of detail and love the two indie developers of Fran Bow put into the game, all to make the story feel so very real for the player.\n\nI believe that if you play this game, you will not be disappointed.  You will fall in love with the characters in the story, you'll root for the success of the main character, cheer for her, feel both happy at times, and sad at times for her, and boo and hiss at those characters who appear to be against her.  I both laughed and cried while playing this game, and I believe that you will too when you play.\n\nIt's clear to me that this is a very special game that makes you think about the things said in the game.  The two-person development team poured much love, time, and hard work into the game.  You will likely want to play the game more than once in order to absorb all the story told in it--it is that intracate.  The result is a wonderful story that you will remember for a long time, and Fran Bow just may become your favorite adventure game, like it is for me.  I highly recommend it.","September 22, 2015","true","71.9"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","31","31","0","2"

It was a beautiful game from the beginning, and it was wonderful to see it flower into something even more special. Because the devs are crazy, and aim for excellence through love.\n\nIt's creepy, sometimes scary, other times heartbreaking. The story is great, the art is beautiful, and the puzzles flow with the story in a way I rarely see in adventures nowadays: they make sense, they don't break the third wall, they are consistent with the narration and the gameplay.\n\nOverall, highly recommended (very very highly, so highly that if you travel there one day you won't be able to breath).\n\nNow I'm gonna do what I have to do, waiting for the night and the time where I will finally restart the whole adventure and complete it.

They are neither too hard to figure out, nor to easy, which i often had problems with in games of the same genre. Never did i really feel stuck, nor did any of the answers seem overly specific or random.\n\n\nFor anyone that likes Point&Click and Creepy Games, this is certainly a game you should give a try.\nI for one really loved Fran's Adventure and i wish the developers all well!

Puzzles are fair and logical.  The story is interesting, struggling to decide if it's trying to feel like a horror game or "Alice in Wonderland."  This gives it a unique style that's done well, paired with a soundtrack that compliments it nicely.  It's also FAR longer than I expected, which was interesting.\n\nSadly, the ending does the game no favors.  For the first 80% or so of the game, you appear to be making real progress figuring out what's going on, struggling to see through a well-executed veil of "Am I a relaible narrator?"  The last 20%, however, simply answers that question with a trite: "LOL no.  You're never gonna know what was happening here.  Just make something up."

A love of gamemaking, puzzles and beautiful concept art is everywhere in the landscape of Fran Bow. No screenshots are allowed in this game because so many of the visuals hold clues to the story and are unforgettable scenes you will never find in any other game.\n\nThis game defies genre, it starts off as doll-core horror in a mental asylum for children and then becomes fantastical, magical, mythology- inspired; reminiscent of some of the old Sierra adventure games like King's Quest 6, except the mythology is completely invented by Fran Bow.\n\nThe game deals with the stigma of mental illness in children and attempts to give the player the experience of a child's curious mind marred by delusions and trauma. The game itself is therapuetic for the imagination to play and it is easy to become immersed in the mythology of Fran's mind.\n\nThis game will give you nightmares; but if you perservere through the story, it will reward you in spades. It speaks true to Winston Churchill's famous quote: "If you are going through hell; keep going."\n\nThe only criticism I have is Fran's purse inventory made it a bit awkward to access items and try them at times - maybe a bar at the top to access items or a drag feature for combining items would have made it easier. But otherwise, I wish there were more games like this.\nGood job Kill Monday and kudos to the artist here for beautiful storyboarding and concept art.\n10/10 would play again.","May 5","true","12.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

Sure, Daedalic pulled out quite a few good ones, but not as invigorating and enticing as this one.\n\nThe description of this game is as far as spoilers should go when you're interested in this game. If you're not convinced, go play the demo.\n\nThe atmosphere, asthetic, music and characteristics of this game are absolutely gorgeous. Yes, there's some cheesy dialogue that made me roll my eyes, but when taking it from the perspective that this game is going for, it's certainly well in place. The protagonist isn't a 'know it all badass' or 'hopelessly confused person' like in most games. Instead, it's just an innocent girl that kind of stays innocent throughout the game.\nThere are many, many 'oh my, what the hell' moments throughout the game, excluding the very disturbing images after taking the pills. Even without those, it's still gritty and disturbing.\n\nThe journey is filled with (unpleasant) surprises, which hadn't taken an impact on me since playing Darkseed or Tormented. Some of the story is vague, but there are many clues to figure it out.\n\nThe downside is that 'some' of the puzzles are just plain annoying or don't make sense at all. For me, personally, there was a math 'puzzle' that didn't make sense. Or I had to interact an item in my inventory with a character, which could have easilly solved by just interacting with that character, like the rest of the game functioned before this particular 'puzzle'.\nThe UI is a bit clunky as well and doesn't respond as something like monkey island or the rather clunky Machinarium, which is strange, considering that the latter is a flash game. The UI in this game just doesn't respond at times.\n\nDespite these slight flaws, I want to thank the developers for this amazing game and hope that they can make more of these masterpieces.\n\nBottom line: If you're a point 'n click adventurer...

I remember just over 2 years ago, watching lets players on youtube and i saw this game very first demo, I didnt even bother watching because i wanted to experience it for myself. So I did, i found the website and downloaded the demo and it was amazing.\n\nI was so happy when they finally gave a release date and i kept so up to date with the game.\nI literally sat at work, in front of my laptop waiting on the 27 of August, and 1 minute after the game was released I had it.\n\nIt was not a dissapointment. It has all great psychological elements.\nThe visuals are so disturbing and yet so wonderfully done, really give off the creep factor.\nSome of the puzzles are easy, some are difficult... Playing the game without walkthroughs was a real challenges, i mustve gotten suck about 5 times, when i suck stuck i mean.... hours even days. Simple point click gameplay, very easy to move around and use.\n\nIn the story you follow little Fran Bow, a girl who experiences the horrific death of her own parents. You follow her through her plans to escape the Asylum you were thrown in after your parents death. Working through puzzles and hidden secrets to uncover the stange death of her parents. Oh.... and you rescue a kitty cat <3\n\nAll in all a beautiful game, worthy of the genre titles.\nUndoubtedly worth the few dollars it costs.","September 4, 2015","true","20.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","1"

Very few games have achieved making me feel this way about them. The gameplay is very gory, but contains a concept that was completely new to me and facinating in the way it is executed. Playing as a 11 year old girl struggling within her own mind. Being told everything through direct thoughts made it much more immersive. I never really knew who to trust. Every object had several sentences of dialogue. I triple clicked on every object, read everything there was to read to see all of her reactions. I'm also planning on re-playing this again to catch what I might have missed which I rarely do. That's how magnificent of a game this is. Playing as Fran really made me enjoy every minute of it too. What I didn't expect is you will play as other characters as you go along when Fran isn't available. Her opinion on simple objects made this game so much more interesting for me. There is plenty of symbolism that tell side stories of the children you're first introduced to. I am so happy Killmonday took the time to include them within the story. It really gave a great deal of emotion and helped influence the mood. The mystery is what really kept me playing. Answers are weaved within the story instead of only at the end. New mysterys are made when old ones are answered. Small hints are everywhere but usually vague, you'll understand them eventually. I really enjoyed making those connections. The puzzles can be difficult but to me makes them much more satisfying to solve. Some unexpected mini games appeared which made playing very entertaining. If you're into mysterious and gory point and click adventures you seriously NEED to get this game, it is outstanding!","August 28, 2015","true","11.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/362680/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThought provoking!\n\nThe subject of psychology has always been interesting to me. Mental disorder, insanity, truth, reality and consciousness are all things this game reflects on.\n\nYou play as a little girl that goes through a significant trauma having lost her parents and ends up being treated in a slightly dodgy mental institution. You go through any means possible to escape the asylum, be reunited with your best (and only) friend, your beloved cat, Mr. Midnight and get back home. The journey is full of turns and oddities that will further add to the question of Fran’s mental state.\n\nThe story is intriguing to follow and always begs the question of what is going on. Even when you find answers, there was always (at least for me) an underlining curiosity over what was real and which side was true.\n\nInsanity tends to bring distrust, whether the person is sane or not, given the label of “Insane” by someone “Sane” will always lead to uncertainty about the person. You fight with Fran to keep her certainty and sanity against the people who are trying to keep her locked up.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. The art style and use of colour is great at getting across the right emotions. Oppressive scenes are dark and cold, safe and comfortable scenes are bright and open. The music also adds drama to the game in the right places and helps to set in those emotions.\n\nThere is no voice acting, although with this game I thought that it kind of fit in that way.\n\nThere is a fun mechanic which lets you switch the scene between the every day reality, to the reality Fran sees when she takes her medication. It opens up new possibilities for point and click puzzle solving and makes the game that tad bit more interesting and eerie. Effectively showing two sides to every situation.\n\nThe transitioning between chapters is a good way to break up a fairly lengthy game and essentially “skip” the unnecessary bits to play (for example, the travel to where the next chapter is set).\n\nI found that the game flowed well, especially for a point and click. I usually get stuck fairly quickly in these genre of games but there was only a few times I got stuck and even then I think that was because I played until it was late and I was tired. Returning to the game after a break with a fresh mind usually solved the problem pretty quickly.\n\nIn terms of 100%ing this game it’s fairly easy. You aren’t likely to get everything on your first play through, but it’s easy enough to do a quick run through again to get any you missed. I played through the game twice in the hours I have put into it if that is any help.\n\nAll in all this is a great game, I liked it! I would say it’s a must try for people that like the point and click genre or generally have any interest in mental disorder, psychology or even just thinking about things a little more philosophically.\n\n\nTL;DR : Intriguing story, nice art style and use of colour and contrast, gentle music that adds to the drama of the game, a well-fitting use of no voice acting, a good flow to it and generally just an all round great game. Give it a try.","May 18","true","11.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","4"

You're better off without the hint then with the hint. I guess if I'd spent long enough I could have figured it out by accident, but you're better off checking the forums if you can't get through the last part of the first chapter. In the Demo there was no hint at all IIRC (or I missed it), but that was better then this.\n\nAnd the UI is a bit odd (but it's a point and click so no biggy..) and you can't see when it autosaves, so you never know how much progress you'll loose by quitting. Also I would like to be able to read what was said a little while ago. Often you can't travel back and often you can't decide when to read the next line. Only if you're having a conversation you can decide text speed, but if it's more of a cutscene-like event (which is still interactive) it just keeps scrolling and if you don't pay attention because you think you have all the time *poof* it's gone.\n\nOther then that it's pretty fun. Very dark. Story-wise it doesn't seem very strong so far (1 chapter in).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiddolBunny/recommended/362680/","WiddolBunny","Leesie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiddolBunny/","9 products in account","I just completed this game today. I was originally interested in purchasing this game myself after seeing one of my favourite Youtubers play through the demo. In the video they said the full game release date which happened to be the day before I watched the video, so I decided then that instead of simply watching the let's play, I'd actually play the game through myself - and boy am I glad I did! I love games which have a little 'something' that makes them different, and this game had just that. I really like Fran as a character and I think it's very easy to want to be on her side. Speaking of characters, there are tons of really creative personalities in this game who really keep you interested, change things up and keep you on your toes.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it was a real pleasurable journey to go on overall (even with all the gore and disturbances!) and I only had one issue with it which was being unable to ''continue'' if you happened to save the game right where the demo left off, but I understand that has been fixed by the time I have written this review which shows how speedy the ones in charge were to fix little mishaps like that, which is always good. Either way it wasn't such as big deal as the opening section did not take too long to repeat.\n\nFran Bow has a real good story and is certainly a challenge in parts (thank God for the discussion hub here!) but that only added to the experience for me in the sense that it was something that in some instances you really had to think about and get involved with. On the other hand it was equally as good when the answer has been staring you in the face and you finally get it and have that ''Oh, duh!'' moment!\n\nAs you can probably tell by how fondly I speak of this game in this review - it's obvious to anyone that I love it. However, one of my only criticisms is that the ending left a little too many loose ends. I appreciate that the game leaves the player to decide what they think about the whole thing as there's nothing more disappointing than when a game gives you a set in stone ending which you're kind of ''eh'' about and leaves a bad feeling over your experience however I would have encouraged just a few of the open-ended questions to come to a definite conclusion. That being said, that may just be the nature of this very game. It's mysterious and nobody really knows what the truth is in the House of Madness. Plus, this is one of those games where I really wouldn't mind discussing ideas with others and coming up with a personal ending that feels right in your own heart which is endearing in its own way as well.\n\nAside from that I really have nothing bad to say about this game, I love psychological horrors, I love interesting stories and cool characters in video games and Fran Bow ticked all the boxes for me. It instantly reminded me of ''Alice in Wonderland; Madness Returns'' which is a similar game in terms of story / characters that I love dearly so I knew that I wouldn't be going wrong if I bought this game. I do feel that it may be inspired by Alice in Wonderland, especially given the photo of Fran and her friend Alice in chapter 5 inside of her wardrobe. That little reference made me really quite happy, actually. Probably more than it should of. But yeah, although the two games share aspects that I love they're also different enough for each other for both experiences to be refreshing. I mean, I could honestly play the two one after the other and not get the feeling that it was tedious. My heart was in this one, I loved every second of it, well done to the creators! I'll definitely be doing a fan art of this game soon!","August 30, 2015","true","10.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I played the demo. I read the news and waited, joined the fan group. It was worth it.\n\nThe story can sometimes be uncomfortable, Fran's life can sometimes seem hopeless and frightening. You never know just what kind of main character you are truly helping, because the game works hard to cultivate an air of chilling mystery. Fran seems like a nice little girl for the most part, she takes joy from the sweeter things in life: her cat, nature, art and family. However, she also seems to find an unnatural amount of beauty in strange places - "Oh, skulls mounted on the wall! This one still has some flesh on it! Kind of odd, but I like it, it's beautiful!"- and things we would find horrifically gory seem not to phase her at all. Is she mad? Has she done worse things than we are led to believe?\n\nIt's kind of like what would happen if a child had some understanding of the sublime, could appreciate the world in a greater, more abstract sense - or rather, the game works with the knowledge that the player will understand such complicated concepts, and Fran also tries to work her way through them and to find a place for herself when her world is shattered. In that way, I think it's incredibly rich and interesting.\n\nOn a more technical note, this game does not tend to rely on the classic jump scare, because it doesn't need to. It does give you the buckets of blood so many of us look for, but for those who are afraid of horror games, this won't be too bad. I can promise you that. It might leave you pondering something or with a feeling of discomfort, but that's what horror is for, right?\n\nIn a decade where horror is becoming something of an unfortunate formula, I often turn to games for something refreshing, and Fran Bow has done just that. It's also not without the cutesy factor.","January 15","true","13.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The story was alright -- engaging enough. The level of creativity that it took to make a game like this was off the scale. It was very Alice in Wonderland-ish, but in a much darker way. This is the part of the game that makes me glad that I played it. I loved the artistry and imagination behind it all.\n\nIt was the gameplay that was somewhat lacking, in my mind. A lot of the puzzles were just not intuitive. You can't sit there and think to yourself, "Alright, how would this thing I just found work?" because in all likelihood, it will not end up doing anything even close to what you think it will do. I ended up doing a lot of "alright, let's try these two things together randomly" in order to get stuff to work. But then, perhaps that was intended? It IS a chaotic, crazy world that she's in, after all. Maybe that's where the lack of intuition when it comes to puzzle solving came in. Who knows.\n\nFor whatever reason, I just don't end up enjoying a game as much when I end up needing to look up solutions to puzzles, especially if I sit there and think "what the f....?" to myself after realizing what I was supposed to have done. It removes you from the immersiveness of the game, and I would have LOVED to have stayed immersed in the universe they created. So it was just a bit of a pity from that standpoint.\n\nAll in all, if you want something that will get your creative juices and imagination flowing, and don't mind having to probably look up some answers, by all means try this game.","May 7","true","15.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

This is a very well done point-and-click adventure/puzzle game with beautiful art direction and a compelling story. It manages to tug at your heartstrings while also being very unsettling at times. I didn't think a story about a girl and her cat would have nearly the amount of depth and nuance that this did. Without giving away too much, I was impressed with one of the major game mechanics in the early half, and there were a few puzzles that gave me some serious challenge until I took a step back and tried to think about them from different angles.\n\nThe one thing I would make a note of is that there are a few parts that get very gory. If you are easily disturbed by blood and/or entrails, I would exercise caution when playing. Fans of Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw's Trilby series of games will most likely enjoy this game immensely.\n\nOverall, this game gets an 8/10 from me.","May 7","true","6.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

But also some dark narrative themes like mental disorders, sucide and other things I wont spoil. Which if done wrong could have been really bad but I feel the game use those subjects respectfully and it does also even has it moments where the game lights up and shows happier sides. Even if that might seem unlikly at the very beginning of the game.\n\nThe game is about a girl named Fran Bow who escapes the mental hospital to look for her cat and hide from the monster following her. To her aid she has her stolen medicn that makes her able to see the world with diffirently. It's as wacky as it sounds, or maybe far more wackier than it sounds. Like Alince in wonderland, Frans reality shifts as much as it wants to.\n\nThe story starts of very feeling loose, and feels a bit too random, but it does develop and becomes quite intresting after the first part of the game. As a whole the plot is just as intriging it needs to be to make you want to play through the whole game and Fran, her pals and enemys grows on you as characters. The randomness of it all is forgiven for the spectatular creative setting and characters.\n\nThe game features an "world switching mechanic" similar to "Day of the tentacle" and "Lilly looking through" where you have to switch between diffrent version of a setting to find new objectives and puzzels, It's not anything ground breaking, but like those other games, it does work very well here, and makes the game show of it's wonderfuls settings. This games worlds might be the best thing about this game, they are so darn beautiful/disturbing to look at, and you just want to explore this rabbit hole deeper to make it show you more of its maddness. It starts of very dark and gloomy, but then makes a few twist into other directions but never strays away from it's own weirdness.\n\nThings I feel could improv the game is that I wish it could highlight everything that is interactive in one area better. It's easy to miss stuff you was supposed to click on. Also the dialogues are a bit slow. Some textures could also have been in an higher resultion, sometimes things just seems blurry and low res, I'm not sure if it's intentional or just technical limitation.\n\nIf you're an fan point and click adventure games, and horror such as Grimm Fairy tales, American Mcgee's Alice games, or find the the demo and gameplay footage appealing. I recommend giving this a go. It's a very weird, sometimes creepy, but also memorable and beautiful experiance.","September 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

From its unsettling atmosphere, to the array of intriguing characters, everything in Fran Bow is clearly a labour of love.\n\nThe artstyle is the first thing I fell in love with. It immediately reminded me of the intro sequence to Alice: Madness Returns. The animations are well done, and remain consistent through the entire game. The game uses a lot of gore, but it's not just any gore. It's artistic gore. That's right, the gore in this game is artistic gore. Rather than feeling disgusted, the gore in Fran Bow made me want to take a closer look at the screen out of interest, something no other game except for LISA has compelled me to do.\n\nThe music in Fran Bow is well done. Nothing much to say about it, other than it is good enough to be worth purchasing the Original Soundtrack DLC.\n\nNow, the thing that really gripped me: the gameplay. Yes, it's your average point & click in terms of control and inventory. However, one mechanic stood out: the pills. Fran can take pills to see and enter an alternate reality. You may take pills and subdue their effect at any time. The images, objects, and beings you see from taking pills, are often quite quite disturbing, but in a good way. You will need to use the pills to solve puzzles, so they provide more than just interesting imagery. For Legend of Zelda fans, think of it as the Magic Mirror from Link to the Past that allows you to travel to the Dark World.\n\nNow, the question most people wonder: Are there jumpscares? The answer is yes and no. There are sudden popups, such as a character popping from behind a door you are about to enter, or heads falling from a staircase into the room. However, Fran Bow does not use the cheap tactics games such as Five Nights at Freddy's utilize. Nothing pops out at the screen at you. Without spoiling too much, I can confidently say that this game is indeed unsettling and in a way, scary, but the "jumpscares" are the lesser of evils this game has to bring.\n\nIn terms of replay value, there is not much. This is a game I most likely will not play again unless I want to head back to hunt achievements. It took me around 8 hours to do a complete runthrough, though it probably will be much shorter for those who use a walkthrough or are generally excellent at noticing small details in point & click games. Despite its lack of replay value, my single playthrough was definitely worth both the money and time spent on this thought-provoking masterpiece.","February 26","true","17.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Stories had meaning, they were written as educative examples for children to behave well. They werent necessarily happy stories.\n\nFran Bow is full of visual display of blood and gore, but never you feel like you are in world of torture-porn. You are in world turned wrong, and you want to end it. Then, you enter the rabbit hole, and game turns into modern version of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nGreat story, great atmosphere, great sound and art. I was first disappointed by the lack of voice acting, but the way the game is presented made me forgive it very quickly. Its like reading a picture book, which doesnt require voice.\n\nGame has many chapters and is fairly long, taking 10+ hours with semi-easy puzzles, Easy enough for everyone to get through, but still require a bit of thinking most of the time. What I liked is how unpredictable the game was. You are not set into one setting for the whole game, but inside a broken mind of a child, which can really change to any direction, at any time... In the end, someone might feel like its open ended and doesnt give you any answers, but one shouldnt overthink about it. The game gives you what you need to know, and from the perspective of the protagonist, Fran Bow, everything is just the way you need to know everything.\n\nI can see how it was influenced by excellent movies "Pan`s Labyrinth" and "The Fall", which also are surreal stories playing with the broken mind of an orphan child. Overall, Fran Bow is an A+ grade modern Adventure game. Some companies such as Daedalic and WadjetEye make great classic style adventures, but it is games like Fran Bow that really show the best of the independent game development has to offer. Fran Bow offers something that big studios would never touch, and Fran Bow does it with style.","March 8","true","11.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In retrospect I wished I backed it for more than 10 bucks just for the game, because it’s a damn fine game. Fran Bow is a lot like Dream Machine and Kentucky Route Zero in that the three are adventure games made by two person dev teams and are beautiful labors of love. The devs of Fran Bow even said that they were putting their hearts and souls in it and they clearly weren’t lying.\n\nFran Bow’s atmosphere is fantastic, it’s got a sort of Edward Gorey-esque aesthetic but it still has its own identity. The puzzles for the most part are all pretty well done, it mostly avoids the usual adventure game pitfalls aside from an instance or two and while they are a few surreal solutions they still do make some sort of sense so they’re aren’t cheap. The writing is pretty good, though a bit wonky here and there, mainly in the beginning. Overall it hits all the right notes to make a great adventure game.\n\nFran Bow is a really humble game and it deserves more exposure. Killmonday did a great job and I hope that they do well, I’d be sure to back them if they go for another campaign. Devs with this kind of passion, dedication, and skill should always be rewarded.  Definitely pick this up.","August 30, 2015","true","8.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It also has an intriguing mechanic of changing reality at will (for want of a better word) by using 'Pills'. Puzzles are adequate; neither feindlishly hard or too easy, with some arcade-like sequences (which can be skipped) and getting through the game is likely to take a few hours.\n\nThe main strength of the game is not, however, it's gameplay. Where the game really shines is in overall design: story, art, sound & music and how those interact with each other. It's as if someone wrote a script inspired by one part 'Alice in Wonderland', one part 'The Shining', and some parts just general weirdness of a child possibly (probably?) going (or being) insane, and then had Tim Burton direct the screenplay. It's at times creepy, somewhat disgusting, funny (albeit in a rather weird way), and sometimes even a bit trippy (looking at you chapter 3). Beyond all that it is a sad and slightly disturbing tale of a tormented child's psyche, where we at the end are left with more questions than answers.\n\nIt may not be the best ever adventure game, but it is original in both presentation and subject matter. It also has a poignant story that is likely to make you think. The game can be enjoyed on the surface layer, but the deeper layers and metaphors are there to be deciphered, but do not expect to get any completely clear answers. It is also a good example of games as art, without at any time becoming pretentious or complex for complexity's sake.\n\nWhen you get down to it, it is - at the core - simply a good game, and well worth playing.","August 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Art is amazing, plot is pretty dark, puzzles made sense.\n\nHas a very Alice in Wonderland feel to it. Also interesting to see Alice and Fran are friends, only referenced by the photo in the last chapter. Fran's interactions with the environment are charming, sometimes in a twisted sort of way. Puzzles were pretty simple, got stuck a couple times but only because I am pretty forgetful.\n\nThe story is pretty dark, as you could probably guess. Keeps you wondering who you can trust in the game. To me the ending was kind of boring and left quite a few questions unanswered. Not necessarily a bad thing as this can leave us to form our own opinions on the unknown.\n\nOverall the game was definitely worth the buy and I will probably play through it again when I need my point-and-click fix.","October 13, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are encouraged to think outside the box and to try new things, and there's a strong message of facing one's fears and past and coping with trauma. Especially after seeing Queen Fran in Istherta(I think that's the name?)\n\nThe only shortcomings are that some of the puzzles are fairly convoluted. Sometimes you have to litterally click on everything and to try every possible option to find the correct one.

A creepy psychological horror adventure with a pretty unique drawn 2D art-style, a spooky music, a great variety of puzzles (with different complexity), you can switch between two worlds to advance on the puzzles and find objects, it's a great point & click adventure, no doubt about it.

I get distracted/frustrated easily and almost never finish even one playthrough.\n\nThat said, I completed Fran Bow in just under 10 hours and it completely consumed me both in-game and out. The storyline is engaging, the characters are well-developed and the graphics are visually appealing. This, for me, is the trifecta of a great game.\n\nThe game did have a learning curve for me though. I often consulted walkthroughs, especially in the first chapter. Once I understood the mechanics of the game better I was able to find my groove, which made my experience much more enjoyable.\n\nI look forward to replaying the game for the missed acheivements.

Instead, this is a story like Alice, with a main character who has the same combination of sensibility, curiosity, friendliness, and straightforward acceptance of the fantastic that Alice had.  It makes no attempt to be Alice, or refer to the original particularly.  It just has the same spirit, but much, much darker.\n\nExcept it's not even as dark as it looks.  There's no shortage of gore, and death and insanity are major topics, sure, but there's also sweetness and a beautiful land of innocence and talking roots, and just when you expect to be murdered by a skeleton, you get birthday cake!  The story is non-standard, not going anywhere you would think, and even now I'm not sure what actually happened - rather like the original Alice.\n\nI have done my best, but Fran Bow is hard to pin down and describe.  It is different, its own thing.  That is why if you have any fondness for point and clicks, and for dark themes, you should play it.\n\n(Oh, and when you get to the season changing part, if you click fast you can change multiple seasons without going through the ones in between.  I feel like a doof getting stuck for so long because I didn't know that.)","November 25, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiakoum/recommended/362680/","gdiakoum","Gagarin Gambit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiakoum/","39 products in account","I usually don't bother writing reviews, but Fran Bow delivers one of the stronger experiences you can get out of a game.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is a well written point and click adventure with puzzles that are reasonably challenging, but not to the point you will get stuck often. The music and audio work well to set up the atmosphere, and the graphics have a peculiar character and beauty. The puzzles, audio and, especially, the visuals, are good, although they don't reach the heights of modern masterpieces, such as Machinarium. However, one should consider that this game was actually made by two people and it does illustrate what indie game developers can do.\n\nThese factors alone would make a good game, but Fran Bow stands out in two ways. First, it introduces a unique mechanic which consists of visiting alternate realities or seasons which are crucial to the puzzle solutions: In one chapter Fran can move through time by controlling the seasons, while in another three chapters she can move between what might be called a waking world and a world of shadows, the latter being a dark and haunting place where a dinning table full of candy can be replaced by mutilated bodies.\n\nSecond, and most important, Fran Bow's story and atmosphere is like a slightly more coherent Alice in Wonderland, but darker, scarier, twisted, and occasionally more dreamlike and touching, where the limits between reality and hallucination are blurred. It is set in a surprisingly rich world with five realities, peculiar creatures and places, and even a made up alphabet which you can decipher thanks to an in-game book. It easy to get engulfed in the story and share Fran's fears, sorrows, and hopes.\n\nThis is an experience you will remember for a lifetime.","December 9, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had forgotten about it, until 2015 when Jacksepticeye had begun playing it. After deciding to buy the game, I found myself enjoying the dark yet simple story of Fran bow's journey to find her pet, Mr. Midnight. The positives of the game are the story, which manages to take you to fantastic worlds, and sceince-bending rules. Despite this, the story manages to keep itself relevent and together. Other positives include how, as a horror game, the jump scares aren't cheap, and the few end up mostly being fran battling her demons, or the medicine you take. The only real problem is the same problem that plagues most point-and-click games, if you miss something, you will get stuck for a while. However, for $15 with 15+ hours to completeion, I most certainly recommend this game.","November 30, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fran Bow is one of (if not the most) imaginitive game I've ever played.  It's educational too; if I ever had kids I would want them to play it, were I not afraid that it would scar them for life.  I wish I would've played this when I was younger because it's one of those games that just opens up a whole new world to the player.  Fran Bow made me think about the meaning of love, life, and reality which is much more than I ask of most of the games I play.  The artwork, storyline, and concept of the game are absolutely beautiful.  I am a huge fan of horror but I think of this game as more of a charming but highly disturbing children's story that non-horror fans could get into as well.

While Double-Fine had nearly limitless funding to produce an adventure game, they spent it all on the first half, rushed the second half and ended up with a good looking but still mediocre adventure game.  Fran Bow had nearly no resources and stretched its budget as far as it could go and came out as a fantastic adventure game.\n\nThe low budget in development shows, the graphical quality of the backgrounds and characters are poor, the inventory can be a trudge to navigate through as you have to click on use, look, and combine on the junk you carry around like this is an adventure game from the late '80s.  In fact, the design sees no evolution in Adventure Game development aside from the mini-games between chapters which are an unwelcome change in gameplay and are skippable with no impact on the play through.  However, it does not need to evolve because it does what it does well with what the developers were given to work with.  The art style works well to make the protagonist come off as insane and projects the nightmares she sees all the time into the world.  The rest of the game is well done enough with a story and design that hooks you so well it doesn't need any innovation to keep you playing it.\n\nThe story revolves around a child at a mental institution named Fran Bow and her search for her "talking" cat.  Along the way you see and discover the messed up circumstances around her lack of sanity and how she copes with what happened to land her in the mental institution in the first place.  Much of the game takes place in what may or may not be the nightmares and hallucinations of this little girl.  The art style, sound, music, and some of the jarring transitions between reality and unreality help present the story and the world she lives in.\n\nThis is a classical adventure game so there are inventory puzzles where you have to rub the right thing in your inventory against the right object to advance the story.  There are also puzzles where you have to figure out how to use environmental objects or machinery with little instructions to open new paths.  They are on the harder side of the puzzles you find in adventure gaming, but I wouldn't call their difficulty frustrating or insurmountable.\n\nIn all, a wonderful adventure game I'd recommend.","February 10","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the fact she has lost her parents, she is a typical child with a simple need of being surrounded by loving ones.\nThis need leads us through the fear and madness, through the rivers of blood and under the rain of tears.\n\nPros:\n-Although Fran's story is far from light, a colourful scheme fits it very well - such an oxymoron. We play as a little girl, eh!\n-Every person we meet has a unique life story.\n-Many scary and unexpected moments for the whole story.\n-Atmospheric soundtracks.\n-Ability to shift the realities (truly fantastic!).\n-Quite difficult riddles time by time.\n-And such a nice black cat :)\n\nCons:\n-No voice narrating. I don't mind playing "in silence" but it might have been more interesting.\n\nAnd to sum up - I give it  9/10","June 1","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as I can tell there's no way to 'lose' (the maze minigame being a good example, which just resets you to the start if you touch the bad things) so that does hurt the mood slightly. With a few exceptions (the door code for instance), most puzzles can be solved by simply interacting with or combining everything you possibly can, but most of them make sense and are fairly obvious so you shouldn't have to do this.\n\nA couple of parts in chapter 2 unintentionally (though I have a sneaking suspicion it was deliberate) worked as minor jump scares for me, though I've certainly seen bigger/worse, safe to say this game is not cheap stream bait like so many other budget horror titles. Not that I don't expect people to do videos/streams of it or anything.\n\nAlso, avoid spoilers whenever you can. It's worth playing through on your own at least once.\n\nUpdate: Well, that was something. I'll let you know what if I ever figure it out for myself. Definitely one of the better and more interesting games in recent years.","August 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Interspersed here and there are puzzles and little mini-games that are more action-oriented. (Some of those mini-games are interesting takes on other classic games, for instance Frogger.) Those can present some moderate difficulty for the most part, though in a few places I was making them harder than they should have been because some rule wasn't obvious - for instance, not realizing in an early maze mini-game that I could approach enemies from certain directions more closely than other directions until I'd already restarted the sequences a number of times. That's a good warning going in: try not to overcomplicate some of the puzzles and games when the solution is much simpler. Of the puzzles, there was really only one that I found a little ridiculous (it's shown in one of the screenshots on the store page). In all, it remained fun to play without being boringly easy or stupidly difficult.\n\nIt was the elements of the story itself, however, that made it so memorable to me. This isn't the first time I've seen very dark subject matter presented in a manner similar to a children's book, but I'm not sure I've seen it done so well. The character of Fran Bow herself is a big factor in this; her stubborn childish innocence throughout everything that was going on was not only endearing, it helped to lend weight to the darker parts of the story. At no point did I feel like this character was acting in a way inconsistent with how she was first presented. She's a ten year old girl and she seems like a ten year old girl. All of the fantastic settings she finds herself in are well worth the visit and I enjoyed her childish reactions to them. In fact, it's odd how in such a dark game I found myself genuinely smiling at certain points. The plot itself is rich, even if the ending, which I'm still working out how I feel about, goes off in a strange (and possibly not completely satisfying) direction.\n\nIn any case, if you enjoy a good adventure game and a good horror story, you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you give this game a skip. Get it. Frankly, I feel I could have paid more for it and gotten my money's worth.","September 3, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yeah, not a typical game of this genre. Instead of cheery characters and lighthearted themes, here you will encounter mental illness, medical mistreatment and their consequences. Story is compelling and will keep you nailed to the chair until you finished it. Narrative can be interpreted in two ways, and is left to the players which one they want to believe is "real".\n\nGameplay is classic p&c with using right item at the right place. Puzzles lean to the easy side and thus are welcomming to less experienced players in the genre. Veterans will probably storm through them but nevertheless enjoy in game since the focus is on the story.

A horrific tale presented from the perspective of such a young heroine. The game is a test of courage mixed with a plea to retain innocence.\n\nThe artstyle, reminiscent of the 90s TV show Angela Anaconda (yet cleaner, smoother and, of course, gorier) fits in so well with the plot and the point-and-click style. Flashbacks are presented in a noir style, but maintain a modern presentation and flow that holds your attention until you retain control again. Everything works great with tight controls and easily distinguishable objects and backgrounds.\n\nThe music and sound effects only serve to enhance the cartoony, yet horrific, images you will have to encounter on your journey. It will serve to sway and move you as you interact with characters springing to life with their own personalities. Although you need to read dialogue, you will easily be able to find each character's voice and relate to them in your own way within a few words.\n\nThe gameplay itself, which involves collecting and combining items and solving puzzles, is nothing new, but is absolutely intuitive to the design of this game. You will get stumped at times, but not to the point where you will feel like something is impossible.\n\nOverall, I had a very pleasant experience with this game.

The art style, the settings, the characters, everything within the game was done so well, and all the while even the cute characters added a tad more sinister to the game. From the beginning, I was rather confused on what was going on, having all of these different realities and such, but once you get further into the game and meet the villagers in Ithersta, you see how the cuteness make so much sense. While this town has all the different seasons and, to me at least, cute characters, it had some evil souls, or kamalas, which probably were not allowed there in the first place due to the terror they can cause.\n\nI believe my favorite character was Mr. Itward, because from the start, I thought he would hurt her somehow, and when you meet him in the woods while going home, he's so kind and friendly. The moment where he took Mr. Midnight, I instantly thought that he was the bad guy I saw him as from the start, but from when he throws her a party till' the ending, he really showed just how much he cared, almost having a fatherly figure to Fran.\n\nThe only thing I would love for the game is a "Scene Selection", so that if you want to replay a certain chapter for different achievements, or to ask more questions, you can just choose it and go off from there. All in all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a cute and sinister adventure!~","December 24, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game tells us the story of Fran Bow that ended up in a mental asylum after the murder of her parents. But Fran Bow is missing her cat, Mr. Midnight, so she wants to escape the asylum, find her cat, and also find out who murdered her parents. The game isn't really helping us understand some details of the real story about Fran. The story is mostly showing us how Fran is understanding the things around her and how she's coping with what happened to her parents. The game is quite dark, so it's surely not for kids. People who love adventure point and click games, will surely love this game. The developers did an awesome job.

It's kind of weird though how the game plays out. It's supposedly a horror game, but it's barely functioning as one. The game incorporates a lot of peaceful and likeable characters and enviroments, which is very rare, but it's not a concept which can't work, and here it kind of does. With this it's easy to make a huge contrast so it's shocking elements have a bigger effect. Using this, the game switches between dark and happy themes a few times to make a world which may as well be Fran's disturbed mind, and it's presented with a gorgeous art style. Also, for the most part the writing is good, but unfortunately when it matters the most they failed to make something interesting.\n\nIt's hard to talk about what I don't like about this game without spoiling anything. So for those of you who don't want it to get spoiled, the game's story is written in a way that when you get answers it only raises more questions. And in the end you get so much ♥♥♥♥ thrown at you (trying to explain what exactly happened) that it's not only overwhelming, but feels like a very heedless way to fininsh a game. Everything which happens in the last like 10 minutes is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I don't mean it in a way that it's completely unlikeable, there were moments which were great and memorable, but outside of that it's really just a rushed way to try and tighten up loose ends, but it just couldn't do that with all of them.\n\nSo yeah, it's hard to explain what I didn't like, but all in all it was a pleasant experience.","April 14","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Malfunction","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980042285/","415 products in account","*Semi-Spoilers*\n\nI apologize to the creators for not recommending this obvious labor of love.\nFran Bow has a lot going for it and earns the (nowadays) rare distinction of being a game I actually played until the end. Which means that amidst all these hundreds of games that fail to hold my attention or engage me sufficiently to be "beaten" this one persevered only to reward me with... nothing.\n\nNo conclusion, no reveal, no explanation, no closure.\n\nSome people enjoy this sort of thing; going online afterwards to discuss their interpretations and theories about events that unfolded. I can even agree with this and relate to it up to a point. I just can't help but feel Fran Bow took it a bit too far leaving _everything_ up to the player. Was it all a dream? Was half of it a dream? 25% dream? Is there one single "fact" in this story anchored to reality or is everything fluid and left to your imagination?\n\nWhen I read a novel I like to imagine that the author had this burning desire to share their story with me; that everything they put into writing was more or less important to the story or the setting or the mood. There will be some ambiguity or some uncertainty - certain facts will be left up to your imagination and make the story better for it.\n\nHere, you might as well just grab a cup of your favorite beverage, sit down comfortably and use these following keywords to make up your own story in your head:\n\nLittle Girl, Insane Asylum, Dead Parents, Medicine, Psychosis,\n\nDid you do it? There you go, whatever you made up in your head can most likely fill in for what "actually" happened in Fran Bow.","May 8","false","7.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","2"

It's basically a different variation of the Alice in Wonderland story from Disney, except it's more dark in levels of cults and rituals than random silly discord. Wouldn't recommend this to children unless they're already exposed to gore, blood, and dark symbols. Otherwise it might startle/truamatize them.\n\nSome of the puzzles left me stuck for periods of time... had trouble finding things to click on or didn't realize I had to wait for something to trigger first to progress. Believe I had to restart the game once as I felt I couldn't progress: Had issues of getting the no. 2 ticket in the clinic.\n\nThe story is... well... alright? Left me lost a few times... don't really know what to say about it. At times it had me bored, other times it got my attention or caught me off guard... some parts just kept droning on with repeating phrases or words heard several times already.\n\nIt's not possible to skip any text you've seen before nor able to make your own save points (as some chapter's start out with heavy text) so this will or may be a pain for achievement hunters if they missed some achievements in their first playthrough. (Especially the mini-games as I would not advice to skip, they're not that hard except the third one due to the jump length is smaller than your cat.)\n\nHow the game left off could be potential for a sequal... but I probably wouldn't get it as the experience I had here didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, but wasn't bad either.","December 28, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It threw me off for sure especially chapter 3 dragged a lot.\n\nChapter 5 is the final chapter and we get back to the dark mood of the first two chapters but it falls flat at the ending.\nThe ending is open for interpretation and I wont spoil anything BUT the ending was rushed, waaaaay to rushed waaaay to much into your face new characters are introduced in the last 2 min of the game just to make a point.\n\nI feel the ending and chapter 3 take down what could have been a fantastic adventure.\n\nShould you buy it ? well if you like games like the Cat Lady and dont expect it to be better then absolutly buy it. its a great game with a fantastic soundtrack.\n\n7.5/10\n","January 5","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The biggest, and worst, is that the game finishes on what is basically a cliffhanger. Not a cliffhanger that leads to another game, either. You just finish the game going "Wait, that's it?". I did thoroughly enjoy the first two chapters, and I understand that the game is supposed to represent a descent into madness, but it does it only by getting stranger. No subtle hints regarding one reality or another - nothing intriguing to leave you thinking, like say, a decent thriller.\n\nAnyway, let's get down to points:\n\nProsVery good atmosphere, and I like the way switching perspectives is done.\nThe art style is very fitting. Despite the looks, though, don't expect a Tim Burton-esque journey.\nA very intriguing mythology behind parts of the story.\nConsYou can tell the game has been translated from its original language. Jerky, stunted dialogue, horrible spelling, and grammar mistakes. *shudder*\nThe graphics are rather low-res. Pixels. I SEE DEAD PIXELS.\nThe dialogue is unvoiced. For something in the modern age, this is kind of a big fail. I guess this could be a plus for those that like to imagine things in their own way, though.\nSeveral points in this game may leave you stumped due to being rather obscure solutions, having you click on something that was previously not interactable, but hasn't changed at all, etc. This is to be expected in a point-and-click game, and I do appreciate that there are subtle hints here and there for some things - but those aren't the hints I needed. I did have to refer to a walkthrough a couple times.\nThe story loses cohesion past the early game. If you were hoping for a story, well... You're out of luck.\nThe dialogue options are rather pointless, as they offer no real choice. It's only really useful for saying "I'm done talking now, bye." so you don't have to read the rest of the lines if you've been there already.\nI really do wish I could select a neutral opinion of this game.

It feels like the writer sort of lost focus and direction of the story. And not to mention the excessive use of the word  darling . And after that the story gets back to gruesome again.\nThe ending is fairly disappointing. I was hoping that this journey Fran goes through to find and answer will, well, give us answers. I was hoping for at least a little bit of animation at the end after I've finished the gameplay, instead i just get one or two sentences written on the screen, and.......... that's all.\n\nThere are a lot of positive points on this game. Such as the arts, and the little games which have different look and mechanic. And also the kitty, love that cat with it's cute paws.\nBut the game is quite highly priced and I still can't come over the lacking ending\n\nMy conclusion, if its on discount might be worthy to buy (cause there are a lot of good games for less price), if not, just you know what can be expected from the game from the many reviews out there.","May 9","false","11.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The setting is gratuitously macabre, but I was fine with it. The story has some interesting ideas, but most of them ultimately felt underdeveloped. And the puzzles are probably the weakest part of it. They tend to be on the dull and rather unimaginative side, with a couple being frustratingly misleading.","June 4","false","10.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Also, the setup of the story is magnificent.\n\nEverything else? Not that great. The story dwindles into being less and less enjoyable with every section of the game that you clear, until the ending which makes almost no sense and failed to satisfy, and this is coming from someone who is used to piles and piles of crap endings to games over the last few decades. Although the plot started out fantastic with so much promise, it just got incredibly weird and felt like it lost focus on what made it so interesting in the first chapter.\n\nThe puzzles/adventure element of the game involving warping realities is great, but anything not directly related to that is often quite unclear as to what to do, and there's no "highlight all items on screen" button or option like you might find in other adventure games. Sure, some of the older titles didn't have this, but you knew what you could interact with because the backgrounds and the items you could pick up or interact with looked so very different. In this game, however, the items you can collect often blend in or are too easy to overlook and forget about, leading to wandering aimlessly until I lucked out and saw something new, or had to pull up a walkthrough on multiple occasions. One puzzle in a library involving symbols representing numbers still didn't make sense even after I looked up the solution online.\n\nSo in conclusion, great look, great reality-warping control, Fran's a great character with great child-like things to say about weird stuff and events, the plot is incredibly disappointing, and some of the puzzles are a true pain. I would recommend either old classics like the Space Quest or Kings Quest series, or newer adventure games like the Deponia series if you want to have better fun and plot than Fran Bow. I don't hate it, but it's quite disappointing.","May 22","false","8.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

One of these realities is fairly normal (to begin with at least) and the other is a completely horrific version - blood and guts everywhere.\n\nTo me, the whole thing is kind of adolescent, and I don't get it. I can kind of see that there is a merging/blurring of the two realities that occurs, but what's the actual point here? The dialogue of the game alternates between delirious nonsense and then blunt and sinister, but never really manages to say anything except for "look at how delirious and sinister this is!". It's grim but in a facile, ungroundedly fictitious, ultimately pointless way. It's a little too much "My Chemical Romance" and a little less "Lord of the Flies".\n\nI did, however, find the hand drawn art to be impressive, particularly the way Fran is animated, but overall I don't think this game was made with my demographic in mind.","May 22","false","1.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

In fact, the whole game feels set in a childlike mindset. However, while that may be impressive especially in dialgoue and Fran's ways of thinking, this also bleeds into the plot quite a lot. The main story becomes a bit of a mess and by the end of it I am kinda of confused. I understand there is an underlying meaning behind the world which you can see in small easter eggs from her own reality, but even then I hoped there would be more cohesiveness and several gameplay mechanics didn't help that experience. For one, I often found myself trying to use "wsad" but the game is solely click based and this tends to get annoying. The game's art is so well blended that it is hard determine what objects are interactive which leads to confusion about what the limits are so I end taking long for puzzles or quests. I ended up using guides a couple of times even though I wished I could have figure it out on my own.","May 23","false","11.6"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Reminds me a lot of Neverending Nightmares.\n\nYou are a little girl, some bad things happened to you, you are in a bad mental state, surrounded by hallucinations and only want to find your kitty and go back home. There are good and bad creatures, strange places, etc. So the story is basically a slightly darker version of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nPositive:\n-The characters are nice. The graphics are nice. The mini games are nice. The puzzles are OK, although they can be sometimes too frustrating or too obvious.\n\nNegative:\n-I can't give a good rating to this game mainly because of the extremely long and dull dialogues. There are a lot of characters that you come accross and you have to talk to almost all of them. Most of these conversations are meaningless and helpless. They talk nonsense and they contribute very less to the story because the story is not clear at the end. Believe me, they are VERY long, and VERY boring.  Creatures, demons, magic, terrible dreams and a lot of "I miss my home and my cat" cryings. You have two choices in converstaions and they have no effect at all. You always have to click LMB to go on with the conversation. For god's sake, at least give me a keyboard button or something.\n\n- The gameplay lacks logic sometimes, which can be really frustrating. At one part of the puzzle, you try to combine two objects but it doesn't let you do it. Then you pass that stage, you do a few other things, then you have to combine those two objects this time to continue. But since you think they can't be combined, you don't bother trying the same thing again, which is the normal human behaviour. So you get stuck there just for nothing.\n\nFor those who played the game, I'm talking about  the crayon and the insect executor card.

The game begins pretty well, showing the disturbing point of views of children locked in a mental asylum, but quickly strays from that theme entirely and becomes a huge cluster-♥♥♥♥. I honestly think the game was TRYING to be like Alice, but the major problem it had was IT GAVE TOO MANY EXCUSES. The appeal of Alice and other completely-insane storylines is that there is no reason for why anything is happening. Why is that character missing their legs? Why is there a pig-centipede that ate a rat? Why is there a floating goat skull trying to kill you? The player shouldn't get the answers to these questions. They should just have to accept the asthetics as they are.\n\nTLDR; If you want a disturbing game, don't get this one. If you want an acid trip, sure, try it, but don't expect much substance.\nOh, and the story is incredibly anti-climactic.

This is your standard point-and-click adventure, nothing too innovative here. The art is... interesting, but not displeasing. The soundtrack is forgettable but not terrible.\nMy biggest issue with this game is the story.\nLook, this game is about a child with a mental illness. It is obviously supposed to be bizarre and otherworldly. I understand that parts of it may be vague/confusing/strange/gross/etc to help the player see the world through the child's eyes and to  up the horror factor. This becomes a problem however when the bizarre is so overdone that it overshadows the narrative.  The 'this child is crazy' bit is pushed so hard that the story gets lost in there. By the time I got to the 3rd chapter, I had no idea what was happening anymore. The ending is extremely dissatisfying and doesn't resolve or explain anything. The things that are explained are far too complex for this sort of game, so they fall short in helping the player understand... well, anything.\nNow, I won't say this was a horrible game. I enjoyed it for the most part, and I don't regret the money I paid for it. However, I will say this: if you're looking for a complete, comprehendable story this is not your game. If you're looking for an art piece or just generally something to creep and gross you out, then buy it.\nI, for one, was looking for a story, and as such, cannot recommend it.","September 1, 2015","false","6.1"," 106 of 279 people (38%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","38","106","279","7","7"

It's cancer because it's aimed at teaching you schizophrenia.\nNot teaching you ABOUT schizophrenia. It's aimed at driving you - the player - insane.\nKeep this game away from people under the age of 17. I'm serious. If kids play this game, and start eating baking soda, or feces, or jump off cliffs thinking they'll survive, then you've now been warned.\n\nI bought this game thinking that it would be about a girl struggling with schizophrenia, or some similar mental disease. ...but the thing is that she's not really struggling. Instead schizophrenia gives her super powers, like the ability to actually turn invisible, or time travel, or not die, by "going into other dimensions", her psychosis being actually real.\n\nThe game follows pretty closely how a schizophrenic person would reason, using compelling rhetorics to try to overpower skepticism in the player, turning words on their heads, with the end goal to try to convince the player that imagination is just you seeing other forms of reality.\n\nThis game scares me in the same way that Waldorf schools scare me: Kids who play these games may actually develop schizophrenia from it, and already insane people wouldn't exactly go saner from it.\n\nThere are plenty of dialogue choices in this game: You're always given two dialogue options. These options doesn't seem to affect the game beyond some additional dialogue - there's no "good ending" or "bad ending".\n\nAs usual with point and click games, you will get stuck time and again, trying to find the thing to use on the thing to get the thing. Sometimes this involves picking up a thing from a huge pile of various rubble, sometimes it means picking up a certain plank from something made out of planks, sometimes it means using objects to combine properties in unreal and un-advicable ways, and sometimes it means clicking on a small heap of rubble in a large area "when you need to". You will need to look up a walkthrough several times over, which leads to a kind of inception when the LPer in your walkthrough, in turn has to look up a walkthrough several times.\n\nThe plot itself is just the visualized ramblings of a madman, that leads up to a very overused plot twist. I won't spoil it - it's just that I'm sick of that particular type of twist, especially when the game itself spoils it continuously throughout the game.","February 9","false","8.9"," 12 of 68 people (18%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","18","12","68","8","50"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperSecret/recommended/362680/","SuperSecret","Richard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperSecret/","144 products in account","Based on all the reviews up here so far I was expecting something a little more impressive.\n\nFrom the getgo I was put off by the fact that this felt very much like a phone port to me. I know this isn't currently available on any phones but the interface seemed to be designed for a touch screen and the visual quality is extremely lacking in a way where it appears to have been blown up to fit the resolution of a larger screen (which is disappointing because the illustrations are very lovely). I checked if there were any graphics options, but there weren't. You shouldn't have to play something in windowed mode to make it look nice.\n\nSome of the design choices also turned me off a bit. The text font and cursor seem to be an afterthought when compared to how lovely the drawing is. I know this is a nitpicky complaint but it cheapened the experience for me.\n\nSince I only played through the first chapter I can't speak to the full quality of the puzzles as the developers may have thrown in some complications, but for me the swallowing pills to swap back and forth between normal/nightmare mode got dull pretty quick. It was fun to see all the insane imagery but it would have been nice if this function offered something a little more in depth than giving clues to solutions that are really pretty simple to figure out. There was no real gameplay motivation to take the pills other than two points where the two perspectives served to directly influence one another and they were a little obvious to be totally satisfying. But as I said, I only played an hour of the game. The puzzles may get much more complicated but the connect the dots logic in chapter 1 was giving me some nasty flashbacks to Broken Age.\n\nIn terms of what I got from the premise of this game: clever in concept but could be handled with more finesse (not talking about the full narrative arc here, just nuances I picked up). The dialogue was definitely so-so. Sometimes I got into the mindset of this being a 10-year-old and sometimes it felt very clunky. Yes these characters aren't mentally all there in a lot of cases, but some of this awkward dialogue can be attributed to the hospital's staff. This iffyness is something I felt in some of the game's imagery as well. Some of it worked super well and some of it stuck out  like reading a weak metaphor in an otherwise thoughtful poem (Dead clowns stuffed in toy chests and heads shafted into a decapitated horse on a wooden pole? KEEP IT COMING FAM THIS STUFF IS TASTY! Pentagrams and grandfather clocks with eyes? ehhhhhhh.........a little forced in terms of "meaning")\n\nAll of this aside, if this game truly seemed to be optimized for pc I would feel a little better about recommending it. As it is now I would say it's possibly worth checking out at a discounted price. NOT SAYING TO AVOID THIS COMPLETELY. I definitely appreciate the effort put into this by such a small team and I would have never written this much about a game I though was flat out bad. It's something way wild to look at and It may just be your thing. Unfortunately in this case there were enough things that irked me to take me out of the experience and felt someone needed to be devil's advocate so they don't feel swindled by the overwhelming positivity (which is what happened to me, I know I'm an idiot)\n\nTry the demo out before you click purchase.","August 29, 2015","false","1.3"," 39 of 196 people (20%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","20","39","196","8","4"

However, even after playing the demo, I was convinced that this was one of the most atmospheric indie games i have had the good fortune of playing. The art style, soundtrack, gameplay mechanics, and story are each worth of the word masterpiece. Together they come together to present one of deepest, hard hitting games available. It is hard to not just ignore any flaws with the game. The resolution seems poor, with little in the way of graphical options. Also, some of the puzzles fall into the point-and-click faux pas of certain combinations not making any rational sense. Regardless of these small qualms, this is a game that deserves more praise than I alone can provide. The developers have clearly poured their hearts and souls into its production.","August 30, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So here's the thing about Fran Bow:\nIt's not REALLY a horror game. It is, but it's not a horror game from beginning to end. I found the game to have many hints of fantasy. The first chapter of the game is definitely scary and disturbing, but as I played through, it got less and less disturbing. I'm not saying this is bad at all, but I just wasn't expecting it. So just be aware that it will not be scary and disturbing the whole way through the game.\nAlso, this game does have a lot of puzzles and there were many times where I walked back and forth trying to figure out what to do, but it's so rewarding once you figure out what you need to do.\n\nThat being said, this game is amazing. I don't have a lot of point-and-click games in my library that I play, but this is an exception. Fran Bow has brought out just about every emotion that I have ever felt all within a perfectly crafted game. The story is one of the greatest and I can definitely see myself playing this game again.\nThe music is also amazing and it's very calming, but I also appropriate for the different parts of the game you will be in.\n\nI played this game back when it was a pre-alpha game in Kickstarter and it was just the first chapter of the game. I loved it and beat it 3 or 4 times. Now, coming back to it, there are a lot of changes (as expected), but not a-one of those changes made the game worse.\n\nI love this game so much and as soon as I saw the full version here on Steam, I bought it immediately without even checking the price; that's how much I've been waiting for this game. Whatever this game costs is worth it. It's worth every penny.\n\n10/10 This game is perfect in every way and I love it with all of my heart. <3","August 30, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hand-drawn art-style is wonderful and extremely detailed. I took the time to explore every nook and cranny just to check it out. The story was interesting and still left some unanswered questions in the end.

The resolution looked kind of low, which is a shame because the art is so amazing. I imagine the high resolution images exist somewhere. If Killmonday would just release the high resolution images, I'd be extremely pleased.\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience and proof that games that try something different can be successful.","August 31, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualDragonHollyS/recommended/362680/","ActualDragonHollyS","Dragonqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualDragonHollyS/","218 products in account","Fran Bow is one of those games where you really have to play it yourself. You can't just watch someone LP it, or watch a review from a youtube personality, or look at screenshots. You will never, ever get a good idea of what kind of experience this is without experiencing it first-hand, and witnessing it in it's hand-drawn, creepy, atmospheric and on-the-edge-of-your-seat storytelling.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are some of the most interesting and well-thought-out I've seen in a Point & Click game. While I'm normally not a fan of the "inventory" sub-genre of P&Cs, the game doesn't fall into that tragic ditch of "rub X on Y until it works". Everything you have has a use and while playing the game, it's obvious as to which objects you can and cannot interact with.\n\nThe "dual worlds" mechanic helps to create a very uncomfortable vibe in the player at times. You will come to know that no matter how peaceful the area you are in looks, the moment you take that pill, your surroundings will change to the exact opposite. Every screen has it's own dark and disturbing twin, and the knowledge that sometimes you will have to pay good attention to every sickening detail will really keep you in the edge of your seat, and sometimes leaping back when you notice something out of the corner of your eye, or even in plain sight.\n\nDuring the game, you'll come to love Fran Bow as a character. She's a little girl who's been thrust violently into a world she doesn't quite understand, and while it's a little unnerving as to how calmly she takes in most of what she's seeing, it really works to create a personality and a character whom you desperately want to succeed.\n\nA cat is fine too.\n\nI'd like to add that this game contains NO jumpscares, in the traditional meaning of the word. Yes, whenver you take your pill, it's quite instant, but nothing's going to jump out at you or scream in your ear, there's no random scary faces or evil beings leaping out at you. You can take your time as much as you want. That's because this game uses atmosphere, story and setting to keep you from feeling at ease. The game is at best stunningly eerie and at worst absolutely horrifying and disturbing. You'll really be frantically clicking on your pill bottle to return to normality, or at least Fran Bow's version of normality.\n\nTo conclude. Fran Bow is an experience that encompasses many emotions, fear, happiness, excitement, foreboding, childlike wonder and a sense of fulfillment as you solve puzzles that are never too hard or too obvious, discovering new characters, new places, and uncover the unsettling mystery of your family's murder, and the reasons as to why you are being stalked by a horrifying entity. At no point was I left unsatisfied, and at no point was I left angry or annoyed at a puzzle or a loose end to the plot. I would recommend this game to anyone seeking an emmersive and creepy experience. 9/10.","September 8, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No sassy one-liners, or pop culture references, but instead a realistic protrayal of a ten year old's sense of wonder and exitement, and fear of the unknown.\n\nCons:\n-After chapter two, the story goes off the ♥♥♥♥ing rails\n-Chapter three was way too long, and ruined the pacing of the story.\n-The ending leaves too many questions unanswered, and feels a little abrupt.\n\nSummary:\nEven if the story gets a little confusing, the great gameplay, and cool visuals are totally worth your money.","December 15, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So here's the thing about Fran Bow:\nIt's not REALLY a horror game. It is, but it's not a horror game from beginning to end. I found the game to have many hints of fantasy. The first chapter of the game is definitely scary and disturbing, but as I played through, it got less and less disturbing. I'm not saying this is bad at all, but I just wasn't expecting it. So just be aware that it will not be scary and disturbing the whole way through the game.\nAlso, this game does have a lot of puzzles and there were many times where I walked back and forth trying to figure out what to do, but it's so rewarding once you figure out what you need to do.\n\nThat being said, this game is amazing. I don't have a lot of point-and-click games in my library that I play, but this is an exception. Fran Bow has brought out just about every emotion that I have ever felt all within a perfectly crafted game. The story is one of the greatest and I can definitely see myself playing this game again.\nThe music is also amazing and it's very calming, but I also appropriate for the different parts of the game you will be in.\n\nI played this game back when it was a pre-alpha game in Kickstarter and it was just the first chapter of the game. I loved it and beat it 3 or 4 times. Now, coming back to it, there are a lot of changes (as expected), but not a-one of those changes made the game worse.\n\nI love this game so much and as soon as I saw the full version here on Steam, I bought it immediately without even checking the price; that's how much I've been waiting for this game. Whatever this game costs is worth it. It's worth every penny.\n\n10/10 This game is perfect in every way and I love it with all of my heart. <3","August 30, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, even after playing the demo, I was convinced that this was one of the most atmospheric indie games i have had the good fortune of playing. The art style, soundtrack, gameplay mechanics, and story are each worth of the word masterpiece. Together they come together to present one of deepest, hard hitting games available. It is hard to not just ignore any flaws with the game. The resolution seems poor, with little in the way of graphical options. Also, some of the puzzles fall into the point-and-click faux pas of certain combinations not making any rational sense. Regardless of these small qualms, this is a game that deserves more praise than I alone can provide.

You speculate what's going on, why you are in this world, and what really happening.  It honestly kept me on my mental toes the entire time.\n\n2) The horror and thriller side of the game is definitely there.  It makes the player feel that in this world, bad things are going to happen, and they usually do.\n\n3) The controls are easy (as to expect by a point and click game), but I honestly didn't feel that they got old or overused.  It was a great choice for a game like this.\n\n4) The music and voices (when there are some) are definitely on point.  I found myself being more aware of my souroundings whenever weird music or noises would appear.  It really puts the player in the world.\n\n5?)Cats are cute :D\n\nCons:\n\nI only have three problems with the game.\n\n1) I thought it was too short.  I wanted more of the story.  More things to click on and maybe even more interaction with characters.  It had an awesome world, and I don't feel that there was enough in it to fill it.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles were actually too hard for me.  I had to end up looking up guides online just to find something I didn't click on that was totally obscure or to find out the my ideas weren't working even though it seemed like they would (common sense stuff).\n\n3) With that in mind, I think there should have been a "Choices matter" system that way the player could feel more in control of our creations and consequences.  At times it felt linear, "do this puzzle, get this whatever".  If they added in different endings or different choices/consequences, it would have really addded depth to this already great world.\n\nWith all of that said, I give this game a strong 7/10.  I would definitely play it again, and my friends loved watching me play this as well.  I just wish there was more to find out!","December 9, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game holds a very creepy dreamlike atmosphere and doesn't use the basic jump scare tatic to keep it unsettling. I will say certain parts of the game are a little cliche, i.e: insane asylum,creepy little girl, shadow monsters. But it also introduces very interesting "creatures", and game mechanics that help separate it from others. The pill mechanic being one of the more prominent mechanics, allows the player to see the game in two different perspectives. The game is also very linear, when given a choice in a conversation it will usually give you the same "ending" without much diversity, with the exception of a couple. But I don't feel that really detracted me when playing the game. The campaign takes about 5-7 hours long to complete and it took me about 10 to get 100% complete. That being said I recommend getting the game while it's on sale as they are asking $15 bucks for the game.\n\nStory: 8/10\nSound: 9/10 (Eerie piano music for the most part, you can buy the soundtrack for $5 although I don't recommend it unless dissonant piano tracks are what you enjoy to listen to in your free time.)\nGraphics: 8/10\nScare Level: 7/10 (It's fairly mild, but still spooky)\nReplayabiliy: 5/10 (Not really meant to be replayed unless you want to experience the story again)\nOverall: 8/10","December 12, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualDragonHollyS/recommended/362680/","ActualDragonHollyS","Dragonqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualDragonHollyS/","218 products in account","Fran Bow is one of those games where you really have to play it yourself. You can't just watch someone LP it, or watch a review from a youtube personality, or look at screenshots. You will never, ever get a good idea of what kind of experience this is without experiencing it first-hand, and witnessing it in it's hand-drawn, creepy, atmospheric and on-the-edge-of-your-seat storytelling.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are some of the most interesting and well-thought-out I've seen in a Point & Click game. While I'm normally not a fan of the "inventory" sub-genre of P&Cs, the game doesn't fall into that tragic ditch of "rub X on Y until it works". Everything you have has a use and while playing the game, it's obvious as to which objects you can and cannot interact with.\n\nThe "dual worlds" mechanic helps to create a very uncomfortable vibe in the player at times. You will come to know that no matter how peaceful the area you are in looks, the moment you take that pill, your surroundings will change to the exact opposite. Every screen has it's own dark and disturbing twin, and the knowledge that sometimes you will have to pay good attention to every sickening detail will really keep you in the edge of your seat, and sometimes leaping back when you notice something out of the corner of your eye, or even in plain sight.\n\nDuring the game, you'll come to love Fran Bow as a character. She's a little girl who's been thrust violently into a world she doesn't quite understand, and while it's a little unnerving as to how calmly she takes in most of what she's seeing, it really works to create a personality and a character whom you desperately want to succeed.\n\nA cat is fine too.\n\nI'd like to add that this game contains NO jumpscares, in the traditional meaning of the word. Yes, whenver you take your pill, it's quite instant, but nothing's going to jump out at you or scream in your ear, there's no random scary faces or evil beings leaping out at you. You can take your time as much as you want. That's because this game uses atmosphere, story and setting to keep you from feeling at ease. The game is at best stunningly eerie and at worst absolutely horrifying and disturbing. You'll really be frantically clicking on your pill bottle to return to normality, or at least Fran Bow's version of normality.\n\nTo conclude. Fran Bow is an experience that encompasses many emotions, fear, happiness, excitement, foreboding, childlike wonder and a sense of fulfillment as you solve puzzles that are never too hard or too obvious, discovering new characters, new places, and uncover the unsettling mystery of your family's murder, and the reasons as to why you are being stalked by a horrifying entity. At no point was I left unsatisfied, and at no point was I left angry or annoyed at a puzzle or a loose end to the plot. I would recommend this game to anyone seeking an emmersive and creepy experience. 9/10.","September 8, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/recommended/362680/","messofanego","Messofanego","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/","259 products in account","As someone who works in the field of psychology, Fran Bow struck a chord with me. Despite sporting some of the most imaginatively grotesque and inspired horrific imagery in a videogame in many years, it's a tragic and empathic examination of a mental illness back during a time when caring was in short supply. The game doesn't pull any punches when it comes to why the children are there such as sexual abuse where a hallucination of a shadow creature is seen leaving bloody marks on the child's body. Nearly every single screen in the first few chapters has a messed up hallucinatinatory side, and credit to the artists that despite the gore, it's evocative in macabre beauty.\n\nMuch like Neverending Nightmares in the year before which dealt with obsessive compulsive disorder, Fran Bow in dealing with paranoid schizophrenia and dissociated personality disorder has reality and fantasy mixing enough that it's hard to make out what exactly is going on. There is an element of dark humour as Fran herself is a strange character who reacts to intense imagery with child-like innocence such as when ghouls are holding her disembodied head outside the window, she just wants them to give her head back. Maybe that element of lightness is part of her denial and also for the game to differentiate itself from grimdark horror games, rather more in line with American McGee's Alice games.\n\nIt's a pure point-and-click adventure that requires looking at items, combining them with each other, in addition to having lots of keys and locks. Sometimes I wish there was a way to find out what the objective was when I came back to this game after a few days. There's a lot of variety in the environments and backgrounds especially in the last couple of chapters when multiple realities keep popping up. All this trouble just to find a cat! Aside from the Alice videogames, there are very few psychological horror games that maintain this kind of darkly humorous yet intense tone so if any of this intrigues you, check it out.","February 14","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanonion/recommended/362680/","bryanonion","bryanonion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanonion/","293 products in account","(Review originally published  here on Gamemoir[gamemoir.com].)\n\nI am one of the most forgiving critics I can think of. Knowing how difficult game development is, I am quite willing to admire what a game does right over complaining of what it does wrong. As long as the developers have put evident enthusiasm and heart into the title—think Deadly Premonition or Sanitarium for instance—I find it much more gratifying to exercise a little patience and sift the gold out of the muck.\n\nIn the growing category of deeply personal indie games, though, I find this practice increasingly difficult. See, in creating a deeply personal game developers tend to make the narrative overly metaphorical and obtuse. I encountered this most recently in the RPG Maker phantasmagoria Stray Cat Crossing. Here the metaphors and the vague story took away from the experience, made it more difficult to connect to on an emotional level. As connecting emotionally ought to be one of the key ambitions of these personal indies, making it purposely impenetrable seems a self-defeating design choice.\n\nIn short, I am apprehensive when approaching narrative-driven games with an ambiguous plot. Killmonday Game's Fran Bow is certainly one of these. The feelings, as always, are mixed. By and large it is a great game, but whether or not it would be improved by a clearer story is a question that has been at the forefront of my mind since completion.\n\nFran Bow is the story of the titular character, a young girl who is shipped off to a children's mental asylum after her parents are brutally murdered. And without even getting the chance to say goodbye to her cat! Deeply unhappy, lonely, missing her feline friend and experiencing strange hallucinations from the drugs she is ordered to take, Fran sets out to escape the asylum. From there her journey features—but is not limited to—creepy forest animals, malicious conjoined twin sisters, a charming skeleton man, abominations beyond the ken of humanity and talking root vegetables.\n\nNow, Fran Bow takes an Alice in Wonderland turn after its first chapter. This was jarring to me as a player, I was expecting something much more grounded in reality. Yet I have never been one to let my expectations get in the way of my enjoyment of something, so I went along for the ride.\n\nFrom the outset, Fran Bow is full of beautiful visuals, ranging from the horrific to the quixotic. The Tim Burton-style art is charming and varied, showcasing a talent as qualified for saccharine-sweet scenes and Silent Hill-tier grotesqueness. Fran Bow is at its heart a visual experience, a sort of interactive storybook with clever puzzles. Certain brief interludes (one a platformer, one a maze and another a Frogger clone) take advantage of claymation—the original presentation style of the never-completed film Fran Bow is based upon—and other art styles. It is all a hodgepodge of settings, themes and styles, both dark and childlike—a sort of smorgasbord for the artist's talents. One genuinely gets the sense of joy in each scene, whether it be pretty or creepy—the joy of an artist making something they want to make.\n\nYet the problem with these varied settings is this: How do they come together in a plot? Well, I have been building up, the execution doesn't quite give everything the player needs to really experience the story. There are common themes among each location—everywhere you travel is, for instance, located on small islands—but the narrative makes great stretches to achieve continuity. An entire mythology is introduced to explain the greatly disparate nature of each location. The lines between reality and fiction blur.\n\nWhile it does make an acceptable amount of sense by the end of Fran Bow, the game begins to lose its focus on Fran Bow herself. In crafting all these brilliant worlds, getting lost in their terror and wonder, Fran herself gradually gets pushed into the background. Her story, the story we set out to experience, gets muddled by so many other elements that the game introduces after we first leave the asylum.\n\nIn the end, Fran's story becomes deeply ambiguous. What is real and what is fiction? This reality-screwing is a purposeful theme for Killmonday, yet it doesn't quite reach the coherence it needs to be fully fleshed out. Fran Bow perhaps bites off more than it can chew—introducing many wonderful elements but never combining them satisfactorily. After a few chapters, Fran Bow starts to feel patched together. Her story is a network of psychological horror, children's fantasy, V.C. Andrews and surrealism.\n\nI don't believe that Fran Bow is one of those games who tells an ambiguous plot just because the developers couldn't find a way to tell it clearly. No, there was clearly more heartfelt intention behind this title. For that it earns a great deal of respect, for it is rare for a developer to create a game with such a personal and emotionally-charged vision in mind.\n\nThe main problem here is that this vision branches in many directions. We've got Fran's character development branch, her connection to her cat branch, the mystery of her parents' murder branch, the "What's the deal with these drugs they prescribed to Fran?" branch, the mysterious new worlds she visits branch... All of them are good. None of them are given enough attention. By the end the player isn't quite sure which branch we've finally landed on, or indeed if these branches work together at all.","October 24, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game holds a very creepy dreamlike atmosphere and doesn't use the basic jump scare tatic to keep it unsettling. I will say certain parts of the game are a little cliche, i.e: insane asylum,creepy little girl, shadow monsters. But it also introduces very interesting "creatures", and game mechanics that help separate it from others. The pill mechanic being one of the more prominent mechanics, allows the player to see the game in two different perspectives. The game is also very linear, when given a choice in a conversation it will usually give you the same "ending" without much diversity, with the exception of a couple. But I don't feel that really detracted me when playing the game. The campaign takes about 5-7 hours long to complete and it took me about 10 to get 100% complete. That being said I recommend getting the game while it's on sale as they are asking $15 bucks for the game.\n\nStory: 8/10\nSound: 9/10 (Eerie piano music for the most part, you can buy the soundtrack for $5 although I don't recommend it unless dissonant piano tracks are what you enjoy to listen to in your free time.)\nGraphics: 8/10\nScare Level: 7/10 (It's fairly mild, but still spooky)\nReplayabiliy: 5/10 (Not really meant to be replayed unless you want to experience the story again)\nOverall: 8/10","December 12, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very well done horror / puzzle game. I'm gonna play again to get the achievements I missed.  Beware: it's dark, gory, and depicts evil witchcraft and magic, which I know will turn off some people. The trailer makes it look like a kid's cartoon, but it's most certainly not a kid's cartoon. Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, though some of them are a little counter-intuitive ("I know I need to buy thread to fix the fishing rod and I have plenty of gold coins, but that's not a dialog option.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968879466/recommended/362680/","76561197968879466","RedButton","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968879466/","74 products in account","I've never written a review before, but seeing this is my first foray into a game that is both made recently and made by somebody who might actually take a cue from a review, I thought it worthwhile to jot down my thoughts. This is also my first adventure game I have ever played, so my thoughts may reflect that more than I realize.\n\nThis will be spoiler-y, but not explicitly so.\n\n\nFirst, the good. The game is a solid length and at no point feels rushed. Fran is a genuinely likeable and sympathetic child whose deep affection for her cat is something anyone with a childhood pet can relate to. Wonderful music. It often made me think of Phil Glass and his work on Koyaanisqatsi. Great animations and a very pleasing visual style. One sympathizes with Fran and finds her a pretty believeable character. She is perhaps a little desensetized to the horror she sees and reacts in a surprisingly sanguine manner, but youth and trauma will do that. In this type of game the story is going to make or break it, and I am happy to report that Fran Bow delivers a wonderful story.\n\nThe bad: The game's tone shifts substantially between Acts. It begins as an intense and surreal horror game. In the first Act you are in a harsh and austere asylum which is creepy enough, but when Fran takes the pills she is transported to a nightmare version of her current surroundings with body horror and surrealism as the main themes. Later, the game shifts into a fairy tale land overflowing with innocence and charity. I kept expecting the evil Fran had previously encountered to horribly corrupt or invade the land--the doctor Paltronas makes mention of this--but that never seems to be the case, aside from a few brief fever dream moments. We never return to the same tone as the first Act, even though we do return to that same physical location, it's never quite as menacing.\n\nThe biggest criticism of Fran Bow is that it has a fundamentally inconsistent tone. Characters can and should change, but that doesn't happen. Instead the evolution is with the tone and underlying facts of the story, which makes Fran the character seem as if she is somewhat adrift and unconnected to the story and thus more difficult to relate to. Fran is the only character with any development, and her lack of evolution is a large misstep that actually seems pretty avoidable: Fran learns more about her place in the universe and her special nature, so just have her develop a firm attitude towards that--embrace or reject. Bam! You've got a charater arc.\n\nThe ending is hit or miss for most and it's a miss for me. The human story wrapped up nicely but the overarching arc of Fran and her relation to her "special" place in the unviersal is not wrapped up. This would be fine, but I don't even have any idea where they go once the game is done. Back to the fairy tale land to become a farmer or something? Back to Earth? Also, Itward is introduced in a somewhat cursory manner. I would like to do another chapter or something with him, build the relation a bit more so I can know whether to trust him. He's "gray," and presumably as capable of betraying or harming Fran as he is helping.\n\nThe dialogue options are non-existent and only serve to offer an exit to a boring or repreated conversation. Anything else is illusory.\n\nThe indifferent: whether Fran is actually seeing different realities or is suffering from a profound mental breakdown is not clear. I am inclined to think that she is actually seeing different realities, but it's possible she is not. The ratio of exposition to puzzles is a bit thin, and since no items are irrelevant--by which I mean every item you can pick up is going to be part of a puzzle--you're taught to blindly pick up everything you see without consideration as to its particular purpose. This may be the nature of an adventure game, though, so it's not in the "bad." Also, the puzzles can be a bit obtuse in their solutions, so be forewarned. But again, that just may be an adventure game thing.\n\nDon't let the ratio of ink spilled over the good vs bad vs indifferent throw you. I tremendously enjoyed this game and found it a rewarding and enjoyable experience. I look forward to the next game from these same creators.","February 25","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not even done the game and it's blowing me away. This game probably tops my list of point and click games I've ever played.\nThe music is amazing, the stories are creepy and sometimes very scary and disturbing, artwork is 11/10 in my eyes, reminds me of old Angela Anaconda and that was a decent part of my childhood as well.\nThe fact that this game dwellls around mental illness/disorders/murders is actually amazing, honestly what games have you played recently that almost ALWAYS makes you have different perspectives on every single character/npc you come across?\nThe puzzles are actually pretty simple but of course there are times everyone is a complete idiot and misses the easiest solution to things, there are times where you will be stumped, and I think that's probably one of the best parts of the game, the attention to detail and the hints you get through different conversations or Fran just making comments in her head will make you think on how you need to progress.\nMight update this once I actually finish the game but for now I'm already gonna say that if a sequel is coming to Fran Bow, I WILL be buying it.","January 28","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I don't actually play very many as I get bored quick) I sat through and played this all in one sitting because it had me hooked. It deals with dark topics like mental illness, sexual abuse, self harm in the beginning but later on you end up in just another world and it doesn't even feel like the same game you started out in. (Literally) It just sucks you in and you want to keep finding out more and more. I ended up feeling a sense of comfort with some of the characters and by the end of the game I was so touched and almost wanted to cry because it was all over.

If you're reading this and you don't mind a bit (maybe a lot, depends on you're fear tolarence) of nightmares: Buy this game. The game isn't just about gore and violence, there are alot of meanings behind it, worthy meanings of life and emotions and who we are and who we choose to be and how we face our fears. There are some pretty funny parts too so yah. So, the main goal of this review, as I sit here after just finishing the game at 5:21 in the morning with teary eyes, knowing that I should probably sleep instead of writing this probably unecessary review bc i have lectures tomorrow, I will just say; Buy it. Gosh darn buy it or so help me... I will buy it for you. Jks i have no money ._. but its worth the money so buy it you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/recommended/362680/","b-rom","b-rom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/","477 products in account","Quick first line summary:  I really enjoyed this game, and would recommend it with very little hesitation.\n\nGameplay\nIt’s a point and click adventure game.  So you gather items from the various screens you can access and you use those items on characters or objects in the area to get access to more screens where you do more of the same.  This is pretty standard fare, so unless you have never played one before you already know how this works.  I will say that the puzzles are very logical for this sort of game, and the few times I got stuck it was entirely because of my own mistakes.\n\nVisual Style\nThe visual look of the game is delightful.  I loved all the character art, and the locations were convincing and immersive.  If you are turned off by gore and upsetting imagery you might want to give this one a miss.  I found that the cartoony look offset the violence depicted, so it didn’t bother me, but I know I would advise my mother to stick to more light hearted stuff.  I did really like the spookiness of it all, and the odd moment where they decided to depict something particularly grotesque kept me always waiting for what would come next.\n\nStory\nPoint and click adventure games seem to be the place to go for story these days.  Fran Bow’s story kept me strung along for the entire ride.  I liked what they did with some characters, the surprises they dropped here and there.  There wasn’t really any plot twists or sudden shifts of character that just came out of the blue and left me disbelieving.  Everything could, and was, explained with context and perspective to make sense.  Having said all that, there is one aspect of the story that I would need to say is this games weakest point, and unfortunately that is the ending.  I’m not going to spoil anything specifically, but if you want to experience the game completely blind, you might as well skip the next paragraph.\n\nFor the entire game there was one massive looming adversary with infrequent hints of shadow players in the wings.  When the final chapters rolled around that adversary just disappeared and was replaced with new ones at the last minute who were just as quickly bumped off in the most contrived way possible and then the game ended.  Just like that.  After all the build-up, all the hidden hints, all the vague clues to various possible twists and various possible conclusions, and all the uncertainty about how it could possibly work out well in the end, all the loose ends are just gathered up all at once and tied into one big deus ex machina bow.\n\nFinal Word\nMy final word on it echoes my first words.  I do highly recommend this game.  It has a few flaws, but it is an entrant in my library that I’m happy to have there.  It does make me want to check out other things this developer brings to the table.","March 22","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No sassy one-liners, or pop culture references, but instead a realistic protrayal of a ten year old's sense of wonder and exitement, and fear of the unknown.\n\nCons:\n-After chapter two, the story goes off the ♥♥♥♥ing rails\n-Chapter three was way too long, and ruined the pacing of the story.\n-The ending leaves too many questions unanswered, and feels a little abrupt.\n\nSummary:\nEven if the story gets a little confusing, the great gameplay, and cool visuals are totally worth your money.","December 15, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is also my first adventure game I have ever played, so my thoughts may reflect that more than I realize.\n\nThis will be spoiler-y, but not explicitly so.\n\n\nFirst, the good. The game is a solid length and at no point feels rushed. Fran is a genuinely likeable and sympathetic child whose deep affection for her cat is something anyone with a childhood pet can relate to. Wonderful music. It often made me think of Phil Glass and his work on Koyaanisqatsi. Great animations and a very pleasing visual style. One sympathizes with Fran and finds her a pretty believeable character. She is perhaps a little desensetized to the horror she sees and reacts in a surprisingly sanguine manner, but youth and trauma will do that. In this type of game the story is going to make or break it, and I am happy to report that Fran Bow delivers a wonderful story.\n\nThe bad: The game's tone shifts substantially between Acts. It begins as an intense and surreal horror game. In the first Act you are in a harsh and austere asylum which is creepy enough, but when Fran takes the pills she is transported to a nightmare version of her current surroundings with body horror and surrealism as the main themes. Later, the game shifts into a fairy tale land overflowing with innocence and charity. I kept expecting the evil Fran had previously encountered to horribly corrupt or invade the land--the doctor Paltronas makes mention of this--but that never seems to be the case, aside from a few brief fever dream moments. We never return to the same tone as the first Act, even though we do return to that same physical location, it's never quite as menacing.\n\nThe biggest criticism of Fran Bow is that it has a fundamentally inconsistent tone. Characters can and should change, but that doesn't happen. Instead the evolution is with the tone and underlying facts of the story, which makes Fran the character seem as if she is somewhat adrift and unconnected to the story and thus more difficult to relate to. Fran is the only character with any development, and her lack of evolution is a large misstep that actually seems pretty avoidable: Fran learns more about her place in the universe and her special nature, so just have her develop a firm attitude towards that--embrace or reject. Bam! You've got a charater arc.\n\nThe ending is hit or miss for most and it's a miss for me. The human story wrapped up nicely but the overarching arc of Fran and her relation to her "special" place in the unviersal is not wrapped up. This would be fine, but I don't even have any idea where they go once the game is done. Back to the fairy tale land to become a farmer or something? Back to Earth? Also, Itward is introduced in a somewhat cursory manner. I would like to do another chapter or something with him, build the relation a bit more so I can know whether to trust him. He's "gray," and presumably as capable of betraying or harming Fran as he is helping.\n\nThe dialogue options are non-existent and only serve to offer an exit to a boring or repreated conversation. Anything else is illusory.\n\nThe indifferent: whether Fran is actually seeing different realities or is suffering from a profound mental breakdown is not clear. I am inclined to think that she is actually seeing different realities, but it's possible she is not. The ratio of exposition to puzzles is a bit thin, and since no items are irrelevant--by which I mean every item you can pick up is going to be part of a puzzle--you're taught to blindly pick up everything you see without consideration as to its particular purpose. This may be the nature of an adventure game, though, so it's not in the "bad." Also, the puzzles can be a bit obtuse in their solutions, so be forewarned. But again, that just may be an adventure game thing.\n\nDon't let the ratio of ink spilled over the good vs bad vs indifferent throw you. I tremendously enjoyed this game and found it a rewarding and enjoyable experience. I look forward to the next game from these same creators.","February 25","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Donar23/recommended/362680/","Donar23","Donar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Donar23/","408 products in account","I am simply impressed by this game. It's basically the work of two people, not counting translations, so I though it would be really short but it actually took me about 8-9 hours to finish, which is totally fine for that price. I got stuck sometimes, so I could've finished it faster but well, being stuck is part of Point and Click games.\n\nThe art style is really nice. It's cute but disturbing at the same time.  The creators must have some really weird thoughts, which is a great thing for a game designer. It was simply creative and when I thought I saw everything, it surprised me with something I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe creators did a really good job here and everyone who likes Point and Click games or just enjoys art that mixes blood and cotton candy shoud definitely play this game.\n\nThe only cons of this game are the small, upscaled resolution and the missing voice acting. The small resolution might be result of the art creation or something like that. The missing voice acting is understandable in two people project with probably low budget. For a game like this, it's totally fine and understandable - it is great art but not really complicated software.","December 7, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You speculate what's going on, why you are in this world, and what really happening.  It honestly kept me on my mental toes the entire time.\n\n2) The horror and thriller side of the game is definitely there.  It makes the player feel that in this world, bad things are going to happen, and they usually do.\n\n3) The controls are easy (as to expect by a point and click game), but I honestly didn't feel that they got old or overused.  It was a great choice for a game like this.\n\n4) The music and voices (when there are some) are definitely on point.  I found myself being more aware of my souroundings whenever weird music or noises would appear.  It really puts the player in the world.\n\n5?)Cats are cute :D\n\nCons:\n\nI only have three problems with the game.\n\n1) I thought it was too short.  I wanted more of the story.  More things to click on and maybe even more interaction with characters.  It had an awesome world, and I don't feel that there was enough in it to fill it.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles were actually too hard for me.  I had to end up looking up guides online just to find something I didn't click on that was totally obscure or to find out the my ideas weren't working even though it seemed like they would (common sense stuff).\n\n3) With that in mind, I think there should have been a "Choices matter" system that way the player could feel more in control of our creations and consequences.  At times it felt linear, "do this puzzle, get this whatever".  If they added in different endings or different choices/consequences, it would have really addded depth to this already great world.\n\nWith all of that said, I give this game a strong 7/10.  I would definitely play it again, and my friends loved watching me play this as well.  I just wish there was more to find out!","December 9, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes inspiration from Alice in Wonderland and twists it with horror aspects and gore to paint a terrifyingly beautiful picture. You play as a little girl named Fran Bow, who is trapped in a mental asylum after the brutal death of her parents. Your only goal is to escape and find your pet kitty Mr. Midnight. The question is how to do it... and figuring out the meaning of seeing things no-one else can see. Let's just say you need to take the red pill every once in a while.\n\nThe story from what I've gathered after three straight hours of play thus far is fairly simplistic, almost like a children's fairytale... albeit a fairytale definitely made for adults and NOT kids (seriously do NOT buy this game for your kids! Despite its cutesy artstyle there is a ton of disturbing/bloody/gory imagery throughout that can be very frightening.)\n\nSome of my favorite aspects of the game are the little nods to various old school games found within minigames played throughout the point and click tale. There's a maze minigame similar to Pac-Man, a river crossing game that's basically a repaint of Frogger, and a few others I have yet to see. As the game is a point and click adventure there is no customization or RPG style elements aside from collecting various items and combining them in various ways to help you throughout your journey.\n\nWhat truly makes this game unique is the mix of disturbing gore and story elements with the adorable, storybook artstyle. The result is a beautiful game with tons of little details that require a couple playthroughs or so to understand everything. However once clues are pieced together you'll find yourself going "Ah-hah!" and even getting surprised at some of the twists and turns.\n\nThen there's the truly disturbing parts; the blood, gore, and the true fate of the children in the asylum. Many of the children housed there have very sad, very creepy backstories which can be discovered by using the red pills to see the true insanity beneath the surface. Sometimes the results can be nauseating to say the least. This is a game that doesn't pull punches with the gore though what makes it frightening is how it makes you think. The fear in this game is all psychological - which is quite fitting considering the setting.\n\nOverall this is a game that I recommend to both horror fans and those looking for something a little different from the norm. I'm not sure if it is worth the $15 price tag, but the art is a definite selling point as is the detailed story. Give it a try, and always be aware that YOU CAN SEE.\n\n","December 9, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A great gateway game if you're trying to get into gaming more as the plot will definitely reel you in; while the ability to stop and start playing this game at any time (thanks to the auto-save feature) is apealing to casual gamers who may only wish to play for short periods. Likewise this game is a great play for those who can only play in short bursts, but trust me you'll want to play each chapter through to the end once you've started!\n\nThe art style, dialogue, and BGM all create a deep eerie atomsphere from the get go, with things getting even more twisted and grotesque as the game progresses. Fran will occasionally make creepy comments about items, lending to the themes of mental health, murder and psychosis that feature prominently in this game.\n\nIt's easy to draw parallels between Fran Bow and Alice in Wonderland - indeed Fran seems to be friends with Alice in the in game universe - but such allusion is a positive as it's always interesting to see where creators have pulled inspiration from.\n\nI've already recommended this game to all my irl friends and I strongly recommend this to you, random stranger, as well.\nI'm certain you'll enjoy many an hour searching for answers alongside Fran if you decide to pick up this game.","January 14","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Her cat has gone missing and she believes she needs to rescue him from the monsters. Or does she? Are the evil monsters real and the lives of her and her cat are in danger? or is it all a mass dillusion? It is your job as the player to descover the truth. The truth behind the murder, the truth behind the monsters OR dillusions, and the truth behind the meaning of reality itslef.\n\nIf you are a fan of the fast paced action commonly seen in most games today and not a fan of puzzle solving, you would not enjoy the game at all; Fran Bow is a point and click adventure that personally took me up to an hour and a half just to solve one puzzle. But If you are in for an emotional ride like no other that will bend the laws of what you thought was reality leaving your mind blown and heart touched? Boy are you in for something outstanding that no other game can offer!\n\nI will leave this review SPOILER-FREE, but I do have to say that this game had an ending that left me pondering, questioning, theorizing, and reflecting on life as I know it for weeks and weeks after I had finally beat it. This is one of those games that makes you think and question everything that is happening in the storyline, because just when you think you understand the mystery, it pulls another mind-bending clue or plot twist every time again and again until the very end. So prepare to have your mind blown even more times than you die in dark souls or cat mario.\n\nThis game managed to stump me for hours, set a new standard for my levels of comprehension, and get me teary on multiple occasions. Fran Bow is less of a "game", and more of an emotional experiance. I do NOT recomend watching a youtube let's play unless you really need someone to hold your hand through the jumpscares with the powers of a couple laughs. This game is best played alone, with the lights off, door closed, and fullest attention payed towards the story. This game creates endless confusion, anxiety, suspision, wonder, and curiosity like nothing else, but it all [sorta] makes sense in the end: and that's why I consider this game to be such an outstanding artistic example of how there is in fact such thing as beauty in darkness.","January 18","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is definitely creepy, but isn't just a bunch of cheap jumpscares that are scary for, like, 2 seconds and then are stale. It consistantly kept me engaged, always offering a reason to keep playing even though it was like 2:00 AM and I was really tired. It was full of interesting twists that kept me turning over material, whether it was new or old. And in the end, that's what makes it so beautiful. It makes you think. The game itself doesn't give alot of hints or anwsers as to what's real and what to trust, especially with the added question of Duotine. It's really left up to you to detirmine what you are going to say is real, and what is a product of her psychosis. The theorizing is immense, and that's awesome. i myself have a theory paper that's, like, 24 pages long and growing, as I keep thinking of new possibilities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicalwall/recommended/362680/","mechanicalwall","MechanicalWall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicalwall/","54 products in account","Did you like Silent Hill 2?\n\nDo you like fetch quests and point & click adventure games?\n\nNo? Then ♥♥♥♥ off, 'cause you're gonna hate this game. If you love that stuff, then this is your game of the year right here. And that's your tl;dr.\n\nFor those of you that are still here, this game is amazing and more than worth the seemingly hefty fifteen dollar asking price. I mention Silent Hill 2 for a reason, because this game evokes that same concept of partaking in a macabre adventure in an effort to overcome grief and some other spoiler-y emotions, and come to some sense of self-realization. Without spoiling, this is a game where you need to take everything you see with a grain of salt, because it deals very heavily with methaporical imagery and situations.\n\nThe writing, probably the cornerstone of every adventure game, is actually childisly simple and frank, but in an endearing way rather than the 'the writer looks up to George Lucas as a role model' kind of way. It's certainly appropriate, considering you're playing a ten-year old girl. Despite being dialogue-heavy, this is one of those cases where there's a lot of showing rather than telling, i.e. the good way to do video game story-telling. To get a firm grasp of the plot. paying attention to the visuals and environment is just as important as actually reading what characters are saying. None of this is to say the characters are poorly written and realized, though; Fran's interactions with her kitty and various other people are charming enough that you'll very quickly warm up to both her and whoever she's talking too.\n\nBut to go back to how this game compares to Silent Hill 2, what's the other fundamental pillar of an adventure game? Yeah, get ready for some ♥♥♥♥ing fetch quests. This isn't one of those 'baby's first point-and-click' games that Telltale likes to make so much, where your key to progression is in plain sight and practically begging you to pick it up. Oh no, get ready to wear out you left mouse button as you furiously pound on every object in the game that could conceivably cough up some sort of item.\n\nIt's admittedly almost parodic how much characters refuse to help you unless you give them some dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; the game is hardly subversive in the gameplay department. There's no 'moon logic' at work here, though, as it's never ambigious as to what you're fetching or how you can get it. This might actually let some veteran adventure gamers down, because your tasks are never particularly difficult to fulfill. Still, there's something to be said for how insane some of the fetching can get. There's one point in the game where you need to do four fetch quests in order to complete another fetch quest, which turns out to be the key for another fetch quest. The layers of fetch quest in this portion of the game are insane, and definitely the low point of the experience. Still, it's in the middle, and leads to some of the best portions of the story.\n\nAnd to wrap up some miscellanious stuff, the artwork is so good that it can easily portray both the grotesque and the cute stuff without either looking too out of place in the game. The art actually reminds me a lot of Broken Age, and as an aside, holy ♥♥♥♥ is this the level of imagination and thematic intelligence that Double Fine should've been aiming for with those fat stacks of Kickstarter money, instead of the garbage they actually put out. The music is pretty good for what it is, which is setting up the mood and atmosphere. The sound design is amazing as well, and like Silent Hill 2 (you probably should be taking shots at this point), highlights just how important good sound design can be for games like this. Every drip of water, every creak, every distant moan, and every naseuating squish helps build tension in all the right places.\n\nOh, and in case you couldn't tell from the screenshots, trailer, or my review, this game isn't for the faint of heart. Don't let the age of the protagonist fool you: there is some seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ here, and I'm not just talking about gore. That's ♥♥♥♥♥ stuff. I won't spill any details, but by Chapter 2 Part II you'll know exactly what I mean.\n\nAll this to say, it's a phenomenal game concerned with the heart-breaking exploration of the mind of a broken little girl, but it juxtaposes the gloom and doom with some levity and hope. It's only really hampered with an overreliance on fetch quests, but that's hardly a detriment to people who like this sort of game. If it weren't for the Witcher 3, this would easily be my Game of the Year; as is, it certainly is the Best Indie of the year, and the best in a long time as well.","December 25, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/recommended/362680/","b-rom","b-rom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b-rom/","477 products in account","Quick first line summary:  I really enjoyed this game, and would recommend it with very little hesitation.\n\nGameplay\nIt’s a point and click adventure game.  So you gather items from the various screens you can access and you use those items on characters or objects in the area to get access to more screens where you do more of the same.  This is pretty standard fare, so unless you have never played one before you already know how this works.  I will say that the puzzles are very logical for this sort of game, and the few times I got stuck it was entirely because of my own mistakes.\n\nVisual Style\nThe visual look of the game is delightful.  I loved all the character art, and the locations were convincing and immersive.  If you are turned off by gore and upsetting imagery you might want to give this one a miss.  I found that the cartoony look offset the violence depicted, so it didn’t bother me, but I know I would advise my mother to stick to more light hearted stuff.  I did really like the spookiness of it all, and the odd moment where they decided to depict something particularly grotesque kept me always waiting for what would come next.\n\nStory\nPoint and click adventure games seem to be the place to go for story these days.  Fran Bow’s story kept me strung along for the entire ride.  I liked what they did with some characters, the surprises they dropped here and there.  There wasn’t really any plot twists or sudden shifts of character that just came out of the blue and left me disbelieving.  Everything could, and was, explained with context and perspective to make sense.  Having said all that, there is one aspect of the story that I would need to say is this games weakest point, and unfortunately that is the ending.  I’m not going to spoil anything specifically, but if you want to experience the game completely blind, you might as well skip the next paragraph.\n\nFor the entire game there was one massive looming adversary with infrequent hints of shadow players in the wings.  When the final chapters rolled around that adversary just disappeared and was replaced with new ones at the last minute who were just as quickly bumped off in the most contrived way possible and then the game ended.  Just like that.  After all the build-up, all the hidden hints, all the vague clues to various possible twists and various possible conclusions, and all the uncertainty about how it could possibly work out well in the end, all the loose ends are just gathered up all at once and tied into one big deus ex machina bow.\n\nFinal Word\nMy final word on it echoes my first words.  I do highly recommend this game.  It has a few flaws, but it is an entrant in my library that I’m happy to have there.  It does make me want to check out other things this developer brings to the table.","March 22","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lovely game in which every surprise leaves you stunned and wondering what's next. It's interesting, peculiar, and mind-bending in some aspects. Fran Bow is a very story rich game with an excellent soundtrack. However, the game is not for everyone. There are references and images in the game depicting self harm, sexual abuse, hallucinations, death, pedophilia, witchcraft, and body horror. The game is also heavily centered around mental illness. There are also a few minor jump scares, but nothing too severe. If any of these things are triggering to you, then Fran Bow is not the game for you.

The game's concepts reminded me of the Alice games (which are also great games, imo) in that the world that the character sees is twisted compared to "reality" as we would normally know it, but the game itself stands out on its own with its own memorable art, gameplay, story, and characters.\n\nIts a point and click adventure game that doesn't hold your hand the entire time. There are no quest markers/lines and no text indicating an objective. You have to figure things out based on clues/cues you get from the world/characters around you. Some things are obvious, others are not, at least not at first, so you will miss some things if you rush through it too quickly. That said, it is not a long or very hard game to play. You are very likely to complete the entire game rather quickly, even if you are aiming to get all the game's achievements (it took me close to 13 hours to do this, but it can be done much quicker than that). However, this is one of those games that is best played slowly.","January 4","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it's a point and click adventure... and because of that I'd be lying if I didn't say that I think part of the draw of this game is a nostalgic one. If the genre isn't your thing, you probably won't like Fran Bow. But, if you can at least tolerate point and click adventures you'll probably get a kick out of this game given that you pay the right price.\n\nThe best thing about the game is probably the art style. The whole game just feels so lovingly hand crafted and the art is executed in just the right ways to build atmosphere. It really helps hit home the feeling of hopelessness involved with Fran's mental hardships. The story is enjoyable, but I would say the experience is far more reliant upon aesthetics above everything else. The story uses a lot of common tropes and in some way feels a bit cliche for the type of story it is. I'm not to say there's anything wrong with that, but it's just something you should probably know going in.\n\nThe one other thing I'd say is I ended up having to use a walkthrough a few times to solve puzzles. I wouldn't necessarily say that the puzzles are "hard", I think it was more of the case of me forgetting how to think in that "point and click mindset". There were a few times where a solution would involve doing something where I would think to myself "Huh, I didn't think the game would let me do that."\n","January 13","true","7.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

A great gateway game if you're trying to get into gaming more as the plot will definitely reel you in; while the ability to stop and start playing this game at any time (thanks to the auto-save feature) is apealing to casual gamers who may only wish to play for short periods. Likewise this game is a great play for those who can only play in short bursts, but trust me you'll want to play each chapter through to the end once you've started!\n\nThe art style, dialogue, and BGM all create a deep eerie atomsphere from the get go, with things getting even more twisted and grotesque as the game progresses. Fran will occasionally make creepy comments about items, lending to the themes of mental health, murder and psychosis that feature prominently in this game.\n\nIt's easy to draw parallels between Fran Bow and Alice in Wonderland - indeed Fran seems to be friends with Alice in the in game universe - but such allusion is a positive as it's always interesting to see where creators have pulled inspiration from.\n\nI've already recommended this game to all my irl friends and I strongly recommend this to you, random stranger, as well.\nI'm certain you'll enjoy many an hour searching for answers alongside Fran if you decide to pick up this game.","January 14","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art and music, while not impressive for the genre, are nicely put together and well in line with the ''troubled child's mind'' theme. Character designs are creative, ranging from paranoid to cute and benevolent-looking, and the looping tracks are short but impactful. Fran Bow's story, which is very roughly The Faun's Labyrinth meets American McGee's Alice, works best if the mind of the player is that of a kid's while the adventure lasts (I've clocked almost 7 hours so far and there's no end in sight).\n\nWhile I'm enjoying this little game, there are downsides. Having no voice acting adds nothing to the experience; it doesn't make anything creepier or more mysterious. Everything would have been much better with it (though I understand voice talent is hard for a two-person team to get). The plot gets more whimsical as one goes, but consider the last sentence of the previous paragraph. Also, some item/environment combnations are unintuitive to the point of mild annoyance, although they are done in moderation and are acceptable as a challenge. The real flaw, for me, is not being able to take screenshots without a workaround. That I can live with.\n\nLikely only worth full price for point-and-click enthusiasts (not a big one myself). If on sale for around half the price, give or take, I'd very much recommend it as long as it's not the first game of the style you will ever play (as there are undoubtedly better ones, but they're not similar to Fran Bow). It's also not reccomended for very young children. And of course, if you need any childhood traumas sorted out... like that one time you found your mom and dad unrecognizably butchered in the living room...\n\n...well, then it's a gamble...","May 10","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It was engaging and the constant shifting of the worlds and such kept me questioning. I honestly still wonder if it was real or not.\nGraphics were nice, the aesthetics in place were interesting. The Istherans ( I think I spelled that right ) were really nicely done.\n\nOnly qualms are the soundtrack and bits of the gameplay.\nThe soundtrack was too... Loop'd for me, personally.

Fran Bow's universe overall is surprisingly well-developed and very obviously is made of the stuff of both dreams and nightmares, as well as of real world horrors like child abuse, self-harm, pedophilia, and the very real inhumane experiments performed on patients locked within mental institutions. Along with the setting, its layers of multiple realities make for a fun game mechanic that nicely complements the exploratory elements of a point-and-click.\n\nThe writers did an amazing job of portraying Fran as a realistic child - earnest, naive, curious, and above all, resilient. She looks into the eyes of creatures that would make most adults turn and run, and she smiles and says hello because she has not yet been conditioned to fear such things. This makes her the perfect person with which to explore the setting and story of Fran Bow.\n\nSpeaking of, the game's story manages to be compelling and unexpected through all five of its chapters, introducing you to twisted authority figures and unexpected allies. Fran Bow plays with your trust, both with Fran's relationships with other characters and with its major themes: What is real and what isn't? Who is good and who is evil? (The answer is often not what you would traditionally expect.)\n\nYet instead of leaving players to question the ambiguous sanity and morals of the protagonist, as many psychological horror pieces do, it paints a picture of a child whose brain does not work like others' and yet is still kind and pure. Unlike others in its genre, Fran Bow is never an indictment of the mentally disordered. The monsters in the story are not Fran - they are the people trying to hurt her because of what she can see. Instead, Fran is the hero, her own hero. That is an important and powerful message, one that needs to be told more often.\n\nThe most noticeable weak point of the game for me was a few rather unintuitive puzzles. I consulted some walkthroughs and occassionally found myself wondering how on Earth a player was supposed to figure out a particular solution on their own without wildly trying to combine every object in their inventory with every part of the environment. This is something a lot of point-and-click games struggle with, Fran Bow being no different. Still, it wasn't as bad as, say, some of the later Myst games.\n\nMechanics wise, I didn't appreciate having to guess where my game had last auto-saved. With puzzle games, it's especially important not to lose progress and risk having to solve a complex puzzle all over again. I ended up playing to the end of chapters before quitting, just to be safe.\n\nI will say that the soundtrack was underwhelming as well. The only place where I really noticed it was in the Ultrareality reception area because the casual elevator music really sold the humor of such an odd stop along the storyline. Because of this, I did find myself wishing the game were voice-acted so I would have something interesting to listen to, but I understand that budget limitations would make that an unreasonable request.\n\nFran Bow's art is beautiful, with a gothic style that lends itself well to both the cute and the terrifying. I'm incredibly disappointed that my Steam screenshot function didn't seem to be working during playthrough.\n\nFinal note: The black cat in the game is pure of heart and does not die. I want to personally thank the developers for that. The good black cat fits nicely with the subversion of the crazy little girl trope, and the fact that Fran got to be with Mr. Midnight and her other friends in the end made for exactly the kind of happy ending I believe most players would wish for her.","May 8","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is probably fantastic for people who like this this type of game because I never play point and clicks and I never play horror games ( I'm a big scaredy cat ), yet I still enjoyed this game quite a lot.","May 28","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A beautifully executed and well illustrated point and click adventure game. you are Fran Bow, a young girl in a mental hospital whom last remembers opening her parents room and seeing their severed bodies in pools of their own blood. The gameplay relies on its main mechanic that allows you to switch between dimensions. Eating a supposed anti-psychotic red pill lets you walk in a demented version of our world with death and dark shadows manipulating the living. The graphics are thought out and definitely created by an imaginative artist, which is always a pleasure to see individual art styles in games. The music is there mainly to set mood, and in a game like this you really can't have crazy heavy metal beats or fast paced drum and bass. With that in mind the music and sound effects in general are well suited for this type of game, especialy when it comes to achievieving a dark mood. So I think if you like point and click adventure games you should definitely play this one.\n\nGraphics: 5/5\n\nThe artist obviously cared about making this game pretty and unique.\n\nSound: 5/5\n\nCreepy and eerie, the sound perfectly matches the mood of the whole game.\n\nControl: 5/5\n\nClick and play. With a very nice and comprehensive interface.\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\nIf you like point and click, this is a good one that brings you in with its art and its awesome story.","May 29","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is quite unique, the universe and concept art for the differnt "parts" of the game are very cool, the "still" images are sometimes of variable quality but that shouldn't deter you from playing.\nOverall it's rather an easy point and click, the puzzle logic is sometimes a bit farfetched (as any good point and clik game) but the amount of possible interaction/combination limits the difficulty.\n","May 31","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Control is simple point and click mehanism but it works. Puzzels are original and can be solved just with good common sense and thinking. Story was really good but leaves something to think. Well its not nothing new if we are playing a horror game with mental illness. Just buy the game and experience it yourself ^^","June 2","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adventure games are not my favorite usually; I tend to give up on them if they are too long or the story doesn\'t hold my interest (or there too random/hard, etc).  Finished this in just under 9 hours, most of the puzzles either make sense or there are nudges in the right direction if you pay attention and don\'t rush.\n\nI got this one due to to the art style in the screen shots (reminded me of Spirited Away, one of my favorite movies) and great positive reviews and I am very glad I did.  If it\'s not obvious by the screenshots above, this game is very mature (gore, themes, etc...not for kids; very unlike Sprited Away).   This is another example of an indie gem.  I hope to see more from this Studio!","June 1","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fran Bow is disturbing, unsettling and makes you wonder about your sanity, It is classic point and click adventure with specific art style. At first it might seem like nice and cute adventure and then you take a red pill and those little animals which seemed cuddly are dead, mangled, you see guts, blood and dismembered limbs. The story kept me going and I am still not sure if it happened in my head, because of magic, or everyone was just insane. Or maybe I am.","June 3","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
