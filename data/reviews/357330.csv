You are a marine tasked with downloading information from various datacores scattered around the  claustrophic confines of an alien infested spaceship. After you have collected all the datacores you then have to shut down the cooling nodes on the reactor and then evacuate safely to the start point before the reactor explodes.\n\nWhat makes the above formula so successful, especially in co-op, is the tension, danger and the various means by which players can approach a level.\n\nThe aliens are dangerous. The aliens are numerous. The aliens will kill you if they get close. Thus this game brings a lot of tension because death is always moments away.\n\nThis game has captured perfectly the atmosphere that was present in a 1995 3DO game called Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels.  The ship ambience sounds bleak and forboding, the aliens breaking through doorways always sounds menacing, the sound of distant gunfire from a team mate reminds you trouble is not so far away.\n\n\nThe game is very customisable allowing players to increase the difficulty level to that which is nigh on impossible. Players can also tone down the muzzle flash and field of view effects which can be a bit overbearing in my opintion (I turn them all the way down). I also turn the action music off as it gets very repetitive after awhile.\n\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated so there is always a new and challenging permutation to play. Players can also enter specific seeds so that common levels can be practiced, shared and ultimately conquered.\n\nSome of the best moments I have had with this game is with a group on Mumble (voip software) forming a plan on the map screen prior to entering the fray. We then enter the fray and very often fail the mission only to tweak our strategy or take a slightly different approach until we eventually succeed. This is where the game really shines in my opinion.\n\nSummary\n\nPros - Atmospheric, Difficult and Challenging, Strategic, Endless Level Permutations, Frantic.\n\nCons - Multiplayer is still in its infancy and it can be very laggy if playing with someone across the pond (ie. Europe to US etc.). Some might say the graphics are a con due to the game not looking like Crysis but graphics do not necessarily make a game. The graphics are perfectly sufficient for what we get and do not detract one iota from the fun factor.\n\n\nIf you want to experience the movie Aliens, experience the game Aliens versus Predator, or experience a game like SPace Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels then this is the game for you.","June 8, 2015","true","119.3"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","35","39","2","3"

You'd think Space Beast Terror Fright can't be that scary, since it's in space and it probably has a beast, that ends up being terrifying and/or frightening. Trust me, there's so much more horror to this game than just the name.\n\nBelieve only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.\n\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Space Beast Terror Fright.\n\nGameplayI've finally found a game that actually made me stop playing for a while, so I could rest my eyes. And that's a bad thing, at least when talking about Space Beast Terror Fright (SBTF), as I've had a blast playing this game.\nThere isn't much to say, since the goal, at least for now, is to download some data, make the reactors go offline and run like Forrest did (preferably faster).\nThe UI has all the information required, and as the player downloads more data, upgrades will come along, that can improve/add many things, like the amount of ammo, or serve as a GPS to the next datacores, or even a pretty motion sensor. All of these will be used to survive the terrifying experience that SBTF is. From closing doors, so the monsters will take a little longer to get to you, to activating sentries, you'll end the mission thinking you were there for some hours, when in reality it wasn't that long.\nThe gameplay itself resembles some old FPS games, and it's also extremely punishing, considering one hit results in a mission failure. Just like Hudson (Bill Paxton) once said, "That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over, what the ♥♥♥♥ are we supposed to now, huh, what are we gonna do?".\nI never swore as much playing a game as I did while playing Space Beast Terror Fright.\n\nPros A well designed retro-style FPS;\nActual upgrades to the weapon/UI as you go further on in the level;\nIntense action that will leave the player looking around every corner before taking the next step;\nThe graphics fit perfectly, despite the flashy colors;\nThe sound effects are not only well adapted, but also make the game scarier;\nA real challenge, no matter the difficulty;\nPrice.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended to.\n\nNeutral Needs more weapons and more monsters!;\nCould use a campaign/story mode of some sorts.\nThe more I played, the more I realized there wasn't much to point out "Cons" wise, and in the end I went with the one that made me stop playing once in a while (to rest).\n\nCons The flashy colors and such make your eyes sore after a while, which leads to needing to rest your eyes for a while (and who wants that?).\nVerdictI'd give it a 8.5/10, not because the game is some sort of masterpiece, but simply because it's a game you'll always want just one more round of.\n\nNote: If you're an Alien (movie series) fan, you'll find this game pretty similar to Aliens (Alien 2).","May 18, 2015","true","8.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","5"

You and your friends are Marines who are given the simple objective of recovering all data cores on a ship and then overload that ships reactors and escaping back to your shuttle before the ship blows. There's just one problem, the ship is completely infested with Aliens.\n\nEver since I was a kid I have always wanted a game like this. A game where there is no massive story you are just a marine with a job to do on various different locations involving Aliens. This game is essentially Aliens meets Space Hulk vengeance of the blood angels only instead of AI companions it is either just you or 3 of your friends.\n\nYou download datacores and all datacores have a chance of giving you an upgrade of which all have their own different levels. For example your basic motion tracker lvl 1 only tells you if something is moving near you. Lvl 2 motion tracker gives you short range blips indicating where enemy positions are and Lvl 3 essentially can detect all motion on the entire ship. You can get infrared vision, better bullets, a map of the ship, more battery life, waypoints pointing to objectives, faster download time of the datacores etc all upgrades have at least 3 more levels to them to improve them such as datacores being downloaded in 7.5 seconds to being download in just 1 second.\n\nTo assist you against the aliens the players can activate sentry guns and close off doors to prevent Alien from being able to easily move about the ship. Naturally the Aliens can destroy these doors but the time it takes them can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nOnce you have turned off the coolants to the reactor the Marines have 2 minutes to return to the shuttle.\n\nThis is a hardcore game you character will die in 1 hit from alien, turret, or fellow marine and once your character is dead so are all his upgrades. If your character gets close to an alien expect him to freak out with adrenaline. He will run quicker but his vision will also be impaired into a sort of tunnel vision. If you manage to complete a mission you carry on the character from the previous mission so you will start a new map with all of your upgrades on that character which will make the mission significantly easier on you and your teammates.\n\nWith procedurally generated maps of 3 different level styles, local coop, planned network multiplayer, and hordes of ravenous Aliens how can you go wrong? This is what a proper Aliens game should be and I am very excited to see what the developers will do with this game in the future.\n\n10/10 buy if you are a fan Aliens or Space Hulk. This is what Colonial Marines should have been.","April 11, 2015","true","34.9"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","36","47","0","4"

Space Beast Terror Fright does not have the latest greatest graphics or tries any fancy with the game mechanics. What it does have in abundance is fun. It's about as close to the old good alien games as we're going to get.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rZPhnHc6pw\nEach playthrough will be quite different given the games procedural nature, but you will always start as a marine on board a ship with a pulse rifle. Seeking out the DataCores rewards random perk unlocks for your character making them stronger and smarter while granting some chance of survival. One feature I enjoyed was the soundtrack also being somewhat procedural. Which basically meant all the alien fights were guaranteed to be that much more 'hollywood'.\n\nLevels did contain sentries that could be enabled to setup choke points but careful management of doors seemed to be the best recipe for success. After finding all the DataCores you are then given the task of shutting down the main reactor, this is done in several stages and often resulted in a one final brutal showdown. Once the reactor is offline you will then have 90seconds to escape, succeed and you will be sent to yet another ship with bigger, badder aliens and more data to retrieve.\n\nPrice may seem a little high but personally I've not had this much fun shooting aliens for a while. With local co-op implemented now and online co-op planned for the future, can recommend keeping it shortlisted if the genre interests you.

Random upgrades, fire power, hack speeds, motion tracker and vision. Yes, vision. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. YOUR UPGRADES CAN GET DOWNGRADED TOO! This is the kind of fps that other dev's should learn from. Hell, even the people who made Aliens: Colonial Marines should take some god damn notes on this. This games has ALL the movie and game refs. (Aliens, Starship Troopers, HALO, Space Marine, and others as well). The Ai is great. They dont just come for you, THEY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ COME FOR YOU! They come through the doors, ceilings, and the floors. Its not just one or two or three. This game keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe game objective is to find data core terminals and download the data to unlock the Coolent system so you can set it to explode, as well as Sentry Turrets. After downloading the data you need you will be awarded either an upgrade or a downgrade. You can get a 2.5 second flashlight recharge and the next you get a 5 second recharge.  One minute you have 500 ammo clip the next you can get a 1000 ammo clip. You get a 120 second flash light and then you get No flashlight for 60 seconds. Trust me you dont want to have that.\n\nThe maps on here are great. Its random based. You can set a Dungeon style map with no doors or with out you can even included big rooms with no advantage points to hype up the suspence. A Maze Style with no doors and sentury turrets, well.....you better play god like. Cause they will run a train on you.  You can add doors and turrets. Each time you play a map it changes.\n\nThe game has an xp system but there is a catch. You can only level up if you pass the missions. if not then you restart. Im not a fan of it but Im not too big on leveling up either so it works for me :)\n\nThey game has 3 difficulties. Easy (1 player suggested) Hard (Yeah, skips normal and goes for the throat. 2-3 depending on map style) Insane (4 players NEEDED and a pack of Huggies Diapers). For a early access this game is simple and yet very challanging. If you are scepticle about paying 14.99 for this game just do what I did and Evolve it with someone on your family share. I was sold in 2 play throughs.\n\nUPDATE 8/6/15: The new update is ok I guess. I dont likt the fact that you have a repair station for your suit. Yes, a fukking repair staion. That crap takes away the hype of the anticipation of the Alien ♥♥♥♥ train that lies ahead. I dont like the fact that they perma downgraded the ammo start. (500 rnds pre-up vs 400rnds post-up) Same for the Turrets 400 rnds instead of the 500rnds. ( I dont mind it because I dont want to reply on the turrets.) Im not a fan of the new download icon. meh :/\n\nWhat Im really enjoynig is the fact of the new alien. They look like facehuggers but with teeth. If you add them to the map(any map will do. Maze has been the hardest one yet), turn off doors and turrets, and turn on random breaches....well..lets just say you will blow through your ammo load really fast. I mean faster than a virgin male on prom night. The first 15 seconds of the game we had not only 15 breaches already but one opened right at the start point. Yes, I jumped like a little girl. Also the Ai has been improved. The facehuggers breach but they are quiet. They now breach behind you.

You just shoot the same alien over and over with the help of numerous sentry guns. It's like someone took their favorite moments from the Aliens films and combined it with Warhammer 40k games like Space Hulk. You will die, a lot. Then you'll try again and die shortly after. Repeat this 50 times until you get bored with it.\n\nYour main goal is to access datacores and set the self destruct for each randomly generated space station, but whether or not you accomplish this is largely up to luck. By luck I mean whether or not the game will cut you some slack and not be too cruel with enemy spawns and datacore placements. Datacore offer upgrades, but you're not given control over these and sometimes the game doesn't give them out at all. Also I hope you enjoy the machinegun they give you, because that's all you're getting.\n\nOverall, this is a hit and miss game, like all randomly generated rogue-like games are. It has decent enough visuals and a nice atmosphere but the price is way too high for the little content you get. I do hope these guys add more stuff into the full version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/357330/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpace Beast Terror Fright is a game that lets you have an experience very similar to the movie Aliens. The weapon akin to the pulse rifle, the hundreds of xenomorphs, the music, the motion trackers, the sentry guns and their ammo count decreasing too fast, the overall look and feel, and so on. These Aliens elements are integrated to a roguelite skeleton, with a maze of corridors that change each time the player dies and then starts over.\n\nI think that the atmosphere is really nailed perfectly, heavy and atmospheric when the monsters are not here, then intense and a lot more stressful when the xenomorphs are pouring down the corridors with no end in sight. Sentry guns to activate and doors to open/close add a layer of strategy to the shooting. The shooting is very divisive by the way... Invasive Heads Up Display, enormous weapon and its muzzle flash, huge recoil, screen shake... This is where you decide : are you willing to sacrifice slick shooting mechanics for immersion? This time, I say yes. The game is built around that in the first place: the corridors are small and the xenomorphs are huge targets going down in very few bullets. So killing is not difficult at all. However, the feeling of not seeing much and not being in control contributes to make the encounters even more stressful and the monsters more numerous and dangerous than they really are.\nWell, except that sometimes there can really be TOO MUCH of them constantly attacking. There are holes in the ceilings that endlessly spawn more and more Aliens as you get closer to them, and some of these nests in the same location can cause some areas to be extremely difficult to get through.\n\nDespite being in early access, Space Beast Terror Fright runs very well on my aging computer. The developers seem to listen to the community (without sacrificing their artistic integrity if possible, since complaints about each element of the immersive interface are bound to keep appearing) and they are set on adding features to the game (such as new monsters or online coop - local coop is already possible), which would be quite welcome. Indeed, the game as it is is an enjoyable and intense experience, but it remains too bare-bones to renew itself on the long term. I am really looking forward see this game grow and get new features, thanks to early access.

It seems that this game never get`s boring. Every round is exciting. If you get unfocused the aliens will eat your fully upgraded marine in a second.

It runs good and stable.\n\nA few years ago i talked to a friend about the ultimative alien game. We figured out that a game should have:\n1. Play as marine and kill the aliens\n2. Objektives like get the data, or rescue hostages, kill the queen etc.\n3. Randomly generated maps\n4. Weldable doors\n\nWell, this game have it all, i coincidental found this game on steam, and bought it after playing a few rounds in the demo. Its great, dont mind the graphics, ist the atmosphere that makes this game so great. The developer is a fan of the alien movies and you will feel that in every second you play this game.\n\nI really hope this game gets regularly updates, the potential is enormous.","April 7, 2015","true","26.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

The way the soundtrack automatically jumps and your FOV tunnelvisions when an alien appears in your field of view might initially seem cheap, but it's actually one of the most immersive ways I've seen a shooter implement a horror mechanic. The music also creeps up should an alien be creeping up on you, which is a godsend when you're too busy blasting away to glance down at your motion tracker and don't realize that a xenomorph's coming from behind. When you're done winding down from the adrenaline pump, having activated a sentry gun in a bottleneck and fled past the waves, there's a neat little snare drum rat-at-tat-tat that lets you know you're off the hook for at least the few seconds. The way your movement rate automatically goes from a sedate jog when all's quiet to a breakneck sprint for survival isn't just for effect or to add spookiness, it actively helps keep you alive when an alien suddenly bursts out from the breach you've got no choice but to brush past. All and all, it creates an extremely atmospheric experience that combines horror and gunplay in way that modern titles can't do with millions of dollars of budget.\n\nThere are some wonky things that can ruin seemingly good runs, though. While enemies can only spawn out of extremely obvious and visible breaches, they don't have any kind of animation that leaves them vulnerable. This means that you can be watching your (upgraded) motion tracker, see and hear zero blips anywhere near you, round a corner where there's a breach in the ceiling, and instantly die because an alien spawned right next to you. The solution to that of course is to never take even a fully upgraded motion tracker for granted, but it's still a tad frustrating. The sentry guns are actually relatively intelligent about friendly fire 99% of the time, refusing to shoot through you and instead giving a telltale klaxon to let you know that they have no shot, but since the bullets do have a marginal travel time, it is in fact possible to walk into the flight path of a bullet and (instantly) die. Also, reduced download time meshes poorly with a large battery and unupgraded recharge time, since currently you only recharge when actually downloading. Allowing you to interact with terminals purely to recharge your battery for just a few extra seconds here and there would be a nice touch.\n\nThe multiplayer is only splitscreen right now, which is an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone with all the obstrusive graphical elements included. (I'll admit that I have to remove all the graphical elements to have a hope of completing a level as I get used to the system and how dramatically my mouse sensitivity and movement can change on a dime.) Given the snap reflexes needed to Not Die in this game (a "mere" 150ms is the difference between life and instant death), I wonder how they'll handle the netcode for the online multiplayer - it's likely that the only way to reasonably do it without seemingly randomly killing players will be by computing much of the mechanics clientside.\n\nThe game itself is a skeleton right now, but it's a skeleton so solid and functional and with so few flaws that I can't wait to see it grow muscles and skin. There's a lot of room for alternate modes: one where upgrades are purchased up front via a pointbuy/cash system at the beginning of the level with no upgrades to be found midlevel, a mode with a hard timer rather than a soft one through ammo count, a mode that would let you tinker with map parameters like doors, average corridor length, and number of objectives and sentry guns... Once networked multiplayer is made, the doors get blown wide open: a mode with aliens under player control, a mode with a human commander browbeating a squad of other humans as stumble through a map with asynchronous intel available to either party... there's nowhere for this game to go but up. I'm not normally an early access guy, but the game as it stands right now is worth $15, and possibly of expansion can only increase your investment.\n\nBuy this ♥♥♥♥ing game. Get spooked. Die horribly. Try again.","April 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I already have a long, tragic, scrolling list of marines that tried and died on my menu, and each name I can remember as a different nightmare scenario.\n\nFraser had a great run. He'd picked up the motion sensor and penetrated deep into the heart of the ship, but stalled a bit activating a couple of turrets in adjacent rooms. Soon the aliens were swarming him from all sides, and low on ammo, he panicked and took a sentry bullet in the back.\n\nRodriguez couldn't decide which path he should take, and in his hesitation forgot to look behind him.\n\nWinters upgraded his gear and charged forward confidently, but got lost in the maze of corridors. Alone and cornered, he fired his weapon dry before the end, dying in a pile of alien bodies and sulfurous smoke.\n\nPichot, oh Pichot. This brave woman fought her way through 24 datacores of hell, timing her movements and covering her approaches with well-placed sentry support. She made it all the way to the reactor, knuckles white and breath hot on  her helmet visor as she cautiously measured her ammo and battery life, never careless. By the end, though, the ship's computer wailed as the timer slowly counted down, and Pichot had lost her way battling through the corridors trying to reach the escape shuttle. She took many aliens with her before the final, merciful explosion.\n\nIt's moments like these with each new 'run' becoming their own story that make me love roguelike games. I read each name at the start of the round, imagine the character that's about to face this singularly terrifying mission, and charge headlong into the madness.\n\nThis sci-fi roguelike shooter has simple mechanics, but does more with them than many games for twice the price. The atmosphere in this game is perfect; claustrophobic, tense, urgent, terrifying, always pressing you to make those critical decisions. Should I move or wait? Activate this sentry or skip it in favor of speed? Left corridor or right? There's never a dull moment as you wonder what could wait for you around the corner.\n\nThe shooting itself may seem rudimentary, but the mechanics only add to the experience. A huge muzzle-flash and wafting smoke light up the dim interior of the ship as the aliens scream and charge you in waves. Your vision pulses with adrenaline and the tracker bleeps progressively louder warnings at you as you frantically maneuver. It takes some getting used to, but I found the mechanics fit the atmosphere nicely, and serve to compliment the gameplay if you learn how to work with them.\n\nThe aliens themselves charge at you in a wave, but this simple behavior doesn't hurt the game at all. The breaches are random, and the aliens can also bash down doors. Their numbers will continue to grow until they seem to be coming at you from every direction, and this keeps the game very tense and urges you to progress so you don't get surrounded.\n\nThe random generation of the maps one of the most interesting aspects to the game. It makes every playthrough seem unique and keeps the game very fresh, but on the downside, some runs can feel a bit easier than others. Sometimes you'll come into a level with a turret and four datacores right next to your starting position, and other times you'll have long, lonely corridors that stretch deep into the ship with no turrets and no datacores at all. The amount of cores you have to access changes as well, and I've seen numbers as low as 9 to as high as 24. These differences can make certain playthroughs feel much harder than others, but it's also great for replayability and helps each soldier have their own story. Some people just have an easier road in life, but can you beat the odds stacked against you and survive?\n\nI'll be honest and say I really don't like supporting early access games. I've seen it burn too many people and normally will just wait until a game's release, but after reading the reviews and playing the demo of this game (yes, gasp, there's a demo!) I purchased it in early access immediately and have no regrets. It's a wonderful start to something I hope will grow and keep it's slimy, alien roots buried in what makes it so great and addictive.\n\nI also haven't even beaten a single level, which hasn't changed my opinion of the game in the slightest, nor have I tried the co-op, which includes split screen with a friend on the same pc. This is a wonderful feature, if only I had any friends!\n\n10/10 - I wish more early access games were this promising. If your at all a fan of the genre, or just well-made games in this age of AAA hype and bloated, million dollar failures, pick this one up. It's great and deserves the support!","April 29, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Upon downloading all the datacores, the player must disable the reactor coolants and make way for the airlock where you start. It's hard, scary, fun, and atmospheric, especially when the power goes out. Don't poop yourself during power outages. The level darkens, all mehcanisms on the map are disabled, and the music stops.

This is commonly done right: give the protagonist of the horror game an arsenal of over-the-top weapons that should (used correctly) destroy small armies singlehandedly.\n\nWhat they get wrong is giving the player power in every other area. In this game you are denied:\nInformation (what you're up against exactly, how many there are, where they are, how overwhelmed you will be) via muzzleflash, darkness, mazelike locations, glitchy AI (seriously) and restrictive environments.\nMovement (fight vs flight CHOICE, variety of approaches, etc) via no jumping, no control over speed of movement and confined spaces -- kudos to the developers for using the equivalent of clip brushes well here, by the way. I rarely get stuck on geometry.\nTime (to prepare, to progress at your own pace of comfort, to even turn around) via endless consistent spawns, no way to block areas, no true safe zones, and a very large player hitbox (meaning that turning away from a nearby breach is instant death, you don't have TIME to look away).\n\nAmong other things. I can't really do a proper front-to-back-top-to-bottom breakdown of it, because there's so much going on here and I've no doubt the developers are sitting on a gold mine of ideas beyond what's on display.\n\nBut this is an -- perhaps THE -- important horror game. Even if it falls flat on so many levels (Quake/Quake 2-era model polycount, low texture quality, downsampling works oddly at best [obscuring the ammo counters on the weapon, really?] and seems a weird choice, very repetitive gameplay, no direction of character development, no character variety at start, limited player choice all around) it's damned good, and absolutely worth anyone's time.","April 15, 2015","true","7.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Your mission is to active all the Data cores within this ship and then shut down the reactor to pretty much cause a self-destruct. While you are trying to complete your job, there are aliens that will swarm you and kill you instantly if they get to you. That’s why this game can be very tense at times.\n\nYou can close doors and active turrets to impede the aliens but you have to be fast before they breach all throughout the ship. The Alien vs Predator survival mode is definitely the vibe I am getting here.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic game still in development and what sounds like great plans for the future.","May 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Be warned, in its current state this game is made for multiplayer.  I'd say it's not worth it if you prefer to mostly play solo.\n\nIt pays great homage to Aliens, and offers a unique experience.\n\nIn Early Access, in its current form, I'd say 14.99 is a bit steep.

Or yell in frustration. The good kind of frustration. The kind that makes you keep coming back, then dying. And dying. And dying some more.\n\nSpace Beast Terror Fright is an arcade-style shooter / horror game set aboard a randomly generated, pitch-black space installation or ship. From the moment you step on board the foreign spacecraft, hordes of alien beasts not unlike the creatures from the "Alien" series of movies begin breaching the hull of the ship and stalking you. Your objective is to move around the spacecraft, avoiding and killing off aliens in order to find and enable a number of datacores scattered around the ship, then set the ship to self-destruct and finally escape back to the airlock before the entire thing goes boom. Add in a permanent death element and insta-kill enemies and you have one of the most intense, difficult and adrenaline-pumping games in years.\n\nFrom the getgo, you're launched into an incredibly difficult environment with limited equipment, although for every datacore you find, you recieve upgrades like thermal vision, stronger weapons and faster download times. There are automatic turrets that can be activated all around the ship to defend important chokepoints or protect you from an oncoming assault. The entire game plays out very quickly; sitting around for too long is almost certain doom. Firing your gun illuminates the screen, obscuring your vision behind smoke and muzzle flashes to the point that you can't see even a foot in front of you. Overall, the game feels like a very accurate depiction of the later half of the film "Aliens" - desperate marines rushing through darkness to escape a constantly aggressive and hostile threat.\n\nThe grame feels and looks great, from the dark corridors lit up by dim lights that silhouette the shapes of the vicious alien invaders to the beautifully designed helmet-mounted HUD, complete with somewhat dysfunctional motion tracker (which adds to the desperate mood). I've never had a good look at the aliens themselves, so I can't tell you how they look, which is exactly how a horror game villain should be. Sound design is just as fantastic, with gunshots echoing out and overlapping all other noise (potentially masking the sounds of aliens approaching from the rear) as the soundtrack fluctuates to accent the action of the moment. All aspects of the design are extremely well done, immersing you right into the horrific environment of the murky, alien-infested starship.\n\nThe controls are incredibly simple, with only three or four buttons aside from the basic movement keys being used altogether. Doors are opened and consoles activated with a single click - the perfect design choice for the panicing space marine. Gameplay, while still relatively simple, can be intense and is always a fresh experience. Sometimes the aliens will breach the ship near a critical data core console, forcing you to stay on your toes as you download the data. The final rush to the airlock is an extremely intense experience, with players sprinting to reach the end amidst the whirring sirens and screaming aliens. The game is very hard alone, though it can be played via classic 4-way splitscreen co-op and will soon have multiplayer added as well. All in all, this game has some of the most intense, terrifying and addicting gameplay I've experienced in a game thus far. Death in a level will not only reset your mission count to zero, but will also remove all the upgrades you've found via datacores amongst other progress, making teamwork and caution paramount. It really makes everything feel much more real and interesting.\n\nSpace Beast Terror Fright - despite its rather long name - is an excellent game, unique in several ways. Fast and intense gameplay mixed with an atmosphere of fright harken back to the days of Doom 3 and the original Left 4 Dead set in the world of the "Alien" franchise - which, if you happen to be a fan of, will certainly be one of the closest experiences you will ever get to playing a game like James Cameron's masterpiece sequel. If you're looking for a challenging arcade-style game, an intense roguelike experience, a pulse-pounding horror game, or just something to sit down on the couch and play with your friends, Space Beast Terror Fright is certainly for you. It's hard, it's addicting, and it's one hell of a wild ride every time you play.\n\nGame over, man, game over.\n\nFinal Score: 9.5/10\n"Dayum."","April 11, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

This may sound obvious but I'm serious. This game is exactly how the videos/pictures/trailers show. You are a Marine, and you fight aliens(and there's the PVP too). No more no less.\n=========================================\nPROS+ Hardcore-like Gameplay (Challenging)\n+ Immersive Atmosphere (You actually feel like a Marine)\n+ Random Map Generation (Suprise Element)\n+ Multiplayer and Local Co-Op\n+ I found no bugs or glitches.\nCONS- Could use more guns and customization.\n=========================================\nPersonal Thoughts\nIn this game you get to be a Marine! But no, not any kind of Marine, you get to be a Marine with a POWER ARMOR!\nNot cool enough for you??? Well, then get your hands in one of those sweet gigantic guns that REAL MARINES use.\n\nI'm talking about those suculent gigantic guns that spill ammo like it was 4th of July while those nasty aliens are coming for you trying to kill you!\n\nNot a fan of scary Aliens? Worry not, this game also has PVP! Which is really challenging by the way.\n\nThis game is really good and it has a LOT of potential. If you are a fan of old-school shooters and a fan of Aliens, you will love this game.\n\nAlthough you can play it alone I RECOMMEND, no... You MUST play it Co-op!

It's a procedurally generated rouge-like similar to "Monstrum", though you actually have a gun this time out.  I suppose one could compare it to the missions found in "Interstellar Marines".  Here, you'll be tasked with retrieving critical data, overloading the core, and getting out all the while holding off the deadly Xenomorphs that roam the ship.  While it is pretty difficult, I still enjoyed my experience and can't wait to see what else they add to the game.

You run, you gun, you try not to die and complete a mission. It has a slight learning curve in the beggining while you're trying to understand the basic things like "constant motion is needed to not die" and "waiting will make things much worse". Solo gameplay is fun and now has a ranking ladder for different map-seeds and difficulty levels, so you can boast to your friends, that, for instance, you're the only one who finished "DEADFACE" seed on Insane Random Breaches.\n\nBut if you're more of an online person, like me, you'll have multiplayer. It has local co-op, it has LAN, it has Steam Friends and Public rooms with same modes as there are for solo. Though you don't have a progression there and you character loses all upgrades after finishing a level. Game supports up to 4 player rooms. At first netcode was simply horrible making game a slo-mo fest, but they've released a patch in a day or so that fixes the problem. Now it's pretty damn smooth and enjoyable. Rough around the edges for sure, but I think developers will fix that.\n\nAbout the developers - they are constantly monitoring steam discussions, use players feedback, answear questions and generally are very nice guys. They don't fail to delivel and I'm not dissapointed by one bit so far.\n\nI clearly recommend this game for anyone who's into procedural generated games. And simple shooters. You won't find here any complicated story, detaled characters or awesome graphics. But if you're looking for some hardcore good old run'n'gun, then this game is clearly for you. And if you're not sure, feel free to try out demoversion on the developers site. It lacks a lot of features from the full version, like "turret friendly fire" and such, but you'll get the idea if you like it or not and make a desicion based on that.","June 5, 2015","true","39.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Looking forward to new updates in the future. Definitely filled the hole in my heart that was ripped open by Aliens: Colonial Marines.\n\n\n\nAs we made our way through the decrepit halls of the ship, the lack of engagements only allowed our fear and anxiety to grow. We had gone a full 6 minutes with no enemy contact. Our plan was simple: Get in, Get the data cores, disrupt the coolant systems to cause a core overload, get out before we become space dust. Breach after Breach was detected, yet no creatures had stood in our path. We activated each sentry unit we came across and closed each door to ensure we would not get attacked from behind, but it wasn't enough. As we collected our first data core, we heard them. They came upon us like a storm, a storm of claws and teeth. The smashing and scraping sounds seemed to eminate from all around us. The screams were the worst part. Those maddening screams. They tore through our Lieutenant almost immediately, the poor sap had his back to the door. I almost threw up in my power suit when we heard the crunching and slurping noises coming from his still activated coms. The remaining 3 of us turn and ran, trying as hard as we could to stay ahead of the scourge. We held up in a hallway under a sentry turret, its firepower adding to our diminished numbers. Just as the fight seemed to turn in our favor, a xenomorph burst through the blast door to our right and slaughtered my remaining 2 teammates. I decimated it with a single shotgun blast to the head but it was too late for my comrades. With my ammo depleted, team wiped out, and power armor damaged to the point of borderline function, I took off at a run towards where we boarded. This damn ship is a maze, with no rhyme or reason to its layout. I found a dead end corridor to rest in, knowing the enemy in pursuit would at least have to come from in front of me. This will be my last broadcast. I can hear them coming.

Main Reason: Extremly Challanging. You want to do it. You  simple want and can't take the failure(s).\n\nTook me many attempts before I was the first time successful in the first mission.

It captures the isolation and tension of being stranded alone on a spaceship very well.

The random nature of awarded powerups, and of spaceship layouts, means that no two games should ever be the same.\n\nEach stage can take up to 15 minutes (assuming you survive to the end), making it easy to have quick sessions.\n\nDeveloper is actively updating the game, and each update so far has brought substantial improvements.

This little heart attack is a rouge-like run-and-gun\nTight hallways and lots of aliens and not a whole lot of ammo make your heart race as you run from data point to data point hoping the turret you turned on lasts just a few more seconds!  Data points work as level up, working toward making you "stronger." giving things like buffed up bullets, maps,  radar, ect. Every thing helps make you get one step closer to the main goal of destorying the ship by setting off the reactors. Once you do make it that far its a mad dash back to the start, past bullet riddled, gib covered, alien infested hallways to your escape. for 15 buck you get your moneys worth and with the local co-op you got one hell of a drinking game. Great sound and effects make it even all the better. So worth the pick up","April 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's single player or local multiplayer which I can see being very very fun. The game is very challenging but I feel like I'm always progressing and getting a little bit farther every go. You start to learn things, and listen for key sounds. When you are downloading the datacores and getting upgrades it starts to make sense the more you learn and the more you play. So far I have really enjoyed the game and find it to be very fun and can't wait to see what else is put into the game.\n\nI can understand it may not be for everyone because it is too hard for people and it doesn't hold your hand. I think it is more brilliant that you end up teaching yourself and develope your own strategies on what to do when situations arise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Undyne_/recommended/357330/","_Undyne_","Undyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Undyne_/","258 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played this back when it was in a Demo Pre-Alpha type of state and, to be quite honest, I'm really happy that the developers took the community into account when they were working on it. It wasn't a case of "Oh, sure, we might do it." or that they simply ignored suggestions; they've actually listened to what was said and tried to implement things based around the feedback they've received, maybe even my own included.\n\nAs a rougelike, high-intensity game, it can suffer from a few penalties usually presented in how cluttered the screen is, how little you see, etc. etc. However, majority of these things can be modified or edited in the menu, so I don't think that a lack of searching on the player's part is enough to bring about something negative to the developers, especially if there is customisation in these respects to change how the aesthetics of the game present themselves.\n\nAnyway, I'll provide a more concise list below. As an early-access game, I will be quite critical, but not enough that I don't realise that work is still being put into it. It's not a finished product, so I expect that new things will come in time.\n\nProsDifficulty Managed by Players (Different manipulations and combinations make the game more difficult, the game rarely makes it difficult by itself since it can only generate the terrain you allow it to.)\nIntense Gameplay (Even fully kitted out, you can still die if you don't stay vigilant - there's often a lot going on.)\nProcedurally Generated (It's a Roguelike, duh.)\nDifferent Weapons and Ammo Types\nDifferent Ways to Manipulate the Generation of Maps / Gameplay\nQuick Loading / Lack of Latency Issues\nContinuous / Plentiful Upgrades\nMeaningful Permadeath\nDetailed Interface (Literally tells you everything you need to know, given the upgrades.)\nDifferent Views (i.e. Split-Screen like view, even on multiplayer, allowing you to see the screens of other players online. This isn't done often and is very unique. I like it very much. It can be changed to be active, or inactive, in different ways.)\nRunning During Escapes (Have you ever thought to yourself "I wish my character would have some sense of urgency while this entire place is blowing up around me." but instead they're casually strolling on? Well, this game does it right. You run faster and faster as the timer ticks down for the ship to explode - there's your sense of urgency. That, and when you're being chased by hungry Xenos.)\nGreat Atmosphere (Especially early game when your flashlight doesn't last long, those highly infested ships look real intimidating during exploration.)\nConsLack of Aliens (There are only two, but at least one of them doesn't instantly kill you.)\nLack of Weapons / Weapon Upgrades (I can't tell the difference between the Hammer 2x and Hammer 4x, honestly. The Razor pisses through ammo with an awful lot of recoil. The Shotgun, Rifle and Hammers are good, though.)\nNo Option for Turning Friendly Fire Off (I can see an exploit of trolls happening, but I understand why it's constantly on.)\nCan Get Repetitive (Despite the fact that it is a Roguelike, the mission is always the same, making it a little tiresome someitmes.)\nAmmo Types Seem Negligible (Maybe it's because of the weapon, but it didn't seem to matter which Ammo Type I had, they usually died in one hit to the Hammer 2x.)\nNo Tutorial (I don't mind, but it might matter for some. My friend and I were being slaughtered the first few times because we were being far too slow, even on easier difficulties. It might help to have a little tutorial mission for newcomers.)\nMeaningless Ranks (Leveling up seems to present nothing other than personal achievement. Not that I mind so much, but it feels like it should do something.)\nIntense Muzzle Flare / Screen Shaking (This can be turned off, so it's not so much of a Con point. Initially, though, it's quite violent in the shaking or taking up most of the screen with the flares. I had to turn it down to a bar each to be bearable for me, personally.)\nLack of Modes (I understand it's early in development, so I can't hit this too hard, but there's only two modes. Scavenge and Deathmatch.)\nNo Background / Story (Ship infested by Xenos, download Intel, overload Core, ♥♥♥♥ off, repeat. There's not much beyond that.)\nChunky Armour, Instant Kill (A pet peeve of mine - these huge suits stop Friendly Fire and Astro-Xeno attacks, but one normal Xeno gets you and your goose is cooked. You'd think with all that armour, it might stop something.)\nSentries / Fences Seem Overpowered (While it can be a pain to activate either of them sometimes, once they're up, they rarely come down. Shy of a power outage, I've never seen a Sentry get destroyed or a Fence collapse - the latter especially, frying every Xeno that comes into contact with it. I know the Sentry has ammo, but I've never seen it get depleted or destroyed, though I did in the Demo once or twice way back when.)\nCluttered HUD (You can turn it off if you like, I'm pretty sure. It's all relevant clutter, but it can be a problem for some people to have so much on the screen at any one time. Such as the large obnoxious text when hacking a data core - I recommend using the minimal HUD text for that one.)\nLack of Players (It's in the beginnings of becoming a proper game, so it's understandable that there isn't a huge playerbase around it yet, but hopefully that will change in time.)\nPlease try not to bash the review 'cause of playtime. I have played it before and, while it has changed a lot, the core principle is the same. I can dissect a game pretty quick and I do enjoy it. Maybe not worth the price tag right this moment, but in time I'm sure it will be - it has promising progressions ahead of it.\n\nDo not be disheartened by the number of Cons points either - most of them can be remedied by your own hand depending on how you want to play the game, so that one is entirely up to you. The reason I touch upon them as negative points in the first place is because they might affect a newcomer to the game since they start on (or off as the case might be) and frustrate / annoy them.\n\nAll in all, I do recommend this game. It has a bright future ahead of it and I think that it'd be a very good couch-party game if you have a big enough screen for the four players, or even a LAN party. Enjoy it, be it in development or otherwise!\n\nI salute you Nornware!","May 1","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sum up of thsi game- quick 3-20 minute game, its like am awesome version of those first person maze games that came in the front of magazines and such. The station is completly diffrent everytime, and of course, the splitscreen functions flawlessly. ATM only one weapon and alien type, but if you're looking for a casual game you can paly in your time off, or another splitscreen game, theres worse things you could buy. The goal of the game is to traverse aroudn a procedualy generated space station, and activate 13 coolants, while being pursued by aliensesque..well...aliens. Each coolent yo uactivate gives you a buff(infared vision, extra ammo ect.), and finding that last coolant while low on ammo leads to some tense situations. There are also turret machiens you can activate,that come  with limited ammo, meaning you can create temporary 'safe zones' if you ever need to flee a large horde. Overall, really entertaining game, and a must have for those that love splitscreen/first person procedual generation, or aliens.","April 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was hurt in a special way when I bought/played aliens colonial marines. SBTF is an awesome experience. The tension is great and the panic rushes are fun.

Addicting. Easy to learn. Damn hard to master. This game is like crack. It has that "just one more try" syndrome. And you will try...again and again and again as the game has no sympathy for you. It has a particular 80's sci-fi charm to it that keeps you coming back over and over again. Each time you fail, you feel like you could have done something better or been more careful.\n\nProcedurally generated levels means you can't just learn a pattern so it keeps the difficulty level up. My first (and only) successful mission completion felt so good. I'm sure I can do it again, right?\n\nNo campaign, just try to get through as many levels as you can. Online co-op was add recently added and it supports up to 4 player split screen co-op, but I've been soloing the whole time and having a blast.\n\nIf you like that Aliens movie sci-fi vibe, permadeath and simplistic quick fix games, you might find way more enjoyment here than you might expect. I know I did. The graphics aren't going to win any awards, but the sound design and overall game's visual nuances wrap up in a very asthetically pleasing little indie package.\n\nIt's definitely not for the faint of heart. If you like a good challenge and just want a break from a full fledged AAA blockbuster title, S.B.T.F. may just be the breather you were looking for.

Você, incorporado em Marine Interstellar qualquer, é designado a desativar mecanismos eletrônicos de uma nave já infestadas por alieníginas. O diferencial deste jogo é sua simplicidade. Não há muito o que fazer senão atirar nos inimigos para salvar sua vida. O jogo não conta com um sistema de Check Points muito menos com Health. Totamelmente Perma-Death. Se o alienígina te pegar com um simples hit você morre e é obrigado a começar tudo de novo. O que naturalmente deixa o jogo bem mais interessante devido ao fato que você deve ter um extremo cuidado na hora de enfrentar seus inimigos nos corredores escuros da nave. O clima também não deixa a desejar. Por ser um jogo simples, conta com uma atmosfera bastante cativante. O clima do jogo, com suas músicas de fundo e sua baixa visibilidade, dá um ar de tensão quando os inimigos se aproximam, deixando o jogo bem tenso aos que tentam sobreviver e completar os objetivos. O jogo não dispôe (talvez ainda) de modo MP. Entretanto é um jogo que vale a pena se você busca um pouco de Survive Horror com uma mescla de ação no mais Alien/The thing que possa existir por aí (aos leigos Alien e The thing são clássicos do cinema).

In its defense, it is very basic, you are a guy or gal with a gun, killing things that are trying to kill you. No crouch, jump, run, reload, or weapon juggling. The visuals aren't cutting edge, and don't have to be. The mood is effectively created, the lighting well rendered enough to tell darkness from shadow, and the score fits. Movement is smooth and fluid, game play is rather addicting, and the shooting is just as satisfying as the scares are terrifying.\n\nNow why isn't it perfect? A few reasons. First, its a medium that would thrive with well coordinated multiplayer and the servers are dead. Second, the movement speed is a bit slow. The player could use a boost in forward motion, if not just adding the standard RUN function. Last, its hard as hell. Even on easy. If you like the challenge of wandering through endless tunnels with the nasties hot on your heels, completing objectives just seconds before it too late, then this is the one. If not, on easy with predictable maps it will take hours to grind out a strategy to get past the first level.

In theory, it sounds simple:  download the data, set the reactor to overload, get out.  What could go wrong?  As it turns out, plenty:  Beasts spawn every few seconds, and any Beast that reaches you kills you.  And then there are optional power outages...\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and responsive, even on my laptop.  Even better, there is an online community where you can go and work together to shoot Beasts and, accidentally, each other.  And the developer is always tweaking the game to make it better (the newest update -- number TWENTY-SEVEN -- will include infested wall texures!)\n\nThis game is already a more refined experience than many other games.  For the price, it's an absolute steal.

Recommend playing the game in co-op with 2-4 players (Only split-screen available currently)\n\nThis is hands down the "Aliens" game we've been waiting for.\n\nYou may ask yourself? 1 Enemy type? 3 Level types? 1 Gun? How could that be enough content to keep me entertained for hours on end?\n\nThe answer, simply enough is atmosphere, procedural generation and smart enemy design. This game oozes atmosphere as you play it, from tight; dark corridors to blinding firefights with an enemy you rarely see well, if at all. It all comes together into a neat little package that keeps you on your toes and even manages to give a few scares when an unexpected enemy pops by. Throw that into procedurally generated levels and even though the game currently only has 3 tilesets (as of patch 1, more to be added) you still find yourself with interesting levels 25 missions in. Finally, by throwing in an enemy infinite in number that kill you in one hit, you never master the enemy but instead only try to hold back the tide long enough to make it out alive. What's better? This is only patch one! The game is good now, and only stands to receive more content!!!\n\nLadies, Gentlemen. This is not the story of how you eradicated the alien menace and claimed glory for earth. This is the story of how far you and your comrades made it before you died.

But that's what an early access is for.\n\nI'll be quick to note the ups/downs.\n\nDowns:\n-Turrets seem to always hit you in the back of the head when you're in fighting along side it in a hallway so I find myself dying from turret mishaps then the aliens themself.\n- Game isn't player friendly. ( doesn't bother me, but maybe to others.)\n- The flashlight doesn't really work..... Meaning. It only shows light maybe about two feet infront. ( Increase the range on it.)\n- Not a veriety of weapons. ( Personally I want to go HAM with a shotty ) and maybe give people two grenades.\n-Interactions are at a bare minimal. Very few things you need to do.\n-Repetitive. No other missions. Just get that data folks.\n-Needs further development\n-Multiplayer is kind of pointless on splitscreen for pc's. Until Online co-op comes into play. It kind of sucks being alone, 90% of the time.\n-Aliens seem a little, how shall we say it. Not as ruthless as they should be and not very scary. I kind of laughed when I seen the aliens thinking " what are they suppose to be? Bugs? Xenomorphs from the movie "Alien"?\n-Lastly, being killed on one hit and none forgiving system seems to me to be more or a burden then a pleasure. (but hey people like that stuff sometimes) I atleast would prefer to have a healthbar and be able to just take atleast one hit, and not die.\n-Ammo! Everyone loves large ammo mags and just to be able to hold down the trigger. Well. in this case you can, 500 rounds of awesome without a reload. ( Put mag cap limits like 50 rds before reload, for a more realistic feel.)\n\nUps:\n-Fast paced action and constantly moving around.\n-Turrets that help you.\n-Usuable blast doors.\n-Oldish kind of graphics.\n-The flow of the game is consistant.\n-NPC's are tough/fun to kill.\n-Being swarmed and running for your life. (creates an intense feeling of panic.)\n-Upgrades that really help you in the long run. (Not like COD perks like jugs. Hacking, infered, tracking etc.)\n-Co-op is extremly fun when you do get a group together.\n-The user interface is smooth and interesting. Reading the data logs on the side/ seeing them is cool.\n-Four different colors to choose from for the HUD\n\nThere's more ups than downs, trust me for the price it's still a bit pricey considering how us Steamers get burned from early access games. But for an alpha its still pretty good. Very polished for an alpha.|\n\n\nTo the developers if you read this.

This game is like that.\n\nYou ever play the old AvP games, where your heart starts racing as your motion tracker goes nuts?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/da_zet/recommended/357330/","da_zet","Zet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/da_zet/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game is fun, intense, unique, and runs smoothly while still looking very good, masterfully utilizing the gritty sci-fi aesthetic. The way your visor HUD ties into the gameplay itself is elegantly done and adds to the player's immersion, which compliments the adrenaline-pumping claustrophobic feel the game is going for. It is fast-paced and hectic at times, but still has a strategical element to it, as you can open/close doors, activate defensive measures like lazers and automatic turrets, and so forth, which I imagine comes even more into play in multiplayer. That, however, leads me to my major gripe about the game: the difficulty is incredibly unfair in singleplayer. Now I'm no stranger to hard games, I enjoy an extra challenge, but as a lone marine you will often find yourself in situations where survival is next to impossible, even on the easier difficulty. Enemies spawn in endless numbers and with seemingly no pauses or waves once they really start coming. Seeing as all that bulky space marine armour of yours apparently does little good against ravenous aliens, a single attack by the bigger variant will take you down for good. It is simply not possible to cover all fronts at all times, leading to the outcome of your mission in singleplayer being more up to hoping for the game to generate a very linear level with lots of turrets and safe zones more so than the actual skill of the player. Talking about death, for me personally the game lacks an incentive to keep playing (and dying) over and over again, other than the sheer mayhem of slaughtering aliens. Most games with permadeath mechanics give you some sort of reward that carries over between playthroughs. Space Beast Terror Fright rewards you with a small selection of randomized upgrades that are only kept on successful missions, and completely reset on death. (And you will die a lot in singleplayer, as I've pointed out.) Now this might appeal to you, but for me, and some other players I imagine, the lack of any sort of progression whatsoever might be frustrating. A thing that's not really a genuine criticism of the game but just an odd design choice is that FOV distortion and muzzle flare are initially absolutely ridiculous. You're going to have to tune it way down in the settings to be able to see anything. I imagine this will be adjusted on full release. (Keys are also not rebindable as of now, but seeing as the controls are surprisingly simple and intuitive, this isn't really a problem.)\n\nOverall Space Beast Terror Fright is a breath of fresh air in the FPS genre that is definitely worth experiencing, despite its issues.","February 21","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's extremely challenging, yes, and it doesn't come with a whole lot of variety in terms of environment. But what's there is the essence of everything that was awesome about the movie Aliens, in highly playable game form. The fact that one single alien can instantly kill you is both infuriating AND highly motivating. Furthermore, this game actually has a very cinematic gameplay objective which really elevates this from being just another shooter to something special.\n\nThere's still some online multiplayer issues to sort out, but the devs are highly active and release updates every few days.

I'm also a huge fan of the Aliens movie.\n\nSo despite how rough the game is, and the chugginess of the network, I really have been enjoying the game. The guns's flaring up and blocking your screen from the muzzle flash, The aliens creeping up on you as you watch your ammo counter slowly ticker down, enjoyable.\n\nReally a lot of people have captured it, with the game being Rougelike. You start off in your area, and from there go to different datacores, activate sentries, refill ammo, etc. Despite how simple the game is, the atmosphere is what sells it for me.\n\nSo give it a go if you can't wait for the upcoming Space Hulk game.

I like the game, its an old fashion shoot fest which is scary as hell and great fun in a group. its let down a little by the user interface and lack of different mission objectives but they don't stop the game from being fun. and as long as your internet connection is good, you should'nt encounter the most annoying problem with the game.","February 27","true","71.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is like that.\n\nYou ever play Space Hulk, where your team of super awesome battlesuited commandoes have to infiltrate a ship crawling with the stuff of nightmares that can kill them in one hit through their epic future armor?  This game is like that.\n\nYou ever play the old AvP games, where your heart starts racing as your motion tracker goes nuts?  This game has that, too.\n\nYou ever play the origianl X-Com, where every sound made you freak out because you just *knew* the chryssalids were coming to violate your men?  This game has that.\n\nHave you ever had that nightmare where you're being chased thorugh dark corridors by things you can barely see?  This game has that.\n\nFor Early Access, this game is extremely polished, and runs very well on my (non-gaming spec) laptop.\n\nForget the stupid title, or embrace it like it's a 1950s sci-fi horror B-movie.  Either way, this game is amazing, and that's just the single-player.  Multiplayer is even more intense and insane with you and up to three buddies trying not to descend into a collective Bill Paxton "game over, man!" panic attack.\n\nThis game already gets a 5/5 from me, and it promises to only improve as it continues thorugh Early Access.\n\n","August 5, 2015","true","112.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the feedback from the games developers is something special, they seem to be as interested in getting feedback from the players as they are in making the game itself.\n\nGood game, great devs.","July 28, 2015","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I NEVER BUY EARLY ACCESS GAMES ok? But after watching a let's play on YouTube my palms started itching, I knew I had to get this game. 16 hours in and counting, it is the best spent £11 of the year and easily the best game of 2015 due to sheer fun factor.\n\nAs the game is in early access, I got it just after patch 18 dropped and patch 19 has since been applied. The developers seem friendly and in touch with the community so I doubt they will abandon this ship mid journey.\n\nThe game itself is fun, hardcore, suicidal and addicting, but still fun. Think of the second "Alien" movie, "Aliens", combine that with rogue lite elements, a dash of space hulk, doom, castle wolfenstein and this game appears. At the moment you play either of two game modes; Salvage or deathmatch. I have spent 16 hours playing the Salvage mode, not really a fan of the deathmatch.\n\n\nThe salvage mode is simple, you board a ship, download datacores, shut down the ship's reactors to overload it to explode and get outta dodge before ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Sounds simple, right? Oh did I mention a zerg load of incoming gunning for you hell bent on feasting on your guts? Ah, I probably should have mentioned that earlier then. ;]\n\nAs you progress through a salvage scenario, downloading information to complete an objective randomly confers upon you additional features to your suit which can range from additional ammo stores, to infrared vision or a motion detector to your radar, or more. And for every completed mission, you gain rank and keep the upgrades won during the round but ACHTUNG, BABY; if you then die in the next round you will be reverted back to a fresh recruit straight outta boot camp for the next mission. You have been warned.\n\nThe game can be played both single play or a the steam mulitplayer lobby system. I recommend playing in Co-op though, as you will need additional guns to push the aliens back just a few seconds more to download the data for an objective or get a sentry gun up. It's always a mad frantic, hilarious dash from point to point. To make matters worse, some of  your capabilities get downgraded if you take a hit. And I really could spend the next 40 minutes reviewing my experience of the game, which; by the way is overwhelmingly positive, but I'd rather grab my gear and go shoot some bugs. What? Wanna live forever? ;]","December 24, 2015","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This also helps with it being a bit easier on older pcs after taking off some of the graphics options. The models of the aliens could use a bit work as there seems to be only two or three different alien models for two types of aliens. as of this time i am writing this, there are only space creeps and beast bugs.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is very urgent and pounding. This adds to the over all atmosphere the game tries to create, and once again works VERY well. though it got a bit trying once i heard music relating to imminent alien threat when they were actually behind a couple walls. not doors, walls.\n\nThe random/procedural generation does little to add to replay value since the only ways to play are gather logs and blow up the place or deathmatch. id be cool with the price if it had much more content to offer other than the same mission in different places. though every place looks different, it all feels the same. If they could get some variety in objectives, and a more varied internal environment as well as monster models, replay value would go up more.\n\nI have not yet tried coop and will offer an update when i do. all lobies ive tried are either private or in mission.\n\nThe only problems i have are repetetiveness in terms of gameplay, the unbelieveable price tag, the seeming lack of a difference between the weapons, and the lack of any reason why i should care about getting these data logs other than it will let me leave if i do. i think an escape mode would be awesome to try playing. I think this game has a lot of potential and should be tried, though i do believe the price is a bit high. however they did put in split screen (a rare gem when you hook up the computer to a tv via HDMI) and full gamepad support. plus multiplayer even though i havent tried it yet. They have done a lot of work and i think they should keep it up. I would recommend this eight ways to sunday. Gives me a reason to believe in my oppinion that all the official ALIENS games could be better than the crap they put out now.","January 15","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apatheus/recommended/357330/","apatheus","apat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apatheus/","184 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPremise: First-person, mp/co-op alien shooter.\n\nPlayability: Very simple controls: WASD, shoot and infra-vision. No crouching, jumping, reloading, changing weapons, etc. Maps are randomly generated and some variables are configurable. There is also a seed editor that lets you see how your map will look. Game runs like butter, but it can be a bit delicate w/ multiplayer: if anyone in the party leaves during the game, the entire games stops and kicks everyone back to menu. Being alt-tabbed seems to mess with the game a bit too.\n\nPlayers: All multiplayer modes are up to 4 players. Many narrow passageways, so watch your fire. Friendly fire is punished, but it's not over the top. There is a deathmatch mode, but it feels more tacked on as the game is meant to be co-op against aliens.\n\nPrice: $15, reasonable. May be slightly overpriced for what you get, but the game is EA and less than a year old.\n\nPraise: 3/4 Fun, high tension game. Needs more content in the form of aliens, map customization and game modes to completely justify asking price.","January 3","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
