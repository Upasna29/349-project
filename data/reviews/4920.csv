The objective is to destroy all enemy bases.\n\nIt is Aliens vs. Marines, each side has unique controls, weapons, and strategies.\n\nEach player has a first person view, and each team has 1 commander who has a top down view like a real time strategy game, directing the players on the field and giving them support and supplies when needed.\nA person should first understand the game and all units and structures, learn basic strategy, and play the game for a week or so before attempting to play as the commander.\n\nA mic silent game of Natural selection 2 is not a good thing. A player should always speak up if they want an upgrade from the commander, or see an opening for an attack. Do not stay silent and assume your commander or other players see what you see. The more information you share with your team, the better.\nI have seen countless matches where a team has control of almost all of the map, but end up losing, because they think that they've already won and don't need to communicate anymore. Slowly, the enemy team just wins all the fights and takes back the entire map.\n\nThis game also has good mod support, with some nice alternative game types, including one similar to gungame from counterstrike, where you simply try to destroy the enemy base, and you get upgrades and get better lifeforms through spending points. You get those points by killing enemies.\n\nThis game has a learning curve, you can't just jump in and start winning. It will take a lot of practice before you become good.\n\nIf you were thinking about buying it, you should definitely go for it. If you stick to the game past the learning curve, you will have loads of fun.\nPlus, the developers are still supporting it with free, very frequent updates, with new content such as new units and weapons, bug fixes and better optimization.","November 25, 2013","true","050.9"," 444 of 489 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","444","489","0","0"

That's all I can call it.\n\nNS2 isn't a bad game.  In fact, despite not personally recommending it, I still think it is a good game.  The problem is that it isn't a game I can recommend to others.  If you look at my hours I'm not someone who hasn't given the game a chance.  In fact, I beta tested the original NS1 mod.   When NS2 was announced and they asked for help to fund it, I purchased a few copies of Zen of Sudoku (another game they produced).  Then, when they were near finished NS2, I pre-purchased the game, sight unseen, long before release.\n\nSo I do support the game and the makers.  I just can't recommend it anymore.  Why?  Well the answer can be found in the game's development.\n\nThe big failure of the game is exactly what happened with NS1.  Basically the developers allowed a small--but vocal and intolerant--minority of players dictate the direction of gameplay development.  These 'pros', are basically the people and clanners who play games competitively and/or in tournaments.  Now I can see wanting to appeal to the 'pro' gamers as a means to generate interest, but there needs to be a balance between competitive and casual play.  Sadly, there never was.\n\nIn the end, the difficulty and learning curve puts this game well out of reach of all but the veterans.  New players are quickly steamrolled and wonder how the heck it happened.  What's worse is that they released the game without a trainer or tutorial mode.  While there is a basic 'sandbox' mode that helps to get a player acclimated to the game before they play, it's too little too late.\n\nI saw this all happen in NS1, and it saddened me when it happened here.  The competitive gamers basically co-opt the game, and casual players are forced to play at that high level or they don't play at all.  In my opinion, the logical way to develop the game would have been to introduce a 'tournament mode', with increased difficulty, for those dedicated players.  It could have been finely tuned to appeal directly to their form of play, while still leaving the game with a 'casual' player base that could actually play the game.  Unfortunately, the developers objected to this concept suggesting they didn't want there to be 'two games'.  But the reality is that difficulty levels are part of gaming.  That doesn't make it "two games", it makes it one game with two difficulty levels.\n\nWith the development team basically abandoning casual players, this basically meant that no matter how many sales they made, the new players never stuck around.  If you look at the history of the game, you will see that from the release in late October 2012 until the end of 2012, there was a large player base that bought the game and was playing.  Since everyone was still learning, it meant there was the potential for developers to cater to that casual player base and build their numbers further.  Instead, they went the other way, abandoning the casual player base in favor of the competitive and tournament players.\n\nOver on Steamcharts you can see just how the game started strong and then flamed out in a spectacular fashion.  ( steamcharts.com/app/4920 )   The all-time peak number of players online was just a bit shy of 10K.  At time of writing there were ~200 playing.  It's sad, it really is, since this could have been a much better overall game.\n\nThe nail in the coffin for this game was when development for 'game balance' was put in the hands of volunteers.  Since the game is easy to modify (in the LUA scripts), balance changes didn't have to be hard coded into the game.  As such, a bunch of people who felt they 'knew better' how the game should be developed were able to markedly influence balance changes by verbally bullying anyone who disagreed with them.  Anyone who dared question those who wanted to make the game harder were verbally ridiculed and harassed.  The game forums became toxic as a result, and casual players began their exodus.\n\nWell, those competitive players got what they wanted.  The game is exactly how they said it should be balanced.  It's too bad there is hardly anyone left playing now.\n\nWhat's worse is that the more appealing elements of the game--the highest level 'upgrades'--only show up when the outcome of the game is predetermined.  (which happens within the first few minutes)  Users who look and see the marine 'mech' robots and the 'rhino-size' alien don't realize that they will likely rarely if ever get to play them.\n\nThis game is a good example of what *not* to do when developing a game.  While I can see the appeal of competitive gaming to a game like this, it can't be at the expense of casual gamers.  Otherwise you kill the potential for the game to grow.  Look at TF2.  A game that is 'easy', but that can be hard based on the skill of the players.  That could have been how NS2 ended up.  Instead, the game is harder than ever.  What's worse is that they added a ranking system to which isolates players based on skill.  New players will find game choices limited as a result.\n\nSimple example of a poor balance choice?  In TF2, if you need to get health, you can pick up health kits (on the field or in spawn) and also be healed by the doctor.  In NS2 it used to be you could go to 'spawn' and heal up fully (health and armor) at the armory--like a med cabinet in TF2 spawn--and you could get health-only medkit drops in the field.  If one was away from spawn, armor could only be repaired with a welder. (like a medigun, except anyone could carry one if they bought it.)  However, the competitive complainers cabal (I love alliteration) pressured the person doing balance work to make it so the armory would no longer heal players.  In other words, once you lost armor you needed to be welded, and you can't weld yourself--other players have to do it.  The outcome of this change was that it made it that much harder for players to stay alive unless they are highly skilled.\n\nIn the end, I still play NS2, and I would recommend it to anyone who I felt had the skill to survive.  However, there aren't very many people who fit that description.\n\nUnless you are someone who considers themselves an exceptionally good FPS player, I would advise you give the game a pass unless it is deeply discounted and you're willing to take the chance the game may not be fun for you.\n\nWhile NS2 is--on the surface--a good game, it missed its chance to be a great one.","January 26, 2015","false","292.6"," 808 of 942 people (86%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","86","808","942","25","45"

However, Natural Selection 2 is twice as surprising in this regard as it innovates not in one, but two genres simultaneously.\n\nThe concept of an FPS/RTS hybrid has been around for quite some time though never properly executed by any major title in gaming. This has always puzzled me as there is no greater satisfaction than seeing a game unfold from both the perspective of an overarching command and the boots on the ground itself. While Natural Selection 2 is a purely multiplayer experience it excels in bring new exciting gameplay to the stagnating genre of first person shooters, most of which have simply resorted to throw bigger guns, toys, and vehicles at you. Instead Natural Selection 2 recognizes the strengths of its predecessors innovative gameplay and polishes it to make an impressive new clean-cut version of a game every gamer should try at least once.\n\nWhile this game truly shines because of its innovation and creativity it does not spare any expense on its presentation either as all the character and alien models are fantastic and really brought to life by the dynamic lighting, sounds, and overall atmosphere that is simply blooming in this games thematic atmospheres.\n\nThe first thing I noticed jumping into a lobby of NS2 is that cooperation between teammates is not only recommended but essentially necessary. This is absolutely phenomenal! There are too few games in this is online gaming world that actually demand that you interact with gamers in such a way as to properly execute a plan rather than everyone simply going at it alone, lone-wolf style. I've played my fair share of both Call of Duty and Battlefield and neither of those two triple-A giants require you to communicate with your teammates as much as NS2. If the new gaming era is going to strip us of local multiplayer and let us only play with strangers online, then they better give us a reason to want to talk to these people, and NS2 does just that by making the alternative to cooperation abject failure.\n\nThe reason that cooperation is so essential in NS2 is because of its unique gameplay featuring 2 asymmetrical sides, the aliens vs. humans, and furthermore one player on each side must be chosen as your Commander/Hive mind, who will view the entire map from above and play the RTS portion of the game building, giving orders, and researching upgrades. The twist of course being that apart from a few builder units the Commander/Hive mind has no forces under his direct control but only the other players on his team who benefit most from executing his orders. Again, cooperation is paramount and having seen the difference between a skilled commander and bumbling one you really get to understand just how effective or ineffective you can be as a player or a leader.\n\nAs for the gameplay as a soldier on the ground, the games generally proceed as follows. You will run out of your initial base to go seize the nearest resource point with your teammates and if you manage to control it without the enemy showing up then you will continue on to the next one. However, due to the impressive array of maps and the units/upgrades available to the different sides, you can never truly be sure just how easy or hard an objective given to you by your commander will be.\n\nLet us discuss some of the key differences between the sides at this point. The human marines are standard enough beginning the game with an assault rifle, pistol and trusty little hand axe. Throughout the game their commander will be attempting to accrue enough resources to get them upgrades such as shotguns, flamethrowers, jetpacks, better shielding, damage upgrades, and eventually mech suits. While all of these things seem like surefire upgrades from the starter equipment the truth is any of it is only as useful as the player who wields it.\n\nThe aliens on the other hand begin the game as the base unit known as the skulk, an equivalent of a zergling more or less which can only effectively attack via melee. They however, are naturally much faster at moving about and can make use of the maps numerous vents which marines cannot enter. These skulks can then evolve throughout the game into other creatures ranging from the builder/medic class of the Gorge, the swift flying Lerk, the deadly Fade and the almighty Onos. Each of these creatures has its own unique strengths, weaknesses and special abilities and knowing when to use each one is critical in being a good alien player.\n\nReturning to the gameplay itself, there are some caveats to be given to new players. This game is rather unforgiving and those who are not any good at shooters on the PC will not find any user-friendly playground here. Though there are beginner level servers they are often such only in name and host just as many veteran players as any other server. Gameplay is rather fast and frenetic and you may often find yourself saying things like "How didn't I hit that guy!?" or "4 of us ambushed him! How did he kill us all!?!" And unfortunately if there is one thing to be said about this game is that the learning curve is about as steep as the Hoover dam.\n\nThat is not to say that the community for the game isn't great, because since servers and players can sometimes be limited, dedicated gamers will do their best to teach newbies the ropes every chance they get. Yet despite the helpful tutors you'll run across you can't help but feel that the majority of people you are playing with in this game have simply come over from the Counterstrike community and have years of practice and experience over you. That being said, if you happen to be a CS gamer, this is your bag and you will feel right at home.\n\nThe truth is however, that despite sometimes going all game without even a kill, I could still make a difference in the match through my targeting of key objectives or even posing as a distraction for my teammates who could actually effectively hit a moving target. This is what makes NS2 so brilliant, that even if you aren't your teams Rambo who CAN take on 4 aliens at once, there is always something that you can do to make yourself useful, and if you really must learn how to be a Rambo then simply practice, practice, practice, and eventually you may get... your first kill. All jokes aside, there is such a vast gap between some players in the NS2 community and while the game may not be as accessible to newcomers as I would like, it generally tends to balance out throughout games.\n\nOverall NS2 is a real treasure for all gamers and tells the success story of an ambitious group of modders who managed to create a revolutionary game that I believe has not gotten the attention it deserves. If more studios focused on innovation rather than repackaging and retheming then we would have more games with the spirit and uniqueness of NS2. The FPS/RTS is still a largely underused genre and yet probably my favorite, and while NS2 may have a steep learning curve which may prevent it from being my go-to just because I don't have the time to dedicate to mastering it, it is still an unforgettable and incomparable gaming experience from which larger studios should learn from.","October 17, 2014","true","18.8"," 268 of 296 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","268","296","4","9"

While I understand that game review is subjective as all hell. Many people have shot this game down as it is different. Further concurring on the theory that innovation in video games is not truly desired by video gamers. This game is innovative, becoming it's own genre of video game that Steam does not have a tag for.\n\nNotes about the game(I believe a pros and cons list to be inadequate)\n-I, as an experienced StarCraft II player, have found commanding to be enjoyable, but slightly more dumbed down than a regular RTS. This is further multiplied by the simplicity of alien commanding. This, however, makes it easy for new players to pick up commanding\n\n-The FPS action is incredibly tense, with the players having to turn off all other sources of sound or music to listen for footsteps or instructions from the commander.\n\n-One concern I had when first starting was that I only liked playing marines, and I'm sure others have similar issues. I quickly learned that I could easily enjoy playing both sides. One must understand what they enjoy about each team before truly finding enjoyment.\n\n-This game is- in my experience on the NA servers- generally underpopulated. However, as of the Winter sale of 2015-2016, their has been a huge surge of new players, strengthening the community and playerbase.\n\nHelpful tips-\n\n-Be nice to rookies. The one thing that solidified my enjoyment of this game was a kind player urging me to be my best and guiding me when I had just began. A little kindness towards new players can and will strengthen the player base.\n\n-Carry a welder. Welders are cheap, available without any research, and can be truly vital in tense situations. Repairing a friendly's armor, or a marine in an exosuit can mean the difference between winning and losing.\n\n-As a skulk, remember that your life is less valuable than higher life forms. Remember to never be afraid to initiate a fight, with a higher life form like a fade or onos following suit. You will most likely die but you have paved the way for your team to win a fight without losing any important or expensive life forms.\n\n-Conceding can sometimes be the only option. Remember that there is always the option to concede by hitting x, and then selecting concede. Sometimes it is best, when new players join to just start fresh and hope for more even teams.\n\n\nFinal comments-\nNatural Selection 2 is a fantastic game, made by fantastic developers that are constantly updating and listening to community feedback.\nI would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fast-paced action, is able to communicate well with others without getting in fights(my brother has this issue), and can be a good loser, because a loss can sometimes be inevitable\n\nHappy Hunting!","November 28, 2015","true","70.6"," 138 of 153 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","138","153","12","4"

One team are Human Marines "Frontiersmen" and the other are Alien Lifeforms "Kharaa", each team featuring a completely asymmetrical way of playing against the other, making the gameplay very diverse and versatile, yet very balanced. The marines, mainly relying on ranged weapons technology like rifles, shotguns etc VS the aliens that will ambush lonely unsuspecting marines by jumping down from dark corners in the ceilings in dark hallways or flying past scared marines chewing on their legs or exposing them to lethal toxins like poisonous gas.\n\nNS1 was a mod from 2002 developed until 2007 for the GoldSRC (Half-Life) engine which was very popular #1 HL mod(moddb.com), and in the last few years, a few original key people formed the company Unknown Worlds Entertainment to work on NS2 to become real, a sequel on its own engine with more than 150,000 owners and thousands of daily players, AAA-quality, released Nov 2012, and still being supported and developed with many updates each month even one year later. The developers won't abandon this game like many other developers do. The game has an awesome community not only noticable in-game, some of which helped crowdfund the developement of the game before it was even Beta-released; or contributing huge amounts of cash to help funding further huge updates to the game like massive new maps, new features lifeforms and revolutionary changes etc etc etc.\n\nThe game is played in servers with player numbers ranging from 2 - ~32 players, however my sweet spot is around 16-20 players.

The Marines side is best for startes , its more streight forward and self explanitory. If you like call of duty or Titan fall than the marines will feel at home with you. As a marine you will need to dodge , strafe and jump often to avoid the bites of aliens and their pesky projectiles that will murder you VERY FAST! so dtay afoot. Each side has a commander who will order you the player to make and construct buildings and power nodes to expand your region of power ( Map control ) , early and mid game sentries are amazing to stop or mitigate a rush to an expansion if placed right by the commander. Late game Sentries add to the horde of your firepower so dont hesitate regardless of what players may tell you , sentries can still kill people in the end game.\n\nNow the aliens side... as the aliens you must spread infestation and build structures as the commander , they play much like the zerg from Starcraft. The aliens have a few distinct species , the Skulk who is what you as a player will initially spawn as. Skulks are fast if used correctly so wall jump often to build up momentum and use your speed to do circles around the ankles of a exo suit or marine to kill them becuase skulks have very low health. Than we have the gorge , a pig styled alien builder who can make or brake the aliens flow of battle by placing mini turrets called hydras , walls called clogs , minions to assist and tunnels to move the aliens a great distance to where they or you may need to be. Continuing on we have the bird ( cant remember the bloody name ) , a flyer who is very fast and cna bite / shoot projectiles to kill marines very fast , great for taking out a straggler or two on your way to a base. And onto the Fade , an assasin with a lot more hp  , use the fades ability to travel insanely fast around marines , confusing and disorientng them as you tear them apart limb from limb. Finally... The ONO'S ... a ultralisk - ish feel to them indeed as these tanky titans stampede through a squade of marines like scissors through paper , their only rivals being the exo suit and grenade luanchers which cost a pretty penny for marines and commanders alike.\n\nMachanics in a gist , Team work is a massive need so listen to the commander and do as he / she tells you becuase YOU are the unit of this RTS. Map control and aggresion are key to victory. A good marine with a jet pack can turn the tide of a infestation in a jippy with the commanders support , likewise a good fade can end a large scale assult in the right hands. Skill and stratigy combine in this game.\n\nNow is this Noob friendly... TBH , in my experience it is rare to find players who wont vote to kick you for being a new player , as a rookie your name will be green until you have reached a certain number of hours played on the game. So its very noticable if you are a new player. Even in " Rookie only servers " veterans will join and the balance that was once there will dicipate into a one sided fight very quickly. So If and onlly if the community was larger than yes this would be noob friendly but as of now , the community is quite small.\n\nCommunity : Is it good??? TBH in the few hours ive played I thought about going back to League of Legends becuase players here are very hostile to newer inexperienced players like myself. Only one server welcomed my scrubdubbery with open arms and there i learned how to play.\n\nFinnaly is it worth a buy???? Yes! , even though the community of this game is somewhat toxic , if you buy a four pack , its great with friends and great when you can actually play an all rookie game when you start out. the tutorial explains a good bit but not all of what you need to know , there is a low learning curve to the game and if you enjoy fps games , this is a new twist on a genre thats been stale for some time.","August 20, 2015","true","20.6"," 154 of 184 people (84%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","84","154","184","20","6"

I was slightly wary of this purchase though, as I have made bad choices in games in the past, but I decided it was worth a shot. I started it up, and as soon as I joined my first lobby, immediately loved it. The game concept is great, merging a sort of warped MOBA with an First person shooter. Throw some aliens in there and basiclly sums it up.\n\nThe game in essence is a moba, with two teams going at eachother, trying to destroy a immoble structure, but its so much more complicated then that. At the begining of the game, a commander is chosen for each team, a commander for the marines, and the "Queen" for the aliens. To win, the marine must destroy the Aliens "Hive" structure, where the Queen operates, and the aliens must destroy the Marines Command Station. Basiclly, the Commander/Queen is like Battlefield 4's Conquest mode, where either team's commander can virtually call in support, ping key points on map, research new weapons or technologies, and generally advise the team.\n\nResources are important to either team. They are gained from building extractors, and can be used to buy upgrades, and weapons.\n\nHowever, the Marines are arguably as important, if not moree, then the commander. While commander can call in buildings, it takes the Marines to actually construct them. The marines also do all the fighting, their arsenal consisting of a medium range assault rifle, pistol secondary, and combat hatchet. (God I love that unholster animation) The Commander can research new weapons to add to the arsenal, including shotguns, landmines, and a range of grenades. Mid-to-late game, the Commander can order a lab drop, which lets you buy (with enough resources,) flame throwers, or exo-suits. Marines expand their territory by building facilities, such as power generators, then extractors, and so forth. If Marines can get multiple bases running, they can build teleports, which let you sweep across the map faster.\n\nFor the Aliens, the game is very similar, yet so different. The "Queen" (Alien's commander) gets a skyhigh view of the map from her hive. She can ping areas, advise the team, and spread the infestation across the area. The aliens are very diverse.\n\nThe default alien is a skulk. It appears to be some sort of hybrid of a crab, and a hyena or something. They run much faster then marines, can scale walls, or even crawl across the ceiling, even using vents to their advantage. Their default melee can kill a Marine in 2 or 3 hits. It also has a far weaker range, called Parasite.\n\nThe second alien, and cheapest to evolve into, is the Gorge It generally resembles a turtle/hippo, with a swollen belly. It's attacks are all range, and involve it spitting up on Marines. But the Gorge's main purpose is to support. It can build Infestations, which cover rooms with swells of green goo. It's primary attack can also heal allies.\n\nLerks are the third cheapest alien evolutions. They resemble pterodactyls, and flies around, quickly striking down Marines at close combat, or picking them off with their ranged spikes. Very agile and hard to hit, Lerk's are a fresh pain in the ♥♥♥ for Marines.\n\nThe second most expensive evolution is the fade, the Fade is virtually an alien assassin, that can leap, teleport, and fade itself into invisiblity. Leaves Marines Wondering what hit them.\n\nThe biggest evolution there is, usually a mid-to-late game version, is the Onos. Basiclly the alien equivalent of an exosuit, this thing appears to be a huge rhino, dinosaur mother hubbard that charges its way through enemy lines. It absorbs damage in its shell, and excels at smashing Marine structures to pieces.\n\n\nThe game is amazingly fun to play, and much more diverse then the average moba. Unfortunately, there are a few cons. There is literally no progression systems. Of course, good Mobas really don't need them, as progression is'nt the point of the game. (Unless you play LoL, and your spending twenty bucks on a revealing outfit for your female champion.) But there are not even leaderboards, apart from some server's fanmade versions.\n\nThe other problem I have with this game is its rarely updated. Currently there is 4 maps, but I believe there is definetely room for more. Of course, the way most of the game is already is pretty balanced, and trying to change the roots of it would not be good, but this game needs some DLC. Some kind or reskin, weapon modifications, anything.\n\nOverall this game deservers 8, or even 9 out of 10. It is one of my favorite games, and I hope to enjoy this game for many more years.\n\n","December 30, 2013","true","6.4"," 91 of 106 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","91","106","0","5"

The community is still quite active and is far less dickish than most, which, to me, is a rarity in this age of games going out of style once they're no longer the flavor of the month.\n\nThe gameplay, while obviously an FPS, is very much dependent upon the strategic layer, and vice versa. What this means is that the commander's role is absolutely vital to the success of the players on foot, and their capability to win their encounters affects whether or not he can expand; it's not like Nuclear Dawn or some other RTS/FPS hybrids where one element is gimped or neutered while the other is fleshed out.\n\nMy only complaint would be the devs' tendency to change things unnecessarily every other week, with minor balance patches or changes throwing the whole game out of whack. The game as it is now is NOT the same game it was at launch, not by a long shot. If you can keep pace with the changes and roll with the punches, however, it's excellent fun.\n\nOne crucial tip for new players would be to use your microphone, if you have one (I know you do). Communication with your team is key. Don't be afraid to pipe up on voice, and always keep an eye on your map (bound to the C key by default).","August 31, 2013","true","352.3"," 117 of 147 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","117","147","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/recommended/4920/","jhaxavier","Haxavier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/","312 products in account","I'll tell you why you may want to skip over NS2, but let me start on a positive note.\n\nNS2 is a bold step in an industry full of very similar multiplayer experiences. Multiplayer is asymmetrical, with each team featuring multiple classes and vastly different approaches to play between teams. Rounds require the participation of not only individual teammates and their skill, but also the (micro)management skills of a commander, acting in an RTS role. These factors lead to NS2 having not only very deep tactical gameplay, but also a very large skill curve to climb and become immersed in. The results of fully embracing and immersing yourself in these systems can lead to a very fun and utterly different kind of gameplay which is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nNow I'm going to tell you why you may want to pass on getting this game.\n\nUnless you are prepared to adopt the committed ethic and mindset of a competitive gamer when going in, you're going to have a very rough time; or at least a very inconsistent experience. The difficulty curve is downright brutal. Maps are huge, complex sprawls with a lot of tactical options hidden away in the architecture and terrain placement. They take a lot of time to learn. Gameplay, even for the human side (which you'd think is in more familiar territory for most people) is not too hard to get a handle on at first, but the leap from functional play to consistently effective technique is ENORMOUS. It also does not help that the core community of this game consists of very talented and highly competitive players that one of them alone can stack a team to an almost assured victory.\n\nThe other major problem that this game presents for new players is related to its greatest strength - its complexity and essential reliance on communication and teamwork for success. This depth ensures almost DOTA-like skill and tactical moments to shine in league play, but in pub play it is a different story. The reliance of one person, the commander, to basically support the rest of the team to ensure victory can be a huge liability in pub play, as having the wrong guy in the commander chair can spell instant doom for a match - very frustrating when it happens consistently. Unlike a lot of other games, like Battlefield and Team Fortress, in which throwing a lot of like-minded players at common objectives usually results in emergent teamplay, constant voice and text communication is essential to a fun and successful game in NS2. Sometimes you get lucky and have a lot of teammates who communicate effectively and listen to orders from the commander. A lot of the time, this isn't the case, and it's frustrating.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned complexity, another problem arises. A small mistake by the commander, or players under him/her can lead to the team's doom in the early stages of the game. Most of the time everything goes smoothly early on and you roll the team, or you lose a battle early on and it's all over.\n\nAnyways, at the end of the day, I'll say this. If you're prepared to immerse yourself in NS2 completely - make it your religion, as you would with a game like DOTA - you're probably going to have a great time with its tactical complexity and heavy reliance on teamwork. If you're not that hardcore, you're going to play an interesting game, with interesting levels, but with an enormous skill curve and a lot of frustration trying to deal with players who seemingly cannot be killed or bested in any way.\n\nMe, I'm not that hardcore. I played the game, it was fun while it was interesting, but after 50 hours I can see some of the complex mechanisms move about and I realize I'm simply not a bad enough dude to become one of those 142 - 2 k/d kinds of players that you'll no doubt run into if you play this game.","December 4, 2013","false","53.7"," 323 of 480 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","323","480","0","20"

Two different commander roles that play completely different. every marine weapon serves a different purpose. Jetpacks change the way marines can engage, and Exos change the way aliens have to engage.\n\nVery skill based. there is not many things in this game that can get you kills without some level of skill, and to play decently you need to learn the maps, and have a good memory-map of your surroundings, and be VERY aware of sounds.\n\nSound based gameplay makes it feel different to other games.\nIn NS2, oftentimes i'll be calling out what i hear in the next room, or i'll hear a faint click of a skulk, giving away his hiding spot. Hearing the marine reloading, giving you a 2 second window to get some free hits.\nyou need to be very aware in this game, and i would say being able to know how many, and exactly where skulks/marines are before you enter a room is the most crucial skill to have.\n\nEvery game plays out differently\n\nGeneraly friendly community (at least in AUS, i cannot speak for the rest of the world.)\nCons\n\nSteep learning curve. the game can take a good amount of time to learn how to play decently, and it is not a game you can pick up casualy and play well in. it takes some amount of time investment to get the most out of Ns2.\nEspecially when learning to play aliens, as they play drasticly diffrent to anythnig else from other games. and i would reccomend checking out one of my guide videos  here  if you want to play alien more effectivly.\n\nRookies cannot just jump into the commander role. Being such a crucial role, many people do not like inexperienced players jumping in without asking first, or someone volunteering to teech them (i do that all the time) so expect to not see that portion of the game for a while unless you use a mic, or someone offers to teach you.\nAnd on AUS servers, it isn't unheard of to have a rookie command, with someone like myself coaching them.\n\nSome players can get quite hostile and newer player, but in my experience it happens far less often on AUS server than on NA ones. that said, don't let it get to you, and try to communicate, i've found it becomes quite hard for some people to yell at someone who has a voice, because suddenly they aren't just words-on-a-screen (same goes for any other game)\n\n"Stacking" Though oftentimes, it is unintentional, some amount of games end up with most of the experienced players on one team, making for a very short and unenjoyable game for both parties.\nIt is often up to the players to fix the problem, though certain mods do try to deal with the problem (or make it worse in soem cases)\nIn AUS, we may try to pick teams manually, and swap a few players around to improve the balance a little. to avoid these sorts of games, but when people aren't willing the game can get quite frustrating.\nSummary\n\n\nI wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys communicating and working with other people. as well as strategy, and fast paced shooters. this game has it all, and no other game is as addicting as ns2 to me :D\n\nI have some more detailed notes on some of the topics above, but i am running out of time, so i'll leave it to you to read them if you so wish.\n\n\n\nCommunity\nIn the negative reviews, one of the main complaints i see is of the "toxic" community, and the low playerbase.\nI can't speak for the other parts of the world, but in AUS, everyone knows each other, and as long as rookies make an effort to listen, and take advice, and even better, use a mic or type back! no-one treats them any different.\n\nAnd even in aus, where the playerbase can't be any more than 100 people, there is ALWAYS a server running in peak times, the playerbase of this game is small, but dedicated, and new faces can only make it better.\n\nIn fact, myself and a few others often go out of our way to help teach rookies the basics, and try to pull them through the games steep learning curve (i'll get to that later)\n\nLearning the game\nProbebly the biggest reason for many rookies not enjoying the game is the steep learning curve, which is only made more difficult recently, because a large majoraty of the playerbase are well experienced (especially AUS servers) and how crucial teamwork and listening to your team can be.\n\nDon't buy this game expecting to be able to go rambo-mode and ignore your team, you WILL die a LOT. oftentimes, rookies in their first 10 hours will get little to no kills each game, but DO NOT let that discourage you, if you can manage to get past the inital hardships, you will enjoy the game more and more, trust me.\n\non a side note, to anyone wanting to learn how to play aliens more effectivly, i DO have some helpful material on my youtube channel here.  here\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Ns2 is  incredibly deep and complex to the new player, the "classes" alone take a long time to master, and you will never be able to master them all, you will always be better at one type of weapon/lifeform than another.\n\nThe gameplay is heavily focused on map control, and coordination between team members, if one team is too agressive, even if they are slaughtering the enemy team, one or two palyers destroying resource nodes in the unprotected side of the map can quicly turn the tide, but that requires quick reaction time, and coordination.\n\nA player does not need to be getting kills to be useful, they only need to be where the enemy isn't, hitting res nodes is very important, and if one team holds more than 4 nodes for too long the game can start to snowball and one side will gain late game teach early, and the only option may be a last ditch base rush or a concede vote.\n\n\n\nBackground\nI first started playing the game way back in Dec 2012 and have been playing it on and off since then, but it wasn't until i got an average computer setup in Jun 2014, thus being able to play with higher than 20fps...\nThen being invited into a competitive team, and learning the finer points of the game, and drasticly improving my own performance. recently? i've taken to recording Ns2 games (among other things) to my youtube channel as a kind of hobby, and i'm one of the few youtube channels still around doing so.\n\n","January 15","true","376.4"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","47","52","4","1"

Bots will be a poor introduction for teammates and opponents, but at least you'll know what buttons do what and what you should (generally) be doing, in a match.\n\nThere is a decent selection of available toys to play with, in game (standard fare, generally, but "all these oldies are goldies")\n\nRounds... Playing the game... here is where things fall apart.. "People"..\n- Someone needs to step up as Commander, which can take upwards of 5 minutes, as nobody wants to Comm and get yelled at for being a failcomm.. So unless you have nerves of steel or natural talent, best of luck if you want to try your hand at playing Commander.\n- Forfeiture. 1 in 5 rounds will end in a team-wide ragequit (usually because they don't like their Commander) as soon as the team loses any amount of ground. About %10 of these forfeitures will be the Commander recycling all of the team's structures.\n\nLoad times are kind of long, but it offers one the opportunity to take a bio-break or whatever (make a snack, do your taxes, read War and Peace).. The long load times can become trying, when rounds have repeated fail-starts... But it is tollerable, in general.\n\nThat said.. This game has been some of the most fun I have had with a multiplayer FPS. The Commander/RTS aspect of the game adds some really neat aspects to the game, such as organic objectives (more than just "kill them before they kill you, a la Counter-Strike or "Stand in a ring until it is blue" like any point-capture game.. Not that I have anything against them, just that NS2 has added a new element that I prefer over the others)\n\nDo I suggest this game to others? If they are fans of FPS and RTS games, it will offer some unique gameplay experiences.\nWhile the game is tough to pick up, it is rather rewarding to learn and perform even marginally well.\n\nTL;DR - Game's not crap, community can be.

And not just new players, but anyone who has a differing opinion really to the mainstream elitist mentality. The community is completely toxic to normal people and their peasant opinions. "git gud" basically. Good luck to new players with green names because if you don't clock in at least 60 hours, people give you ♥♥♥♥ for "sucking."

They were popular for a good reason because it was actually fun to play. The dev's ruined that now by "hiding" those servers thus essentially killing off their biggest playerbase: casual/light gamers. People need to get their high horse out of their asses and understand that not everyone can clock in 1k+ hours and even those that do just want to relax and enjoy a good game at the end of the day. Not be two big macs away and a diet coke from a bursting a vein. Now the only 3-4 servers that you can play in NA are just completely ruined either due to terrible balance between the two races or just simply being full almost 24/7. And if you want to join an EU server because you happen to play at 7 AM, good luck because EU/Russia doesn't want our laggy comcast asses. So have fun in the 4 NA servers that are left. Which btw, there's always one or two guys who absolutely carry one team the entire time and you are just praying that they leave. Until another 4k hive score guy comes in.\n\nAs far as patches go, the game is pretty unbalanced as of patch 299. Several of my fellow ns2 players are leaving solely because of this patch. They each have 1k - 2k hours. That in itself speaks volumes of how the devs only listen to the circlejerking community of the top 10 players who constantly whine about adding stupid ♥♥♥♥ like a broken OP HMG while consistently nerfing aliens because they miss ns1 but don't want to go and play ns1. Instead they want to make ns2 become ns1 with fancier graphics. And also ♥♥♥♥ing up aliens. Thank god Overwatch will be out in a couple days from now. I can finally uninstall this increasingly frustrating, broken, elitist, ♥♥♥♥ing game. Thank you blizzard.\n\n\n","May 21","false","009.4"," 64 of 86 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","64","86","10","10"

For 3 years, I played this game religiously and logged as many hours as I had in CS:S and TF2 previously. At a time, I would have rated this game much higher than both of those AAA titles. Sure, the public servers were always and still are a bad case of teamstacking due to a lack of in-game matchmaking or a proper team skill balancing system, and the game released full of bugs and was terribly optimized leading to an immediate and huge dropoff of players and dooming the game to a tiny community for the rest of it's existence... but the core game was an excellent foundation, and over the years with the help of the balance mod "CompMod" and "Pub Friendly Comp Mod" by Dragon as well as key quality of life mods like "NS2+" by mendasp and "Shine" by Ghoul (not to mention some long needed bug fixes and optimization), the game became great. The greatest game I ever played.\n\nBut not anymore. I can no longer recommend this game for anyone. Not for any price, not even if it was free; I wouldn't wish this abomination of a game upon anyone.\n\nThe developers (UWE), in some misguided attempt to help "new player retention", using some bizarre reasoning to "help the game grow" have actually started killing their own game. The most popular servers for the last 3 years, now dead. The one league there was for this game: dead. The games only competitive matchmaking system (NSL gathers): dead. The amazing mod "CompMod" mentioned before? Dead, with random features from it stripped and screwed with and thrown into the vanilla game in a poor attempt to "shake up gameplay".\n\nThe developers of this game have ignored the community for so long, and their continued ignorance has now ruined the game for me, and so many like me. F*ck UWE. F*ck NS2.\n\nUWE: The balance is f*cked, and NS2's most loyal players are quitting and moving on, the majority of the remaining community hates you and your most dedicated and essential modders are sick of dealing with you.

The alpha and beta releases seemed interesting but you could barely play them because of the horrible performance. Thankfully, the game has been optimized since then and it runs decently these days (Obviously still not the best optimization when it comes to newer games.) That aside, it's one of the few games that successfully blends in RTS and FPS gameplay where you need a commander to build structures, order your field players around the map and eventually win the game. I've never fully enjoyed multiplayer games where you can go around solo and kill everything by yourself. Surely that's possible in NS2 as well if your opposing team doesn't know how to work together. Teamplay is the key word here, it basically forces you and your teammates to work together in order to win the game.\n\nI've bought this game so many times it's ridiculous. Pre-ordered it three times, bought several copies after the release and even got the humble bundle package a couple of times just so it could get more active players.\n\nCommunity is friendly and mods are keeping the game alive and kicking, whether you want different models or some UI tweaks, it's all available in the steam workshop.\n\nOverall, it's a multiplayer game where teamwork is absolutely required. Don't like that? Then the game is not for you. However, if that concept seems like it could keep you entertained, then don't hesitate to buy.

I'll give it an 8/10\n\nSuggestions:\nIt is a real time strategy and first person shooter.  If you don't like the RTS part you don't have to command your team, just ask someone else too.  Make sure you listen to your commander if he even talks.  This game is very fun when you get to learn it.  The biggest problem for me was it has a pretty steep learning curve.  You will join a server (hopefully it will be a rookie friendly server) and have NO IDEA what to do, maybe even after you played the tutorial.  It took some time learning.  If you can find a siege mode server you should try that.  The flow of the game play will be more repetitive instead of people trying to do different strategies you don't understand.  You will die alot.  Your best bet would be to play as a supporting player and watching what other people do.  Grab yourself a welder as a marine or follow people around as a gorge.  You will be killed by a skulk almost EVERYTIME before you finally manage to get lucky or see them before they see you.  Yet when you play as a skulk you will probably get killed EVERYTIME until you at least get a few hours in.  The game could change in a heartbeat if you have a good commander on either team.  What I like to do?\nXenocide alot\nIf you get an exosuit stay back and blast the alien scum from a distance,\nDon't be a hero\nDon't do things alone\nWhen someone wants to rush in or your commander says so make sure everyone is there before you do\nDon't ignore your resource nodes\nFor the love of god don't hop in the com chair when you don't know what you are doing.  You will be burned alive\nIf people want to be jerks to you just ignore them or go someplace else\nJoin a rookie friendly server.\nMake friends with the mods and admins\nDon't say I don't know what to do (say what it is you need help with instead)","November 7, 2014","true","52.6"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","33","40","0","0"

Of course it 'had to be launched for financial reasons' and I love the developers but I really wish they had an extra few years to flesh it out and then do the release. The main issues being performance, lack of in-depth or interactive tutorial, and a real way to have a form of player made matching which is for sure the new standard in all forms of video games, especially competitive video games.\n\nA lot of the negative reviews and feedback came from the games launch and thus I think really hurt the playerbase, and new potential players. The game didn't really come with an in-depth tutorial for this generations of 'everything in front of me, learn nothing' demographic of gamers. These new gamers also do not like to be demolished by veterans and learn from their mistakes, instead they blame things on cheats or simply complain and then remove the game from their library's and continue back with something more casual.\n\nThe developers were very active in the forum and with updating even to this date. The community is great and really keeps the game alive and thriving. In its current state I for sure recommend you try it out if you like competitive fps what so ever. But don't always expect to find a server with your preferences as there isn't too many running. Especially if you like small player counts and not an excess of mods.\n\nAs for the developers they continually work on other projects and I recommend you follow them and their products if you value your pc games. They keep a great community and really take into account player feedback.. it's pretty much your duty as a gamer to support developers such as this to keep the pc community thriving.. or else you'll end up with some multi-million dollar recycle every year that your three year old brother could play on a high level.\n\nI love this game, its community as I said before, and the developers.

We’ve been conditioned by eons of evolutionary pressure to equate a simple formula: symmetry=beauty. Our primate brains are built for symmetry, since a significant portion of our grey matter is dedicated to the detection of it. We can discern within fractions of a second whether an object is symmetrical or not. This has profound effects on civilization. Generally speaking, people with highly symmetrical faces have more self-confidence, get hired more easily, are judged by workplace superiors to be more productive and intelligent, get more promotions, make more money, get more… well, you get the picture.\n\nAnd what does this teach us about ourselves? That we’re a society of shallow sycophants? Yes, but it also teaches us that we are hardwired symmetry seekers; that we can’t help but be blindly drawn to symmetry like moths to the electric bug zapper. *Pop*. Fortunately, us gamers have learned to subdue our symmetry seeking boner missiles, probably due to prolific internet pornography fappery; okay maybe not due to that, but whatever the cause, we’ve learned the hard lesson that perfect symmetry in videogames is boring.\n\nThus, most competitive multiplayer games have at least a little bit of asymmetry. The devs add just enough differences to the teams to produce faction flavoring, or they place the teams in asymmetric roles (i.e. assaulter vs defender, King of the Hill). All of this is just dandy, and we like to call it “gameplay depth”. However, treading too far down the wrong fork in Asymmetry Lane can lead to the developmental shantytown known as Balance Patch City: a dark domain in the midst of a constant process of buffing and nerfing that can leave the local player community distraught and burnt out, a community who’ve in turn been reduced a collective of fetal positioned, thumb sucking man-children babbling random strings of capital letter text that include phrases like “GAME=BROKEN”, “NERFPOCALYPSE”, or (Christian Bale’s favorite) “WHAT DON’T YOU ♥♥♥♥ING UNDERSTAND!?”\n\nThankfully, Unknown Worlds Entertainment has utilized their excellent navigation skills and have expertly trodden the full length of Asymmetry Lane. Aye, they’ve fought through the mines of Moria, passed the silvery towers Gondor, simply walked into Mordor, scaled Mount Doom where they threw a sheet of papyrus scribed with the word “symmetry” into the fires at the heart of the earth (a purely symbolic gesture, of course), and rode a disfigured gryphon all the way to Asymmetry Heaven. The end result of this epic journey? Natural Selection 2.\n\nNS2 smashes head-on two opposing forces featuring polar opposite combat doctrines with an effect more dazzling than the quark-gluon plasma spewing forth from the Large Hadron Collider. Scientists are still baffled by its success.\n\nWithin this game you will take on the role of the Frontiersman, a Trans-System Federation grunt in a future where a space-faring civilization has taken a little time away from mudane tasks like warping space-time and building Dyson's Spheres to produce something so incredible that it is rarely seen in Science Fiction: a recoilless assault rifle. Mind blowing right? What will you do with this deadly accurate weapon? Like any good Space-American, you’ll use it to shoot anything that moves during an extra-terrestrial first contact scenario of course! We wouldn't want such a relationship to get off on the wrong foot after all, so you’ll be using your stand-off ranged capabilities to create interlocking fields of fire while taking solace in the knowledge that the word "questions" was removed from the dictionary three centuries ago. Watch those corners, watch those corners!\n\nAlternately, you’ll be playing as the Kharaa, a misunderstood biomass collective of intelligent bacteria that can morph into higher lifeforms. Since you hate being roasted by the wanton use of flamethrowers, you’ll be using your biomass to morph into savage creatures with hardened carapaces, regenerating flesh, and poison gas for flatulence. No, not the Addams Family. Your cast of characters will include such melee-expert heavyweights as Skulk Hogan, Lerk Skywalker, Gorge Foreman, Walker - Texas Fade, and the dreadfully hideous Yoko Onos. You’re built for the ambush, so dark corners and high speed maneuvers augment your offensive capabilities.\n\nNS2 takes this first-person asymmetry gaming perfection and kicks it up a notch Emeril Lagasse style. You take ¾ cups of FPS and throw in ¼ cups of RTS and BAM! You’ve got a full cup of “omg I can’t believe this actually works, what sorcery have you conjured to mix oil and water!?” hearty gaming goodness. That’s right boys and girls, one of you maggots (term used figuratively if you’re a Frontiersman, but very, very literally if you’re an incubating Kharaa xenomorph) is going rise to the call and transcend your mere 1st person existence to actually take semi-omniscient command of this needless bloodbath. The rest of you… well, you get to play your favorite units from Starcraft; that’s right, the indomitable SCV and the expendable Zergling. So grab yourself a welding tool Jonny Rico and go build my resource extractors! (Welding just not cutting it for you? Worry not because the Mutalisk, Ultralisk, Goliath, and Firebat also make faithful but legally distinct appearances in this title.)\n\nAs the commander you have access to the full suite of typical RTS institutions. There's the top down view, resource management, tech trees, upgrades, deployables, the left click, and the all important right click. You'll have your hands full trying to wrangle the units at your disposal. Only now instead of your units following your orders with unconditional obedience, you'll have to guide them through the delicate process of helping them arrive at the conclusion that, yes, sacrificing themselves in a suicide assault is good for them. Look, "Offensive Pattern Picard Distraction Phallus 8-D" is good for you because it's good for the team. Oh you get it now? Good for you... now run along and die like a good little Redshirt. Kay thanks.\n\nFortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and can teach less experienced competitors superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and will stomp less experienced competition with superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge. Whoa, déjà vu.\n\nThe point of that "it's a good thing/it's a bad thing" dichotomy was to highlight the fact that NS2, like almost all other games, has a learning curve. This one is fairly steep, so as a new player prepare to be overwhelmed. However, please unbind your Ragequit button and stick this one out; you need to keep in mind that you've entered a digital world that has never before been executed so flawlessly. No, not even the beloved Battlezone from '98 managed to mix FPS and RTS with this level of finesse (although, if you're looking for an excellent singleplayer version of this experience, that classic gem is a must play for you). You are now treading in uncharted territory never before probed by the gaming populace. With a little patience you too can navigate your way to enjoyable and memorable gameplay experiences.\n\nMy advice to new players: stick close to the guy with the shotgun. Unless your a Skulk, then run, run away from the gun with the shotgun! No! Don't stop to look behind you, HES RIGHT THERE! KEEP MOVING YOU IDIOT!\n\nThe bottomline: if you haven't lived vicariously as an ankle-biting, wall-climbing zergling... then you haven't lived at all.

The combat is very fun and you can do all types of strategies and builds each game, such as fast expand for aliens to get xenomorph or human fast expand with warp gate tech or harassing human extractors with skulks with aliens which is one of the best ways to get yourself back into the game as aliens.\n\nAll in all 9/10 Very good game I would recommend.","October 3, 2014","true","50.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

Admittedly the learning curve is very steep, but once you get into it it's really addicting. Contrary to other reviewers here I had only positive experiences with the Natural Selection Community. Generally everyone is very nice to each other because good team play in Natural Selection is even more important than in CS or TF2. There aren't as many servers as there used to be but it's still no problem to find active games with enough players. The game is 4 years old but the graphics still look awesome and the overall design is just timeless. If you are a casual player and just want an easy game you will be frustrated.

After previously writing about not liking the online part of MMO's I've decided to write about one where it's essential and largely why I'm hooked. So what is NS2?\n\nNatural Selection 2 is a first person shooter (FPS) with real time strategy (RTS) elements. There are two teams, marines and aliens and the goal is to eliminate the enemies base (or bases). In each map you begin with a standard base and someone on each team elects to be a "commander". This commander plays the role of the RTS player and everyone else are the units who fight. Each map there are resource points you need to capture and gain more map control.\n\nTeam work in this game is key, without it you lose. It's a simple rule.You have work as a whole team and as individual groups. Covering each other, helping build buildings and protecting them, listening to commands and constantly moving forward trying to secure more ground. If you venture out yourself you're most likely going to die unless you have superb aim, even then a well executed attack by a couple of enemies and even your aim won't save you. Because of this, a losing team could come back from the brink.\n\nI've played games where the whole map is lost to us and we have only our little base to camp in and through some amazing team work, quick thinking and some luck have turned the tables completely and I've had the same happen to me while on the winning team. That thrill of coming back or the shock horror of all of a sudden be losing is exhilarating. A game is almost never set in stone makes you play smart, always be on your guard and expect anything. To me this is rare in most games. This game relies on a lot of components to gain a win (a good commander, good players, map control, constant awareness, resources, etc.) that it's hard to have the upper hand on all of those which means by the virtue of so many facets, that it's usually a more balanced competition. On the other hand, with so much to juggle it's easy to be overwhelmed.\n\nThis is the one thing I appreciate most of all from this game, the friendly community. It can take some time to understand how the game works and even longer to get good at it. I've seen many a player in a server with everything thinking "what the hell is that guy doing?" and for them to say "sorry guys, I'm new". In my experience in other games I've seen the person either be told off or ignored, in NS2 the majority of people have actually instead helped. They tell them what they're doing wrong, how to do it right and things to be aware of in between. This even happens with people new to commanding (with out a decent commander you are almost bound to lose) and people teaching them and being supportive throughout it all. It honestly makes me truly happy inside to see this considering where the community stands today.\n\nThe gaming community can be a horrendous pit filled with anger and childish behavior that seems to be endless. This is where most of me grew up, gaming is something I love and I know most in this community out there feel the same way and it hurts to see the vocal minority who have nothing but vitriol to spit being the larger voice to represent us all. There is some of this in NS2 but there is much more kindness to balance it out.\n\nNS 2 is a small community compared to other games and maybe that's what guides it down a gentler path. There are not many of us so the more we push away the less of a chance the game we enjoy will stick around. So we try not be an ♥♥♥ and instead help to guide these and hopefully they'll do the same in time. That's something I can be proud to be part of.\n\nWith a high challenge, the to and fro of games and an awesome community filled with decent human beings I can't help but to constantly jump back in to a game when ever I have free time.","December 7, 2014","true","353.6"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","1"

It's PC centric with none of the dumbed down console design plaguing 90% of games this last generation.\n\nWhile the heart of its addictiveness and its frustrations is the competitive nature against other human players instead of vs AI. If there's a reason you will keep playing NS2, it will be because of the players you will be sharing this unique gameplay experience with.\n\nBut it also has two very major problems that everyone who has played NS2 has experienced at some point - Performance & Balance. Few people have a computer capable of running NS2 at a steady 60 FPS throughout an entire match; the Lua coding and the engine has had a long history of criticism. And the game requires hundreds of hours to master its mechanics, that were majorly changed as of build 250 requiring a renewed learning curve.\n\nBalance however has always been a topic of debate since the beta, the main problem with the way the game is being balanced is UWE's obsession with trying to turn it into a competitive 6v6 e-sports rivaling that of SC2. The small crowds at events and the low amount of views can be defined as very niche, yet this is what the game is being balanced for; NOT for public play or for the majority of people that quickly join and leave NS2 throughout its sales.\n\nMy personal experience with NS2 is hard to define...the first 5 months I used a mic, tried 6v6 pugs, experienced a lot of a-holism from people and played on a 1280x720 resolution. It was stressful, I hated it and ended up quitting.\n\n5 months after with a much better computer & mouse, I picked the game up again as build 250 came out. Performance and balance issues were still very frustrating, the game was basically an on-going beta. But playing with people I became very familiar with is the reason I kept sticking around, as well as the mastery we humans care deeply about.\n\nDo I love or hate NS2? Some aspects I love, and some things about it I can't stand. It's a bittersweet experience, the game has stayed alive because UWE keeps it alive with constant updates. However it's obviously not financially viable for them. So sooner or later NS2 will fade into obscurity if it isn't already.\n\nI think for me, NS2 might have been the pinnacle of anything coming out in the next 5-10 years that has made me invest as much time into it as I have. I think the only thing I might have spent more time playing, is StarCraft.\n\nEdit: As far as clarifying how I feel about this game retrospectively, NS2 had an amazing concept, one-of-a-kind; but the execution of the public multiplayer, the balancing and the decision of UWE to code their own engine probably doomed this game. And having played NS2 for 10 months, public games are 90% frustration and 10% balanced teams; same complaint I've heard from many whom used to play NS2.\n\nAnd it always had a small player base for a multiplayer game, exceptions were when thousands of players would be joining and then leaving within like 2 weeks of major updates or sales. Thus I'm pretty sure that the small size of the remaining active player-base, makes a match making system completely redundant considering you need to fill up 12-24 slots; and at down-times you're lucky to find one full server in EU.\n\nI regret wasting a whole year on a game that mostly brought me stress and contempt, but I have no regrets about all the experiences I've had with the hundreds upon hundreds of players I've met throughout all my time spent with it. Whether it be good experiences or bad, I have learned from them all and as a result; I have grown both as a gamer and as a person.\n\nI guess when all is said and done...Natural Selection 2, caused me to evolve :)","September 20, 2013","true","760.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","1"

Asymmetric teams!\nThe aliens have several completely different, specialised classes, all of whom mainly rely on melee combat. To their aid the aliens have a wide variety of movement abilities and possibilities.\nThe marines play like a regular FPS and are defined by their equipment.\n2. The game is at the same time an RTS!\nOne player on each team takes the role of commander with all the traditional RTS elements, as top-down view of the map together with building placement, technology research, expansion and resource collection - from resource points spread out on the map which need to be controlled!\n\nAs much as I can talk about the incredible depth of gameplay of NS1, this standalone sequel has gone a slightly different path, mostly for the worse. Nevertheless, this is one of the very few unique games out there with very deep and entertaining gameplay!\nFor people who want to challenge the best, there is a big and very welcoming competitive/pro community!\n\n\nOn the whole, NS2 (and NS1! requires HL1) is absolutely recommended to anyone who likes multiplayer first person shooters and wants something MUCH more than soldier vs soldier deathmatch!\n\n\n\nPractical considerations:\n1. Having a microphone is a big plus as a soldier and a lack thereof is a big minus when being commander.\n\n2. You need a good gaming computer to play this game enjoyably.

It's easily worth full price and is occasionally on sale.\n\n@1.237 h\n\nthey game reached with COUNTLESS updates, ballace patches, map chages, 3 completley new maps (9 Total, officials... plus countles Maps from the moding scene), and two major expanstion packs for zero $ a pollished and finished state.\n\nThese unbelievable deves have a system in place, called the Reinfocement Programm, where you can donate an random amont of money (how much ever you think they deserve to get for the extra work) . Dependent on how much you spent, you'll be rewarded with in game goodies and swag. I mysef a proud owner of the shadow tier badge still think of the game as an ever green.\n\n@2.100 h\nI now have our own server running with all mods that support the original game experience without compromising it. The game is a blast and has no match. I found all of my best steam buddies in it. In fact you have to use both sides of your brain or at least 70% overall brain capacity to be bad at it. So the game is full of ppl that overcame thier frustration and are able of common sense. The atmosphere in game is very friendly and supportive for the most part, cuz ppl know how it feels to be rookie in this one. See our girls fight on youtube.com/hellariousbasterds, they are a prime example of good maners and sportswomenship. I've seen countless tripple A titles and halfbaked indies go down the river of time in the two years NS2 is out now. But only NS2 keeps floating with it's deepth, replayability and funny ppl like the little, resistent ever green it is.\n\nA sport to be trained. The friends i found over the years are a blast and the community it most of the time friendly, supportive and pacient. (some times not, people in this game, especially when they are not that skilled yet, deal with an huge amount of frustration that sometimes surfaces)\nBut these are rainy days ^^..\n\nMost of the time the sun shines out of our guns XD\nIt's unbelievable.. This is not a game... it's an ancient instinct...\nthe Hunt... in a Team with strong tactical requirements...\nA Challenge\n\nLike I said.. Love it.. worth evey cent...

After a long period of abandonment and community development, that changed stuff for the better, they now rejoined development. cuz thier other games are very costly and not doing that well.

In thier initial "WE ARE BACK" post they even mentioned that the team consits of people that not regularly play the game, nor that they are good at it. They also put this team (consisting of former members of the community development team and some animators of thier other games) on a 3 month trial.

Saying that, it's still worth a buy when it's on sale. Be prepared to only play it multiplayer, there's absolutely no storyline or singleplayer. Furthermore, there's only about a dozen maps actively in rotation.\n\nSaying that; NS2 could have been a million unit game. The balancing is perfect, and it's probably one of the most fun, rewarding, and entertaining games out there. Sadly, the dev team went wayyyyyyyyyyyy too gung-ho on the multiplayer competitive front, (thinking CS), so unless you're an old NS1 pro like myself, you'll find games are pubstomp after pubstomp, (what happens is all the pro's know to join 1 team, and alternate sides every round. This creates really super fast 5min games).\n\nDon't expect there to be any additional updates; the dev team has already moved onto their next title. It's really a shame though; the team should write the book on atmospheric development on a shoestring budget, (they developed their own game engine, textures, models, etc with less than a million dollars. Trust me, this is VERY unique!). If you're looking for a balanced and unique online game, this is it. Yes, you're playing the same map, but RARELY does it get repetitive due to the hyper complex potential for the game.\n\nAt this time, the game is 24.99. I can't recommend anything more than 9.99$ for this game. Yes, I've personally dumped 200 hrs into it, but I'm an old ns1 pro. I can see a new person spending 25$, getting into a game, getting IMMEDIATELY annihilated via a pub stomp, and then chuck the game in the trash.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/recommended/4920/","Fluoxx","Fluoxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/","472 products in account","As someone who never played the predecessor, I can't comment on any similarities or improvements; what I can say, is that this game is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer shooty pew pew games I've played in years.\n\nFirst off, it looks lovely. Whether you're playing Aliens or Marines, the game has a very nice polished look to it and while the standard map rotation isn't massive, they are well balanced, which is something I have found to be lacking in a lot of similar team based games. The balance is more impressive when you consider that these aren't typical teams, either. Playing as the basic Alien species, the Skulk, gives you the ability to wall walk and hang onto ceilings, making you a perfect ambush predator. Marines can develop jet packs later in the game, allowing them to fly, but both teams have very distinct differences which makes the need for balance more important.\n\nNS2 is also a game which is very hard to 'carry'. Whereas in other games in a similar vein, you can have a random player join your team and absolutely face ♥♥♥♥ the opposite team with seemingly no help from you or your mates, who are in their minds probably sat with their heads up their arses. This is a game where teamwork is absolutely necessary to succeed, and when you do succeed, it is glorious. A win on this game on either team feels amazing, like you've worked your balls off to earn it.\n\nAs with every other multiplayer game in existence, you will sometimes get a ♥♥♥♥ team. Sometimes you will be on that team, it happens. Other times you will be on the murdering death squad team and feel like you're a god. A lot of the time this responsibility rests on the team Commander. The Commander will sit in the Hive/Command chair, depending on the team, and will take on a top down view of the map. They are in charge of deploying resources and upgrading abilities/equipment for their team; they also direct their team mates as to where they should push or where the commander thinks they should push. Team synergy between the troops and the commander is vital, and I've not seen that nailed so well before as in this game.\n\nThe NS2 community is also very friendly. The first time I decided to play Commander I was a nervous wreck, but I was guided and helped by my team mates and - shock horror - NOT screamed at for my lack of experience. I've been in the odd game where new players are given crap, but the vast majority of games I have played have been with very nice people who are endlessly helpful. Even starting out playing, other players will help if you ask and give you tips as to what to do.\n\nOne downside I've found to this game, and it's a major one, is that the player base appears to be dwindling. This means that relatively full games are getting harder to come by, especially later on at night. Many servers are empty and it's a real shame, because this game is a bundle of fun once you get to grips with it, which leads on to my next point.\nNS2 has somewhat of a steep learning curve. When I say steep, I mean that it takes a while to get learn the benefits and playstyle of each Alien and also the Marine weaponry and equipment.\n\nI've personally found that this isn't a game where you can just pick a class and play however the hell you want, you have to know what you're doing with certain things otherwise you can be a bit of a spare part. For example, when you play on the Alien team, initially you will spawn as a Skulk. To play the other 'classes', you have to Evolve into them and this is done through your own personal resources which increase as you play, push and kill. The most expensive class, the Onos, is an absolute beast, but new players (and old) can sometimes be seen playing them and just rushing into Marine bases because at first glance you see your massive health pool and think you're an immortal juggernaut. Tactical maneuvres, organised by and with your team, are the key to success in this game and the solo warrior approach simply will not work.\n\nNS2 also offsets potential pitfalls presented by fellow players. Occasionally, you will get a complete and utter turd as your Commander - it happens. Thankfully, you can choose to Eject ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commanders, along with a plethora of other commands such as voting, signalling to your team mates and taunting, amongst others. Team communication is vital in this game so a mic goes a long way for those times when you're getting the ♥♥♥♥ shot out of you and can't type your predicament. Map pinging also helps brings sticky situations to your team mates' and commander's attention.\n\nOverall, awesome game. I only hope that the playerbase gets a revival, because it is a shame that more people don't get to experience the brilliance that is Natural Selection 2.\n","September 27, 2014","true","87.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is very team based, and it's the best feeling when your team finally just clicks. Sadly though, a bad team can ruin the game play experience completely.  One player is given the role as 'commander', this play will play the game in an RTS view, giving out orders, building structures etc, the rest of the team will play in FPS mode.\n\nThere is plenty of different weapons for the Marines, where as the Aliens transform into different creatures, ranging from a scuttling little dog like alien, to a giant rhino beast.\n\nThe levels are perfect arena, the lighting and ambient effects make it feel even more realistic.

After that NS2 was a giant letdown. The whole gameplay concept was messed up. NS1 was a tactical/strategical game, where with smart tactics you could defend the base, and advance.\nNS2 is a no brainer, because the map layout and the lack of effective defensive capabilites make it impossible to secure an area with turrets etc. There are too many routes to reach a point so it is impossible to play defensively, turrets are to weak to make defensive blockades. So the only option is to attack agressively and research everything as fast as you can. From the smart and deep gameplay in 2003, we stepped back again to the level of Quake 1 in 2013.","July 6, 2014","false","48.5"," 45 of 80 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","45","80","0","1"

Marines have ranged weapons, explosives and siege artillery.\nAliens have teeth, claws, speed and excessive maneuverability,\nand range in size from cat to rhinoceros.\nMarines structures require power to function.\nAlien structures build on infestation and slowly die when it subsides.\nEach team has a commander that manages sturctures and upgrades via a top-down view.\nNatural Selection is the single most thrilling, most competitive first person shooter I have ever played since the release of its Half-Life 1 mod in the mid 2000s. Sure, Battlefield delivers large-scale modern warfare in life-like graphics and SFX, but it fails nonetheless (like any other FPS I could think of) to implement half incredible teamplay potential that Natural Selection does!\n\nBasically, you have a team of marines on one side of the map and an alien Hive on the other. The alien Hive is where the eggs spawn, and the aliens will aim to optimally build three or more Hives to unlock all their upgrades and reach full strength. It's up to the marines to eliminate the aliens before the situation spins out of control.\n\nThe game goes by controlling the map's resource nodes (scattered evenly between the 8-12 rooms that make up each map) in order to unlock higher weapons/lifeforms and upgrades faster, and ultimately kill all the enemy's command structures (the alien Hive or marine Command Center). And what makes it so full of heat is how quickly a single move could change the tide of battle! Both teams have structures made for quick commuting: teleporters for marines and underground tunnels for aliens. If used correctly, your entire team could be in the enemy base in less than 20 seconds.\n\nNormally, the marines have to set up and DEFEND teleporters at Hive entrance chokepoints to suffocate the aliens by constantly teleporting in and damaging the Hive while preventing the aliens from scattering all over the map. The aliens on the other hand are better at sneak attacks; eliminating lonely marine resource nodes and setting up "sneaky tunnels."\n\nWhen the aliens successfully lay a tunnel to the marine base undetected, their whole team could be in the marine base in less than 15 seconds! And then it's up to the marine commander to trigger the Distress Beacon to teleport all marines back in time or else the base would be overrun. But even when the base is defended successfully, the aliens will usually utilize this mass relocation of the marines to eliminate their structures somewhere else on the map!\n\nThe aliens also have the choice whether to destroy the marine structures in each room or to aim for the power node, which, once broken, conceals the room in pitch black darkness and disables all marine structures in it. Up until the red emergency lights come online, the only thing any rines in the room can see is whatever crosses the thin strip of flashlight that they have.","May 11","true","255.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

(I'm willing to rule out that I'm lucky and just haven't been around 'those' people).\n\nHowever, I can tell you this:  As an achievement hunter, I was able to contact a developer on the official discord server (Remi, you're awesome!).  This person took the time out to help me join a private server full of veterans for a 'Captain's Night' (Shout out to TGNS, you folks are great and I hope to play with you all again!) and was nice about it.  Not only that, but the folks I played with were all immensely supportive of a 'greenie' being on their side.  Folks in the voice-comms were giving me tips, telling me to follow them around, and showing me some really neat tricks.\n\nI personally like small maps with 7v7 teams; it allows you to know the folks you're playing with (especially if they are in comms).

Natural Selection 2 picks up where the first game ended with our hero Charles Darwin using his time machine to transport himself 1,500 years into the future. In the opening scene, players find themselves in a dystopian sky city of the year 3370 A.D. Players soon discover that all of the citizens who inhabit the game's world are devout creationists, and while the world starts off as beautiful and serene, the scene quickly turns dark when the characters in the world discover Charles' identity.\n\nNatural Selection 2 strives to call important issues into question which test our society today. For example, in one scene, the player is selected for a lottery where he or she has the choice to throw a baseball at a married couple comprised of an evolutionist and a global warming believer, or at the lottery host. Needless to say, NS2 achieves art status because of this powerful scene which serves as an analogue to the oppression of scientists in our very own twenty-first century and deserves a place in every steam user's library.","November 26, 2013","true","52.2"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackmilk/recommended/4920/","blackmilk","BlackMilk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackmilk/","445 products in account","Natural Selection (2) is a great blend of FPS and RTS action. Also called a mix of Counter-Strike and Starcraft, the game features two asymmetrical teams (the aliens or 'Kharaa' and marines or 'Frontiersmen') who fight for control of the playing field.\nMarines can use weapons to shoot the creepy crawlers, but the aliens with their messy spores, big teeth, slime and scythes can shred marines to bits when given the opportunity.\n\nEach team is led by a Commander who sits (relatively) safely in either a Command Station or Hive. The Commander has to lead his/her team to victory by giving instructions and orders, and by building and expanding a base.\nWhen every Command Station or Hive has been destroyed, the team who owned those structures will lose.\n\nThis is a game that you cannot afford to miss, wether you like Alien-inspired themed games, shooting aliens or biting marines or like to give orders and work as a team.\n\n--------------------------\nMore information...\n\n-=Gameplay=-\nQ: How is it played?\nA: The main objective in regular NS2 gameplay is to destroy all command stations or hives, depending on which team you're fighting.\n\nJoining a server will spawn you in a waiting room of sorts, where you will find portals that, when walked through, assign you to a team. The choices are aliens, marines, random or spectator.\nJoining and leaving a team can happen at any time during the game. When both teams have a commander (any player who approaches the command station/hive and activates it) the game starts. Other players spawn in the same room while the commander gets an RTS-style overview of the game. Soldiers have to move out to build or defend constructions and take down enemy buildings.\nPlayers are free to choose their own path, but have the best chance of success when following orders from a smart commander. The commander places buildings, researches upgrades and keeps lays out a battle plan on the go. The soldiers have to conquer territory and alternate between attacking to take over and defending their own rooms. Alien buildings grow slowly on their own, marine buildings materialise as transparent 3D blueprints and have to be built by the marines in the field.\n\nThe currency of the game is simply referred to as resources (res). These are acquired automatically, slowly over time. Every player receives personal resources (p res) and the commander can spend team resources (t res). Players can spend p res to buy weapons and equipment or to change into more powerful life-forms and upgrade those. The commander uses t res to purchase and place (blueprints of) structures and to research upgrades as well as providing field support for his troops. Both teams must build extractors/harvesters to increase the resource income. The more resources you acquire, the quicker you can acquire upgrades and better equipment or life-forms. As your team becomes stronger, you'll more easily push the enemy team out of rooms and eventually back into their last base. Destroying their only remaining command station or hive wins you the game.\n\n-=Graphics, sound, experience=-\nNS2 is a decent looking game. There's been a lot of improvement since the first game. With the infestation that spreads from alien structures to the textures of alien life-forms, marine exo-suits and the scenery in maps, there's enough to look at. But you'll be too busy hunting down your opponents to actually take it all in anyway!\nThe sound is also good, but don't expect a lot of music. It's all about sound effects to help you locate your enemies, or at the very least be aware of their presence. Listening to music is not really recommended while playing, as long as you're playing a marine or an alien without the special detection upgrade. Footsteps and the sound of claws on metal serve to give away the enemy's position. The marines have taunts and the aliens can growl a bit, there's not much to that, but there's plenty of interesting sounds for all the abilities and weapons.\n\n-=Technical, controls, etc.=-\nMay be a little heavy for some machines. Many players resort to turning graphics down to keep framerate up. It's not terrible, but can be a problem when there's a lot of players fighting in a small space with lots of particles being thrown around. The controls are easy and fairly intuitive. As they say, less is more, and NS2 agrees. At least in the controls of players out on the field. Commanders don't have that much more, but to be quick and effective they have to remember quite a few shortcuts.\n\nPro's:\n-It doesn't take long to learn how to play (as a player in the field)\n-The game is well balanced\n-The game works with upgrades but there's no real RPG elements involved, anyone can jump into any game and contribute right away\n-A match that's going nowhere can be ended early by having either team vote to concede with a majority of players, other methods include voting to restart or having most/all teammates go to the ready room (leaving the team), often ending the match\n\nCons:\n-Playing commander is far from easy. It takes time to learn and become good at, and games often take a long time to start because nobody wants to take up that position.\n-Experienced players tend to stack up in teams, making it hard or impossible to win for a team of average "pub" players (this is not a game flaw, but it's something you'll often face when playing it, and as this is a multiplayer-only game, it's relevant)\n\n------------------------\nVisit our steam review group page:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreview\n\nReviews of games with titles starting with N, and reviews/translations of this\ngame (review) by other group members in this thread:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreview/discussions/0/618453594748486501/","July 21, 2013","true","528.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Wasn't exactly what I thought it was as you can be either one or the other. It does allow for a commander in multiplayer mode and you have to actively work with your team to build new sort of "buildings" or stations. You issue the order, they physically have to go there and build it and possibly protect it. There are two opposing teams going at it at one time : humans and the parasites. Humans have their respective weapons, and you are able to choose what you would like to use from the ammo bin (once it's built)! Being the parasites takes a bit of practice to really hone control or get a kill. Parasites also come in variations as some fly, some are small and quick, some are used to build their own defensive systems. Unlike human upgrades (regarding weapons), beasts upgrade gradually when you choose to evolve them. You can get evolve points the more you successfully kill opponents. There are a lot of people saying the game has a steep learning curve (which is sort of does) but all the in-game players were more than willing to answer any immediate questions I had. The game becomes easier of course the more you play it. Do not be afraid to learn! Depending on who your commander is for your team, you can either have a great game or an okay game. One may ask who would I rather be, the beasts or the marines? To be honest, I preferred beasts at first due to the ability to climb about on walls and be invisible on creeps but over time I learned how fun it is to be a marine.\n\nGraphics are absolutely impeccable on this one. Sounds are appropriate for the world the dev created. Makes you nervous when you start hearing things and you know your about to be attacked.\n\nSolid 8/10 - this is a must buy if it's on sale!\n\nFor future Natural Selection games : maybe have a few vehicle options (or fixed weapons placements). I understand the concept of one person in charge of a team, but the problem arises that no one wants to be the guy watching instead of playing. Maybe allow for a real-time planner?\n\n\nScreenShots :\n\nFirst person view puts you right into the mouth of the beasts\n\nA continuation from the first screen shot... just to show if you stand still you can go invisible\n\nWhat the commander view looks like","July 21, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's multiplayer only and there are 2 sides, aliens and marines. I'm quite honestly surprised how balanced this game is, there isn't an overpowered side winning depends entirely on you and your team (and how competent the enemy team is too I suppose).\n\nBoth teams start out with a base and one resource tower, These towers provide resources for your commannder to build buildings and upgrades for you e.g sentries/better guns for marines or more armour and powers for aliens. The towers also provide each player with resources which they can spend on better weapons for marines or stronger and higher lifeforms for aliens.\n\nYou expand across the map taking more bases and resource towers and fighting the opposing team, victory comes from there surrender or you obliterating there base. I prefer the latter.\n\nThe only real downsides is that lobbies often become so one sided with all the best players sticking to one team the game is decided before it has started and ocne in a while you will get a commander who either doesn't know what they are doing or are trolling on purpose which gives you a very high chance to lose.\n\n9/10","November 27, 2013","true","313.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/4920/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Lets get the obvious out of the way, NS2 offers a unique multiplayer FPS/RTS experience that you will not find anywhere else. It's PC centric with none of the dumbed down console design plaguing 90% of games this last generation.\n\nWhile the heart of its addictiveness and its frustrations is the competitive nature against other human players instead of vs AI. If there's a reason you will keep playing NS2, it will be because of the players you will be sharing this unique gameplay experience with.\n\nBut it also has two very major problems that everyone who has played NS2 has experienced at some point - Performance & Balance. Few people have a computer capable of running NS2 at a steady 60 FPS throughout an entire match; the Lua coding and the engine has had a long history of criticism. And the game requires hundreds of hours to master its mechanics, that were majorly changed as of build 250 requiring a renewed learning curve.\n\nBalance however has always been a topic of debate since the beta, the main problem with the way the game is being balanced is UWE's obsession with trying to turn it into a competitive 6v6 e-sports rivaling that of SC2. The small crowds at events and the low amount of views can be defined as very niche, yet this is what the game is being balanced for; NOT for public play or for the majority of people that quickly join and leave NS2 throughout its sales.\n\nMy personal experience with NS2 is hard to define...the first 5 months I used a mic, tried 6v6 pugs, experienced a lot of a-holism from people and played on a 1280x720 resolution. It was stressful, I hated it and ended up quitting.\n\n5 months after with a much better computer & mouse, I picked the game up again as build 250 came out. Performance and balance issues were still very frustrating, the game was basically an on-going beta. But playing with people I became very familiar with is the reason I kept sticking around, as well as the mastery we humans care deeply about.\n\nDo I love or hate NS2? Some aspects I love, and some things about it I can't stand. It's a bittersweet experience, the game has stayed alive because UWE keeps it alive with constant updates. However it's obviously not financially viable for them. So sooner or later NS2 will fade into obscurity if it isn't already.\n\nI think for me, NS2 might have been the pinnacle of anything coming out in the next 5-10 years that has made me invest as much time into it as I have. I think the only thing I might have spent more time playing, is StarCraft.\n\nEdit: As far as clarifying how I feel about this game retrospectively, NS2 had an amazing concept, one-of-a-kind; but the execution of the public multiplayer, the balancing and the decision of UWE to code their own engine probably doomed this game. And having played NS2 for 10 months, public games are 90% frustration and 10% balanced teams; same complaint I've heard from many whom used to play NS2.\n\nAnd it always had a small player base for a multiplayer game, exceptions were when thousands of players would be joining and then leaving within like 2 weeks of major updates or sales. Thus I'm pretty sure that the small size of the remaining active player-base, makes a match making system completely redundant considering you need to fill up 12-24 slots; and at down-times you're lucky to find one full server in EU.\n\nI regret wasting a whole year on a game that mostly brought me stress and contempt, but I have no regrets about all the experiences I've had with the hundreds upon hundreds of players I've met throughout all my time spent with it. Whether it be good experiences or bad, I have learned from them all and as a result; I have grown both as a gamer and as a person.","January 17, 2015","true","138.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

Also so far as I can tell basic alien's bite works off of gun physics and won't hit anything you aren't aiming directly at. Either that or the hit detection is an *expletive removed* and just plain barely works.\n\nThe game is designed around fast paced twitch gameplay with mostly melee and weak aliens vs marines with guns. However the resource system is designed around being really slow and punishing you for deaths by forcing you to play as a skulk for 90% of the game while you're learning.\n\nThe game is abysmally unoptimized, so unoptimized that its not even funny, loading times are seriously minutes long, not even kidding. I actually have to turn settings down to run a bot server with the default amount of bots, and I bet you're saying "OH well you should get a better computer!" the truth is I can't, there is exactly one better processor and more powerful graphics cards do not exist outside of tri or quad sli setups.\n\nThe commander job is fantastic on paper, really innovative! Ingame it is a *expletive removed* that overshadows the rest of the entire game. The problem with NS2 is that you are entirely dependant on your commander, and your commander is entirely dependent on you. In theory this is fine, in practice it makes learning the game a *expletive removed* *expletive removed* *expletive removed* pile of zit puss.\n\nBecause the commander doesn't have much agency on their own, so nobody wants to play the commander for long, its a job that is nessasary but not engaging enough to be something that enough people actually want to specilize in to keep the game going. Its a core mechanic of the game and its frankly a janitor job, and only "strategy" in a broad sense, in a more specific and accurate sense its herding randoms on the internet around.\n\nThink about that for a moment, think about how many random people on the internet are willing to follow orders, and how many of them you would trust to give orders. Now narrow that list down to people who bought this game, are willing to sit in the commander chair, and are willing to attempt the massive learning curve for the alien side of things. Now throw in a team of toxic people who can grow impatient with a bad commander.\n\nThats what I think is the biggest problem with natural selection since the player and commander are entirely codependent you need a good team to make things work and there is very little that you can do to help out a bad team. This could have been avoided by giving the commander something fun to do, like traditional ai controled soldiers to bring in more rts elements, or the ability to zoom out and see any decent portion of the map. Or something, anything to make the commander more interesting and easier to play in the face of their own incompetence or the incompotence of their team.\n\nAs it stands your enjoyment of this game will depend entirely upon your tolerance for other players and your willingness to get stomped into the ground for an entire round anytime you have a subpar team.","January 6, 2013","false","9.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Not sure why, but I probably just forgot.\n\nThe RTS genre is dieing out, if it hasn't already. So instead of developers cranking out RTS games, we are starting to see a new trend of FPS-RTS hybrids. Nuclear Dawn is an example of this, and TF2 could have been the same way (see developer commentary). I used to be a big fan in many regards, but there just doesn't seem to be any good classics. EA over milking their acquired IP such as C&C has lead to disappointment, and reason as to why they were voted the worst company 3 times in a row.\n\nMany describe Natural Selection 2 to be like Counter-Strike in many regards. It's true for the most part, as realism isn't the focus -- competitive play is. Updates seem regular enough to resolve problems which is nice to see.\n\nWhile it's unfortunate that the developers scraped using the Source engine, it is certainly nice to see people try and release competing engines. One of the certain draw backs to releasing a custom built engine has to be the increased work of maintaining not only the engine but the game. After I don't know how many updates, the developers continue to ignore the hull sizes of models. Could it be caused by an oversight in development? Certainly, but for how long it's been with the game, it's ridiculous. When I refer to hull sizes, I'm talking about the collision "mesh" which detects where things can fit. The tanky alien unit "Onos" fails in this regard, being able to fit (and let alone jump) to places that don't make any logical sense. The outside parts of the model just pass through solid objects, which can really infuriate marine players.\n\nPart of competitive play has to do with teamwork. While new fronts have been opened in regards to making the first time experience more inviting, some work needs to be done else where. Even with the dynamic loading of textures and models, it just takes way to long to load maps. Servers still seem to be single core based, so GSPs will not be jumping at it because server processors tend to be clocked lower.\n\nWhile certainly pressing new ideas into the industry that lacks a lot, I wouldn't want to rush at this game.\n\n7.5/10","February 1, 2014","true","43.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is not! It is a fully grown RTS with real players as units. This is important to understand if you want to have fun with it.\n\nI've seen my share of marketing claims asserting game X would really endorse team play. They all lied. Not so with Natural Selection 2. It doesn't "endorse" team play, it simply makes it a requirement for victory. You need your team, your team needs its commander and the commander needs the team to follow his orders. It's a symbiosis.\n\nThis is the strongest part of Natural Selection 2 and it's the feature that sets it apart from other games. In a way it could be seen as a game about leadership, and at the end of the day, when everybody knows the tech-tree and how to deal with opponents and the commander has learned the "best build order" and the countless possible strategies there is still work to do. Sometimes the biggest challenge seems to be to keep the team's morale up. This is where communication comes into play, an important part of the game. It is incredibly rewarding to overcome a worthy opponent and there are no achievements or unlockables in this game. Winning itself is the achievement.\n\nAnd if there's no teamwork? Well, that's when Natural Selection 2 gets incredibly frustrating. Especially veterans can often tell how a game will end after 30 seconds. And it's always YOUR fault. See that NooB over there? YOU need to talk to him and make him follow you. It's impossible for the commander to take care of every single player.\n\nIf you just want to casually shoot some Aliens, this is probably not your game, but if you want to enjoy team play and are willing to commit to a degree: don't wait any longer.\n\nIt's regularly on sale for €2,49.

You play RTS as a commander directing your brave troops or as a mighty alien/marine fighting your way to the enemy's base and helping your commander to build and defend structures.\n\nYou always have to cooperate with your teammates, playing solo leads to dying all the time even if you buy a heavy unit like EXO or Onos.

And yet, I don't feel as though I am being unjust.\n\n<Quick Overview>\npros:\nfun\nfast paced\nteam work based\n\ncons:\nGame is possibly abandoned (no regular updates)\nextremely long load times\nservers are empty (hardly anyone plays this game anymore)\nnon stop yelling\nnot beginner friendly\npoor balancing (aliens are superior)\n\n<Indepth Review>\n\nIn Natural Selection 2, you play on the side of the Marines or the aliens.\nThe two sides use a combination of RTs style structure building (the commander) and first person shooting (everyone else). The two sides have upgrades, structures, team work, and their brains to best the other side.\n\nThis game is fun, It'll kill sometime if you're bored. However, it gets old very fast for a large number of reason.\n1) You can tell from the "Christmas splashpage" on the title screen, that this game does not recieve many updates. It is nearly February and we are still being shown Christmas images.\n\n2) The game's connection and loading speeds are awful. In order to connect to the "tutorial", I was subject to an unbelievably long time period. I was able to boil some pasta and prepare myself a nice carbonara before it was done loading.\n\n3) When connecting to the server list, one can see many servers. Unfortunately, there are only 10 or less servers that are actually being used. On average, the servers hold 10 people. This is a good indication that this game is dead and plaers have abandoned it for its many flaws.\n\n4)Advanced players of this game have no room for beginners. They will scream and belittle anyone who doesn't understand the game mechanics immediately. The only reason they won't kick you, is because there is strength in numbers.\n\nIf you'd like a "get yelled at" simulation, then this game may be for you.\n\n5) Aliens have an advantage in this game. The aliens are capable of very quick movements. WIth how shooting is implemented in this game, it is disasterous for the marines. Therefore, everoyne wants to play on the alien side and you are left with an unbalanced team.\n\n<Conclusion>\nIt's a fun game, but save your money. The many flaws of this game has led it to lose its player base.\nI'd consider it if it was on a great sale (75% off and up) and if I had many friends that were interested in playing.","January 19, 2015","false","3.1"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","2"

What's the point of a shooter if the shooting ain't fun and exciting to begin with? There's barely any satisfactory gun feedback. The enemy animations are risible and the way they attack/charge at you from like 5 meters away it's just silly. NS2 features one of the most unnecessarily intricate level designs I've seen in my entire gaming life for these type of shooters, there's no flow to them, it's a chore to travel back and forth between rooms, it's a labyrinthic mess. The engine, as far as I know, it's not based on UE3 so 'featuring' texture pop-in -that takes even minutes to load- it's even more bizarre. The performance is terrible overall, very unoptimized and it doesn't look that hot to begin with, the pictures are really misleading. Add to that the extremely long, annoying load times -even for a training match with bots-.\n\nA shame really, it looked like it could have improved on Aliens vs Predator and delivered what Colonial Marines didn't on the MP aspect.

The two teams are not just asymmetrical, they are outright unbalanced.  So much so that a single, high tier player is all it takes to decide the game.  There is just no way to deal with how crazy some of their aiming capabilities are or ability to dodge as aliens.  This fact along makes the game a chore to play, add in the learning curve and the fact that UWE has never been good at balancing the gameplay.  The original NS had significant imbalance issues that took practically the entire development of that mod to finally iron out, by then it was desolate of an active, teeming player base.\n\nNatural Selection 2 is a game with great setting, art style, and technical chops.  It is a shame the core gameplay can be so lopsided and difficult to work through.  Add in that the developers have for all intents and purposes abandoned the game to the community.  That is the death knell of a game, from here on out it is just running on the original steam from its release.","July 10, 2014","false","149.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

For example. Using a skork unit and trying to ambush a skilled marine will result in the marine hopping out of sight and into the air while doing a 360 turn midair, while reloading, then shooting you once with the shotgun and you are dead.\n\nForget about the 10 minutes it took you to sneak up to this player. Attacking someone in the back will result in the human jumping in to the air and dodging all future melee attacks. It takes up to 4 melee attacks to kill a marine. this makes it so that you cannot sneak attack players and be rewarded for your stealth. The only time sneak attacks will work are when you attack a noob marine.\n\nThis is why I quit the game because stealth is not rewarded and only those players who have been playing this for ages will win the fights because they know all the ridiculous glitches to come on top of a fight no matter what you do.\n\nI also think that late game, these massive units appear in the game where players control a mech or a giant dinosaur rhino, kind of ruin it completely. Things look really arcady and cheesy sometimes. Especially when all the marines hop around jumping higher in the air than the actual aliens.","April 23, 2014","false","35.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","3"

My feelings about it are very complex, as it's a bold and innovative step in FPS multiplayer, has excellent developer support, and a pretty good community to boot. There are frequent updates and gameplay balances, and a new map is released roughly every six months or so. The two opposing factions are assymetrically balanced and gameplay is varied and interesting. So much so that you don't mind playing the same few maps over and over again countless times. In some respects, this game has pretty much everything going for it.\n\nSadly, I simply cannot recommend Natural Selection 2 for one very specific reason. The game's greatest strength is its ability to seamlessly blend the RTS experience with the FPS experience, and when you have a team that works well together, under a commander who knows the ropes, this game offers one of the most fun multiplayer experiences available.\n\nIt is this same strength which is also the game's greatest flaw. Very often - almost always - your experience is entirely dependant on the person in the command chair. To begin with, no one ever wants to be commander. You will sometimes spend as much as 10 minutes waiting for someone's patience to wear thin enough that they finally get into the command chair, at which point you are at their mercy. Sometimes you will even spend longer waiting for the commander than the actual game lasts.\n\nIf this person happens to be you, your command experience will go one of three ways: 1) You will do an excellent job and everyone will love you for it, in which case your game will likely be over very quickly. 2) You will do an excellent job and everyone will hate you for it anyway, because you didn't build X thing at Y time. They will complain at you for arbitrary reasons, even though you are winning the game. 3)You will do a bad job and everyone will hate you for it, likely resulting in you being kicked from the command position, ostricized, and ruining everyone's fun.\n\nAdditionally, while the game is quite expertly balanced, it takes very little to upset that balance. A bad or good commander can mean everything in a game, and very often the fun and enjoyment of as many as 24 people hinges on that commander's ability to play the game. It's not uncommon to spend hours going from stacked game to stacked game because teams just can't seem to turn out right. And then, when that magical golden ratio finally occurs, and the game looks like it's going to be a long, bloody, brutal fight to the death, someone rushes your base and the game is over before you have time to check the map.\n\nSo, while I have had some real fun with Natural Selection 2, at the end of the day I just can't recommend a game with such a massive, fundamental, and irreversible flaw. The average player just has to put in way too much effort and patience to squeeze the fun out of this game. But I do admit that if you manage to do so, you will be in for quite a treat.","January 11, 2014","false","794.2"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","28","51","0","4"

I have played this game more than most other people.\n\nI tried to introduce some new players to the game recently, and i don't believe either were sold on the game, with the main complaints being : "its hard to aim the guns cause the targets move so fast and are so small." and "its hard to understand the strategy in the game, cause its so complicated."\n\nOne experience which really led me to the conclusion that the strategy is hard to grasp, is the frequency with which i was the only one on my team who realised we had just lost, or won a game.\n\nMy opinion is that they released this game too early, at a time where to get decent FPS during combat a PC of ridiculous spec was required, most people had a bad time playing the game at this point.\n\nThese days, it is well optimised and running on machines that didn't exist when it was released, it is an incredibly smooth play, i get a buttery smooth 144fps.\n\nBecause this game was released in an unfinished state, MAJOR changes were made to the game after its release, which completely destroyed any chance the game had. The addition of gorge tunnels was particularly irritating to me personally (as it made the teams less diverse).\n\nThere were other major changes, i have to admit i wasn't a fan of this chopping and changing, because i have put so much time and energy into maximising the efficiency of my strategy, only to have to start over from scratch on the next update.\n\nThis, was what eventually led me to leave the game, near the introduction of gorge tunnels.\n\nAfter a couple of years break from the game, i have come back. The game is well optimised now, the combat is snappy and enjoyable, the strategy hasn't been messed with. I could play this game, if there were enough other people playing it!\n\nThis is a VERY GOOD GAME, I don't think there is a skill ceiling for the strategy and combat, if there is, i haven't reached it !\n\nThis game trains your aim, hearing, and combat sense. After playing in this game, go and play counterstrike and see how much easier the aiming seems.\n\nIf you like games where you have to have incredible aim, and a deep understanding of strategy, this game is for you!\n\nOh, and also get a microphone, or don't buy the game :)","November 9, 2013","true","540.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a unique blend of FPS with real-time strategy elements. It pits two teams (Aliens VS Marines) against each-other in online matches. Graphics are very nice, performance is ok - the custom made engine (Spark) does seem to be quite CPU demanding, yet a comprehensive options menu allow for various tweaking. Gameplay is awesome, sound assets are okay.\n\nIt's good fun, competitive, but also newbie friendly. Has a great community that are steadily active (so you'll always be able to find a game). It's essentially a game about map / resource control, upgrading / evolution tech research & using various weapons / skills & abilities - it's pretty sweet.\n\nAs a huge fan of both the original HL1 mod & the indie dev team, I must admit I wasn't too impressed with the initial release due to bugs, performance issues, lack of content & balancing issues - yet true to their word UWE rolled out (& continue to do so) patches / updates & free content, fully addressing my intial concerns. I fully respect UWE approch to the development process where they where open to community suggestions & really made an effort to involve players with the process even from pre-order.

A lot of people complain about the community being “Too Veteran” or “God-Like” and that makes it hard for new players. I say that this is true, but they can't help it if they have played the game for so long. If you are completely new, I recommend Bot matches against the computer even if others don't recommend it\n\nBot matches are not designed to be challenging for veterans, but if you are new they are very helpful. They allow you to explore the games systems and try-out everything. Things that may be too expensive for you to risk buying in a real match in fear of screwing up. The hardest difficulty Bot matches actually are challenging for new players so don't listen to people who say “Playing Bot matches will ruin your skills forever” or stupid comments like that because they are not true.\n\nOnce you are ready (which can take a load of bot matches to reach), try a easy multilayer match and see how you go. Even if you lose you can learn from the experience.\n\nDon't fall into the trap of buying the game, getting really exited, immediately joining a multiplayer match, get totally destroyed by other players and then stop playing the game because its “too hard”.\n\nIf you are desperate for some multilayer action you can try to create a server (if you know how ;_;) or join a empty server and invite your friends. Really great game! Just don't be surprised about the difficulty level. It is a hard game!","September 30, 2015","true","45.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You will need to practice practice practice if you want to get good, even just playing it 5 hours a week would likely only leave you "okay" for a long while.  The game rewards accuracy, twitch reaction speed, strategic playstyles, and teamwork.  With the exception of the twitch reaction speed (I have a fine motor deficit that makes twitch speed hard for me) , I find all of these things to be good things.\n\nYou will find the two team types to be fairly well balanced, though at lower skill levels the Aliens may seem a tad more powerful (even then it is by very little, I think I averaged 58/42 Alien/Human when I was learning the ropes), but the humans tend to take a few more games in the higher skill levels (with the midground being fairly well 50/50).  The humans get enough cool weapons and gadgets to let you find a playstyle that fits you (though make sure your Commander knows any specific things you want researched or you may not get your prefered loadout), and the Aliens all play differently from each other with their own set of morphs that serve as battlefield upgrades.\n\nThe only reasons I would tell someone not to buy this game is if they don't have a beefy enough system to run it properly, the person doesn't like sticking with the team and wants to run off to fight solo (this will almost always end in a quick death for said player), or you just won't be playing regularly enough to grow in skill (you need to have at least 2 hours every week while you are playing, in my opinion, to ensure that you are not stuck being a target to more skilled players all the time).  Other than that, if you like cooporative squad tactical shooters, this is probably going to be right up your alley.","January 12","true","21.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Although the learning curve is pretty tremendous  for what seems to be a simple AVP concept, the reality is that Natural Selection 2 involves requiring strategy that most games do not. Each of the two teams of Aliens and Marines have one commander, a person who assumes a top view of the map and can order his soldiers to go to a certian location, complete an objective, upgrade their armor and weaponry, and build structures to fortify the main base and make their team more powerful. I have found that the community for NS2 is generally helpful to rookies, and most (not all) will give tips and advise to new players struggling with the heavy expectations for a team in the matches that can last upwards of half an hour. Occasionally you witness the gruff veteran who lacks patience for the new recruits, but you can pick up on the game mechanics fairly quickly before they nag at you consistently. The gameplay is solid and balanced, playing as either team is fun and enjoyable. Playing as the vulnerable aliens as you stalk your prey can be exhilierating, but hunting the agile opponets with a pulse rifle can be equally enjoyable. The best game involves high levels of cooperation for all, but when you win, it feels great to have contributed to a team and I think I can say the level of comradery felt between two people is greatest when you squinting in the dimly light power room trying to reconstruct power to get the lights on as knee-high aliens shoot acidic goo at your feet. Fantastic game at any price, and it is gaurenteed to last you quite a while.","December 13, 2013","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Don't know what made me buy it, i just sort of felt the need to do it. And man i'm glad i did it. There is so much stuff going on in this game it's just not possible to write it down in a reasonably short review.\n\nIt's a blend of FPS and strategy game with great emphasis on team work. Because on your own, you're are a dead man/dead alien. Granted, hours and hours of training will give you a huge edge over new players, but doing it as a team helps even more.\nThere are so many upgrades, different weapons, vehicles, tactics, methods of attacking, methods of coordinating attacks, exploiting environment and different paths, abilities. It's just insane and awesome!\n\nOne thing that i recommend is that you get yourself a decent headphones with mic. Because the only way to play this game is to hear the team and communicate in real-time. Typing stuff is just too time consuming and clumsy. Keeping team up to date with combat status can often be a matter of win or lose. And don't even think of commanding without a headset. You just need it to do the job right.\n\nThere is one special thing about this game, while it was made by indie developer, the game apart from occasional balance issues feels like a proper high profile AAA multiplayer game. It just all feels really professional, well executed and polished.\n\nDid i mention the graphics look absolutely amazing? It's incredible what kind of graphics engine they developed themselves for this game. I wish they'd sell it to other developers, because the worlds, models, effects and the lighting and shading itself is sometimes so realistic you could almost mistaken it for a photo. I'm not kidding!","January 14, 2014","true","679.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Natural Selection 2 is an extremely underated game. It combines FPS action with RTS elements to make one of the most unique games you'll ever play.\n\nI've sunk in nearly 800 hours so far and I can honestly say every round I have played has been different. Rookies tend to get discouraged at first because of the steep learning curve, but stick with it for a couple of hours and you will NEVER want to play anything remotely similiar to CoD or BF.\n\nI could sit here and go on and on about how great this game is and how it deserves much more attention. Instead I will throw a couple of negative things out there to be fair.\n\nThe optimization is pretty bad. You don't need a super computer to run it or anything. Personally, I play on a three year old laptop.\n\ni7 2.3 Ghz\n8 Gb Ram\n660M GTX\n\nI can still normally run games on at least medium settings, but not Natural Selection 2. Even on mostly low settings, I only average 35 FPS. Another problem seems to be hit registration. There have been many times where I've shot lifeforms point blank (and see alien blood) yet I ended up doing zero damage. Other times, I'm an alien WELL around a corner and I'm still taking bullet damage.\n\nThose are my only two complaints. Do they keep me from playing? Obviously not. Is it gamebreaking? No. Should you get this game? No question.","June 29, 2014","true","778.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That was only moved to another server mode filter.\n\nThis is a great game, and these recent reviews are damaging enough for any new players looking at them, IF you are looking for a new game, something challenging then this is for you, you won’t notice any of these recent changes as they will all be still new to you, give this game a go, you won’t regret it.","July 26, 2013","true","844.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cuyut/recommended/4920/","Cuyut","Pearl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cuyut/","54 products in account","I believe Natural Selection 2 is a masterpiece of a game, that represents the perfect blend of FPS and RTS game play. It is one of the few games where teamwork and individual skill are highly rewarded. On top of that, the community is accepting of new players and offers a friendly hand to educate those who are new.\n\nDue to the fact that Natural Selection 2 is a hybrid of FPS and RTS game play, it allows for very competitive play in that the deciding factor of victory and defeat involves the long term decisions of a commander and/or the quick reactions and overall skill of the individual combatants (whether shooting aliens, or stalking marines). Due to this style of game play, games can very well last over an hour and yet feel very "tight" throughout the entire match.\n\nHowever, as of now, there is a lack of a ranked match system. The fact that the average game easily lasts over 20 minutes, and longer games tend to last for at least an hour, a very serious deciding factor of the winner is simply how many players leave and join the game. I understand that this is not really a game breaking problem, however due to the fact that players do not have much "loyalty" to their respective team, and the fact that the average match is rather lengthy, if a number of "pro" players join or leave the match during the middle of the game, it could drastically change the fate of the match instantly. I believe that having a sort of ranked match system, like that in Counter Strike: Global Offensive, will serve a very competitive game like Natural Selection 2 justice. Having ranked matches will also remove the occasional "newb stomping" matches, where there is a skill-based team stack.\n\nThe game features asymmetrical teams with very different game play styles. This provides for a different style of FPS game play, and not the traditional shooter vs shooter like in most FPS games. I believe that because of this asymmetry, it expands the average gamer's experiences about FPS games in general. However, in Natural Selection 2, because it is also an RTS hybrid, a player could choose from essentially four game play experiences within one match alone which highly increases the game's overall learning curve. These four game play "roles" are: Marine commander, Marine player, Alien commander, and Alien player. Each type of "role" presents new strategies and information upon which the player has to know, and ultimately, having a sense of all the 4 roles is the minimum requirement for being "decent" in the game. Overall, having asymmetrical teams can interest those who are tired of the same-old shooter vs shooter, and because Natural Selection 2 is an asymmetrical FPS/RTS hybrid, such game play increases the overall learning curve to become fully understanding of every aspect, tactics and counter-tactics within the game.\n\nDo not let the lack of a ranked match system and rather difficult learning curve stop you from playing this game however. The lack of a ranked match system simply means that Natural Selection 2 is always going to be played on a "casual" game play setting, which many FPS games have. The difficult learning curve is also easily passed if one simply spends about a good 2 hours playing in a sandbox training server by themselves, learning all of the abilities, techniques, tech-trees, map-knowledge, weapons, and life forms to get that "full" understanding of the 4 game play "roles" I mentioned earlier. Furthermore, if you still need further clarification and help, the overall community in Natural Selection 2 servers are kind, vocal, and willing to help those who ask.\n\nI believe that Natural Selection 2 marks the standard for all asymmetrical and even symmetrical FPS/RTS hybrid games in the future. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially those with a background in playing other FPS and RTS games as they could easily apply their knowledge of both game genres into their Natural Selection 2 game play.","December 31, 2013","true","681.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Add to that, each team has a commander that sees the map from overhead and uses team resources to build structures to aid this team, while directing his team to work together to grab objectives.\n\nThe interaction between the commander and his team works very well and the majority of the community are actually nice, helpful people. There are a lot of variation in marine weapons and equipment and alien creatures but for new players this also means a bit steeper learning curve than usual for a shooter. Luckily, there's a tutorial, ingame hints and a single player sandbox mode with or without bots to help getting started. Also there are rookie servers for new players so you won't get completely stomped by veterans.\n\nIf you like the idea of having to defend a dark, creepy corridor with your fellow marines against vicious aliens charging with more teeth than you can count, assaulting a nasty alien hive with grenade launchers, mechsuits and jet packs, sneak around the ceiling only to jump down and bite the head off an unsuspecting marine or charging a group of panicking marines with a massive dinosaur sized alien, this game won't let you down.\n\nGo get it.

The Alien and Marine teams aren't exactly equal as the Marines have more ranged weapons and the Aliens have melee and close ranged attacks along with two or three ranged attacks and also have a greater utilization of the map as they can climb walls and enter vents. The commander plays it like an RTS yet each unit is an actual player. It's a fantastic game that requires some team play and lets you really get invested in each match. You will soon find the team and weapons that suit you and you'll fit comfortabley right into the game. If you ever played Tremulous or Gloom, which are amazing mods based off the same concept as they were the first to try this split team dynamic, then you will certainly enjoy this updated version of the classic style of FPS.","June 17, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Team based objective game with a marines vs. aliens shooter theme to it.  Both marines and aliens has a commander who plays in a "starcraft style RTS" mode that builds, upgrades structures, and "micros" buffs/debuffs to your enemy and teammates.  Every one else plays as a marine or exosuit (mechs) versus different evolution of aliens ranging in support roles to assassin roles.  The game has been updated monthly and shows some response to the community.  Overall, if the support is consistent by "UWE" (Unknown Worlds), then the game will surely have a good lifespan for you.  There are a few modded servers that keep the game fresh and a unique game in every game you play.  Some of the negative aspects of the game though are the consistent team stacking, pro players coming into servers just to make the game depressing by steamrolling everyone, and lack of maps.\n\nPros: Unique style of gameplay, different forms of aliens to experience, coordinated team gameplay, and non mirrored matchup.\n\nCons: One or two sharpshooters on the same team can ruin the game, well played fade or lerk lifeform can carry the entire alien team, balance issues, lack of maps, small community, heavy rookie learning curve.","November 26, 2013","true","798.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Reliant upon squad tactics and logistical support the marines may be more familiar, but require solid aim and awareness.\n\nThe alien infestation are worlds apart, with a mix of disposable skulks, dog like aliens very similar in play to runner aliens from the early AvP games; through to Fades and Onoses, much more specialised lifeforms that are important to keep alive. The aliens are build around hit an run tactics and guerilla warfare; breaking supply and picking off isolated pockets to keep the marines on the defensive.\n\nThe RTS aspect is really what makes the game special, there is macro and micro required. Commanders (limited to one lucky person per side) placing Resource Towers to allow marines to get new weapons and upgrades and aliens to evolve, and also being able to provide more direct help to his footsoldiers by dropping medpacks, ammo and scans.\n\nThe game is very slick without being dumbed down, and is based on team work and strong tactics without being clunky. The game looks beautiful, but that has not been at the expense of gameplay.\n\nThe one thing I cannot account for is the community, whilst I have had mostly positive experiences the game relies upon teamwork; thus, people not working as part of the team or following the commander's suggestions will be dead weight, something that will get on everybody's nerves. Rokkies are flagged up, and the developers have tried to encourage a forgiving environment, but trust me when I say there is one golden rule...\n\nDo as you are asked: you will have a lot more fun that way.","December 15, 2013","true","88.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Oh, and its VERY arcade!\n\nThe game has two competing sides that play vastly differently, which is something rarely seen in multiplayer games, especially shooters. Playing as aliens is nothing like playing marines. Moreover, commanding makes the game actually a Real Time Strategy with other players as your units! However,  each side is limited to one commander, so if you enjoy NS2 as RTS, then you might have a hard time playing it this way when there are other players who want to be a commander too.\n\nNonetheless, there's a lot to enjoy in this game when played as FPP too. Not only because every unit (as aliens) and every different weapon (as humans) changes the style of the gameplay, but also because the game is quite intense and atmospheric (this is probably the best looking game I have ever seen too!). I highly recommend checking this game to everyone who like multiplayer action games, especially the arcade ones.\n\nThe only drawbacks I can think of are infuriating loading times. I have never seen a game that would load maps even one third of a time as a NS2 maps load.

And the thing is, it is done with great honesty, authenticity and seriousness. Developers did it with their heart, you can see it. Now ALL I wish, was that I had free time like when I was younger, that I had all my friends around me in LAN like when WE were younger, and to play for hours on that game. Because then it would be awesome. Without it, meh, it is just ok. But because of that potential that lucky people can exploit if they have time and friends, well, then I DO recommend that game to you, lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.","June 6, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So what does it offer?\n\n- hybrid FPS/RTS (the only other game I know about that does the same is Nuclear Dawn, but ND has been abandonned    by its devs and is pretty much dead)\n- two completely different teams with different upgrades, tech trees, weapons, etc. encouraging different strategies\n- a lot of room for in-depth teamwork\n- each match is different, even on the same map = high replay value (btw maps are awesome)\n- unlike most RTS, NS2 allows for surprising comebacks (too many careless mistakes by players with high value classes/equipment can cripple the winning team very hard)\n- high skill ceiling (play with people of same skill or you'll be frustrated)\n- constant updates\n\nMany of the old negative reviews do not apply anymore, as the game now puts you against people of same skill. I got this game when it was on sale for 5€, but to be honest even 10€ is a joke. Steam is full of ♥♥♥♥ games which are more expensive and don't even get close to the amount of content and replay value that NS2 offers.\nDon't get confused by the DLC, as I did. NS2 is not pay to win, everything is unlocked in the game. The DLCs are only skins, and most likely they will disappear soon anyways (one already did) due to the new NS2 item store. So expect more customization possibilites in the future.\n\nIf you think about buying this: do it.

Siege was a lot of fun and kept me coming back for a couple of months. However I can't recommend this game I bought less than a year ago because: 1. Player population dropped significantly.\n2. 80% of the games servers are completely empty.\n3. Nearly every server nowadays is literally in the 200+Ping redzone.\n4. They got rid of Siege gamemode and mostly favored making the game more difficult for an already tough game.\n\nI enjoyed it greatly, the community at the time was fun to play with. People strategized and worked together at the time, but unfortunately those days are gone.\nI do hope the server populations increase, the game gets better balanced, and siege comes back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteleafArts/recommended/4920/","WhiteleafArts","Whiteleaf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteleafArts/","14 products in account","So here's the story:\n\nGot super excited when I found an Aliens VS Humans game(been looking for a tactical one like this for a LONG time), so I bought it for 10 USD.\n\nStarted it up after installing: takes about 10 minutes to start up--and that's just the loading screen. No joke. I'm thinking, "Oh, maybe it just needs to load the files for the first time." Yeah I was wrong.\n\nGet to the menu, and I'm getting 7 FPS. Why? I've got over the system requirements and I'm running 7 FPS on medium settings, wth? Turn all the settings down to low, 720p resolution: get 15 FPS.\n\nGo to server browser and see if it's any better(by that I mean maybe it'll run faster in game). Find a server, try to connect to it. It's not full, and it's not connecting. Thought maybe a lot of stuff was happening in the server so it needed to process and load it all; nope. Wait about 5 mins and I close it out. Go to another server and try to connect, nope, after 5 mins again, I'm stuck on the dang loading screen.\n\nFinally decide to try the quick game option, and asks me if I want a tutorial. Hadn't ever played, so I clicked yes. And it takes around 10 mins to load...AGAIN. After it loads it's running 17 FPS(btw I have my Steam settings so I can see my FPS in game)...on lowest settings. My gosh...talk about not being optimized. So I start to hear the narrator and this is what immediately comes to mind after he's done speaking:\n\n'Background noise in the recording, you can hear the click to stop the audio from recording at the end, and there's a lot of static and it ends like it cut off; because there's not background noise in the game.' Can't believe that was the final audio recording for that, I have audacity(a free audio recording/editing program) with a $40 headset that sounds 10x better than this. I record it, if there's background noise I remove it ENTIRELY, and I have a cardboard box for my "professional" recording. Like really, this is the best you get when you release the game? That's one of the worst audio recordings I've ever heard in a game, it's rushed; unfinished and could have of been better made if you took your time.\n\nEnough about the audio rant, next, it tells me to build an armory, then kill some enemies. I start shooting the enemy(let's just call it an alien rat, first glance that's what I thought it was), and guess what happens? I drop half of my 17 FPS while fighting. I don't know why.\n\nI go back into my graphics settings after killing the alien rat and make sure everything is down, and turn the resolution down to the lowest. I decide to see what would happen if I turn up the quality on some things, because in some games it happens to run faster on higher settings; don't ask why, but they do. Anyways I literally JUST click the little arrow so that the texture quality is medium, and what happens next? Drop half of my 17 FPS again?, no. Increased FPS?, no.\n\nAll of the dang HUD disappears off my screen. Nothing at all. No text for the settings menu, and no HUD whatsoever in game. Wth? I click the left arrow(arrow that decreases the quality) on the button-area I had clicked, and nothing happens. I hit apply: nothing. Not a single text is on my screen. Empty rectangles and empty boxes.\n\nI proceed to close out the menu and reopen it to see if it was glitched for a second. *sigh*...This keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? After I close the menu again my game freezes...comepletely freezes. It's sound is looping and locking at a certain point(that indicating it's completely frozen), I open task manager to close the process...and I don't see it. Because of course, the stupid application is covering my desktop and I'm blind to everything there. I tried for 3 minutes to get the stupid task manager to work, finally I found an option where I can "move" it by right clicking on its icon on the Windows bar. Move it over to my second monitor, and close out the application.\n\nTL;DR: Game froze, HUD disappeared, terribly optimized, bad experience. Had high hopes that I could play this but NOPE! I'm also REALLY ticked off that I'm above the recommended requirements, and that the requirements lied to us. I should be able to get a solid 30 FPS on min requirements on the lowest settings AT LEAST. NOPE!\n\nBad game, uninstalling and not playing again.","June 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","3"

I haven't had as much trouble finding games as in my previous review.\n\nI was getting very frustrated with how often (after rookie only servers) I was constantly getting destroyed, but this too has gone away as the game mechanics (besides commanding) are pretty intuitive and with some patience and effort I no longer feel like a total idiot/scrub.\n\nNeedless to say, my sinking disappointment after I left the rookie servers at how awful the game seemed is gone and I think I've found another game to play regularly!

With multiplayer you really do need a good commander on your side otherwise you will lose, its that simple. I came here from an article on PC Gamer - wasn't familiar with the title of the game but me and some friends decided to purchase it cheap and give it a go.\n\nGreat game for teamwork, and also nice to see that Comms is widely used so you'll find most people are there to help. I did feel Marines were useless until the Jetpack mod upgrade, personally the Aliens feel alot stronger at the start - maybe with the correct commander you can earn the Marine capabilities quicker and turn the battle back around.\n\nWas nice to be able to play and will be stored in my steam library for more future plays.","January 16","true","22.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Along came a stand alone sequel to one of the greatest mods to Half-Life 1.\n\nIt launched with an editor. This was a HUGE deal at the time. You didn't have the option of the free UE4 Engine,  and all of the major titles on the market were booming the DLC deal.\n\nPlayer retention hasn't been good in Natural Selection 2, but the game deserve so much more play than it does. One of the reasons is that it's an old school titel, with roots in the mindset of the hl1 times. Getting good as either marine or alien takes time and practice, also a fair bit of knowledge, and on top of that you have the commander aspect which is basicly an RTS game with real players (some may act like AI's).\n\nNot many players has the patience of old times, where people would defrag in a mod for Quake3, for weeks, only to outrick their opponents movement wise the in their matches.\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Getting gud is hard. (like in the old days)\n- The game is awesome and have one of the best communities of all time, who are all happy to help / teach new players.\n- Active forum / steam community.\n- All it really needs is more players.\n\n10/10\n\n*Plushie Gorge's may cause cuteness overload*","May 13","true","057.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Everything else is a small accessory to that goal.\n\nBy comparison, just knowing the basics of Natural Selection 2 is a catacomb of logic. It makes you realize why games like TF2 and even Battlefield now focus on the idea of just having single-objective maps; diverting your focus between the five things going on at any time is often near-impossible. This is combined with very precise control requirements for each of the characters involved. For a marine, a skulk can jump across 30 degrees of your vision in less than half a second, and as any alien, having a constant arena awareness to make use of mobility is an immense challenge.\n\nThis does two things. The high skill floor causes a massive divide between skill levels. For instance, a bad skulk will get 1 kill in an entire game, and a good skulk will be undefeatable even to basic enemy marines. Second, it causes any team failure to become heavily compounded. If you've played a TF2 game with just one team member AFK, you tend to notice it. In NS2, just having someone not doing 20 things a minute as a commander can screw everyone over.\n\nThe pressure to perform well moment to moment has, sadly, turned the community pretty sour, much like a game like League of Legends. Even simple failings of the team like failing to act quickly in the face of overwhelming amounts of information (for instance, constant references to named map locations) can cause commanders to exasperate "Geez, we might as well forfeit, we have NO teamwork going on". Worse, if the team doesn't vote to concede, a completely lost match will drag on for half an hour with no map change. (Unlike a game like League of Legends, there's just no opportunities for comebacks - the entire resource system of the game encourages the "rolling wrecking ball" mentality)\n\nPerhaps this game would be fun with months of practice, played solely with players who have similar amounts of experience; but even if you can get that first goal you'd likely just become one of the aforementioned commanders.","December 23, 2015","false","54.0"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","1"

Often ending is a very real struggle on both sides with team work, almost inherently making even the most random and public of games competitive.\n\nOn top of this Natural Selection 2 is one of the few PC games that remains open source, coming with everything from the level designer to a PDF file explaining the dynamics of map making and how to make one that is balanced, the same PDF i assume Unknown worlds gives to their employees. Best of all, the developers take the time to listen to the community, engaging in conversation and discussions daily. In fact, being a player who has been around since early alpha i know a number of features in the game, good features, were designed by players like you are me and implemented with the help of the developers.\n\nNatural Selection 2 is a gem for its time, one of the last PC games to still embrace the community as PC games used to do.","December 19, 2013","true","252.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanO-bytez/recommended/4920/","nanO-bytez","nanO.bytez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nanO-bytez/","421 products in account","You remember the Alien vs. Predator frenchise back in the day? Before Half Life 2? This is it at it's core. And then, it isn't.\nNatural Selection 2 is a competitive FPS-RTS mix that features asymmetrical gameplay. A team of Marines is put against a team of aliens that play entirely different while one player of each team serves as an overseeing commander from a top-down perspective. As commander you have to put down buildings like ressource extractors, armories, robotic facilities or buildings that provide upgrades for your little and ever complaining servants. This mode actually plays quite a lot like Starcraft or Command & Conquer for example. At least most of the times. You can even issue specific orders to individual team members. Following these orders and the way they are executing them is completely up them though.\n\nWhile the commander and his skill is certainly critical to the success of your team, the personal skill of every soldier/alien matters almost as equally. But teamplay is objectively the most critical. A team that communicates a steady flow of information is already half way through the match.\n\nThere is quite a lot of maps shipped with the game and an almost infinite number of custom made maps as well as different game modes. The basic mode though puts you on a map with usually 5 locations where a command terminal or hive can be set up. These are needed for your commander to do his job. If you loose all of your Command terminals / Hives you loose the game. You start with one prebuild at a random location together with your first ressource extractor that provide a slow tick of ressources, both for the commander to spend on buildings, upgrades etc and for every player seperately to spend on personal equipment (Weapons, Armor, perks, ...). In case of the Marines you also start with a single Infantry Portal on which dead marines can respawn. Aliens hatch from eggs that spawn near a Hive at a slow rate.\nSo the immediate goal is to expand to other ressource nodes, build up you base and defend it and eventually destroy the enemie's bases. It's a game about map control like you would expect from a competitive RTS, so usually the team that holds the majority of ressource nodes for an extended period of time wins the game. Usually.\n\nSo much for the gameplay. What's it mechanically? It's a fast paced shooter that orientates itself along older titles like said Alien vs. Predator, Unreal Tournament, even Counter Strike for a certain degree. Weapons don't nessecarily act realistically. It is more important to keep the cursor on target than it is precisely aim or shoot in bursts to maintain a narrow spread. Aliens regenerate health at a slow rate but marines need medipacks that are dropped by the commander or an armory to get back up to full health. In addition they need a teammate with a welder to fix any armor points lost.\nSo, pretty old school but with an interesting twist and certainly a focus on teamplay.\nGameplay mechanics for the commander are deskribed in one word: Starcraft. It's an established formula and it works fine. Hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. Every building and every equipment you may drop as commander is sorted in different categories (basic buildings, advanced buildings, etc.) and mapped to a specific key. (Controls are fully rebindable by the way). That's it. It's pretty easy to pick up although quite hard to be good at.\n\nTechnically and graphically the game is not really state of the art. It is not an ugly game and the texture quality is reasonably good. Animations work fine although they might look a bit silly from time to time. Where it really shines is it's dense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere and the ammount of adjustable game and graphics options as well as it featuring a good, old fashioned server browser and full mod support.\nIt's a PC game so why would you not want to pick a server based in your country with a low ping instead of being randomly assigned some server at the end of the world where not a single person speaks a language you recognise and you lag yourself through the map? Server browsers are your best friend in any FPS and Natural Selection 2 has one so... go for it.\n\nIf you like Counter Strike but would like to try something that puts two teams with entirely different strengthes and weaknesses against each other while maintaining a high degree of competitive gameplay then Natural Selection 2 is a thing you will most certainly enjoy.\nIf you already enjoyed it's predecessor or Alien vs. Predator back in the day but the graphics get a bit old for you then this is an absolute no-brainer. Buy it. Love it.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind though is that the developer pretty much ceased any support and further development to be able to concentrate on their current project. Although there are still frequent content updates and plenty of bugfixes provided by the community team that officially took over and so far the changes that were made by this team improved the game in many aspects.","October 4, 2014","true","87.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He issues commands and places structures that have to be build an defended by the other players. The other players see the world from the FPS perspective.\n\nThis isn't CoD or BF! If a team doesn't work together, it usually gets crushed in a few minutes. So you really need to work together since there is no unit that can survive alone! I can't say this often enough! Remember to obey and help your commander and use your voice chat to report enemy movements etc!\n\nPlaying as a human marine is similar to other shooters save for the team dependency. What really makes this game unique is the alien side. Since this game features asymmetric  gameplay, the developers made sure that the two teams play completely different. The aliens see the world through their mouth, bite and spit at enemies, climb walls, cloak and evolve into oher lifeforms.\n\nThe game is incredibely fun if you play in a team that works together.

Playing either side, marines or aliens, proves to be balanced and fun given all the different unit customizations the game offers. The game randomizes where the players start in the beginning, which makes for increased replay value since every round plays out differently. However, the problem i had was technically when it's your first time playing the game. Game crashes for about 3-5 times during loading screen, first game map loads about 7-9 minutes but afterwards download will only take 2-3 minutes and.

I bought the new edition last year (mainly to support the developers) and was a bit scared by the fact that they built their own engine. After trying it out I was impressed by the visuals and gameplay, but unhappy with performance and mouse input. Because of that, the game did not draw my attention for too long.\n\nLately, I gave NS2 a second chance and must admit that they put great effort into updates. You can use raw mouse input and the performance has increased dramatically. Furthermore the skill level is quite high (I think there is a competitive scene) and it is really fun to fool around as a total noob on public servers.\n\nThe aiming skills needed are different (in comparision to e. g. Counter-Strike) because aliens are very fast, can be nearly everywhere and a lot of close combat situations arise. The RTS part of the game (commanding) seems to introduce a lot of cooperation and teamwork even to public servers.\n\nThere are always full servers and the community is surprisingly friendly (voice communication is quite common).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightachu/recommended/4920/","lightachu","Prepare to Cry: Sif Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightachu/","158 products in account","Natural Selection 2 is a near-perfect asymmetrical multiplayer game that integrates the real-time strategy and first-person shooter genres into one package. In Natural Selection 2, there are two teams: the marines, and the aliens. The marines work kind of like your typical first-person shooter. They are, however, led by a commander who can drop health and ammo for the marines as well as placing structures around the map for them to build on their quest for victory. The aliens work a little differently; they tend to fight more effectively in close quarters situations, unlike the marines who can shoot from a distance. The alien players can also evolve into more advanced life forms whom each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Just like the marines, the aliens have a commander. The alien commander works much more independently than the marine commander; however, the alien commander can still provide a lot of support for his team with the structues that he or she builds and the upgrade paths that he or she chooses. The asymmetrical gameplay along with the combination of two outstanding game genres means that there is never really a dull moment, as every match can be interesting in its own way. I definitely recommend that you atleast give Natural Selection 2 a chance.","December 29, 2012","true","759.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would give it a 8/10 in the current state.\n\nPositive\nit is very different to other games:\n- 2 completely different teams\n- Many weapons/lifeforms/upgrades are unlockable\n- You can play as a strategic commander\n-This makes the game very dynamic and gives you an insane amount of possibilities, tactics and   situation you can find yourself in between.\n- The gameplay is very fast\n- The community is very helpful. Ask any game related question on a Server: You will get helpful answers!\n\nNegative:\n- High system requierements\n- Very complex at the beginning (You won't understand much and you will get killed very often)\n\nIt is still possible to learn this game. Once you know how to play it, it will be one of the most awesome games you can have and it makes fun for many many hours.

Unlike most games of this type fighting against an enemy team of a COMPLETELY different makeup and abilities to your own makes quite interesting and pulse pounding games. Often ending is a very real struggle on both sides with team work, almost inherently making even the most random and public of games competitive.\n\nOn top of this Natural Selection 2 is one of the few PC games that remains open source, coming with everything from the level designer to a PDF file explaining the dynamics of map making and how to make one that is balanced, the same PDF i assume Unknown worlds gives to their employees. Best of all, the developers take the time to listen to the community, engaging in conversation and discussions daily. In fact, being a player who has been around since early alpha i know a number of features in the game, good features, were designed by players like you are me and implemented with the help of the developers.\n\nNatural Selection 2 is a gem for its time, one of the last PC games to still embrace the community as PC games used to do.","December 19, 2013","true","252.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game seamlessly blends RTS and FPS elements which ends up producing rounds that have isolated, but intense firefights in the beginning, followed by all out team fights later in the rounds. Playing either side, marines or aliens, proves to be balanced and fun given all the different unit customizations the game offers. The game randomizes where the players start in the beginning, which makes for increased replay value since every round plays out differently. However, the problem i had was technically when it's your first time playing the game. Game crashes for about 3-5 times during loading screen, first game map loads about 7-9 minutes but afterwards download will only take 2-3 minutes and. On the brightside, there is no Lone Wolf crap, requires a lot of teamwork, it's better to use voice communication as a commander, Overall! It's a nice fresh combination of RTS and FPS. You'll love this Game if you enjoy FPS and RTS.\n\nRated: 8.3/10","June 24, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A team of aliens plays versus marines, each having a commander that controls their team from above in a RTS style gameplay making this team-shooter a unique game with a unique gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is very quick, especially when playing on the alien side due to the high movement speeds, but still strategy is paramount to win in this game.\n\nSome points I especially like:\n+ Completely different gamplay, based on which side you are on\n+ Offers possibilities for slower/more relaxed players (Use the Gorge form as alien - building structures, supporting your team; Welder as marine - repairing structures/armor of players)\n+ Succesively unlocking new items in the tech tree diversifies games\n+ Having a commander gives the game a special "feel"\n+ Teamplay is encouraged\n+ Huge choice of upgrades/weapons\n+ Playing as commander is absolutely huge and an excellent experience\n\nThere are also some things I don't like but they are negligible towards the positive points:\n- Finding someone to play commander on your team is often difficult on public servers\n- The success of a game depends heavily/ultimately on the skills of your commander\n- Overwhelming the marine team after a long game as aliens can be very tedious and lengthy, even after the whole map apart from one base is under alien control. Marines are able to easily defend a single base.\n\nI think this game is a worthy purchase and I can only recommend playing it.

With alien melee (safe for Lerk which can do a lot at range and the Gorge though it should rather build). Real time strategy is a required element for one guy on each team, through the commander chair.\n\nNatural Selection leads to a diversity of play to be enjoyed for hours. It can be a bit frustrating to pick up, though I enjoyed the complexity from the start. “Tanking” a “big ♥♥♥ Donkey” can be an enjoyable experience even while loosing. You can’t be blamed for feeding (well not is standard play) so stick to it and keep an eye on the map and radar {tip}.\n\nIf you want more strategy or want to dictate the flow of the game jump into the commander seat. Though most people require one to have a mic for this role as communication is important esp. if your team does not ping or keep an eye on the map.\n\nBalance is a bit of a dynamic perspective. It is balanced, though you might not think it at times and the whole thing can change around the next patch corner.\nLatency is not so damaging so you can have fun in global games.

While one of your teammates (or even you) is the commander, the others have to help him building different tipes of constructions and, of course kill and destroy enemy constructions.\nWhat happens if you are getting bored of being the commander? No problem, my friend! You can exit from the commander base whenever you want, and you only have to wait if other mate wants to be the commander. Just follow one rule: There must always be a commander, if not, your team is lost.\nBored of being always shooting to little aliens? Then switch side when another round starts.\nYou can decde your side before the game starts so look carefully to the advantages and disadvantages of each one:\n-Marines have different weapons and upgrades of ther armours and weapons. They can even buy powerfull machines to help them. They are a perfect choice if you prefer a direct stile of shooting and go with your mates to battle.\n-Aliens have a more stealthy style. They can go by vents and make surprise attacks to alone marines. For this they all have like darkvision and they are very rapid. You can even evolve to different aliens with different tipes of attacks and movement, like fly, climb the walls or go as fast as it looks like you are teleporting yourself!\nDefinitely, Natural Selection 2 is a game that won't disappoint you, and I highly recommend it.","December 5, 2013","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay involves either being on the ground or in the commander's seat, fusing beautifully the first person shooter and the real time strategy genres.\n\nNumerous weapons and classes are available for both the Marines and the Kharaa, this allows for diverse play and keeps the game interesting. From the humble skulk, running on the ceilings and dropping in on unsuspecting victims. To the gargantuan and brutish Onos, smashing everything in it's path and reducing Marine machines to their component parts in seconds. There's a class for all kinds of players on both sides. Want to run around fearing for your life? Stick with your bog-standard infantryman. Want to go crazy and toe-to-toe with an Onos? Get yourself a mech and be feared by the Kharaa.\n\nWIth hours of replayability, servers up 24/7, and a well balanced system of play. Natural Selection 2 is by far one of my favourite games of all time. Go ahead, buy it. I'll be waiting on the ceiling round the corner.","December 15, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you ever played the predecessor, a mod for Half-Life, then you are familiar with the concept.  It's a blend of some RTS elements into an FPS game, pitting aliens against humans.   As an Alien you can evolve to a number of different species, from flying Lerks to the massive bull-like Onos.   As a human, you're more limited by what your command chair player gives you.  They'll give you objectives for new structures to build, give you weaponry to equip yourself with, and research new tech for your team.\n\nThe only gripe I have is with the balancing of the two sides, it's been disappointing at times in the beta and retail lifespan.","November 29, 2012","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Natural Selection 2, there are two teams: the marines, and the aliens. The marines work kind of like your typical first-person shooter. They are, however, led by a commander who can drop health and ammo for the marines as well as placing structures around the map for them to build on their quest for victory. The aliens work a little differently; they tend to fight more effectively in close quarters situations, unlike the marines who can shoot from a distance. The alien players can also evolve into more advanced life forms whom each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Just like the marines, the aliens have a commander. The alien commander works much more independently than the marine commander; however, the alien commander can still provide a lot of support for his team with the structues that he or she builds and the upgrade paths that he or she chooses. The asymmetrical gameplay along with the combination of two outstanding game genres means that there is never really a dull moment, as every match can be interesting in its own way. I definitely recommend that you atleast give Natural Selection 2 a chance.","December 29, 2012","true","759.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A team of aliens plays versus marines, each having a commander that controls their team from above in a RTS style gameplay making this team-shooter a unique game with a unique gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is very quick, especially when playing on the alien side due to the high movement speeds, but still strategy is paramount to win in this game.\n\nSome points I especially like:\n+ Completely different gamplay, based on which side you are on\n+ Offers possibilities for slower/more relaxed players (Use the Gorge form as alien - building structures, supporting your team; Welder as marine - repairing structures/armor of players)\n+ Succesively unlocking new items in the tech tree diversifies games\n+ Having a commander gives the game a special "feel"\n+ Teamplay is encouraged\n+ Huge choice of upgrades/weapons\n+ Playing as commander is absolutely huge and an excellent experience\n\nThere are also some things I don't like but they are negligible towards the positive points:\n- Finding someone to play commander on your team is often difficult on public servers\n- The success of a game depends heavily/ultimately on the skills of your commander\n- Overwhelming the marine team after a long game as aliens can be very tedious and lengthy, even after the whole map apart from one base is under alien control. Marines are able to easily defend a single base.\n\nI think this game is a worthy purchase and I can only recommend playing it.

At first the Marines seem more straight forward and the Alien race is a little bit too obscure to seem to be fun. Eventually both sides are fun to play for various reasons.\n\nOne needs to look up general gameplay mechanics in order understand what things do abd are useful for,  how to react properly etc. Generally the community is nice and the only real downside seems to be lags/glitches with the netcode on bigger servers. A loss brings frustration but when things turn out well, it's a lot of fun with some tactical aspects you wont find in other FPS.","December 29, 2013","true","571.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Marines Vs Aliens in a fight to take out the other's base. Each side is led by a commander who views the game in a Top-Down style RTS view. Their soldiers are controlled by other players in First-Person. Lots of weapons, upgrades, and equipment keep the game interesting depending on which order they are researched by the commander.\n\nEach team plays differently, but each also has an incredibly high learning curve. This game is not for the impatient or the lone-wolf. This is a team-based game. Players that don't work together will die, teams that are divided will lose.

Marines like to use guns, Aliens like to nom Marines and are faster.\n\nBoth sides have a commander who builds structures for the team and play this FPS as an RTS instead. They use resources from resource points that they've built on or gotten team-mates to build on. These then are used to get more tech and upgrades for everyone else.\n\nEveryone else also gets resources from their controlled resource points. Aliens use them to evolve into different Aliens (and to place structures as Gorge) such as rhinos (Onos), whilst Marines use them to get different guns and jetpacks and mechs.\n\nSo your goal is to eliminate all the enemy players by either destroying their respawn buildings and/or command structures. To do this hold more resource points so you get upgrades faster, and go destroy enemy buildings / people with better weapons/aliens so that the enemy team loses their resources.\n\nHave fun nomming people/shooting things/bossing people around!","November 16, 2012","true","75.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A team of aliens plays versus marines, each having a commander that controls their team from above in a RTS style gameplay making this team-shooter a unique game with a unique gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is very quick, especially when playing on the alien side due to the high movement speeds, but still strategy is paramount to win in this game.\n\nSome points I especially like:\n+ Completely different gamplay, based on which side you are on\n+ Offers possibilities for slower/more relaxed players (Use the Gorge form as alien - building structures, supporting your team; Welder as marine - repairing structures/armor of players)\n+ Succesively unlocking new items in the tech tree diversifies games\n+ Having a commander gives the game a special "feel"\n+ Teamplay is encouraged\n+ Huge choice of upgrades/weapons\n+ Playing as commander is absolutely huge and an excellent experience\n\nThere are also some things I don't like but they are negligible towards the positive points:\n- Finding someone to play commander on your team is often difficult on public servers\n- The success of a game depends heavily/ultimately on the skills of your commander\n- Overwhelming the marine team after a long game as aliens can be very tedious and lengthy, even after the whole map apart from one base is under alien control. Marines are able to easily defend a single base.\n\nI think this game is a worthy purchase and I can only recommend playing it.

Marines, and the various forms of Aliens, all look like clones of one another. The environments are also pretty similar looking, though it’s hard to notice when you’re fighting for you life. I’ve also encountered a few issues where it locks up after failing to load a level properly. Even more frustrating is that there’s no way to group with friends to go into matches together, nor is there a way to see how far along a match is before you join. Smartly, though, the team has integrated mod support into the main menu, and it’s great to see how active the community has been in implementing new skins and the like into Steamworks.","December 29, 2013","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He issues commands and places structures that have to be build an defended by the other players. The other players see the world from the FPS perspective.\n\nThis isn't CoD or BF! If a team doesn't work together, it usually gets crushed in a few minutes. So you really need to work together since there is no unit that can survive alone! I can't say this often enough! Remember to obey and help your commander and use your voice chat to report enemy movements etc!\n\nPlaying as a human marine is similar to other shooters save for the team dependency. What really makes this game unique is the alien side. Since this game features asymmetric  gameplay, the developers made sure that the two teams play completely different. The aliens see the world through their mouth, bite and spit at enemies, climb walls, cloak and evolve into oher lifeforms.\n\nThe game is incredibely fun if you play in a team that works together.

Before Half Life 2? This is it at it's core. And then, it isn't.\nNatural Selection 2 is a competitive FPS-RTS mix that features asymmetrical gameplay. A team of Marines is put against a team of aliens that play entirely different while one player of each team serves as an overseeing commander from a top-down perspective. As commander you have to put down buildings like ressource extractors, armories, robotic facilities or buildings that provide upgrades for your little and ever complaining servants. This mode actually plays quite a lot like Starcraft or Command & Conquer for example. At least most of the times. You can even issue specific orders to individual team members. Following these orders and the way they are executing them is completely up them though.\n\nWhile the commander and his skill is certainly critical to the success of your team, the personal skill of every soldier/alien matters almost as equally. But teamplay is objectively the most critical. A team that communicates a steady flow of information is already half way through the match.\n\nThere is quite a lot of maps shipped with the game and an almost infinite number of custom made maps as well as different game modes. The basic mode though puts you on a map with usually 5 locations where a command terminal or hive can be set up. These are needed for your commander to do his job. If you loose all of your Command terminals / Hives you loose the game. You start with one prebuild at a random location together with your first ressource extractor that provide a slow tick of ressources, both for the commander to spend on buildings, upgrades etc and for every player seperately to spend on personal equipment (Weapons, Armor, perks, ...). In case of the Marines you also start with a single Infantry Portal on which dead marines can respawn. Aliens hatch from eggs that spawn near a Hive at a slow rate.\nSo the immediate goal is to expand to other ressource nodes, build up you base and defend it and eventually destroy the enemie's bases. It's a game about map control like you would expect from a competitive RTS, so usually the team that holds the majority of ressource nodes for an extended period of time wins the game. Usually.\n\nSo much for the gameplay. What's it mechanically? It's a fast paced shooter that orientates itself along older titles like said Alien vs. Predator, Unreal Tournament, even Counter Strike for a certain degree. Weapons don't nessecarily act realistically. It is more important to keep the cursor on target than it is precisely aim or shoot in bursts to maintain a narrow spread. Aliens regenerate health at a slow rate but marines need medipacks that are dropped by the commander or an armory to get back up to full health. In addition they need a teammate with a welder to fix any armor points lost.\nSo, pretty old school but with an interesting twist and certainly a focus on teamplay.\nGameplay mechanics for the commander are deskribed in one word: Starcraft. It's an established formula and it works fine. Hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. Every building and every equipment you may drop as commander is sorted in different categories (basic buildings, advanced buildings, etc.) and mapped to a specific key. (Controls are fully rebindable by the way). That's it. It's pretty easy to pick up although quite hard to be good at.\n\nTechnically and graphically the game is not really state of the art. It is not an ugly game and the texture quality is reasonably good. Animations work fine although they might look a bit silly from time to time. Where it really shines is it's dense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere and the ammount of adjustable game and graphics options as well as it featuring a good, old fashioned server browser and full mod support.\nIt's a PC game so why would you not want to pick a server based in your country with a low ping instead of being randomly assigned some server at the end of the world where not a single person speaks a language you recognise and you lag yourself through the map? Server browsers are your best friend in any FPS and Natural Selection 2 has one so... go for it.\n\nIf you like Counter Strike but would like to try something that puts two teams with entirely different strengthes and weaknesses against each other while maintaining a high degree of competitive gameplay then Natural Selection 2 is a thing you will most certainly enjoy.\nIf you already enjoyed it's predecessor or Alien vs. Predator back in the day but the graphics get a bit old for you then this is an absolute no-brainer. Buy it. Love it.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind though is that the developer pretty much ceased any support and further development to be able to concentrate on their current project. Although there are still frequent content updates and plenty of bugfixes provided by the community team that officially took over and so far the changes that were made by this team improved the game in many aspects.","October 4, 2014","true","87.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought the new edition last year (mainly to support the developers) and was a bit scared by the fact that they built their own engine. After trying it out I was impressed by the visuals and gameplay, but unhappy with performance and mouse input. Because of that, the game did not draw my attention for too long.\n\nLately, I gave NS2 a second chance and must admit that they put great effort into updates. You can use raw mouse input and the performance has increased dramatically. Furthermore the skill level is quite high (I think there is a competitive scene) and it is really fun to fool around as a total noob on public servers.\n\nThe aiming skills needed are different (in comparision to e. g. Counter-Strike) because aliens are very fast, can be nearly everywhere and a lot of close combat situations arise. The RTS part of the game (commanding) seems to introduce a lot of cooperation and teamwork even to public servers.\n\nThere are always full servers and the community is surprisingly friendly (voice communication is quite common).

And jet-packs to greatly enhance the speed and mobility of infantry.\n\nThis put up against the Kharaa's arsenal of lifeforms including:\nThe small, fast moving, wall and celing crawling Skulk\nThe support and builder-class Gorge\nThe flying and obnoxious gas-farting Lerk\nThe in-and-out-of-battle blinking assassin-class Fade\nAnd the massive and extremely tough marine-stomping and goring Onos.\n\nBut there's more!!

Resources are harvested from certain points and go to both team resources that the commander spends and personal resources that can be used to buy weapons (for the marines) or evolve into new lifeforms (for the Kharaa).  The marines get the standard guns : starting with the machinegun and can purchase others such as a flamethrower, grenade launcher, welder or the ultimate Exo suit.  The Kharaa start as the skulk, angry little dogs, and can evolve into gorges (support/builder unit), Lerk (flying ranged unit), Fade (teleporting assassin) and finally the tanky Onos (large angry bull).\n\nAll in all it is a very fun game, and there is apparently a lot of moddability to the game as well so there is a lot of replay value.

It was origonally a mod for Half-Life published over 10 years ago. One player from each team elects to be commander and plays the game similar to a real time strategy. All the other players either become a marine or an alien (depending on the team a player is on) and plays the game in a more FPS style.\n\nWhat is the gameplay like?\nNatural Selection 2 is not an easy game by any means. It relies heavily on teamwork as well as personal skill. The most critical roles in the game is the commander as he/she is responsible for co-ordinating the team, placing structures, managing resources and choosing upgrades. For this reason, it is highly recommended that people new to the game (< 10 hours) do not command on public servers. Moving on, marines play like most other FPS's, with their primary weapon being a gun. Everyone spawns in as a marine and can buy weapons and utilities from structures such as armories. When a marine is killed, he/she respawns from one of the infantry portals placed by the commander. As for the aliens, everyone spawns in as a basic alien call a skulk. Skulks have the ability to run up walls and bite for their primary attack. An alien can also evolve (works similar to buying) into other life forms. These other life forms consist of the gorge (an engineer/medic support life form), the lerk (a flying alien with ranged attacks), the fade (an assassin like alien which can use "blinking" to move very fast) and the onos (a big rhino looking creature). When an alien dies, he/she becomes one of the team's eggs around a hive (an alien command structure) and hatches after a few seconds. The game is heavily resource based, with each team battling for the numerous resource nodes scattered around the map. Because of this, the balance of power can snowball if a team gets a poor start. Games usually last for around 20 minutes, although there is always the odd 1 hour long games (which are usually very tense).\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nI would recommend this game to anyone if they are intrested in games in the strategy and FPS genre. However, this game requires quite a few hours to grasp the concepts and its community is slowly shrinking, so if you have friends who have lots of spare time of their hands, it might be worth picking this up during a sale and giving it a go. (Plus playing with friends is always lots more fun)\n\nPros:\nAsymmetrical gameplay\nGood mix of RTS and FPS\n\nCons:\nSteep learning curve\nSmall community","March 15, 2013","true","195.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

With the aliens, you can evolve to different species, you start off as a skulk, then, (in order of cost) Gorge, the healer, the Lerk, A flying Creature, The Fade, with it's deadly claws and blink ability. Then there is the Onos, the tank. All these are brought with resources, which you get for capturing res towers and holding them. It's the best multiplayer game I've ever played.\n\nTL;DR: WHY ARE YOU READING THIS GO BUY IT!","October 12, 2013","true","127.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both sides are critically dependent on a competent commander viewing it all from an RTS point of view, setting up structures, researching upgrades, new gear and abilities, dropping supplies in times of need and advicing the forces in their quest to destroy the enemy.

There's potentially more balancing to be done when it comes to certain classes or abilities being slightly overpowered, but that's a matter of fine-tuned refinement rather than a vast overhaul. Right now it's an excellent game that taps into both the FPS and RTS markets, with plenty of varied builds and playing styles on offer. If competitive multiplayer gaming is survival of the fittest, then Natural Selection 2 is certainly fighting tooth and claw to reach the top tier.","December 31, 2013","true","199.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cookie590/recommended/4920/","cookie590","The Last Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cookie590/","159 products in account","Should you buy Natural Selection 2?\n\nSo firstly, what is Natural Selection 2?\nNatural Selection 2 is a multiplayer only, Strategy/FPS hybrid (a mixture of the strategy and first person shooter genres) created by Unknown Worlds, in which marines face off against aliens in a fight for map domination. It was origonally a mod for Half-Life published over 10 years ago. One player from each team elects to be commander and plays the game similar to a real time strategy. All the other players either become a marine or an alien (depending on the team a player is on) and plays the game in a more FPS style.\n\nWhat is the gameplay like?\nNatural Selection 2 is not an easy game by any means. It relies heavily on teamwork as well as personal skill. The most critical roles in the game is the commander as he/she is responsible for co-ordinating the team, placing structures, managing resources and choosing upgrades. For this reason, it is highly recommended that people new to the game (< 10 hours) do not command on public servers. Moving on, marines play like most other FPS's, with their primary weapon being a gun. Everyone spawns in as a marine and can buy weapons and utilities from structures such as armories. When a marine is killed, he/she respawns from one of the infantry portals placed by the commander. As for the aliens, everyone spawns in as a basic alien call a skulk. Skulks have the ability to run up walls and bite for their primary attack. An alien can also evolve (works similar to buying) into other life forms. These other life forms consist of the gorge (an engineer/medic support life form), the lerk (a flying alien with ranged attacks), the fade (an assassin like alien which can use "blinking" to move very fast) and the onos (a big rhino looking creature). When an alien dies, he/she becomes one of the team's eggs around a hive (an alien command structure) and hatches after a few seconds. The game is heavily resource based, with each team battling for the numerous resource nodes scattered around the map. Because of this, the balance of power can snowball if a team gets a poor start. Games usually last for around 20 minutes, although there is always the odd 1 hour long games (which are usually very tense).\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nI would recommend this game to anyone if they are intrested in games in the strategy and FPS genre. However, this game requires quite a few hours to grasp the concepts and its community is slowly shrinking, so if you have friends who have lots of spare time of their hands, it might be worth picking this up during a sale and giving it a go. (Plus playing with friends is always lots more fun)\n\nPros:\nAsymmetrical gameplay\nGood mix of RTS and FPS\n\nCons:\nSteep learning curve\nSmall community","March 15, 2013","true","195.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't complain because the developer's aren't to blame for my PC being terrible, but I would have liked to see more features able to be adjusted like texture quality and geometric complexity, since reducing the triangle count would certainly speed up draw times and make the game a lot more playable for people with less expensive machines like mine.

Brilliant strategic and tactical depth. Awesome graphics with perfect styling. Runs pretty good as long as the server isn't a toaster. Being competitively balanced it can lead to a few lopsided games for every balanced one you get, but when you get a balanced game it's a real trip and even better if you win. The marines struggle to stay alive, the way the alien creep spreads over the map and the lighting effects have to be experienced. It takes some effort to learn all the nuances (and you might not ever get it all) but that's what makes it good, definitely worth 10 bucks. Since there is nothing else like this game that competes, it will always have a player base, some of the NS2 players play nothing but NS2.

Games can span anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on how well the teams are balanced.

He shortly left and I hope he uninstalled.\n\nThe gameplay:\nPlay as MARINES at first because it's the most familiar play smart and stick with your group/don't split up. Keep your distance from the aliens and move strategically and communicate with your commander.

I will not say "unique", since the word seems overused nowadays. What is unique about the game is that it actually implements 2 very different factions with very different playstyles while still staying moderately balanced. It is also unique in the way that the development team keeps the game updated and running, partially relying on community effort to do so.\n\nWithin the game the Marine faction represents the standard FPS gameplay of tactical movement and long range engagements. The Marines move slower through the map, but have a distinctive firepower advantage and can set up outposts a lot more quickly than the aliens. The Marine commander will have to juggle a lot betweeen setting up bases, maintaining resource income and supporting frontline troops. Marine field players will need to coordinate with the commander and each other in order to hold as much ground as they can without spreading their forces too much\n\nThe Alien faction has many lifeforms that have short range attacks and low hitpoints, especially in the beginning of the game. They rely on stealth and synergies between their abilites to ambush and overwhelm marines or sneak behind enemy lines to quickly destroy key structures. The Alien Commander can focus a lot more on supporting his team and can even leave his position in the Hive vacant for some time to assist in attacking or defending. Alien field players need to pick wisely when to invest resources in higher lifeforms and balance between doing the most possible damage and keeping their valuable lifeforms alive.\n\nAs an advise for new players I recommend to visit servers with a lower playercount first. The game is designed around teams with 6-8 players, which further increases the steep learning curve on some of the high playercount servers. Also, I advise them not to be afraid of trying to play aliens at first. While playing as marine may be more familar to many, there are many things to learn and keep in mind at once that simply do not matter for alien players. Going for a high skill server while learning is okay, however keep in mind that on servers with a high average skill the atmosphere can become a bit competetive.\n\nStrenghts:\n\n- The game has a strong emphasis on teamplay and tactical gameplay. While personal skill is also important the team with the better coordination, even if it just by a part of the team, can have a big impact on the outcome.\n\n- Both sides have a unique feel and playstyle to them, and a variety of weapons to cater to different preferences of playstyle.\n\n- A very unique atmosphere that is supported by map design and faction design alike.\n\n- Different map designs encourage different approaches in playstyle, both personal and as a team.\n\n- The "community development team", hired by the developers to maintain the game, produces regular patches in coordination with the community to fix performance and gameplay issues.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The Netcode could need some serious improvement, with long range weapons facing against short range weapons differences in latency can have a huge negative impact when playing. I recommand searching servers with a latency (ping) of less than 100 (my experience suggests less than 50).\n\n- The playerbase is stable, but small. There is a number of well populated servers, however it is possible you come online at a time where all the "good" servers are full. With your ping in mind, try out for yourself whether you want to wait for a slot on a server in your region or try your luck on one with a higher latency, or with more/less skilled players than you.\n\n- For a new player, the amount of things to learn can be overwhelming at first, especially on marines. There are a number of gameplay mechanics that are not immediately clear to the player and need to be learned. Be not afraid to ask, even if some of the experienced players may sound harsh, there is always someone who will be willing to help.\n\n- The same goes for commanding. There is a lot about commanding that is not immediately apparant, so you might not want to try it right off the bat. However, messing around in offline sandbox mode might be good to get an idea of "what that commander is doing" while you are out fighting, even if you are not interested in commanding.\n\nI recommend NS2 to anyone ready to invest some time into learning the game before actually having fun. There are a few initial hurdles to overcome if you want to play successfully. However once you become more accustumed to the mechanics this game can be fun and challenging to skilled and less skilled players alike. Also, my personal experience with the players in NS2 is that there are quite a few helpful ones that you can get along with very well, although you may need to take the initiative talk to them first. Many players are not used to the amount of communication NS2 requires for both teams, so this factor might also require some effort from the side of the new player.","September 29, 2013","true","425.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a wonderfull RTS/FPS hybrid, and the gameplay, especially with recent tweaks, is fast paced and exciting. Each team has a different playstyle, and the balance is set up very nicely. To list a few highlights:\n\nAt the beginning of each round, a player on each team can enter the Command Center (Hive for Aliens) and is granted a top down perspective of the game, just like a standard RTS. The commander places buildings, purchases upgrades, and issues orders, just like an RTS.\n\nHowever, unlike a standard RTS, the units under his command do not have to follow orders, because these units are the other players. The other players play this game like a shooter, spending personal resources gained from building structures, killing enemies, and passively from secured resource points, to buy new weapons and equipment such as grenades for use.\n\nThe Aliens, however, do not purchase weapons or equipment with their resources. They evolve into other life forms, spawning as the generic Skulk, a fast moving but fragile wolf-like creature, and evolve traits, like enhanced speed, armor, or stealth.\n\nOne team wins if they destroy all of the other teams Command Posts/Hives.","December 29, 2013","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a VERY RARE title. It blends so many elements from FPS, RTS, and even have mechanics from other genres like adventure games. NS2 captures the thrills of FPS combat, the tactical intruige of RTS, and the joy of winning in a team-based game. It can have some learning issues for new players, but once it clicks, once you understand the awesomeness of NS2, you will keep coming back again and again.\n\nThere is no single-play version, but there eventually will be due to how insanely moddable this game is. The entire custom engine was built with modding in mind. It has Steam Workshop support for maps, but will soon include support for full mods. Spark (the Engine/Platform NS2 runs on), dare I say, is more moddable than the original HL1 and look what came from it. The potential for entirely new games, variations of NS2 make this worth the price alone. Get it!!","September 5, 2012","true","079.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However I do enjoy aliens and commander isn't so bad. The game also heavily relies on the fact marines can pick up weapons from corpses. I can imagine how aweful humans are when they are no longer able to pick up their weapons.\n\nHowever as all three games go, they do have a gameplay trend: Human-biased with lots of players and alien-biased with little amount of players.\n\nOh well who cares its still fun.","June 3","true","193.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The marine team is essentially what I've always wanted FPS games to be like in the multiplayer section. A commander has a birds-eye view and can order marines specifically [Giving you, as the player, side objectives that help the team]. In most games I would complain about the ability to full auto and have such small spread, but you NEED it, as the aliens have a lot of finesse. This is truly a team game, where a high kill count and low death score isn't as important as securing strategic locations and getting resource nodes for your commander.\n\nAs Alien, it's a bit tricky. It's very easy to understand, but hard to master. This game often plays as a horror game, as good alien players often will ambush and surprise marine teams, making it hard to steady your aim. Onos has to be the most fun [In my opinion] to play, and let's even a noob who's willing to save up resources try out this behemoth of a xenomorph.\n\nTrust me, you won't regret at least trying this game.","June 3","true","378.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like RTS games then the commander chair is for you. Be sure to do some research on it before you play, because it can be overwhelming for first or second time commanders. While the first few games can be confusing, once you get the hang of it the game becomes pretty entertaining.

Allot of sad lonely people also constantly complain to these commanders and make it very hard for new commandes to want to continue learning how. It's not easy.\n\nThat counts for this game in general. It's not easy. You dont get any free kills, you will often end a match with less kills then deaths by far, but if you help your team it will be very satisfying and you will care more about the victory then your score.\n\nAllot of players have been playing it for years and they make up the hard core of the online community for this game, most of them are very nice but they can be vary impatient. Allot of them are also insanely good at the game and there will be more then one game when your team is wiped of the field by 3 very experienced players  working together.\n\nThere's no rewards or badges or "Good job nerd!" coming across teh screen but you will feel much more like you did something usefull when your real person commanders pats you on the back for holding off the enemy allone.

This is a few FPS game in current market that you cannot just YOLO to win a round. You actually have to think, plan, many steps before the enemy. this game also requier multitasking skill. while you are rushing to your objective, while you are shotting at aliens, you re required to know what's happening in each location on the map.(if you can't do that, usually there are people with mic that inform you which room is being hit and which room is clear to move in and so on)\ncommanding is a whole differnt part of the game. you cannot just jump in the command chair without much experience as a field marine for good couple of hundreds of hours of gameplay time in NS2, but ironically, you do need to have experiences as a commander to understand the physiology of the game.\nafter that, you are supposed to think as a commander, do what commander would want a marine to do, when you are a field marine. that's how you win a game as a solid team, and that's the true jewel of this game.\nthis is what makes NS2 the best game i've ever played in my life, and trust me, i've been a  PC gamer for about 15 years. this teamwork requirement environment, this strategy heavy gamestyle is unparalleled to any other game with the same or similar expirence.\n\nthe only flaw is that UWE, the developer of this game, is a small company, plus they have been making terrible mistakes for the past year. and they might make more mistakes in the future because that's who they are.\n1.they forced themselves to develop their own engine eventhough they lack human, capital resources. which is why it took years years for NS2 to be released.\n2.due to #1, the game engine is very poorly coded and thus poorly optimized to any computer system. if you get 120FPS in BF4, expect to get 60FSP in this game at most.\n3.there are only handful number of maps that are actually playable. there are custom made maps in workshop, but i've never seen a single map that is actually balanced and playable.(including jambi. jambi is the best custom map but at the same time, it's still unplayable) and UWE didn't care about having only 6 maps because they have less then 10 employee in their company, and they decided to spend their time on developing new mods(that is also broken to maximum level) changing balance here and there(that were unnecessary), changing maps(i mean ruining maps like docking), fixing bugs(thus making more bugs by the bugfix)\n4.the game is unbalanced to public players since UWE only focus everything in the game for 6 vs 6 competitive matches. the best experience i had while playing this game was when i was playing in 30+, 40+ servers. but i'm not sure if UWE knows that they can't optimize the game to that level of server environment, or they really want to make this game like starcraft that pro  players compete in national league, but if you join a server that is 20+, you will notice that alien vs marine balance is broken. it's always marines that are stronger because they have guns, when both alien, and marine players are at exactly same level when it comes to skills and teamwork. i used to be ok with that. this asymmetric confrontation was what i loved the move about this game. the problem arose when UWE started to nerf down aliens and give marines more and more weapons, and more firepowers.\n5.the game is laggie to its maximum level. you will notice that you actually get killed not because of your skill, but because of the lag issue. if you have 200+ ping, you will be almost a solid second behind what's really going on in the server. this is very ironic if you recall what i said about balancing. UWE is going for 6 vs 6 player balancing because they want to see more and more competitive matches and leagues, thus making 20+ server unbalanced. and i hear competitive league players complaining that they can't compete with other teams at their best condition because of the lag issue.\n\nthe reason why it sounds like i'm ranting every single thing about UWE is because i realized that it's in their nature. even though they are given with this awesome game concept, the execution was a fail, and i must say, they could have done something to prevent this. they could have become next blizzard. they could have made it next starcraft. they could have make the competitions shown on TV like starcraft. but UWE has failed and that's why you see 75% off sale every month for past 5 months. UWE finally accepted their failure. and the last thing i want to point out is that they started a donation program toward UWE at the same time as they started to promote the game with 75% sales. the company has some serious moral hazard. they chand the gameplay style upside down 6 months after the release and they've been doing that once a while, and oldbies like myself was thinking 'this is not what i've purchased, this is not what i've been trying so hard to be good at'.\n\nConclusion:\nthe strongest iron happened to meet its least skilled blacksmith. you will still have fun with it. but expect some flaws. and after playing awhile, you will face a unclimbablely stiff learning curve due to the game engine and lag.(you don't have to worry about this for the first couple of hundreds of hours because the game's learning curve is stiff at the beginning too)","December 21, 2013","true","173.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Allot of sad lonely people also constantly complain to these commanders and make it very hard for new commandes to want to continue learning how. It's not easy.\n\nThat counts for this game in general. It's not easy. You dont get any free kills, you will often end a match with less kills then deaths by far, but if you help your team it will be very satisfying and you will care more about the victory then your score.\n\nAllot of players have been playing it for years and they make up the hard core of the online community for this game, most of them are very nice but they can be vary impatient. Allot of them are also insanely good at the game and there will be more then one game when your team is wiped of the field by 3 very experienced players  working together.\n\nThere's no rewards or badges or "Good job nerd!" coming across teh screen but you will feel much more like you did something usefull when your real person commanders pats you on the back for holding off the enemy allone. If you loved COD, you will hate this game.\n\nBut it if you are up for a challenge, and if you like to take control be sure to try out the commander seat, yopu'll find most people are very patient and jsut want try to win, and some people will ♥♥♥♥♥ constantly but you can mute them or offer them your command seat, most will ♥♥♥♥ their pants if they have to command themselves.\n\nBuy this game if you like teamwork, strategy, fighting the ods and using your voicecom. You WILL need to TALK to your team.\n\nAll in All one of the best games i bought on sale ever!\n","November 20, 2014","true","53.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

I was an avid player of the original Natural Selection late in it's lifetime.  The RTS-esque elements of NS2 are done very well, but they should provide you with an in-game tutorial to help guide you with the how-to's and when-to's of this element of the game.  Playing as the marines is basically a straight forward shooter. Where the game really seperates itself from the pack are playing as the aliens and the surprising amount of team work shown by members of the community playing this game.  I was very impressed with the community.

It really is a unique game because you can become a commander for your team like true real time strategy. However, I recommend that you NEED to wear headphones while playing. The commander and players like to use mics while communicating. So it will be hard to listen if you're just using speackers. Natural Selection 2 focuses on teamwork. So you cannot go guns blazing through the game like callofduty. Otherwise your team will lose altogether. You must trust and follow your commander's orders to win the game.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nThe gameplay is one of a kind. You will not find a game like this.

This game will have you thrashing you mouse while holding the fire button hoping you get the last hit you need, And when you get it? It feels great. One of the best games I've ever played. you play and play and as you get better you realize, instead of rewarding you with OP weapons or unlocks. the only thing you get is your knowledge. As you slowly get more and more kills a life you see that this game has made you better at firstperson-shooters, A faster thinker, and a better person.\n\nCommunity:\nPlus the fact that you have to play for long periods of time to be good means that all of the little kids and their tiny attention spans disappear or cease to be visible from the community. MEANING that there are no kids, just fun, chill, Team playing Adults wanting only a good time. I have not met one "12-year-old-living-breathing-cancer" While I've played this. The community is nice and will let you in with open arms.\n\nCommander/RTS:\nThe Firstperson element blends perfectly with the Commander element which lets you command your team as if it were an RTS. Because the community is cool, they actually listin, even though your a nobody in a chair telling them what to do. And if you lose? Just say "Sorry guys I'm a noob, its my first time." And the team you just drove into the ground will be patting you on the back giving you tips for the near future. You think I knew what I was doing first game? Hell no, but it lasted an hour and when we lost, the enemy commander said "That was fun, you are fun" and i almost cried. I mean i pushed locker for the whole game and they ♥♥♥♥ed my main and i didn't notice but still. it was fun.\n\nDLC:\nThe DLC is a great addition and is worth 6 bucks. (Its $6 for each) I plan to buy more\n\nWorkshop:\nThe community is somewhat strong with new weapons, mods, balances textures, modles, sounds, and some truly Dank Content. Like the Faded mod, which turns this action packed si-fi shooter into a suspenseful team horror shooter. Or human V human games. In case the Aliens get to boring. (Like aliens will ever get boring)\n\nDev team:\nDevelopment of the game is still strong, adding new elements and bug fixes all the time. And with their new "Bootcamp" update. Now is the best time for newcomers. They also just improved hit boxes so the game is at an all time high.\n\nPreformance:\nI have an Acer. Which isn't exactly the best Gaming PC. With Inagrated HD Graphics and 4 gigs of RAM there aren't many games this brick can run.  But God Damn, This ♥♥♥♥ works. And it works great, I play the at locked 30 fps, sometimes if the gods are feeling kind i get 40-50fps. So if your worried about your requirements. The fact that you loaded this review up mean you'll prolly be fine. The load times are a bit long but that could just be the Acer. (Acer explore beyond limits am I right?)\n\nOverall:\nI Can't stress this enough. This is a wonderful game that every PC should have installed. Now i don't do number grades but you can read this reveiw and grade the game based off of my reveiw. OR you could play it...","February 4","true","54.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game will have you thrashing you mouse while holding the fire button hoping you get the last hit you need, And when you get it? It feels great. One of the best games I've ever played. you play and play and as you get better you realize, instead of rewarding you with OP weapons or unlocks. the only thing you get is your knowledge. As you slowly get more and more kills a life you see that this game has made you better at firstperson-shooters, A faster thinker, and a better person.\n\nCommunity:\nPlus the fact that you have to play for long periods of time to be good means that all of the little kids and their tiny attention spans disappear or cease to be visible from the community. MEANING that there are no kids, just fun, chill, Team playing Adults wanting only a good time. I have not met one "12-year-old-living-breathing-cancer" While I've played this. The community is nice and will let you in with open arms.\n\nCommander/RTS:\nThe Firstperson element blends perfectly with the Commander element which lets you command your team as if it were an RTS. Because the community is cool, they actually listin, even though your a nobody in a chair telling them what to do. And if you lose? Just say "Sorry guys I'm a noob, its my first time." And the team you just drove into the ground will be patting you on the back giving you tips for the near future. You think I knew what I was doing first game? Hell no, but it lasted an hour and when we lost, the enemy commander said "That was fun, you are fun" and i almost cried. I mean i pushed locker for the whole game and they ♥♥♥♥ed my main and i didn't notice but still. it was fun.\n\nDLC:\nThe DLC is a great addition and is worth 6 bucks. (Its $6 for each) I plan to buy more\n\nWorkshop:\nThe community is somewhat strong with new weapons, mods, balances textures, modles, sounds, and some truly Dank Content. Like the Faded mod, which turns this action packed si-fi shooter into a suspenseful team horror shooter. Or human V human games. In case the Aliens get to boring. (Like aliens will ever get boring)\n\nDev team:\nDevelopment of the game is still strong, adding new elements and bug fixes all the time. And with their new "Bootcamp" update. Now is the best time for newcomers. They also just improved hit boxes so the game is at an all time high.\n\nPreformance:\nI have an Acer. Which isn't exactly the best Gaming PC. With Inagrated HD Graphics and 4 gigs of RAM there aren't many games this brick can run.  But God Damn, This ♥♥♥♥ works. And it works great, I play the at locked 30 fps, sometimes if the gods are feeling kind i get 40-50fps. So if your worried about your requirements. The fact that you loaded this review up mean you'll prolly be fine. The load times are a bit long but that could just be the Acer. (Acer explore beyond limits am I right?)\n\nOverall:\nI Can't stress this enough. This is a wonderful game that every PC should have installed. Now i don't do number grades but you can read this reveiw and grade the game based off of my reveiw. OR you could play it...","February 4","true","54.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
