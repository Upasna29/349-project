And they were giving keys to the game so we could play it despite the technical issues with an actual release date. How cool is that?\n\nThe game itself is simple: you have dragons, you fight other dragons.\n\nPROS:\n+ IT'S FREE.\n+ IT HAS DRAGONS THAT CAN SHOOT LASERS AND MISSILES.\n+ Flight mechanics are nice and enjoyable.\n+ It's pretty easy to aim, but not TOO easy, so unless you've never played a video game before, you won't be dying every 5 seconds.\n+ Different dragons have nice designs (fury <3).\n\nCONS:\n- For now, it's not much more than gaining xp and unlocking new dragons.\n- Sounds are pretty terrible, dragon's roars are a bit... messy? And there's some voice that says something during the battle, but I can't understand anything of it.\n\nAll in all, it's a pleasant game for dragon lovers. I hope for more content to come soon.

And people found that a good enough reason to riot.\n\nAfter playing for only about half an hour, I can already see where this game is most likely going. I can see a bit of meta forming, and each of the dragons clearly has their own playstyle and purpose. I can't say for sure if this game is going to get better or worse over time - but as is, it's worth an hour or so of your time. It's incredibly easy to pick up (you don't even need to know what any of the keys do the first time you jump into a match. You'll be fine.)\n\nI like how your starting dragon is a bit of a heavyweight. Not the bulkiest of the bunch, I assure you, but they have enough HP so that you'll survive a few of the hits you're no doubt going to be taking while you improve. They're enough of a middle-ground so that you can jump into any of the other dragons with enough basic experience under your belt to know what you're doing.\n\nThough I have only played a few games, I'm noticing that I only see about one of a type of dragon per team, which is nice. It's a good indicator that there isn't a clearly broken dragon to play as. Yet.\n\nThe airplay is a little frustrating at times and momentum doesn't seem to work exactly as it should (I would love to see an update where it's possible to build up a lot of speed and then ram right into them. With recoil, of course. Right now, the dragons don't really feel like they have weight to them.) but it's a solid starting point.\n\nThat seems to be my all-around opinion on this game, actually. It's hit the ground running with a solid start in it's development and I'd love to see where the devs take the game from here. It's definately possible for this to fall flat, but who really knows? Best of luck to you, devs.","February 2","true","0.5"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","53","64","3","1"

It may have had its ups and downs on release hence all the negative reviews but I seriously recommend giving it a shot.\n\nThe actual gameplay is fun and consists of Free for all and Team deathmatch and the dragons feel like they have weight to them.\n\nStory: ?/10\nThere is no story. Just TDM and FFA\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe game is fun but lacking at this stage and I hope to see the developers make this into a great game.\nMaps:  7/10 For the time I played this game the maps felt fun to fly though. From flying in a temple to flying high above the map, It felt fun to explore\n\nOther notes\n- No IRL Currency store which makes this a balanced and skillful game\n- Easy to hop in and play a match\n- More content coming in soon such as Riders ontop of your dragon and customization.\n- Small download so it wont hurt to download and try it\n\nWhat I would like to see\n- Ranked matches. From the 20 minutes I played I had the problem of the opponents being to easy. The games I played I was on top of the leaderboard without trying. If there was a ranked mode to pair you up with players around a certain skill level, I would play this game alot more\n\n- 1v1 Arenas. Just a small Circular Dome with a set enviroment for a 1v1 with be amazing to play. It almost feels as if the game was made for it. It would also be nice to add in another arena mode where both people use the same dragon just to make it purely skill based while both having the same skills\n\n- Boost. A small boost that lasts 5 seconds and charges over the period of 8-10 seconds would be nice. The flight can get kinda slow when you die and have to fly to the middle of the map. It would also add a new element when fighting someone or escaping rockets.\n\n- Party'ing up. A pre game lobby before you go into a game to make sure you and your friends are on the same team. This can also work when or if ranked matches are implemented.\n\nFinal note\n\nI would give this game a try as it is alot of fun and I look forward to what this game will bring in the future!\n\n- Mirt\nP.S I'm aware that the start bit looks a bit rushed.

The biggest reason being that there are barely any games where you play as dragons. It's always slay the dragons and you end up feeling like a ***** because you want to play as a dragon instead.\n\nWhile this is an epic game for dragon fanatics, it can also be for other kinds of people. It's a good game to have on the side since matches are 7 minutes (deathmatch at least) and you can leave anytime as well without being punished.\n\nA cool bonus is that there aren't any things to buy with cash yet but that will obviously change but it won't matter to me since I love this game.\n\nI recommend playing this with a friend that has already played it for a bit because the tutorial doesn't work yet. It won't let you shoot a turret when it asks you to so you can continue the training. Besides that flaw, this is a good time waster. Not a big time waster like other games but a fun little game to have fun with.\n\nI seriously hope this becomes a huge hit over time.","May 4","true","3.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","29","33","4","1"

I've been looking to play games like this since, I don't know, a pretty long time. Essentially, you play as a dragon created by men, to defeat other dragons. Sounds fantastic now, doesn't it? Let me list some of the pros and cons.\n\npros:\n- You play as a dragon;\n- You play as a gun-wielding dragon;\n- You play as a dragon with a cannon on its back;\n- You play as a dragon;\n- Gameplay mechanics are quite fun;\n\ncons:\n- Delay time (?)\nI need the devs to clarify this. I don't know if its just me, but the delay time for me is quite ridiculous. I accidentally\npressed " ` " in the middle of the game which resulted in a pop up window (basically pause popup with continue and\nquit) that could not be closed even after I clicked like a dozen time. Also, I have to wait for -+5 seconds just to have\nanother popup that I have to wait when I want to quit. If it could be done instantly it would be wonderful.\n\n- Chat mechanics\nIn every game, I always wish good luck to all of the players in both teams. But the thing is, I can't seem to see if the\nchat was sent or not. This may not seem like a big deal, but in the future, this is a game-shaping mechanic. If the chat\nmechanic is clear, then this would be better. Make it simple like in Dota2 or CS:GO.\n\nImprovements:\n- Environment interactions\nThe dragons could land and walk instead of hurting when they hit the ground, their fire could burn down trees, they\ncould hang on the edge of a cliff. These are some examples of envi interactions that the devs could create.\n\n- More fx!\nAdd more sounds when the dragons got hit, add more visual effects when the dragons collided, etc.\n\nI think that is it. I know I gave out more pros and cons, but I don't know if I could recommend it in its current state. If the delay time is fixed, it's going to be a great game.

Before you can even move, you'll be hit by three explosive abilities as Tiamats do circles around spawn for kills.\n\n\nTeam play is a little less of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess as you don't spawn in the middle of combat/dragons/gunfire. A lack of objectives to fight over really brings the dragon fighting into full focus where honestly, it has very little business being.\n\nDragon combat is basically four seconds of shooting, followed by three seconds of cool down. Even if you avoid overheating the gun, the shield adds heat and blocks at random. The overheating mechanic would be fine if you can kill an enemy dragon in a volley or two or had other things to do aside from hit your ultimate ability once every fifteen seconds, but as it stands, general play goes like this:\n\nFind enemy dragon\nFire a volley\nOverheat\nFire a volley\nOverheat\nUse the shield\nOverheat\nDrink vodka\nOverheat\nFire a volley\nOverheat\nUse ability\nEnemy dies due to being more filled with vodka than you\nRepeat\n\n\nUnfortunately without objectives the only way you can lose teamfighting is by straying into enemy gunfire while they alternate three dragons in a clump shielding and firing. Since collision isn't a thing you can cluster♥♥♥♥ a three-headed game breaking hydra the second you find someone who speaks english.\n\nAlso let's talk about collision for a minute. My tail touched the very edge of a lake and I instantly threw my guns down and died. I hit a rock with a wing and sometimes I get stuck only to be dislodged like the sword in the stone 6000 years later, or my wing phases through entirely unmolested.\n\nThis is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke and I can't recommend it for anyone, it's not even worth streaming it's so dreadfully unoptimized and boring.

Lasers!...interested yet?\n\nTime of Dragons is a bizarre game, and I like that. You basically fly your dragon around and do your best to murder other dragons in the face with lasers and fire/poison/electricity, depending on the dragon. The team has done a great job coming up with different types of dragons (including - for some reason - a manta ray). They also offer a couple of pretty good environments to do battle in.\n\nThis game has some problems. Free-for-all mode has all dragons spawn in the same spot, resulting in massive amounts of death for those who want to farm their points and nip unsuspecting players. The firing system requires massive recharge times, which detracts somewhat from gameplay. "Leveling up" or choosing more advanced dragons gives you very little tactical benefit, though I suppose that's not bad for newbs like me.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, these problems don't detract enough for me to dislike this game. Time of Dragons is just plain and simple fun.\n\n[Edit 1: The first problem with the game has been solved!

As is you have to load into every game type to find which ones people are playing (that is just because there aren't a lot of players, nothing the dev can do).\n\nIf you like dogfighting games then this could be entertaining to you, otherwise not so much.","May 20","false","1.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

(There isn't too much content right now, but I let that slide seeing as how it's clear this game is still in its infancy)\n\nPROS:\n\n~ Dragons with lazer beams on their backs!\n~ Fun and easy to understand gameplay, no real tutorial is needed unless you have a hard time understanding very simple game mechanics.\n~ This game has a CRAPLOAD of potential, and I hope to see that potential realized as they update the game.\n\nCONS:\n\n(Note: These cons are about the game in it's condition at the time of the review, cons are subject to change in future updates)\n\n~ You cannot select specific maps or servers that you would like to play on, you select a game mode and it puts you in a random match, so you only have a "Quick Match" option essentially.\n~ No party system, this makes playing with friends nearly impossible, your friends also cannot join your match via the Steam Overlay\n~ All of the Dragons have different stats and abilities but feel exactly the same in the end. What about adding a dragon that can stabilize itself on the ground and do mortar fire at the cost of mobility. Or a dragon that can "Snipe" with a zoom in ability. Until things like this are implimented, all of the dragons feel exactly the same.\n~ DNA is useless for the time being. Essentially you earn "DNA" points as you rank up, but all you do with it is unlock dragons... which there aren't very many of at the moment. I imagine in the future it will be used to unlock weapons, upgrade dragon specific abilities and such. But for now its next to useless.\n\nIn the end I can say this, as long as the devs continue to make improvements, and don't RUIN the game with said improvements, I will recommend this game and would spend money on it.\n\nNOTE FOR THE DEVELOPERS: Should you guys decide to implement a Microtransaction system for the game... there is only ONE way to do it without making players angry or making your game Pay to Win. The purchasable content can ONLY be cosmetic items... ONLY cosmetic items... such as dragon skins, weapon skins, etc. Customizable items will still make you money without making the game Pay to Win and thus losing and angering your player base.","February 8","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A+) and not the best graphics, this game was amazingly fun. It actually felt as if you were an epic dragon fighting in an arena. The combat was fun and diverse, you have many different options for how to go about a fight. The mechanics are diverse enough to let you play how you want. I found I could rack up a lot of kills as an artillery dragon who sits in the back, or a speedy fast dragon that gets up in their faces and makes them have to out-manevour me. (Which ends up being fatal for them because I seem to have perfected stopping and reseting your aim.)\n\nNow the cons... The GUI isn't great at all. It's hard to tell what any of the ultimates do or what the specific guns do. (Though some experiments will reveal them pretty quickly, and you can change something in the middle of a round if you don't like it.) As well as the stastics are really confusing and doesn't really tell me anything meaningful. (The "heat" stat was really confusing. [Heat being a mechanic that limits how often you can shoot. Different weapons build up different amounts of heat, you build up too much heat you overheat and can't shoot, but you can let it cool down a little bit before you shoot again so that you don't overheat.] Because the lower the stat is apparently the more heat you can take?)\n\n7/10 (Fun, but could be a lot better.)\nBut I really enjoyed it. Getting past some of the weird UI and willing to expirement to find out what does what, it's really really fun. If they improved GUI and their stastics this would be 1 point higher. If the graphics were better (Though they aren't terrible.) I would give them another point. :)","February 14","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have a choice of quite a few dragons that are unique in their attacks,flight, and look and are actually pretty imaginative. The game isn't very big so it's worth a try!","February 14","true","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164730453/recommended/353130/","76561198164730453","CabbageStorm","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164730453/","45 products in account","For a free, early access game this is looking pretty good so far. I enjoy flying around and defeating other dragons with the use of missiles and plasma cannons. I even went through a phase of playing this game often and in doing so, I noticed I was playing with the same players over and over. Even the leaderboards contain mostly players I have seen and played with before. After playing against some of the same people a few times, it can actually feel like two players have something against each other and begin trying to kill each other more than the other players. As with many games, you can hurt players on your team which can lead to you being betrayed (this normally only happens when there are no enemies and your team seems to get bored easily) or accidentally hit. Of course this problem lies within player attitude and not the game itself. I can say though, that the lack of enemies (or teammates for that matter) seems to be down to the game seemingly having no team balancing which results in a lot of unfair matches.\n\nThe flight feels quite nice and fluid for the most part but it can be hard to determine the scale and distance of certain objects in the environment. So when you are flying around and you notice you're coming quite close to something large, you usually try to turn sharply or pull up which is difficult sometimes as the dragon seems to want to almost drift and keep moving forward as opposed to just sharply and swiftly pulling up. Most of the time you end up crashing into said object which makes you more vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe turret/weapon system is great. It features a number of weapons and items to help you in battle such as plasma turrets (default weapon/fire type), missiles and a special attack that is performed with the R key if I can remember correctly. Most of the special attacks are short range and have what seems to be a spherical radius. In my opinion, the Ogre's (big green, tank-like dragon) special attack is overpowered, since he can stun you and keep you in one spot then use his vast amount of health and firepower to quickly dispose of you.\n\nAnyway, my next point about the turret and weapons system is that the crosshair seems to take a very long time to catch up with where your dragon is looking which can be annoying when you have a clear shot ready but your crosshair is nowhere to be seen. Earlier I mentioned items. These items include stamina refill, weapon cooldown, mines (that float in the air) and a smoke screen (I may have missed something from the list). These also have a cooldown period but can give you an edge in battle and instantly regenerate upon respawning after death. The mines and smoke screen can be good items to use and can make a great combo as you can drop a mine if you're being followed, then drop the smoke screen which will blind your enemy and lead them to fly into the mine. The smoke screen can also hide you when you're on low health and allow you to escape. Your dragon can be given a speed boost (shift key) which takes stamina rather quickly but (if you have it equipped) you can use your stamina refill to give your dragon a second boost.\n\nI did notice that the models and sounds seem to be based off other games/movies...\nThe Inara - Ikran (Avatar) (Similar sounds too)\nThe Fury - Toothless (HTTYD/2) (Also similar sounds)\nThe Vampire (mainly it's head) reminds me of creatures from the old game Altered Beast but may just be a coincidence.\nTiamat is given the same name as the bat queen from Darksiders (perhaps this dragon was given this name instead of the vampire since it would have looked too close to Tiamat). Again, perhaps it's just coincidence or I'm just looking into it too much.\n\nThis game is very team based with nice graphics and a great idea behind it. It's a great game for passing the time and having fun and can actually be quite competitive. When you have balanced teams, it can be very enjoyable. If you enjoy team based, dragon flying, weapon firing action then this game is for you. I recommend trying this game and seeing what you think. I may have written a bunch of bad points (which I seem to find it hard not to with most things) but I do really like this game.\n\nI apologise for this painfully long (not as painful as my overuse of certain words) review but thank you for reading - if you didn't die of old age before getting to the end... This is my first review.","April 26","true","21.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

I learned the controls in just a few matches. They are simple enough for anyone to use, but have enough flexibility and complexity to pull of maneuvers you'd think came from a jet combat simulator. The health and damage system is adequate, being shot at is a real risk, unlike a lot of other first or third person shooters, where you'd think the character was the man of steel. Unlike other shooters, I managed to make my first kills in my very first match, which was very satisfying. A game that takes too long to offer the player some incentive to play, is hard to continue playing. Time of Dragons is not one of those games.\n\nFor the most part, the game is evenly balanced (And the promise of biweekly updates means that whatever tweaks need to be made to keep it fair, can happen), the lack of "upgrades" in the usual sense making combat a test of skill over grinding. The sense of progression is present, and from the start the game offers you the opportunity to test out several of the different dragons, to see which fits your playstyle the best. There are dragons out there for a mix of niches, whether you like a heavy hitter or a swift and agile fighter. (Which appealed to me the most.)\n\nSure, there isn't much content to this game. But do all games need content? The matches are quick, six minutes each if you join from the start, perfect for when you just want to take a break. But there's enough variation in the Team and Solo deathmatch modes and maps to offer several hours of unique play. No match feels quite the same. The matchmaking system itself could offer more, though it is relatively fair, and again, even a new player can trump the most experienced if they take a well-aimed shot.\n\nFor being free-to-play, the game is astoundingly well put-together. It is the first shooter that I've been able to run at full resolution and graphics quality without losing the most precious commodity these game need, framerate. The maps are very well thought-out, with places to hide and ambush and space for an all-out dogfight. The music, unintruding and not distracting in the least (in fact, I would go as far as to say it is beautiful) is quite fitting to an aerial combat game like this,  a refreshing break from the grating "hardcore" shooter music. Sometimes when you're all alone in a match (It happens every once in a while) you'll find yourself just soaring around the map, feeling like the king of the world.\n\nOverall the game shows great promise in what is to come, and great fun in what is already there. I can see myself staying with this game for many months.","February 7","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seeing how the devs are still working on it as people are reporting bugs and other things, there's a high chance they're going to exploit that potential.\n\nFor now, let's talk about the game in its current state. The graphics are good for now. My PC is pretty low-end but I can still run on the highest settings on the opening screen without dropping frames (however, there is an in-game setting for post effects that makes the game look ugly AND drops your frames immensely, so this setting should be removed or fixed pronto, but just turn it off in the in-game settings for now if you're having problems).\n\nActual gameplay is very, very...\nFUN.\nI feel like I could play this game for hours on end without getting bored of it. Time will tell if that feeling will continue, but as of right now, everythings running a smooth course. Graphics, audio, animation... none of that really completely matters if the gameplay isn't fun. And this game's gameplay is straight up, pure, magical fun. I mean the concept itself sounds fun, just think about it! Fire-breathing dragons with missiles and lasers mounted to them? That's awesome! And the fact that it is executed so well in this game makes it all feel incredible.\n\nThe only bad things in this game are the bugs and some of the audio. Let's start with that audio. The music in this game is pretty darn cool, but the sound effects are plainly sub-par. They need to be remastered in order for me to feel fully submerged into the game, because otherwise, it feels like there's no reality to this game when those fuzzy, low-qual dragon roars play. Now, the bugs are mostly with the HUD. Sometimes when you're in the options menu, you can't click the accept button. That's one example. There are also collision bugs regarding dragons running into walls even when they haven't even touched the walls. Other things, like certain flight animations, need to be polished and more rounded. But perhaps those animations help with the game's charm. Honestly, I really don't care about charm.\n\nAll that matters is that you should give this game a shot. It's got class, fun, and dragons with GUNS on them for crying out loud. It deserves a chance, so try it out, at least for a half hour.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis game has a couple bugs but it's incredibly fun, so try it!","February 7","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I learned the controls in just a few matches. They are simple enough for anyone to use, but have enough flexibility and complexity to pull of maneuvers you'd think came from a jet combat simulator. The health and damage system is adequate, being shot at is a real risk, unlike a lot of other first or third person shooters, where you'd think the character was the man of steel. Unlike other shooters, I managed to make my first kills in my very first match, which was very satisfying. A game that takes too long to offer the player some incentive to play, is hard to continue playing. Time of Dragons is not one of those games.\n\nFor the most part, the game is evenly balanced (And the promise of biweekly updates means that whatever tweaks need to be made to keep it fair, can happen), the lack of "upgrades" in the usual sense making combat a test of skill over grinding. The sense of progression is present, and from the start the game offers you the opportunity to test out several of the different dragons, to see which fits your playstyle the best. There are dragons out there for a mix of niches, whether you like a heavy hitter or a swift and agile fighter. (Which appealed to me the most.)\n\nSure, there isn't much content to this game. But do all games need content? The matches are quick, six minutes each if you join from the start, perfect for when you just want to take a break. But there's enough variation in the Team and Solo deathmatch modes and maps to offer several hours of unique play. No match feels quite the same. The matchmaking system itself could offer more, though it is relatively fair, and again, even a new player can trump the most experienced if they take a well-aimed shot.\n\nFor being free-to-play, the game is astoundingly well put-together. It is the first shooter that I've been able to run at full resolution and graphics quality without losing the most precious commodity these game need, framerate. The maps are very well thought-out, with places to hide and ambush and space for an all-out dogfight. The music, unintruding and not distracting in the least (in fact, I would go as far as to say it is beautiful) is quite fitting to an aerial combat game like this,  a refreshing break from the grating "hardcore" shooter music. Sometimes when you're all alone in a match (It happens every once in a while) you'll find yourself just soaring around the map, feeling like the king of the world.\n\nOverall the game shows great promise in what is to come, and great fun in what is already there. I can see myself staying with this game for many months.","February 7","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That puts it pretty high in my sights for a one-play kind of game. Then I kept playing. You can only have 3 dragons in the start, but you can get all of them eventually. They cost 3 each and you get a point every level. This is not a pay-to-win at all, I didn't even see an option to pay. The graphics (highest setting) are a lot better than expected and the controls have the perfect balance of complexity (for detailed shooting and movement) and simplicity (for ease of play.)\n\nThe only problem I have for this game was the lack of tons of dragons (which wasn't expected anyways), for there is only 10. All of them are different enough to be interesting to play all of them. Also, there are only 2 game modes and a third to come. Free for all and Team deathmatch. The third is some kind of point control, or defend the location, or attack the blimps, or something like that.\n\nMore game modes, dragons, and the leveling actually doing something would be the only things I think could make it better. Game modes such as Capture the flag, or a storyline, or custom enemies spawning in, stuff like that. More content to improve replayability. The Dragons are cool as they are, but there are more kinds that can be made. Speciality ones like ones that can resist certain moves, but have a crappy super move. The leveling is a bit of a touchy subject, in the sense that I realize all the dragons are on the same playing field, and leveling that changes stats would make the game unfair. I like the idea of your level unlocking game modes, or perhaps arena rooms (more and more skilled rooms.)\n\nI really like this game, it's exactly what I wanted in my childhood (and I am sure yours too.) I am glad I found it here. Good job developers!\n\n-Azure","March 3","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Not much players are friendly, when I've talk in game, they're just not replying or even 1 talk in game, so it's not friendly. No upgrades to buy or skins, same weapons (No new wepons unlock tactics when you have upgrade the level) Example: Level 10 "Some weapons are unlocked" So that will be made players to be more addicting to play.\n\nLastly the sound fx when choosing the dragons, some sounds are not fade out smoothly.

In fact, this game is pretty balanced. I main Fury for his special ability and high speed, and I rarely get killed in game. Toxors, Ogres, and Skats are the easiest for me to kill: Toxor for their lack of in-battle maneuverability, Skats for their low health, and Ogres for their low turning speed.","February 17","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Though, it lacks a few things, and can be burnt up quite quickly. There's not too much in terms of weapon choices and dragons nor customization, looking at the same few dragons for so long kills the mood pretty quick. Honestly i do look forward to seeing this get big, but there's allot of work ahead of the devs before this gets overly big.\n\nI do recomend it, and while it's missing some stuff and needs some work, it connects to matches quickly and it's good for a quick match to kill time while waiting for a friend or partner to get ready to go out or go to school or whatever. And honestly it's completely free, no microtransactions at all to be seen. So give it a go, but don't expect it to be the quality of bigger companies, it's a free game, not Black Ops 3. It'll get better though and playing with friends will make it more fun, it's definitely worth the two gigabites it took up on my laptop.\n\nI hope the devs make this go allot further, though just an opinion of a player, it'd be nice to customise the dragons and weapons a bit more.

This game has a small player base which means that there are like 200 players and growing. This means that if you find a server with players your ok, however it takes about two tries.\n\nThis is a game about Dragons shooting each other with rockets and lazers. There is not much to say about gameplay other than you can kill teammates if your not careful, or if they are being a ♥♥♥♥. You have about 10 dragons you can play, each with different classes which changes speed and amount of guns. Heavy classes = slow and lots of guns, Light classes = not as slow with half as many guns.\n\nGraphics are decent, could be better though the devs seem to have abandoned the game.

Use lasers and missles, while evading enemy attacks, deploying a shield to defend against incoming barrages. Engage in either free-for-all matches where every dragon is your enemy. Or, enter team deathmatch and partner with players to overwhelm the enemy dragons. Earn experience and level up, acquiring DNA that can be spent on unlocking new dragons such as Toxor and Tiamat. Easy controls allow anyone with an internet to jump in and start firing away.\n\nTime of Dragons features "multiple creatures with unique capabilities" and a large assortment of weapon options. A variety of modes is available. It appears that everyone that plays the game, regardless of where they are in the world, is on one server.\n\nPlayed for 1,5 hours on a straight run, trying all combat modes (free for all and team battle). sadly, very rare to find people on team battle. I won easily without doing anything because I didn't have an enemy to kill. but on free for all battle mode its always full with people and I enjoyed the battle.\n\n+Low system requirements\n+easy to play, download and install it, choose your dragon or create a dragon using DNA, choose the battle mode, and KICK SOME DRAGON ♥♥♥\n+free to play casual shooter games\n+no need cash *probably, this is my own opinion\n\n-Limited gameplay modes: only 2 (free for all and team battle)\n-Weak dragon sound design","February 14","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

It has very low system requirements, and it runs on unity.\n\nGraphics and Aesthetics\n\nGraphics are good considering its low system requirements (My broken PC can run it!), but some textures are a bit eh, and animations are lacking in "umf" especially when you fire rockets and kill opposing dragons. The plasma lasers feel as they should, though a sound for them colliding with a dragon would be cool, instead of just numbers popping up. Rockets and Plasma Balls feel kinda eh as well.\nThe game is very colorful, and has a wide variety of dragons, which homage some familiar tropes (Such as the tyrannosaurus-esque Tiamat dragon, and the European starter dragon), as well as homaging familiar dragons in movies (The Fury and Ogre dragons in particular look like 2 particular dragons from How To Train Your Dragon, though only vaguely).\n\nStory\nLiterally nonexistant, not even little bits of flavor text for each dragon. Not important, but would be nice to see!\n\nMechanics\nFlying is fun, though going up and down feels a bit slow, and the flying can be quite sluggish at times. (Good luck zipping around corners, even with a fast dragon!)\nThe combat options are lacking, 1 machine-gun esque weapon for each dragon, an option of a Plasma Ball, Rocket, or Rail Shot for a secondary weapon, and 2 accessory slots for things like mines and things to restore your cooldowns. Each dragon also has its own unique "ultimate" ability, which is the only difference between dragons aside from their stats. Each can equip the same weapons. It feels kind of boring, honestly. More variety in weapon types would make this much more fun. The cooldown time for using your weapons feels too restrictive, and all the dragons have the same cooldowns. The actual combat, however, is fun and intuitive, which is what really matters for a game this simple. Zipping, dodging, and dogfighting another dragon can be quite fun.\n\nMisc criticisms\nIn TDM, theres no indicator telling what is an allied dragon or an enemy dragon. Friendly fire is on. This need to be fixed.\nNot enough players, but this will change with time, as its a very new game.\nThe progression system is kind of pointless, really.\n\nOverall?\nReccomended, especially for free! I advise the devs to start building some new weapons options for the dragons, and refining their movement system.","April 12","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Suffers from a lack of players.\n\nPros:\n+ free game without microtransactions\n+ dragons with freakin' laser beams\n+ little bugs/issues that I've come across (addressed in cons section)\n+ decent Halo-esque 3D textures for a small indie game\n+ games don't snowball (unless your "team" leaves you)\n+ small game\n+ high framerate\n\nNeutrals:\n/ little player count; I've typically only ever seen one lobby.\n/ achievements (I love me some achivements)\n/ OS X support (although not many people game on macs, it works very well on my rMBP)\n\nCons:\n- Kill assist system a little weird/buggy; I'll whittle a player down and someone else will sweep in for the KS (which isn't so much the game's fault as thhe player's) but then I don't receive credit half of the time.\n- Not a whole lot to do due to low player count\n- Cannot pass tutorial level due to not being able to shoot when prompted despite repeatedly clicking the left mouse button. Works well otherwise.\n\nPoints of interest:\n{ Controls take a bit of getting used to, but fun and easy to handle when you get the hang of it. Took me a bit to get turning down.\n{ Higher level players get only a bigger number next to their name and access to having more, but not particularly better, dragons, giving more to players with more skill rather than a higher level.\n{ Right now, it's best playing with a friend so at the very least just to have someone to play against. (Can be seen as a pro if you like private lobbies, or as a con because you can't lobby hop if you don't particularly like the players in a certain game.)\n\nOverall an entertaining game for free. Would recommend if you want to kill a few hours. Needs more players to play with/against, which you can help with by getting the game!\n\n8/10\n\n~Pie\n\n(Edit: Formatting + TL;DR)","May 14","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I After spending only 1 hour in the game so far, I already know I will be spending a lot more time in it as the days go by.\n\nThe graphics are not the greatest, but where that is lacking, the gameplay makes up for it. The game seems very well balanced You have a small list of weapons to choose from and can only use your main weapon and one other you choose from a small list. You also have a couple other items you can choose to aid you in your fight such as a smoke screen.\n\nStarting off in the game, you have only one dragon to use. Once you gain a few DNA points, you can start unlocking more dragons. Each dragon has 1 special ability that is on a cool down. Fire breathing, heal, blind, ect...\n\nEven though it is a very simple game and currently has only two game modes, Team play and Free for all, I highly recommend this game.

Good idea, not good in reality\n\nThis game looks like it will grow a lot, and have a great community if they keep the balance as good as it is now and keep Micro Transactions out of the picture.\n\nTHINGS I WANT\n- Visual customization of your dragon! Nothing that makes it better or worse, people would play too much and it'd be a repeat of Robocraft\n- Fixed Crosshair.\n- More Dragons!\n- Dragon breeding!

You can unlock more dragons by using 3 DNA each, you get one each level up.\n\nI cant say i had trouble with the game, sure it needs some time, for example if you get hit by a railgun you wont know what hit you, there is not much of a sound playing when you get hit by it, you just notice your health dropping and sometimes a thin lazor swooshes by you.\n\nBut the game works.

You can unlock more dragons by using 3 DNA each, you get one each level up.\n\nI cant say i had trouble with the game, sure it needs some time, for example if you get hit by a railgun you wont know what hit you, there is not much of a sound playing when you get hit by it, you just notice your health dropping and sometimes a thin lazor swooshes by you.\n\nBut the game works.

It looks like they all put effort into the game, and it's optimized beautifully. That being said, a small team doesn't always make the best games mechanics and graphics wise. When I first started the game I was thrown in a room with a dragon staring me in the face, and a basic UI. To the left is information about your dragon, to the right is the possible dragons you can unlock (with info if you hover over the picture of the dragon), the top (which gives you a barebones settings option, an option to quit, and an option to start the game), and the bottom which is filled with items that you can use in the match\n\nThe actual gameplay is solid and the gunplay is easy to get into, however there are only two game modes available as of the time this review is written: TDM or DM. Fairly basic modes whos main goal is to get you to understand the weapons that are mounted on to your dragon... and every other dragon. As far as I can see, there are very little if any diversity in the weapons attached to every dragon. This makes the two game modes a battle of "Who can shoot first" situation.

In all honesty, at the moment - the only thing I could reccomend to make it better would be the ability to change your hotkeys (as Left Shift can be annoying when you're trying to speed up and drop mines at the same time - at the moment, it feels kind of like combat is W+M1 no matter what dragon I'm playing.)\n\nI feel like it could also greatly benefit from controller support for gameplay.\n\nAside from these things, I believe it's a good game. The dragon classes are balanced and the ability to customize your playstyle no matter which dragon you're using by changing weapons and gadgets is refreshing. Keep up the good work.\n\n(P.S.

And even at that point in the beginning, it still had WAY more features in it than this Steam version does. And as I watched it develop, it gained even more features, and became truly interesting, one of my favourite apps.\n\nI haven't played in a while, haven't even hopped back over to Facebook to check if it's still there, but regardless when I saw it was on Steam I downloaded it immediately. Even though I was super confused about the reviews talking about how simple and one-dimensional it is, I had tons of fun before and I am greatly looking forward to seeing what they do on Steam.\n\nSo I'm saying this now: don't write this game off as mindless and boring until after they finish bringing in the rest of the features, which I'm sure they will. Right now all you can do is hop on different dragons and go shoot people out of the sky, with almost literally nothing else to change or improve how you do so, but with the full set of features it's a wonderful game with many complexities.\n\nIt's no more mindless and repetitive than any other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game out there, and since Call of Duty is now a hugely popular series, I'm going to assume that a fair number of people don't find fighting for supremacy and honing your skills and equipment set to suit your strategy for blasting your enemies out of existence to be boring.\n\nDifferent dragons, different stats, right? You wanna tank, you go ogre. You wanna zip around like NAH NAH NAH NAH CAN'T TOUCH THIS, you go manta. But the equipment, that could all be upgraded, and the stats further specialized. A point to winning and leveling beyond unlocking more dragons. Making enough gold to buy the coolest stuff, getting skins for different looks (leopard spotted Inara, oooh exotic!)\n\nVisually, if you wanted to improve the cooling system for your guns (so you can shoot continuously for longer without your guns overheating and going into cooldown), there would be actual cooling pipes appearing on your dragon's saddle. Need more defence to take less damage? Armour pieces for various parts of your dragon. In the later stages of development that I was still playing during, stat upgrades had visual effects on the look of your dragon, which was so cool in my opinion.\n\nAnd it really helped that you could focus on the stats that were important to you. I'm more of a CLICK WILDLY AND HOPE SHOTS HIT WHILE FLYING WILDLY AWAY IF SHOT AT kinda player, so I upgraded my shot accuracy (so the cluster of shots is tighter--at base accuracy, shooting at one space would have multiple shots hitting random areas in a cluster, so unless you were right up in another dragon's face you couldn't guaruntee shots would hit exactly where you aimed them, unless you upgraded your accuracy) and my cooling systems, and left my defense and actual firepower to later.\n\nRight now, as a level 3 I saw a level 16 and said "meh, they probably won't crash into the ground by accident, let's go shoot them in the face". With full features, a player with a level that much higher than you is cause to go running for your buddies, because the chances of you taking him down alone are next to nil. Which, yenno, is as it should be in games.\n\nOther features I immediately noticed this Steam version doesn't have yet:\n\nCollision. In the FB version, colliding with another dragon results in both of you dying. You don't get credit for the kill, either, but neither do you get penalized for suicide. Made a game of chicken a bit riskier.\n\nAlso, healing spawn points. First few games I went, did my blitz thing, dashed back to spawn almost dead, and then sat there in the light like WHY AM I NOT HEALING WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?! I don't know if that was a conscious decision by the developers to prevent strategies like mine (though the excitement of a race to spawn point--will the one team shoot down the injured enemy before they get within the safety of the spawn drones?! COVER ME GUYS CAN'T YOU SEE I'M NEARLY DEAD GET YOUR TAILS OVER HERE AND COVER ME-- was always very exciting, especially on the bigger maps) or if they just haven't implemented it yet.\n\nHonestly the only thing the Steam version has right now that I don't remember from the FB version is the different battle modes. I only rememember team vs team and free-for-all. These other modes are neat.\n\nSo my final word to you guys: seriously wait to make a final judgement. If you find yourself going "this game was fun at first but after a bit..." stop yourself there, because you've tasted what the game is about... now be patient and wait for the rest of it. IMO, it'll be worth it.","May 24","true","11.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's just the right amount of slightly silly, coupled with good solid game mechanics, interesting level topology and swoopy flying.\n\nit DOES have a slightly cheap feel, but the myriad features and optimizations that would be required to make a game like this run like the new DOOM does would require a huge budget and a large pricetag.  This is very healthy small studio development at its finest.\n\neverything works, there are a pleasing amount of upgrades that i was able to earn in a half hours play session, there are some people on servers and the UI makes most stuff pretty clear.\n\nthe actual dragonfighting is fun! it's slower paced than other flight or dogfighting games and theres a large variety of animations in the dragon characters which make it feel very natural and cool to flap and glide around and do popup attacks and dive in for the kill. a full server would be very awesome.\n\nI would like to see perching and hanging implemented, as you can't land anywhere - your dragon fumbles around until you can flap ungracefully back into the sky.  im thinking of the batman games style drop/snatch attacks here.\n\nalso going to moan in passing about\ngeneral art direction (it all looks a bit disjointed, get a theme going on to tie it all together)\nlevel art quality (maybe you guys should stylize this thing?)\nlighting (black dragons get old fast)\nsome level topography (the nightworld map with all its tunnels and overlooks is my favourite so far, some of the other levels need more height to be more of a playground for flying)\n\nbut omfg dragons! reccomended!","May 31","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/recommended/353130/","melancholyrose","Mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/","77 products in account","Time to Leave\nOverviewI didn't play this game for very long before coming to my conclusions, and really, you don't have to play the game long at all to know what it's about. Time of Dragons was a pretty fun and clever concept, with dragons carrying turrets on their back and blazing into an all-out war with other dragon species. It seems like a rare breed. However, it's spoiled by one fatal flaw: it's multiplayer PvP only.\n\nThe Positives1) Engaging, action-filled combat. It's fun to see stuff explode.\n\n2) The dragons, while kind of blocky and mushy-looking, have cool designs, and they're all unique from each other.\n\n3) The game is free to play, and there's no P2W system of any kind.\n\nThe Negatives1) It was fun for five minutes, then started getting boring really fast, mostly because of your lack of options. Do you want to PvP in this way or this way? It's all the same thing: kill the other players and win. There was no variety whatsoever, and the few choices you do have aren't very interesting.\n\n2) I couldn't really get a leg-up in terms of experience since everyone who was playing seemed to be higher and better than me. Again, this made the game boring pretty quickly, because there is no skill scaling. What's the point of fighting if I can't win anything? Not fun. Moving on.\n\n3) The abilities don't seem to do anything. I've hit my special ability several times on enemies and tried like hell to get it to land on them. It doesn't seem to hurt them. Even if it did, they usually managed to kill me before I could tell. I tried the fire blast with Tiamat and vampirism thing that drains health with Vampire, and neither seemed to hurt the enemy. Maybe I just couldn't land it right, but should it really be that hard to land? Especially in a high-action environment where I don't have a lot of time to swoop in and hump the enemy before using my ability?\n\n4) Almost the entire playerbase was Russian for some reason. So I couldn't even chat with people. Even if I could, it's not like I'd have anything to say except "Hey, can you help me kill this dragon so I don't die again?" I'm sure if I banged my head on the keyboard a bunch of times, it'd have the same effect.\n\n5) There's no single-player or PvE options, so if you enter a battleground and see no other players... that's it. You have to leave and join another one and hope you have other people to play with. And if you're on at the wrong time of day, no one at all will be around. Unless they're Russians, I guess. Which is fine, if you're Russian.\n\n6) Turning is slow as hell and has gotten me killed more than once. Even when using an evasive maneuver, it was impossible to avoid an attack if the dragon was already on your ♥♥♥.\n\n7) It says each dragon has a "role" but they don't come into play at all. Players don't really stick together (because the teams are usually 2 or 3 people), so roles are pointless. It's pretty much what you think works best for keeping your ♥♥♥ alive. So pick a dragon with high health and high damage every time so you have a fighting chance.\n\nFinal ThoughtsThere's nothing special about it. It's just mundane multiplayer PvP with players you can't understand. Skip this one and move on. Unless you like to be frustrated. Then be my guest.\nIt could very well be that I played the game at "the wrong time of day" and maybe more US players join in the evening, but that still shouldn't matter.

That's all I have to say. (ALERT! HUGE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!) Now on to why I gave it a negative review. It's a fun game, but not a good game. The reason I say this is because of how new it is. It just gets repetitive after a bit, because there aren't any other weapons from what I have seen, and you get everything but the dragons free. When you start the game, you get 6 DNA points, and a starter dragon.  Every level up you get is 1 dna point, and you may expend 3 dna points to buy a new dragon. Simple concept, simple game. But the only problem is there are only two gamemodes, and once you get all the dragons or just all the dragons you want, you're done and have no reason to play except just to have fun shooting down other dragons. Now, after maybe a month or 2 I may edit this review, but for now in its current state it's just a good idea. (NOTE TO DEVELOPER: Please for the love of god do not add a premium currency or microtransactions! PLEASE! You have a great game in the makings, take it and run!)","February 24","false","0.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

(In my opinion, the game could use dragons with different weapons, like Tiamaut or whatever having rockets or something. Also, could use more dragons, as stated in cons. For instance, a Hydra or Ice dragon, something of that magnitude.)\n\nCons:\n\n- Clunky, kind of poor controls.\n\n- Limited number of players.\n\n- Disappointing amount of dragons to play as.\n\nI may download this game again ONLY if you fix those things. For now, though, I am sorry to say I have removed the game. I hope to see that it has improved in the future.","May 19","false","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","1"

It's essentially a moba/deathmatch. Again, I hate those, but that is personal preference. If I ever find one that's actually enjoyable for me, that opinion may change.\n\nIn the one battle I managed to live more than 30 seconds, everyone in the group was speaking/typing in Cyrillic, so I had no clue what they were saying.

And then it should also not put another player on the team that then has 4 players.\n\nBoth games I played ended up being immensely imbalanced, 1 v 5 before I left, and 2 v 5 before I left.\n\nI recommend it because it has a lot of potential, and the more people that play it, the more incentive the devs have to fix it.

Its a third person shooter/ flight game where you fly around as a variety of different dragons  getting into aerial dogfights with opposing players. Currently there are eight dragons and two game modes to chose from. Now I myself am pretty sure that in the future we will get more options than we already have, but even if we don't its still a good selection of playable dragons. I recommend anyone interested in a game like what I described above try this out, it has a ways to go but for a free to play game it doesn't have any sort of cash grab yet, so that's real good news!","February 1","true","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

When you leave the shield up for a while it eventually goes down. When it does you cannot fire leaving you totally open to get shot. Secondly there isnt a very good warning for when you get shot. Sometimes you seem like you get shot from nothing. There is no visual warning and you still take dammage. Finally you should not take dammage from your shortest hair on your left claw getting grazed by a rock. It knocks like 200 hp off and its very annoying.\n\nIf you only have a few minutes in a day to play some games and you want a airborne simple shooter game then this is the game for you.

It's difficult the shoot, the spawn is instant death and space should be a way to go upwards. This game just isn't doing it for me. There weren't a lot of different dragons to choose from, and multiplayer battles are way unfair. Like I said before, they spawnkill. Stamina for the dragons are too low, the night fury lookin' thingy was not only copied in some ways, but the major ability (R) sucks. It does no damage unless you aim it perfectly. I'm very disappointed in this game.... I don't regret installing it, but I do see that it needs major fixes.

I thought that this was going to be one of those games that tries for the overly B.A. thing like, "LOOK DRAGON WITH GUNS AAAAA" but this game is so much more!\n\nFor starters, There is a wide variety of different dragons to play as, each with their own sort of theme. There's one that looks like a manta ray, one taht reminds me of a snake, etc. There is a design for everyone here, and the diversity is very nice.\n\nThe Gameplay is very smooth as well. I've some across many games taht fail horribly to do the whole "flight" thing, but Time of Dragons does it soooooo well. It feels very satisfying to kill airborne enemies, and I love playing this game.\n\nIf I had any complaints, they would be taht this gamee definately has some graphical issues. They're not huge, but some textures are a bit weird at times, and models/animations can look a bit stiff from close up. If anything, it makes the game run easier on lower-tier computers like mine, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nI reccommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game that's easy to get into.","February 24","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Why, oh why, does it look like a SPORE game?\n\nThe art style (the UI especially so) could have been SOOOO much different; I personally could see this game taking on much more of a darker, gritty style. The point is - my impressions of this game upon loading the dragon selection menu was this: The dragon models, they look cool enough, but everything else looks really, really pants. Sorry. The big ugly 'sci-fi' blue UI tabs and icons are not particularly pleasing to the eye.\n\nThough this game still looks a little undercooked, it's free, so "why not?" applies here. I like the concept, and I would like to support the developers by giving this game a reccomendation.

The graphics arent the best but certanly not the worst iv ever seen. the dragon flight works really well.  each dragon has its own set of stats and each dragon is fairly balenced. i hope there is a tutorial level in the future seeing as when you stat of you go in blind, but its an easy game to get the hang of.

Why, oh why, does it look like a SPORE game?\n\nThe art style (the UI especially so) could have been SOOOO much different; I personally could see this game taking on much more of a darker, gritty style. The point is - my impressions of this game upon loading the dragon selection menu was this: The dragon models, they look cool enough, but everything else looks really, really pants. Sorry. The big ugly 'sci-fi' blue UI tabs and icons are not particularly pleasing to the eye.\n\nThough this game still looks a little undercooked, it's free, so "why not?" applies here. I like the concept, and I would like to support the developers by giving this game a reccomendation. I only hope that they consider revising the current art style, or at least make some improvements - but again this comes down to preference, and indeed the player base that they are going for.","February 29","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being recently released ofc it has limited maps etc, that's not the issue. Nothing works.\n\n- The movement of your own dragon (yes, i've tried several) always seems to be half the speed of anyone elses\n- I never once figured out how to use my "special ability" regardless of what key I hit\n- The dragon moves (default Q and E keys) also don't seem to work\n- Spawn areas are not safe, and you can be killed through your own shield within seconds of spawning\n- Once you've mapped your key configuration there is NO way to edit it after the initial setup\n- Nothing is explained fully enough except the stats (cooldowns, energy, movement etc)\n- There's no training area so you're instantly thrown in against anyone and everyone before you know what to do\n- Levelling only seems to unlock more DNA fo you to create more dragons ( saw no stats change, no refill additions etc)\n- There seems to be no options for weapons, so everyone has the same thing\n\nIt has potential but right now it's lacking a lot of content, requires a lot of fixes and the ability to actually edit settings beyond your audio, and desperately needs more information/hints/whatever to help anyone not looking for a limited 5min PVP game where you can die before you even fly.","February 25","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

They even added shortcuts to quickly tell people if you need healing , cover , etc. ( though i dont make use of those , i tend to go by the movement language of players to see if they need healing from me or not)\n\nBesides that now every dragon has a short regen timer when you die , either forcing you to wait for it to regen or pick a new dragon.\nI for one like this idea because it makes people choose different dragons and try to think of different strategies , i've been getting much better at playing as ray.\n\nThe only few bugs that there are now is that the items in slot 3 and 4 even after they have finished cooldown do not want to work and act as if they haven't finished cooldown.\n\nThe game has gotten an extra point from me atleast! 9/10","February 25","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There are quite a few dragons to choose from each with different abilitys and stats and it's just simple and fun. Getting into a game is quick and easy. Only thing I can complain about is that the kill and asist detection need work, as in, when you do a lot of damage to a player and someone else kills them you don't get an assist most of the time and sometimes it says they other player just died not giving credit to a player for killing them.
