As in, a comment on how the game stands right now. My attitude towards it will most likely change as it develops.\nSo, let's start off...\n\nRight now this game contains about as much content as an average flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's extremely simple, and once you figure out how to move adequately you can easily fend off attacks by the wildlife (wolves and bears), whose only real difference is their speed. And if the developer reads this: You might want to change that.\n\nYour main tools for harvesting the lands are rocks (as in common rocks you find lying on the ground) and axes; both can harvest any kind of harvestable resource (trees and boulders) or kill wildlife. There are also hammers and shovels, though their uses are limited to construction or reshaping the ground respectively, and they can't be used as weapons. Tools used exclusively as weapons include bows and handguns, which can be crafted relatively easily. Their advantage is not only in range, but they also slow your opponents drastically for about two or three seconds, making it far too easy to get in consequtive hits, assuming you have enough ammo. (And it would surprise me if you didn't, since that is also extremely easy to craft.)\n\nYou can also build your own house! Flooring, walls, doorways and roofs. Out of wood... J-Just wood... Oh, and different kinds of flooring with rocks, and wood... This will obviously be expanded on in the future updates, but right now it's just a bit boring building your own shelter, not to mention unnecessary since the map is littered with abandonned buildings. The only disadvantage to these is that you can't make doors for them, but meh...\n\nAll in all, I'm sensing the usual potential with early access games here. And if Scott Cawthon has proved anything, it's that single developers can produce good games. But right now, the game is far too limited, and much too easy. And it suffers from the same sort of problem that most survival games has: Hoarding! The game didn't do its description justice... Because as it stands right now, it's just another minimalistic survival game, with the same core ideas and the same problems. So sorry people, but I just can't bring myself to recommend this. And I'm usually a bit TOO NICE in my reviews...! You'd be better off playing Project Zomboid or something. At least that game has some challenge in its early stages...\n\nBut once again, this is only preliminary. I've put my money on this thing, so I better not be disappointed in the future as well. But I'm an optimist! So I assume that I won't be. :)","March 23, 2015","false","1.1"," 79 of 116 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","79","116","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/recommended/357650/","Wolffstamps","Wilk [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/","233 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDisclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.\n\nProject Explore  review:\n\nOverview\nProject Explore is a top-down sandbox survival game which has lots of potential. Currently realism is one of the major factors of the game (after all, it IS a survival game) which is very well done. There are four needs; health, thirst, hunger and sanity. Most have their unique ways to become satisfied. Thirst is filled by using a drinking item, hunger by eating, sanity by either reading or killing enemies and health by multiple ways; eating, drinking, consuming a healing item or waiting it out while your hunger and thirst needs are mostly full. Hunting creatures is a large portion if the objective since it rewards you with multiple things, such as armor, sanity and food. However, the fighting system is quite literally just hit/miss, run up to the enemy, attack them before they run away, if they chase after you, stop for .05 seconds and then hit them and so on. So you may be asking yourself one thing; is this game worth buying? And if so, why? Isn't it just an isometric remake of AAA games? The answer is, well, the game shows potential other AAA survival games did not. You can lose the game due to a simple mistake early on in the game which evolves raidly in late game. If you went into an enemy stronghold instead of hunting bears, you will be punished. This game will challenge you, don't go adventure because nature will try and best you, but do go venture because you need everything.\n\nGameplay\nEarly game is quite difficult if you have no idea whatsoever of your actions and consequences. The learning curve is very easy to pick up since it's a mostly a generic survival game, the only things slowing new players down are small details , such as drinking straight from the water source instead of needing a canteen or something of the same sort to fulfill thirst. So in a way it is difficult because of the obvious not being so obvious (obvious in real life, not so obvious it would be added into a games' mechanics).  Once you know how to survive, the game is amazing, especially seeing that your base is so large and mostly finished. It adds a factor of achievement, you can now see for all the days you have survived just how much progress you have done, even what was un-needed was added. Building mechanics are fun and intriguing, the worst part during building is probably laying down the ceiling. You can only place ceiling when it is right next to a wall. This is a large problem while making structures on a larger scale since you need to make a maze if you'd like to add a ceiling. Another con of this topic is ho the doors open and close, it's quite difficult to close them behind you  sometimes. The combat system is terrible and will definitely be improved, it's one of the few flaws I've seen so far, but the worst one. Over time you will become overrun with loot which will be rendered useless, so you can't do anything about that apart from exchange it into materials.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nAddictive gameplay\nMostly realisitc\nFrequently updated\nLoads of times\nBuiling is very well done\nGUI doesn't get in the way\n\nCons:\nCombat system is flawed\nWhatever you build resets after you load the game back up\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

If the devs will keep on working and won't bail after getting the money, it can turn out to be one really addictive and loveable 2D survivor game which doesnt include zombies.","March 26, 2015","true","5.2"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","35","55","2","0"

Already has about 30 or so  items to craft, including construction blocks for your house, weapons (gun, bow), campfires and the usual tools (axe, shovel, hammer). You can also go fishing if you don't dare to go hunting yet.\n\nView is 2D top/down with some 3D objects (like houses or trees). Simple, but effective and the movement works very well. I don't like very much the attack/gather with right mouse button because it doesn't have an animation for your action and is not very clear what are you doing.\n\nAll in all, tiny fun game for all of you who, as me, like survival games and also building and crafting a little. It also has a reasonable price, so Recommended, of course.\n\n2- SÃ© que debo jugar algo mÃ¡s pero por ahora puedo decir que el juego promete y es divertido de jugar, aunque por supuesto le falta contenido pero ya estÃ¡n trabajando en ello.\n\nEs un jueguecito minÃºsculo (8 mb!) de supervivencia sin zombies pero con lobos y osos para que caces (o para que te coman). Actualmente tiene como unos 30 objetos o asÃ­ para fabricar, incluyendo bloques para hacerte una casa, armas (arco, pistola), fuego de campamento y las herramientes habituales (hacha, pala, martillo). Incluso puedes pescar si no te atreves aÃºn a ir de caza.\n\nLa vista es de arriba a abajo en 2D, con algunos objetos 3D en el mapa como las casas o los Ã¡rboles. Simple pero queda bien y el movimiento es fluido y estÃ¡ bien trabajado. Una cosa que no me convence es el ataque/recolecciÃ³n con el botÃ³n derecho del ratÃ³n, porque no tiene ninguna animaciÃ³n y no queda muy claro lo que estÃ¡s haciendo.\n\nEn fin, considerÃ¡ndolo todo, es un jueguecito divertido para todos aquellos que, como yo, les gustan los juegos de supervivencia con algo de construcciÃ³n y fabricaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, el precio es mÃ¡s que razonable asÃ­ que Recomendado, por supuesto.","March 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","25","44","4","0"

You cannot swim in the game, and the water in general is unrealistic and looks bad.\n\nSurvival Mechanics\nIt's not hard at all to survive in this game, the thirst and food mechanic aren't even really made properly, I can have 0 hunger, but drink something that brings my health up and live forever. The only way to die in this game is to reach 0 health, so don't worry about thirst or food, med-kits will do you forever. Thirst is insanely odd. You must find a water bottle to get thirst up, and they are quite hard to find. That is one of the only ways to get thirst up, not sure if you are able to craft anything like that, either.\n\nAnimals\nAh, the animals. These animals are quite odd, and very easy to kill. Do not beware of bears, wolves, or whatever, as they run the same speed as you, and you just grab a rock, run backwards, and click. Boom, they're dead. The developer(s) should put more time into animal mechanics, as they are also quite wonky at the time. Not to mention the wall glitching that happens frequently, I always find an animal either stuck half-way in a wall or stuck inside of a building and not able to get out because the collision in this game is also kind of poo.\nUpdated:The collision is still quite poo, as stated above, but other than that, I think that the AI and animals in general are worse.. Now they are quite hard to kill, and impossible to get away from. I'll give an example from my own gameplay. A wolf is chasing me. (they now go faster than the player), the wolf bites me, I use my sprint or whatever spacebar is, and get some distance, but after pressing spacebar, there is a large delay, that keeps the player held back. That gives time for the enemy to move forward and kill you. So, overall, I like the old AI better, it still needs a bit of work. As for the collision, it needs alot of work. Things still glitch into walls, and into trees, etc.\n\nInventory\nAh, the inventory. The inventory in this game is quite bad, in my opinion. The design of it looks quite bland, and the colors are hard to differentiate. The accuracy in which dragging and dropping has is very bad, only on certain occasions do my items actually move in the inventory. This needs alot more work.\n\nA bug\n\nI decided to add this little bug here, since I can no longer post on the Project Explore forums. When I load or start a new game, the framerate is in the negatives. Recently it was -1492 FPS when starting a new game. It's not an important bug, but I still feel it should be fixed in the final product.\n\n\nSummaryDon't buy this game yet, wait until alot of bugs are fixed and lots have been done in the game to make sure you get the most out of it, as currently, it needs lots of work.\n\nThanks for reading! :)","August 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","27","49","4","4"

When you first start a map, you're able to customize your character (even from above, you can see different hair styles and clothing color). Different biomes have been added, with temperature that goes with each environment, that does affect your survivability (too hot, you get thirsty; too cold, your hunger drops; too dark, you go insane), like your average survival game.\n\nWhat makes it different is the dedication that the developer is putting into his game. Yes, I am actually the other half of the studio, but I am not a part of the game except for the occasional input and celebratory things. I was encouraged to revisit the game, and I am glad that SeaBass was able to take input from the community and put it in the game, because it made quite an improvement. Also, your occasional references to pop culture, or a glimpse of the developer's back story, is reflected in the 50 and counting items that are being added into the game. What I really liked is the nice amount of wildlife on the map (or at least a realistic amount) and the ability to refill water bottles (California should really take that advice to heart).\n\nWhat I want to add as constructive feedback would be an easier way to control the game. Example, using a key, or left clicking on an item for it to move to the shortcuts or the crates (when applicable). It's more of a burden dragging everything around, and it's not efficient.\nI also found way too many skeletons, torches, and rock (item) spawns on the map. I don't know, there just seemed to be a lot of stuff, and without a place with crates/a backpack on hand, it can get out of control.\n\nHaving died only on the fifth day to a dirty gang of creepy, blade-as-hands, no-goods, only makes me want to survive even longer. A game worth supporting and praising. Splendid job, SeaBass.\n\n----\nOld Review\nAn enjoyable survival game with a dedicated developer. It's constantly updated with the help of the growing community and improving every day. A game worth picking up. *thumbs up*","March 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","23","43","8","0"

Great concept and already quite fun even if it's very early alpha. It's got some nice mechanics, you can build houses, craft stuff, and all the other things that you'd expect from a survival game. It's introduced a sanity mechanic which is a nice addition. There are some rough edges, and not very much content like in most of early access games(But that's why they're EA), but the developer is pretty cool and dishing out updates quite often.

It looks like it was made from a downloadable template and it shows.  Graphics are junk, control design is unintuitive, and its just poorly implemented all around.  If your using the mouse with one hand, why spread the other keys all over the keyboard.  Terrible design.\n\nBefore I wrote this review, I decided to browse the other reviews, game website, and community page.  I am uber experienced in playing games. And with that, I am also uber experienced in programming.  Some of the developers comments are exceptionally questionable.  Anyone who downloads a game engine identifies themselves as a developer like anyone picking up a golf club says they are a golfer.\n\n260 FPS?  Why boast such nonsense.  If I have 1000 cores, am I only going to get 260 FPS?  If I have a 75mhz pentium, am I going to get 260 FPS?  Pushing new updates on a daily basis?  What does that mean?  If there is no substance to an update, it doesn't matter if you push 100 updates a day.  Based on what the publisher has stated, there is no doubt the non existent multiplayer aspect of this game is going to follow the same terrible design of whats already implemented.\n\nSadly, I don't see foresee this game improving at all.  There is no content.  And there is no experience behind the designer.   Even if this game were free, its still not worth downloading.\n\nIf you want to make a $7 donation to buy this, that is up to you.

Then this is the game for you!\n\nSeriously, a super early access game.  There's not much here, nor should there need to be at this point.  There's a world surrounded by water that you can't fish in, there's two types of animals and some bird shadows, a bunch of empty buildings with stuff that's easy to obtain if you don't mind clicking the "stick" button 30 times in the crafting menu, some sand areas that seem to spawn less animals, a night cycle, and some water areas that you can fish in.\n\nThe interesting stuff comes in when you go insane, which ironically doesn't happen if you kill enough animals (and bury them).  But yah, there's no point in hiding that there isn't a lot going on in this game yet.  And that's A-OK.  It has a great atomsphere with some effective mechanics, and even if you know you've got nothing else to do it still sucks you in.  That's probably the greatest victory of Project Explore.

In fact, I've gifted it to two people already. You'll go through and see a few negative reviews on it, but here's my take:\n\nThis game is an Early Access Game. I've been in contact with the developer personally and he describes it as "Pre-Alpha." So, with this in mind, the game is going to have a few flaws. Another review mentioned how "the game is nowhere near ready for sale." True fact. Which is why the developer is still working to improve upon the game even as I'm typing this.\n\nI would just like to point out a few things: The game is fun. It has controls that are easy to get used to. Currently the game has 153 unique items that serve their own purpose. There are currently 5 unique mobs, a 6th to be released with the next update. The building system is fun and easy. The crafting system is as well. All around, this is a great game that you can run on virtually any computer.\n\nI mentioned the next update. The next update is going to be released in approximately 2 weeks. From what I hear, it's going to be a huge update. I don't want to go into details and spoilers, so I won't mention any specific additions. However, I will mention that there are going to be an indescribable number of bug fixes for every bug that has been reported by the community. And there will be quite a bit of new content from what I understand. You can find additional information in the Community Hub.\n\nOverall, I feel that currently I can not actually give the game a rating because it is not complete. But if I had to rate it, I would give it a solid 7.3 out of 10. That number is sure to go up as bugs are fixed and the game progresses.","August 10, 2015","true","16.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Crafting is very straightforward with an in-game recipe, which may make the survival aspect less challenging. The game is heavy on exploring and that's where Sanity comes to play because in order to continue exploring you need to stay sane. While other survival games use Stamina or Temperature as means of survival, Project Explore uses Sanity, which I find interesting and hope to see more depth coming from it as it develops.\n\n--- 07 January, 2016 ---\nThere's been massive updates and the game is slowly getting better, my first impression was a top-down Minecraft, but visually and technically it's turning into Don't Starve. There's also major visual/graphical changes around the corner so it's worth looking at the announcements. I would still recommend the game at this point, rate of progression and price, it's definitely worth following if anyone is curious about trying the game out.\n\n---- 23 March, 2015 ----\nIt's not a clone, but it's basically a top-down version of Minecraft; you cut down trees, you build, you hunt, you eat, and you die. You also collect dirty magazines and read them to stay... sensible.\n\nThe alpha version of Project Explore was only released two days ago, so there's a lot of content missing, many items still have no function, the survival aspect is really light (no thirst meter (yet?), being able to eat everything raw, nothing despawns/respawns, no durability), but there's so much potential for this game.","March 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","0"

I can actually appreciate many of the graphics and effects as they are - the topdown 3d styling of trees, rocks, etc is really cool! The game has really great sound design implemented throughout.\n\nMy first play through I died pretty quickly. After that I buckled down and figured out some of the basics and did  much better. I plan to dive back into this game and spend a lot of time in it. And doing so will be worthwhile as the developer has been very active on pushing new content & features.\n\nSo to close this, I was born in the 90's and grew up playing 2d games - so perhaps that is part of the reason that this game is so satisfying for me, but I would recommend Project Explore to any serious or casual gamer!\n\nGreat game!","December 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It takes many elements existent in other survival games such as Minecraft and adds new elements that make the game fresh enough to be different from the rest. There are certainly things needed to be fixed here and there, but nothing big enough to ruin gameplay. My only complaints thus far are the very low rate at which animals spawn and how easy it is to get lost (while some could say this is an intended design element, it would be nice to at least be able to produce a compass or map that would lead you back to your home). In the end, I would definitely say the game is worth it's current price, and considering the price will probably go up as the game is developed, it'd be better to get it now than later.","March 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","14","28","2","1"

I do appreciate the crafting system as all you have to do is click on the button to craft the item in question, assuming you have the resources (the game tells you what you need) in your inventory.  Animals seem to be walking through houses currently and they'll still eat you while you read the light tutorial in the beginning or check out your inventory screen, so just be ready for anything as soon as you spawn.  While I have found items to pick up in houses, they're admittedly missing doors and other furniture to search at the moment, making the world seem somewhat empty.  Still, this isn't a bad buy for $7 and the developer seems to be releasing updates on a regular basis (at the time of writing).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AILt6icZL-Y\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta2ZfXyYbEQ","March 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","1"

Put rock in hotbar. Hit tree to get wood.\n-Found a house with a fire in it. Was getting dark so I danced around the fire inside all night so I would stay sane.\nDay 2 -\n-Day 2 starts. Somehow had a 1 night stand alone...\n-Went outside and farmed more trees. Found metal ore and harvested it.\n-Ran from a bear, then a wolf, then another bear. Got tired of running and beat up the bear with my rock. Almost dead.\n-Found shelter, tried to cook meat, found that you just have to eat it raw right now. Yum.\n-Crafted a bow and 16 arrows during the night.\nDay 3 -\n-Went to try out the new bow. Wasted most of my ammo trying to hit the running wolf. Learned to attract the creatures attention before trying to shoot a bow at it. 4 shots later and I had more cloth, meat and fat.\n-Farmed more trees and rocks.\n-Took a while to walk to cordinates x0,y0 on a large map. Started building my house. Went afk for 1 minute and a bear was standing over my lifeless corpse. Paybacks a *****...\n\n10/10 Would beat up a bear with a rock again.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nOn a more serious note...\nI highly recommend Project Explore. The game is currently missing most of its content and is slightly buggy but it has a tremendous amount of potential and the lone developer is constantly working on new updates.\n\nBasics of the game:\n-Top down 2D/3D survival game.\n-Find food by killing animals or looking in houses.\n-Craft weapons to assist in hunting bears and wolves. Current weapons in game are a bow and a 9mm pistol, more will probably be added in the future.\n-Stand by a fire inside during the night in order to slow sanity loss. Kill creatures and collect their corpses in order to regain your sanity.\n-Build a house as big as you want with an easy to use building system.\n-Multiplayer will most likely be implemented in the future so work together with friends to take down mobs and/or other players.\n\nPros:\n-Currently well built, not very buggy.\n-Great game for low end computers. Currently a 7mb download and the game is very easy to run. 950fps on my computer.\n-Addicting game, not as difficult as most survival games but still very fun.\n-Lone developer who, per a conversation with him, really wants to see the game through to completion and on and will not abandon it.\n\nCons:\n-Missing the majority of its content at the moment. However, the developer is working very hard so that should change sometime in the near future.\n-A few non gamebreaking bugs and bad ballencing. Problems should be fixed quickly though. Make sure to suggest in the comments what the issues are. He has to know about the issues to fix them.\n-Some settings changes currently missing.\n-Some of the graphics could be better. An actual artist has been hired so a bunch of the graphics should be getting a revamp.\n\nI know, I put 4 pros and 4 cons. The pros far outweigh the cons however. Most the cons are easy and quick fixes or just upgrades to the game which will come at a later time.","March 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","10","20","3","0"

And i love it even more :)\nAlot of new items have been added and after seeing the new wavepoint system and armor all i can say is where are the weapons? With all this badass armor coming out you would think Surviors and more weapons are needed to match up to the amor so the player doesnt feel 100% secure and safe with armor on. And of course im going to bring back my mention of pets :). If you havent already goten rid of the idea then Please add pets as my player feels very lonely in house by himself.\n\nAhhhh... Project Explore where to start. Me personally i love TDS games and making it survival was a good choice. Of course with every early access games there are a fair share of bugs. The bugs in the game do not make the game completely broken or unplayable. Well lets just get started with the review\n\nThe Developer\nThe develper goes by the name of Seabass of steam or LegueOfSebastian on twitch. Sebass is in gamemaker constenly working and updating his game making him one of my favorite developers because unlike alot of them he has kept working on his project and i know finish it. He adds new content almost everyday aswell. He so far has kept his promise and i defenitly see this game getting finished and becoming really popular. He is very helpful and keeps his trello well updated he also when not working will help answer some question on GameMaker: Studio.\n\nProject Explore\nProject Explore is a game on trying to survive as long as possible dealing with hunger, health, and sanity. You can chop down trees to build a house or mine metal to make a gun and some tools. Animals are a big danger as they are powerful and can sometimes be hard to kill. There are alot of weapons even a referance to Half-Life. Like a more peaceful way to live? no worries!! In Project Explore you can go fishing to get food and you can basically live of the land in this game all the way. But sadly there is a down side. The Metal Axe as it stands is way to easy to get i had it before the stone axe.\n\nWhat I personally would love to see\nMy ideas for the game are simple\nMore Animals and Fish\nPets (like a Panther, Bear, Wolf)\nMore Guns and Weapons (ShotGun, Rifle, a Sword of sorts and with pets maybe a way to control them to attack)\nDifferent tools (Picaxe to mine rock, Drill to mine rock and cut trees, hoe to farm, Chainsaw to cut down trees)\nMore Ores to make more tools and better equipment\nAI controlled sruvivors and camps to raid\n\nClosing Lines\nI say add in pets because during playing i sortof got lonley and wish i had a pet or friend that could help me through my journey on the land\n\nAll in all I give this game a 10/10\nMaybe even add some of my ideas :]\n\nKeep up the great work Seabass and finish this game","March 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

The visuals are noticeably rough, the enemies vary from standing still and taking a beating to slighlty touching you and that nearly being an insta kill.  There's no real reason to use the crafting system when you can just find a steel sword inside a house and kill everything, and use fires that are placed around to cook meat.  And honestly there's nothing really unique about this game to justify a purchase over a game such as Minecraft, Terraria, or Rust at the moment.  It's controls are debatebly okay where its more of a gamepad control then a mouse/keyboard control.

The game lacks a bit. That being said it is still fun. I would have to rate this game a 7/10\n\nOnly problems I encountered were that certain things weren't working. Such as the metal crafting table. I put in some metal to create some nails and springs and nothing popped out. Not to mention that items seem to go into a void if you mine or cut with a full inventory.\n\nTo say that this game has potential is not giving it credit for what it is. Its a fun game nonetheless.

Its kinda like rust but with a overhead view, and with the added awesome bonus where you don't need damn pillars to build a house (making a ton of those we're annoying in rust, took ages to get the wood to make a building just because of pillars) But seriously buy it while you have the chance of it being on sale and for as cheap as it is for as good of a game as it is... Yeah its in alpha but that just means the game has a lot more potential to be even a greater game... And the developer is a really nice guy and communicates with the community to make the game better for the community. And updates at least once a week is always nice, something new to find every week you play the game :D\n\nI rate it 8/10 but will most likely go up as the game progresses. There are things that need to be added in yet like Multiplayer.

As an early access game, that's not unexpected.\n\nFor now, this is an game that, if available at a low price, is certainly worth the purchase to kill a couple of hours here & there. There's a fair amount of land to discover & quite a bit to do (hunting, fishing, building) that's fun if done for a short amount of time.  Once you get into the groove & get what you need to easily survive (which can be done in a couple of game days after you get a feel for the mechanics), the magic wears off.  At the time of this review, there is nothing available to sustain the game & keep players playing long term.  With updates expected around the corner, this problem may soon resolve itself.\n\nThere are some minor glitches, but all of the ones I've found have already been noted by other users & recognized by the developer.  None of the ones I have encountered have made the game frustrating or unplayable.

The top down angle is horrible making everything impossible to see and the bright colours and horrible angle combined are enough to knock anyone sick. I would not recommend playing this game if you have just eaten your dinner, or if you really want to risk it have a bucket handy and close by.\n\nThe Bad\n* The UI is so clunky, hard to navigate, unresponsive, messy and just downright horrible.\n* The angle leaves no perspective of depth, making you feel sick and struggling to understand what the hell anything is.\n* The bright colours mixed with the horrible top-down angle.\n* You cannot play this game for longer than 10-15 minutes at a time if you dont want to vomit.\n\nThe Good?\nI legit could not find a single redeeming value about this game. The developer is nasty, the game is nasty 10/10 IGN would recommend you do not spend your hard earned cash on this trash. How the hell did this get through greenlight and mainitain postive reviews? I call foul play.","August 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 39 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","11","39","2","26"
