It's buggy to all hell, the gameplay is repetitive and boring, and there's no story. It's got the right idea but goes nowhere with it. I picked this up at $0.50, and even that felt like too much for this unpolished lump of coal. It needs a lot more story, mechanics and variety before it's worth anyone's time, and the team has given up on it, so strongly discourage you from buying it. I highly recommend the multiplayer sequel, however, so go play that.","December 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","33","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/recommended/49800/","aasha","Aasha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/","111 products in account","This game is bad.\n\nThe concept is okay. It's like Guns of Icarus.\nThe problem lay mainly with the fact that the game only lets you play the first level. It's glitchy and simply won't let you interact with your guns in level 2 - and before you think this was a personal problem this was something I found to be the case after watching a video review on youtube as well. The game simply doesn't have anything past level 1 (which is only about 5 minutes long).\n\nThe ship you fly in looked like something a 4 year old designed and a 12 year old built. The cannons had some effort in them. The rest of the graphics honestly felt like the maker had no desire to make it a good game. It seriously gave me the "I don't care if it looks bad. I just plan to make a fast buck" impression. These are the graphics you would see on those computer games from the early 90s where 3D is still a bit of a workout. Not today if you're actually expecting people to pay for the game.\nAnyone that has played Second Life: You could make the majority of this ship exactly recreated in prim and texture (from scratch) in about 1 minute on SL. It was really that simplistically designed (guns aside).\n\nThe animations were about the same. Not that I saw many inside 5 minutes. They felt like someone rushed them out as some free favor they owed the developer.\n\nI started this game more or less expecting a single player mode of Guns of Icarus - a reasonable thing to asume considering when I first got it the game was named "Guns of Icarus" (barely any different than "Guns of Icarus Online"). I was honestly interested to see what they had in mind for a solo adventure. A story where you fight against AI opponents like many single player games. That sounds awesome really since I like GoI.\nIt didn't have anything like that. Just a blocky albiet fun 5 minute fight against some planes followed by the inability to actually do anything for the rest of the levels.\n\nThis game gets an actual 0/10.Possibly the only game I would ever rate so low.","November 12, 2014","false","0.1"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","31","44","0","3"

I only bought it because I wanted to collect all the games in the series. However, this is expected as it was released in 2010 and was pretty much a little prototype to Guns of Icarus and I didn't expect it to be great. I bought it for less than a dollar so I can't really complain. That being said, I'm curious why the developers kept this on Steam as those who have never played Guns of Icarus Online might think that it is similar to Flight of the Icarus and shun Guns of Icarus Online when it is in fact an amazing game.","May 6, 2015","false","0.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychonauter/recommended/49800/","psychonauter","psy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychonauter/","150 products in account","tl;dr, detailed review below+ It's a nice minigame\n+ Upgrades for your airship\n\n-- Need to restart the game to play the second mission.\n-- Quality/price ratio\n-- Linear and very repetitive gameplay\n- Only 4 enemy types\n- No story other than the explanation on the shop site\n\n\nGameplay\nIn "Flight of the Icarus" you're playing a privateer who owns an airship with multiple guns on it to shoot enemy aircrafts. That's basically it. Your airship holds 5 guns, which you can upgrade at the start of each level if you have enough points.\n\n\nScenario\nFlight of the Icarus is like an oldschool shoot-em-up, but worse. Every level works the same way: You wait until you see enemies (pirates) flying towards you. Usually you're faster finding them by looking around than focusing on your radar. Your task is quite simple: shoot them. If you don't manage to shoot them fast enough, they hit your ship and damage some parts of it. But don't worry, you can run around and fix everything. The only thing changing between the levels are the guns you place and the weather. The main character doesn't take any damage.\n\nOn your HUD there's a timer telling you how long you have to survive. After the countdown hits zero the level immediately stops, even if there are enemies left around you. After each level you get points, depending on how much cargo you have left and how many enemies you've shot. If you have enough points you'll get a new weapon which you can place on your ship. There are only 4-6 spots, so you usually have to replace other weapons.\n\nThere's also a survival mode, where you need to defend your airship as long as possible.\n\n\nKey features\nUnlock the Fallen Hero Cap in Guns of Icarus Online ...\n\nGuns of Icarus Online is a Multiplayer which costs 20$. I don't own it, so I can't tell something about it.\n\n18 Epic Levels & 8 Powerful Guns\n\nThey're not epic, but linear. The guns are quite nice though.\n\n4 Enemy Types (Duster, Gunship, and Pirate Ace aeroplanes, and Airship)\n\nThey won't be stronger if you choose a medium or hard level, there will only be more of them.\n\nTime of Day & Weather Effects\n\nAs mentioned, that's the only thing changing between the levels.\n\n\nOverall Quality\nGraphics:\nThe game has a steampunkt design, but very low-quality textures. However, it doesn't look too bad. Remember it's an Indie Game.\n\nSound:\nThere are only basic sounds (shooting, airplanes), not much more to mention.\n\nWeapons:\nThere are 8 weapons (more than enemies!). Every weapon behaves different.\n\nEnemies:\nThere are 4 enemy types. There is a boss fight in which you have to beat multiple airships.\n\nCoop:\n?? Afaik the Coop doesn't work anymore. But I'm not sure on that one - I don't know anyone else who has this game.\n\n\nKnown Issues\nYou usually won't be able to play after beating the first level. To continue the "story" you have to restart the game.\n\n\nWorth the price?\nDefinitely not. The game is quite fun to play once in a while, but it's not worth more than 0.99$. Check out Steam Sales if you want to buy this game.","October 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It's not a bad game but I would recommend getting "Guns Of Icarus" which is more expensive but has multiplayer.\n","January 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

If you want to get guns of Icarus please do I have that game as well and find it unbelievably fun. This game is terrible though.\nYou are set in an airship then expected to keep it flying without any assistance while hoards of enemies shoot at you.\nI do not even know if the game is winnable because lord knows it is difficult, but it is too shallow to reward you for your troubles.\nI don't mind difficult games, (undertale genocide run / darksouls / and other such games are actually fun to me), but the idea is that the diffculty is with reason and afterwards there is a sence that you advanced and got better. here its just a bland rip off with no substance.\nSo if you are a fan of shooting yourself in the foot for NO REASON. please do play this game. If your the kind of person that wants to shoot themself in the foot because you like the challenge of walking around with lead in your foot try elsewhere.\n\nEDIT:\nThe game is still not able to be recommended. It is a boring grindy mess with little reward.\nIt keeps the player running arround trying to do everything by themselves including keeping the ship repaired and running and defending itself form hostiles. At first this is not bad and is quite relaxing but as the difficult increases it becomes stressful. As mentioned above I do not mind stress if I get a feeling of reward afterwards, but this one has no sence of reward in it. You completed a mission and your reward is a type of gun. This means that you have to grind in order to advacne. and Again grinding is not something I am against, but I need to see the grind advancing me. In most RPGs when you grind you can see your character getting stronger and more powerful. but in this game the grind is so slow and near negligable it becomes a chore. I can kill the same wave on enemies 100 times but never feel like i get better. Am I getting better or stronger, sorta  again the guns help, but it feel so small that I never get that feeling like I am stronger.\nThe game is not in of itself bad, but it is dull as dirt. It lacks any real depth. I don't mind a single player game (actually i prefure them) but there needs to be something there to entertain me. A story, A character, just something. There really is nothing here to keep me going.\nIt feels like this game is now just a pointless void. Get Guns of Iccaraus. It is what this game wants to be. Still no story, but it replaces it with multiplayer.\nI feel this game should be removed from the steam store. It no longer serves a purpose. It fails to entertain, the one purpose of a game.","April 2","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

The graphics are surprisingly good for a game that is only 85 MB, but the music is a little too somber for my tastes. The washed out sepia tones for me, also added to the boredom a bit. However the game does feature a long campaign, unlockable upgrades as well as some tactical strategizing. Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions are supported.  For the price, Guns of Icarus may have some appeal for mainstream audiences, but the gameplay is not compelling enough to be called addicting.","July 21, 2012","true","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

The slight "steampunkishness" seemed to appeal to me at first, and the idea of battling airships stirred my imagination somewhat. The mechanics of the game are fairly straightforward, and ultimately there is not much to it: run around the ship (in third person view) either manning weapons (in first person view) or repairing various stations/components; you earn credits/currency by ending each battle with as much cargo as possible, and you can then purchase upgrades for your ship for the next mission. There is the beginning of an interesting game concept here. I understand that the developer is probably now more focused on their online version of this game; this is partially evidenced by them renaming this one "Flight of the Icarus" to distinguish it from the multiplayer "Guns of Icarus Online" (although this game originally claimed to have a "multiplayer" option as well, it has recently been updated to remove that option from the main screen). I've observed some fairly enthusiastic feedback for the online product, but I haven't tried it myself so it's not possible to provide an effective comparison. This edition definitely has a "freshman" feel to it, with not much in terms of depth and refinement of features. I obtained it at a highly discounted price, so I'm not holding it against them. Generally, I wouldn't bother -- tons of other indie games with more to offer.","June 29, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guns of Icarus has no tutorial stage where you're forced to push the buttons you're told to push. Rather, whenever something new first comes up -- be it another part of the ship is on fire or you first mount a given type of gun -- the game pauses and tells you everything you need to know about it. Once you're done absorbing the info, you unpause and it won't bother you about it again. This allows Guns of Icarus to stay out of your way as a player while still saving you from needing any sort of manual. Furthermore, the player is allowed to ease their way into the game simply by being provided levels at all stages of difficulty, which brings us to the next thing.\n\nSecond, there's the multitude of paths. A campaign consists of a series of flights between map locations taking you from the starting location to a final showdown on the other end of the map, and at almost every location you can choose between multiple locations to go to next. The flights have various degrees of difficulty, allowing you to choose a path that starts easy enough to build up strength and then step up the difficulty whenever you're ready. If you survive a level you can continue to the next, but if you also keep your cargo hold from serious damage you can get better guns and armor. Naturally, harder levels offer better upgrades for keeping your cargo intact, to make it worth the added difficulty of getting those upgrades; so if you take a harder path and excel, you'll be better equipped for the final showdown. And of course, different flights show you different pieces of the story, which brings us to the yet another thing.\n\nThird, there's the exposition. Guns of Icarus has almost no plot, but is full to the brim with story. Rather than using or abusing cutscenes, each location features a postcard-like combination of an almost impressionist oil painting of the place in question and a snippet of an entry from the captain's log (which reads more like a diary, actually). For as minimalist as they are these give you potent glimpses into the world of the Icarus and the life of her captain, and together weave a tale of peoples lost in a hostile world, of their struggle to survive, and of pressing on with no destination save the next step in the journey. It's a somber tale, but the good, pensive kind of somber that leaves you pondering how you'd manage in such rough times and wondering if you can tell if people who seem cold and hardened aren't really just weary of being desperate for so long. The end of the game also (minor spoiler...) seems to nod subtly to the Greek legend of Icarus, which should please the classically minded (I know it pleased me).\n\nTo be fair to people thinking of buying Guns of Icarus, here are some obvious things from Guns of Icarus Online that you won't find in the original here (at least in single-player mode): companions to help keep your ship in the air, the ability to steer/pilot the ship, multiple ships to choose from and multiple ammo modes for each gun. Oh, and Steam Achievements, if you really gotta have those. There is also less variety of music in this game, and the graphics aren't quite as polished. The gameplay here consists almost entirely of running from gun to gun trying to shoot down wave after wave of World War I style fighter planes and still have time to repair your airship, but it does take some tactical strategy to succeed. To be fair, the sequel was just doing what every good sequel should: build upon, expand upon and improve upon its predecessor without spoiling the legacy or trampling on anything important. It would, nonetheless, be a mistake to focus only on what the original Guns of Icarus doesn't have, without appreciating what it does so well; and if you prefer just to shoot down waves of enemies, of if you really like a somber story told in postcards, you might actually like it a little better.\n\nIn short, while you should definitely check out the sequel Guns of Icarus Online if you're interested in either of these games, the original Guns of Icarus is a brilliant example of a well-designed game and may still be worth your time.","January 4, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guns of Icarus has no tutorial stage where you're forced to push the buttons you're told to push. Rather, whenever something new first comes up -- be it another part of the ship is on fire or you first mount a given type of gun -- the game pauses and tells you everything you need to know about it. Once you're done absorbing the info, you unpause and it won't bother you about it again. This allows Guns of Icarus to stay out of your way as a player while still saving you from needing any sort of manual. Furthermore, the player is allowed to ease their way into the game simply by being provided levels at all stages of difficulty, which brings us to the next thing.\n\nSecond, there's the multitude of paths. A campaign consists of a series of flights between map locations taking you from the starting location to a final showdown on the other end of the map, and at almost every location you can choose between multiple locations to go to next. The flights have various degrees of difficulty, allowing you to choose a path that starts easy enough to build up strength and then step up the difficulty whenever you're ready. If you survive a level you can continue to the next, but if you also keep your cargo hold from serious damage you can get better guns and armor. Naturally, harder levels offer better upgrades for keeping your cargo intact, to make it worth the added difficulty of getting those upgrades; so if you take a harder path and excel, you'll be better equipped for the final showdown. And of course, different flights show you different pieces of the story, which brings us to the yet another thing.\n\nThird, there's the exposition. Guns of Icarus has almost no plot, but is full to the brim with story. Rather than using or abusing cutscenes, each location features a postcard-like combination of an almost impressionist oil painting of the place in question and a snippet of an entry from the captain's log (which reads more like a diary, actually). For as minimalist as they are these give you potent glimpses into the world of the Icarus and the life of her captain, and together weave a tale of peoples lost in a hostile world, of their struggle to survive, and of pressing on with no destination save the next step in the journey. It's a somber tale, but the good, pensive kind of somber that leaves you pondering how you'd manage in such rough times and wondering if you can tell if people who seem cold and hardened aren't really just weary of being desperate for so long. The end of the game also (minor spoiler...) seems to nod subtly to the Greek legend of Icarus, which should please the classically minded (I know it pleased me).\n\nTo be fair to people thinking of buying Guns of Icarus, here are some obvious things from Guns of Icarus Online that you won't find in the original here (at least in single-player mode): companions to help keep your ship in the air, the ability to steer/pilot the ship, multiple ships to choose from and multiple ammo modes for each gun. Oh, and Steam Achievements, if you really gotta have those. There is also less variety of music in this game, and the graphics aren't quite as polished. The gameplay here consists almost entirely of running from gun to gun trying to shoot down wave after wave of World War I style fighter planes and still have time to repair your airship, but it does take some tactical strategy to succeed. To be fair, the sequel was just doing what every good sequel should: build upon, expand upon and improve upon its predecessor without spoiling the legacy or trampling on anything important. It would, nonetheless, be a mistake to focus only on what the original Guns of Icarus doesn't have, without appreciating what it does so well; and if you prefer just to shoot down waves of enemies, of if you really like a somber story told in postcards, you might actually like it a little better.\n\nIn short, while you should definitely check out the sequel Guns of Icarus Online if you're interested in either of these games, the original Guns of Icarus is a brilliant example of a well-designed game and may still be worth your time.","January 4, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
