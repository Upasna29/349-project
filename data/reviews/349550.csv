"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/recommended/349550/","tinyturtle","Tiny Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/","870 products in account","I can't with good conscience recommend this game to anyone. It's a straight mobile port. It does well to adapt to different resolutions but the art used in the game really doesn't stand up to being brought up to HD. The asthetics the art goes for though are pretty lovely, I have to admit. It evokes the themes of the old HeroQuest boardgame mixed in with the classic old fantasy art tropes of that era, which I think looks fantastic. A little silly, but there's nothing wrong with light hearted fun!\n\nFun though is something this game lacks. The primary gameplay is wandering through a tile-based dungeon, bumping into enemies and then fighting them one on one. No matter how many enemies are in a room, you will never face them at the same time. They'll get in line and take turns being beaten up by you. What groups of monsters do is give something they call a 'gang' buff; when you get into a fight with a monster that has other monsters close by, it gets a +50% buff. I'm not sure what exactly gets buffed, if it's a specific stat or just straight up all of them, but they do get noticably tougher.\n\nDealing with them doesn't change, however. You just click until they die. You drink a potion every once in a while if you're taking damage, or you can use a spell charge if you're feeling fancy, but that's really it. Whether you play the Assassin, the Water Demon or the Ninja, you'll be doing the same exact thing, using the same tactics. All that changes between them is that some have access to different types of gear from shops, but even then the gear doesn't add anything but flavour. It's all just pure stat bonuses; a bonus to attack or a bonus to defense.\n\nIf you play this game for more than five to ten minutes it quickly becomes terribly boring. The game is best enjoyed, I believe, in short bursts on a cellphone or a tablet, where it shines. There the lack of tactics don't mean much because you're just grabbing it for a tiny bit. Kill a few monsters, do a quest, get some gold and get a little tougher. The utter lack of depth is completely fine in that setting. It's ironic then that the cellphone version is less than half the current price (at the time of writing) than the PC version.\n\nRight now the game is being sold for $5.99 with a -15% special promotion that drops it down to $5.09. Meanwhile you can get the game for your Android at $1.99. No joke. You're paying $3 extra ($4 after the sale ends on March 10th) for a far inferior experience, which I find terribly dishonest. I don't know why mobile ports feel like they have to charge double or triple or quadruple the mobile prices. Oh well!\n\nAll in all, I suggest you give this a pass. If you're a fan of boardgames, this does not invoke any of the old joys of HeroQuest or its ilk. It's not a good RPG, or adventure, or a good exploration. Check out the mobile version instead.","March 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 67 of 89 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","67","89","4","2"

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nBefore I start with this review, Let me just say this.\nThis is a fun colorful game that I recommend for the RPG, Turn-based type fans out there, Otherwise you might not like it very much, Because the game's focus is pretty much on that.\n\nSo to begin.\nMighty Dungeons is a really fun game, It is very customize-able so gives you more choices to go with your adventure.\n\nAs you can see in the screenshots, Your character and enemies are icons moving across the map, Which is not really a bad thing it gives the game a more (strategic) feeling.\nThe game is fast, You don't feel that (Come on just move already) part, Because everything goes by fast.\n\nI am not a fan of phone ports (Ios/android) But this one was built again for pc to suit it better, And the devs are doing a great job with it so far.\n\nA feature I like about the game, All those customizing features in it, When creating a new character you choose the game difficulty, Character buffs ( making it stronger ) Enemy buffs ( making them also stronger).\nYou also choose if the fights are turn-based or with a 5 second timer, Also while making a new character you can choose if Perma-Death is enabled or disabled for it, For a stronger challenge to some.\n\nWith more than 10 characters to choose from, All can equip certain types of Weapons, Armor, Spells, And more.\nAnd they all look very good in design gotta hand it to them.\n\nAbout 7 Campaigns, Each having 8 levels becomes harder as you progress through, And also a great feature which is workshop, So you can create more Quests, Campaigns, Characters, Weapons, And steam community is very creative, Hoping to see some good stuff.\n\nI like the old-school Rpg style in battles, Nothing too complicated just the basic Rpg type.\n\nThe map design is splendid, Gives you a path to follow and to reach the destination, And with every quest and campaigns it gets bigger and better with new designs and layouts, Chests and Cabinet and more to loot, Monsters everywhere, Traps to disarm and Secret paths to find.\nThe quests are easy, Find the thing, Rescue this guy, Kill the Dungeon master and a lot more.\n\nA shop to buy all sort of stuff from, A tavern to reach after finishing a quest, A training area to test your power, And after every quest and achievement you get points to spend to upgrade your hero.\nOh yeah also Achievements, There's a huge pack of them in this game.\n\nWhat I disliked so far is the game's balance, I feel like certain characters are overpowered ( Fire demon ) On nightmare mode, Your hp becomes much lower but damage gets higher, So becomes easy to 1 hit monsters before they get the chance to attack you.\nSo I don't suggest going Nightmare mode, I highly recommend going with the original mode.\n\nLets go to the pros and cons.\n\nPros  1 - Fast paced battles and movement to explore dungeons faster.\n2 - Many characters with different builds, A lot of levels to play, And customize-able features.\n3 - Great level design and characters that was built by the dev and the community.\n4 - Good soundeffects and soundtracks, Suits the game just right.\n5 - Equip weapons, Repair them, Use spells, Heal with potions and more Rpg-styled features.\n6 - Loot loot and loot, For some reason we gamers really like looting and this game has it.\n7 - I found a few bugs and errors, After reporting it to the developer they were fixed within the day, So huge thumbs up here.\n8 - It sure takes a long time to finish, 6 hours in and still climbing up the way to the end, And With achievements I'm sure it will take much more time.\n\nCons 1 - The matter of balance, Some characters feels much stronger than the rest, But I guess that's because of the (Nightmare) Mode, Which makes the character's damage much higher but with less health, So just go with original mode.\n2 - After a while the game feels kinda repetitive, But to turn-based dungeon crawler fans, That shouldn't be an issue.\n\n\nI am not being generous here the game has a lot more Pros than cons, The repetitive one is just my own opinion, To some others who gets addicted to this type of game, They would feel different about it.\nBut the balance is still an issue if you want a very hardcore challenge, You can choose perma-death or just click the option that makes the monsters crazier and go with Original mode to have a more balanced experience.\n\n\nTL;DR\nRecommended to people who'd enjoy this type of game, An rpg dungeon crawler type of game, That focuses mainly on that while ignoring some visual features, It gives a lot of hours and a lot of fun.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend this for people who are not really into this genre and would like to try it, Just see a few videos before deciding who knows, You might end up liking it.\n\nOverall 8/10 Had some real fun playing this game, Kudos to you devs good job on this.","March 4, 2015","true","8.3"," 49 of 80 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","49","80","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperFlexserve/recommended/349550/","SuperFlexserve","FsGoD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperFlexserve/","142 products in account","Mighty Dungeons is one of those games that takes you back to playing Hero Quest at the table. If your not familiar with Hero Quest the board game Google it. Lots to do quest wise and the content doesn't stop there! The game sports tons of quests from the get go with user created content available! I find the combat to be a mix of old school turn based with a mix of strategy and timed action. I have owned the Android version and was happy to see I would not be squinting at a smaller screen to play! (Plus my legs wont go numb when on the toilet playing for hours .. LOL)\n\nPROS:\n++ Might Dungeons is Hero Quest (basically)\n++ Lots of Quests\n++ Lots of classes and races (Characters)\n++ Interesting monsters\n++ Bosses!\n++ Large Dungeons\n++ Lots of hidden loot!\n++ Secret Doors! Lots of them!\n++ Kiting monsters from rooms so they can't get extra bonus on their attacks for grouping! LOL ;)\n++ They added hit zones on monsters (I gotta experiment with it to see full effect)\n++ Fast satifying quests and engagements! No need to grind for hours before the action begins.\n++ Some added humor! ?\n++ Strategy element with item and character choices!\n++ Active developers!\n\n\nCONS:\n-- Was a phone game\n-- Graphics are good, but basic (Don't expect next generation graphics, but the game doesn't need them!)\n-- Limited monster animation (wish there was more to attacks and defenses animation wise) Maybe in the future.\n\nTIPS:\n++ Explore everything!\n++ Never leave ANY part of a dungeon untouched, even at quests end.\n++ Sometimes secret doors also contain loot, inspect them first! (BOTH SIDES!)\n++ Walk the hallways first before opening doors, get the random monsters out of the way.\n++ Stock your potions and use them wisely!\n++ Kite monsters out of rooms so they do not get a group bonus.\n++ Use your mousewheel to see more and right click to drag the map around.\n++ Limit your play time, time will pass very fast as you explore!\n\nI have played the phone version for over a year and enjoyed this game thoroughly enough to be very excited to se I can now quest on my PC! On the phone, I have almost beat the stock quests, I'm going to re-play it all !\n\nIn the times of deaf developers and 1 trick AAA titles at high cost this is a very welcome Steam game!

It feels like Heroquest but better. Done 5 of 8 campaigns already in about 5.5 hours. That being said, one playthrough and I think I'll be done with it. I'm guessing I'll get about 10 hours tops out of it playing with one of the OP toons.\n\nFor the price, if you enjoyed Heroquest as a kid, this is worth.\n\nUPDATE: Underestimated this game. I was playing with permanent death and in the last map of the 7th campaign I was overconfident and ran into a room through a secret door with 8 powerful toons all giving each other gang bonus. First one smacked me around silly.\n\nIt's got more depth than you first think through the first few campaigns. I would recommend running it with non-perma death first to get a feel for the whole campaign, THEN, if you feel like it run it a second time with perma death. That's my plan.\n\nOn the other hand, this game has gotten better as it went along. Challenging and more fun than I would have expected and clearly my first playthrough estimates were wrong. 10 hours have passed and I'm still playing it.","March 4, 2015","true","25.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

A good game to de-stress with after work or school or just for some no brain drain relaxful dungeon crawling.\n\nEspecially good since most dungeons are a single layer/screen size. So they're nice "bite-sized" chunks that can be done in 15 minutes or so.\n\nAll-in-all, a good non-pretentious game for those who enjoy dungeon crawlers but don't want to spend a lot of time micro-managing.","March 7, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

Fun for both longer sit downs, and quick diversions. 9/10\nEdit: More time with this game has seen me upgrade it from my initial 7.5 to a 9. I've also added a bit more to the review to reflect that change. Being a port from another platform should not be held agaisnt a game, unless it was ported poorly. Looking at you Dynasty Warriors 8   ;...;\n\nIt's a good budget dungeon crawler. It sticks to the roots of dungeon crawling; explore dungeon, search rooms, kill mosnters, complete quests, collect booty, upgrade hero stats and equipment. I good selection of starting characters should  provide you with one to fit your play style. There really isn't much room for play style though- kill monsters, collect loot. The upgrade system is pretty flexible and allows you to customize as you see fit. You earn achievments by clearing dungeons, and killing things. You can then spend these points to upgrade your heros stats. Money and loot can be exchanged in town at the shop to allow further customization. Strategy comes into play when deciding to tank it up with more armor, go for more damage to kill the baddies faster, more spells to upgrade your arsenal, or the ever important potions. From the basic and essential healing potions, to the stat and combat buff potions.  It's fun and satisfying to see your potion guzziling whelp, evolve into a dungeon destroying machine.\n\nBeing able to pick any dungeon you want from the start, is a nice feature. Sucking down too many potions as you progress up the chain in a quest line? Try moving to the lower tiers of another dungeon to help you farm those achivment points, and much sought after gold!\n\nVisuals are very basic, but do not detract from the dungeon crawling experience. The simplistic icons fit into the Hero Quest/Board Game feel quite nicely. Audio is adequate in giving you some olde timey, or darker dungeon crawly music and fight sound effects, but is nothing to make you beg for the OST.\n\nComabat is a little lacking, but fun in it's own way. A simplistic "click&kill" interface can be nice sometimes. You can gamble on aiming for a critical location. I find aiming for the arm on a monster with high HP can make all the difference in the long hall. Monsters get a bonus for other monters in the area with them. A pathetic goblin provides the same bonus as a fearsome dark knight. Even when you try to use the narrow hallways to your advantage to fight them 1v1, somehow the monsters in the back are still able to provide support. They don't have to be adjacent either. It seems any baddie within a couple squares can lend a hand. The only real tactics I've found are to engage the weaklings before the biggers ones, and kite down hallways trying to lose the others. Thus removing the "gang bonus" before fighting the more powerfull things.\n\nThere's no hidden costs, or microtransaction store. The game is fully accessible from the start.\n\nIf you're into old school dungeon crawlers, give this a try. It's good at scratching that itch. If you want a fast paced, bloody, immersive 3D, visceral dismemberment orgy... this might not be the game for you.","March 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","2"

Right before turning last night at 5 AM I decided to check Steam one more time.  And what do I fnd but a glorious gem called Mighty Dungeons! As one old wizard once said, "stay awhile and listen." [NOTE: Sorry Blizzard, I'm dead broke so even if you do try to sue me for using a line, you won't get a cent. Besides, I'm protected by the academic fair use clause AND the Malodorous Ring of Power Against Megacorporations so, bite me].\n\nWow, where to begin? I don't write reviews as a sort of list as I am too addle pated so intead I'll\nwrite a review. [Get on with it! - ed.].What we have here intrepid Steamers is an unabashed love letter to boardgame classics like the legendary Heroquest and that is a Very Good Thing (TM). Veterans know the ropes of course: complete quests by punching monsters and finding Important Stuff (TM). The game comes with 8 campaigns each with 8 to 12 quests per campaign. It's Heroquest mashed together with Dungeonmaster and apologies to you young'uns out there that have the addled notion that Skyrim is the only game in town.\n\nYou want heroes? You got 'em with a bucketload of choices from warriors and elves to murderin' maulin' minotaurs (I love alliteration), and if you are feeling especially murderous you can be a demon and almost anything else in between. Each hero has her/his strengths and weaknesses and because there are so many choices, replayability is high out of the gate. Additionally, you can repeat quests as often as you like but with each repeat the monsters get significantly tougher and the rewards diminish to prevent over farming for gold runs. Of course in gamer speak that means that one MUST repeat quests because the developer has thrown down the proverbial gauntlet. ;)\n\nThe game started life in iOS land. But wait, don't run away! This version has been made PC worthy by ramping up the difficulty, full screen resolution support AND the ability to create new content for the game! I should state that there is no level editor per se included but creating content is VERY easy and if you visit mighty-dungeons.com you will find all kids of guides. That said, the developer indicated that he is working on uploading some tools to Steam Workshop. I can only imagine what twisted mightiness will emerge from the sick.. errrr.. I mean BRILLIANT minds that haunt Steam.\n\nYou can make this game play as you like it. Do you want to play it as a roguelike with all the odds against you an permadeath? Tick off the appropriate boxes and die - a lot. It could be however that you had a really crappy day at work or you want to punch your professor for assigning a 50 page paper on Hegel's Reason in History that's due in two days. Well then, tick off the godlike option and slay all in your path. You won't get your paper done but at least you won't be jailed for trying to faceroll your professor.\n\nDo not let the games iOS looks deceive you. The boardgame style serves a purpose in that it focuses on the most important component in any game, namely, game play.\n\nQuite a long review for a game that only costs a fiver but this game is so very content rich and I haven't even scratched the surface. It costs less than a Starbuck's coffee and you don't have to deal with a cranky barista. The developer is VERY active on the community hub and get this: there was a gamer who couldn't choose between this or Dark Quest. The developer told the gamer to buy Dark Quest to support a fellow indie developer THEN e-mail him and he would give the gamer a free Steam key for Mighty Dungeons.\n\nThis my friends is the kind of developer that deserves support. He releases a wonderful game for a song, helps out a competing developer, and a member of the community.\n\nMay the fleas of a thousand camels infest your [insert area here] if you don't buy this.","March 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","1"

It's a lite dungeon crawler that has several dungeons that can be completed fairly quickly which makes it a great game for those in-between breaks. It does have some minor flaws (like the last level of The Black Sheep Quests can freeze up and make you exit the game but your progress is saved). There are many different characters to choose from which gives you lots of options when playing the game. They also have specialized armours and equipment for each of the different classes/characters. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty decent game.\n\nPros:\n-Quick and simple\n-Achievements are fairly easy to get (I got a perfect game in less than 20 hours)\n-Great character/class selection\n-You can upgrade your equipment\n-Achievements unlock hero points to upgrade your character\n\nCons:\n-Some glitches in maps (like you start one and you can't attack or be attacked by monsters, it corrects itself if you leave the map and re-enter, also, the last Black Sheep Quest can freeze and the program stop working half-way through the game, but game saves your place and progress when you restart the game)\n-Achievements unlock hero points, so when you have all the achievements, you can't progress further without entering cheat codes\n-To get the Origins campaign you have to enter a special code (and the origins campaign is situated inbetween your current list of campaigns which effects some difficulty/playability of the game)\nThe last game is very anticlimatic as it gives you these super weapons and then there's no big bad monster to defeat. It's very anticlimatic if you just fought the Goblin King which is really the last big threat in the game\n\nOverall, I rate it at a 9.5/10","May 7, 2015","true","26.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm not really sure why that was, because playing through the PC version revealed it to be a relatively brainless and lackluster experience.\n\nGameplay-wise, playing a warrior class is a rather easy and boring experience, with the only interesting parts of the game being your first campaign or so, when you still have to trade off between trying to hit enemies in the head for high damage but only a 25-35% chance to hit, or hitting them in the body for normal damage 100% of the time. Quickly, however, you reach the point where your equipped weapon is good enough that you kill most enemies before they get a chance to attack you, and after that the only real threat comes from enemies who can do hundreds of damage if they get a turn. "Fortunately", though probably not for game balance, this is a game with purchasable invincibility potions that last an entire fight (or five!), making even those a fairly easy task. I can't say how it'd have been if I picked a class that focused on spellcasting, however.\n\nThe game also generally lacks in interesting loot until the last campaign, with almost everything being buyable in the store rather than being found in a dungeon, which ends up adding to the mediocre feeling, especially since the majority of the armor items only have two or three varieties, meaning that the only items that even really drop are weapons and potions. The main exception is the final campaign, which adds a bunch of weapons stronger than the previous best weapons near the end of the game... as well as a limited-use weapon called the Soul Eater that kills anything in one shot, but only has five uses. Fortunately, the blacksmith in town will repair it infinitely for free, so it really has infinite uses once you get it back to town.\n\nEngine-wise, the game also is rather lackluster, suffering from notable slowdown if the game is left open for a while, slowing down when I attempt to purchase toolkits, having some issues with line-of-sight being drawn through solid stone blockades or other walls at times, and the last campaign giving me several crash-like bugs, where nothing in the game would respond to clicking any more, as well as outright crashes in the last mission. Also, once a mission's requirements are complete, all of the enemies get random-seeming stat boosts, making them much harder than they would be. As a result, it's almost always good to kill everything in a mission before you complete the requirements for it, which can be awkward and appears to be the result of either a bug or an undocumented (at least, so far as I could see) feature.\n\nThe story is also lacking in most places, mostly being mission descriptions that give an excuse for why you're hacking up monsters in nearly identical-looking dungeons and short in-mission blurbs often riddled with typos. The only obnoxious bit I really remember is that the final campaign ends with a cultist saying their dark god(dess?) will soon revive... and, well, that's the end of the last campaign. That said, story is clearly not supposed to be the draw of this game.\n\nGraphically, the game is rather boring and repetitive... until the last campaign, which has some issues with the tileset at times (external walls not being visible until the inside of the building is visible in the town maps, for instance) as well as some minor issues with how tightly-packed some of the maps are, but which is way more visually impressive than the rest of the game. Unfortunately, the seven campaigns before the Black Sheep campaign have you basically going into areas that all look the same again and again. While some of this is clearly due to the HeroQuest inspiration, HeroQuest was working with the limitations of a physical board and still included custom tiles for every expansion.\n\nLast but not least, this game loves hilariously blatant copyright violations, which I found kind of amusing - the hidden campaign is almost exactly the original 12 missions from HeroQuest translated to the game's format, and there are cameo appearances by Drizzt do'Urden, Raistlin Majere, Liliana Vess, and Sephiroth. A bunch of other stuff in the game also uses names and terms (like deity names and locations) from Dungeons & Dragons. While Hasbro/Games Workshop might frown at the Origins campaign if they knew about it, I still felt it was a cool addition. The other stuff just seems silly and unnecessary.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game, mostly because almost all of the game is combat but it doesn't have a very solid combat system, instead having one that quickly devolves into "hit attack until the enemy dies, or drink a potion of invulnerability at the start of combat if it's really nasty and then hit attack until the enemy dies." The bug-ridden engine, lack of interesting loot, and general bland and repetitive feeling of 7/8 of the campaigns are also issues, but the core gameplay not being fun is the main reason this is a thumbs-down.","March 11, 2015","false","10.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","8"

You move an icon resembling your character around a 2D surface. You move one square at a time and find chests, monsters, and items you can use. When you fight a monster it pops up a static image of the enemy and you can click an attack button or a part of the monster's body.\n\nYou have a bunch of dungeons to play through with each one having 8 stages. Each one has different objectives to complete to finish the level. you can then spend money you found to buy new gear to improve opn your character. You will also earn xp points to upgrade certain stats when you complete feats like kill so many monsters, earn so much gold, etc.\n\nThe game was fun for a while but after I completed about 4 or 5 dungeons I grew tired of playing. It's a good time waster and can be some fun in small spurts.","May 16","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh boy.\n\nThe game is badly built, the menus barely work, the UI is an abomination and the graphics are a mishmash of hand-drawn and badly refined pictures of different resolutions and styles; there are enough primary colors to make your eye bleed and a sound design that will make you mute the whole game after a minute. Everything you hear and see in this game is an assault on the senses.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing to be proud of either. While the initial setup promises a lot at first glance with the mission system, after you started playing, clicked around on the goblins sliding at you, then mashed the Attack key while listening to the exact same sword noise and annoying grunting noise when your character gets hit, you will want to quit and never touch this game again after a mere few minutes.\n\nSave yourself the suffering and don't buy this game.","May 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game is simple, and yet riddled with bugs that can stop your progress, like having to exit an area due to not being able to attack, or an option not being available to be seen. If you're looking for an experience like this, I'd recommend Card Hunters, the F2P browser game, but sadly, Mighty Dungeons doesn't do enough for me to stand out.\n\nFor more information and gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJqv-UzxKIw","March 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","15","33","3","10"

As for the shop items I also believe that could be improved by adding a more selective amount of items for each type of character that helps them in physical strength, magical strength and attack speed for rogues so it doesn't have to be each character individually having new items it's more of what kind of traits they show. for the battles how they could be improved is add more features rather than headshot body shot leg shot etc you could add a skills tab for melee avatars. The battles should be more interactive rather than BAM first battle spam the attack button you should add a proper tutorial. Even through all this it was a really good game that I played for a few hours then let my 11 year old brother have a shot and he found it magnificent (I admit I cheated some money to give him better items so he didn't get demolished). With the pets you could add different moves for them and even add armor for them which would make them live longer. As for potions I think they were alright. Going back to what the shop needs improving on would be the prices they go from one extreme to another what you should do is have the starting weapons like long sword at a cheaper more reach able goal for newer players so that they don't get too frustrated with the game. All in all I would rate it 7/10.","December 10, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
