"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbuh/recommended/415920/","pbuh","The Prophet Mohammad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbuh/","354 products in account","A real hidden gem of a game; Voidspire Tactics is a rarity in that it not only draws inspiration from games like Final Fantasy Tactics, but it actually gets what is fun about a party based SRPG. The rhythm of unlocking new skills, classes, passive abilities is spot on. After every battle there's usually something new to equip, or some ability to buy, or some stats to improve.\n\nCombat lacks the height mechanics of FFT/ Tactics Ogre, but there's still a lot to take in, with positioning and facing still matter, and spells modify terrain (Ala Bahamut Lagoon.) It's not quite Divinity: Original Sin, but magic interacts with the environment in some fun ways.\n\nOutside of combat, exploration is outstanding. Somewhat non-linear with a wide variety of environment types, visually the game never gets boring.  Plenty of secret items and even areas are stashed underground, down cliff faces, and just behind cave walls. I was surprised a number of times how a hunch or even a blind guess paid off.\n\nPlot is definitely not the main focus of the game, which may disappoint some RPG lovers, but I was so in love with the gameplay and exploration that I was glad to spend most of the game outside a dialogue box. There are some choices to be made, and an in-game bestiary/ item codex to fill out, so while a first time play-through may run about 15 hours, there's plenty of content to go back and look for.\n\nIn short, there's a lot to love about this game, whether you're a JRPG or WRPG fan. Voidspire Tactics is a detailed, very creative game that knows it's strengths, and is just a delight to play.","December 22, 2015","true","19.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/recommended/415920/","losian","Losian Rooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/","285 products in account","I am a die-hard tactics fan. Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Advance 2, and Tactics Advance all have a spot somewhere in the top handful of my favorite games of all time. As such, I always lack of remotely similar titles that build on the style that they set the groundwork for!\n\nThis game, it seems, has at least some inspiration from that style. I'm just throwing down my first impressions here after making characters and jumping in.\n\nThe graphics are relatively simple pixelwork, but it's tightly controlled and well done, it's cohesive. The environments fit the style, there's no obnoxious 3d lighting effects thrown over pixels or backgrounds in a different resolution. The UI is fairly intuitive. Movement and actions in combat take a little getting used to but it's not bad.\n\nThere are four races at start; humans, of course, and three others.. which includes a furred race, a naga race, and some kinda weird faceless humanoids. You start by making a party of four and can change up the head style/hair/clothing colors/etc. to differentiate your characters. The game has a sort of open-worldness, think back to like.. Ultimate series? You can wander around outside combat and use abilities (light braziers after setting them back upright, manipulate terrain to traverse it, search crates, etc.) and it feels a lot like the later Ultimas, but with your party in tow, naturally.\n\nTo my surprise it even has a charge-time mechanic much like the original Final Fantasy Tactics! You have to be a bit more careful with the planning of dropping your spells and such.\n\nAt that point it drops you right in, and you start off with three available classes. There seems to be the ability to have a main and secondary class, again much like the tactics series. I can't comment yet on the overall balance with combat difficulty, classes, etc., but my first impressions are surprisingly positive! I've yet to find ANY other Tactics-style game that was really done remarkably well, so this is a treat for those like me potentially.\n\nI'm thoroughly impressed!\n\nOne big issue, though, is that at present (11/2/15), the saving appears to sometimes crash the game. :( The autosaving works and the save seems to work at least sometimes, but it's a bit hit or miss, so it's sort've a significant annoyance. ** This should be fixed now, saving works fine for me as of the built the other day. **\n\nEdit: Couple hours in now, totally worth the cost and then some. So far so good. There's a neat little crafting system, a mix-and-match of passives from various classes that encourages branching out, a  nice variety of weapons/status effects/etc. It definitely has a 'open world' kinda feel as it suggests, there's hints of directions but not tons, but it's also pretty engaging just to wander around and see what enemies/items you can find/craft, while also bulking up your classes a bit.\n\nThis is a definitely solid title.\n\nEdit edit: Just finished today!\n\nAbsolutely loved it. I did hit ONE major bug, but coincidentally I had just reported a smaller bug to the dev and, as such, he helped me out and he was able to not only fix the issue but isolate the bug and go ahead and update the build so it'd not be a game-breaker for any other users who play it.\n\nMy only real significant complaint is that I'd love more! A bit more depth to the dialogue or story wouldn't be bad, but I also realize that the goal here seemed to be more of an "openness and exploration" type approach as opposed to a deep and engrossing story. There was some intrigue and such at first while figuring out the gist of what's going on, so that was definitely better than nothing!\n\nI definitely enjoyed the game, and after beating it there even seem to be a few unlocks (a few races, new difficulty, etc.) so there may yet be more on harder difficulties/other play throughs? Not sure, but really, I'd give this game a solid thumbs-up if you are a fan of any of the Final Fantasy Tactics series.\n\nI do wish I had realized sooner that I could hover over the ?? for classes not yet unlocked and thus unlocked them sooner and, as such, be able to better plan out my characters. I was scrambling a bit at the end to kinda build up their skillsets some more with the last classes I unlocked. I will also say there were QUITE a few secrets, and I'm sure I missed a bunch.\n\nKeep a good eye out for nice Zelda-style breakable walls (and keep a hammer, axe, pickax, shovel, etc. handy for such occasions, too.) There are some moments when you need a precise one of a couple tools to get through something.\n\nI do wish the game was a bit longer, but for the cost and the style of game, I have no complaints.\n\nSuper good job, dev. Great game!","November 2, 2015","true","22.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

Instead of me listing pros and cons I’ll just leave some bullets and you can decide if you like that element or not.\n\n\nGood KB/M support.  Can rebind all keys.  But, has a somewhat console-ish UI feel.\nFour member party generation\nFour races with basic racial ability/bonuses equivalent to Avrernum games\nCharacter development is through earning xp in a specific class and unlocking new classes.  You can have two classes activated at any time, and the abilities granted by these classes.\nThere are three passive slots for slotting passive abilities you opened with classes.  Can have three from one class or mix and match.\nZelda like elements like picking through walls or shoveling to find secrets, etc.\nGameplay, to me, seems like a jrpg developer tried to make a western like crpg in the vein of Dark Sun, Avernum, or Albion.\nCrafting is extensive.  Not extensive like in-depth and complicated, but extensive as in abundant.\nFor instance – you can put oil in an empty bottle, put an oily rag on the empty bottle and you have a Molotov cocktail.\nTo craft weapons you need the weapon manual/book thing and put it on an anvil then put the mat on it and Wala you have a crafted weapon.\nBetter mats make better weapons.\nPut a piston and rope together and you can climb down holes.\nChop trees for wood, etc.\nI never really pay attention to story but the dialogue has been very brief so I have read what has been said.  Story, so far, doesn’t seem to be the focus of the game.\nLot of exploring.\nVery restricted equipment slots.  You have two weapon/item slots and three other slots for armor and two trinketish items (like a necklace and goggles, or a cloak and hipflask for example.\nCombat is decent.  I don’t think it is mind blowing os far, but I’m not all that far into the game.  I would say it is a ring above Avernum, but not at the level of ToEE (in my opinion).  On par with Knights of the Chalice.\nCombat does not have action points - you have a movement option and attack option like Antharion, ToEE, Knights of the Chalice, etc.\nNo bugs so far; seems pretty rock solid\n\nMy opinion – this game is good and well worth the money, even at full price, for fans of crpgs willing to try a game that isn’t your standard fair.  The game probably won’t blow your mind but it has enough content and meat to justify the price.  Its not the best at anything, but it is also far from the worst.  It has all the gameplay elements I look for in a crpg and I do not regret this purchase at all and feel safe recommending it to all crpg fans at full price.","November 2, 2015","true","15.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

BlingSnake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/z_bill/","135 products in account","This is an ingenious game.\n\nAt first glance it might look like all the art is copy/pasted from some Snes template, but don't let that repel you. Not only is this a fantastic (and very fun) tactics game, it's got a ton of neat crafting & exploring mechanics you don't expect.\n\nOften I was surprised by this game, like: "I need more bandages but don't know how to make them. I wonder if I use that on that..." And it totally worked! Or: "I can only hop two tiles. Can I freeze that water to make it to the island?" Yes! "Wait, can I use these seeds to make a vine ladder?" Absolutely!\n\nIt's essentially got all the sandboxy world-altering of something like Divinity: Original Sin, but this was made by one guy!\n\nAlso, the world is simple, but a lot of fun. Smartly, the developer justified having disparate game environments crammed next to each other by making that part of the plot in an almost meta way! And the denizens of the world are stone people, cats, lizards, insects...It's like a small slice of a rich, weird fantasy world.\n\nHighly recommended for any tactics fan, especially those who seek out games that sprang from one dev's mind.","April 1","true","18.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Is this game good? Short answer, yes, you will most likely be satisfied with your purchase because this game does a lot of things right.\n\nLet's get into it a bit more and I will explain a few reasons why I am enjoying this game so much.\n\nFor starters, the developer (I think it's only one guy) has clearly put a lot of heart into the overall design of his game. Every character feels unique and I feel encouraged to interact with them. The enviornments are pleasing to navigate and encourages you to explore each and every area. The music varies on the situation but it almost always goes well what your doing in game, whether is simply exploring a dungeon, or fighting in an epic battle.\n\nSecondly, and probably the best part about Voidspire, is the combat. There is a lot to love here and I have absolutley no gripes with combat thus far. It's very fair, and also challenging. I am playing the game on default settings right now and I'm still making some mistakes. I have accidentally downed one of my characters by hitting him with a my own lighting bolt.\n\nThere are a variety of classes that you can start out with and I believe you can unlock more as you progress, and whats really cool is you can change up your class for your characters any time, as well as assign them secondary classes. And as you level up your characters you get new abilities at your disposal and this lets you fight the way you want to fight. I am having a lot of fun with one character whos primary class is warrior, but I also leveled up some scholar abilities as well. This type of model lets you tailor the game to how you want to play, and it's a lot of fun. There are also a lot of stats related to each of your characters which makes it extremly fun to level them up and see how they progress.\n\nI haven't gotten too far into the story yet but I will update this review as I continue through the game.  If you have even the slightest interest in this game I suggest picking it up, it's a load of fun.","November 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There is a wealth of interesting classes, each with their own unique abilities, allowing for some very fun combinations. Versatility is also a key element outside of combat, as many of the games puzzles have multiple solutions.\n\nI experienced a bug attempting to solve a problem in one particular way. The creator of the game responded within a few hours with multiple solutions. He also looked over my save game files to determine what other options I had available to me. Because the game has multiple solutions, I was able to work around the bug by simply solving the problem another way.\n\nGiven the cheap cost of the game, high replayability, great gameplay, originality of the world, and excellent support, this is a solid buy for any fan of tactical turn-based games.","April 10","true","36.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You are now one step closer to unearthing the next indie gem in your steam collection. If the numbers I have seen on steamdb today are to be believed you are one of only a relative few that have been lucky enough to do so. This game is good buy it.\n\nAnd the rest of the story......\n\nI confess the reason I initially turned my nose up at this title was the asking price vs. the graphics shown in the screenshots. My gut reaction was this was going to be another "proud" indie developed game with alot of heart and not enough direction or triple AAA gloss to cover up the imperfections. Well I was wrong.\n\nSo I decided to make the purchase after seeing the slow trickle of "recommend it" reviews that seemed to be genuine come rolling in over the last few days. If you take the time to read them I think its pretty clear most of the reviewers would put this game in the 8-9 range on a 10 scale. I was also swayed by taking a visit to the game's dedicated page and browsing a few articles/blogposts from the developer (I think this is a one man show) detailing his take on the mechanics that govern rpg systems and challenges of allowing for intersting choice vs maintianing game balance. If you're still on the fence I'll do my best to tell you why you should be off it and walking this way already.\n\nStuff I liked.....\n\nSolid Combat Mechanics - Fairly standard Startegic RPG with a twist or two thrown in for fun\nExploration - Legend of Zelda comparision-worthy\nPacing - Excellent for me and you if your fan of exploring looking for secerets\nCasual plus/Hardcore-lite  - Voidspire found that sweet spot between making the game too simple and overly complex\nBalanced - Good build-up from a few gimmes to a casual brawl on up into a few semi-challenging to difficult scenarios. I love that I was required to make some strategic adjustments in the mid to late game but did not feel that one missmanaged attribute point early had destoryed my character builds.. Puzzles - These required work and a bit of effort plus perception\nInteractions - There's alot of them from icing down water to walk across to diggin up rubble and lighting camp fires. Big plus for me was that you can burn down a forest. It takes persistance and given there's no real strategic value in doing so. Regardless I reaaaaallllly enjoyed watching it burn up along with the hippie squatters that called it home.\nRetro-feeling good ness from the 16-bit era Super Nintendo style\nUnique (meaning there's only one) setting - Not your typical Orcs, Goblins, Dragons-to-go formula.\n\nAC/DC\n\n-Stats are not explained very well...for experience players this will not be an issue as the forumla is a pretty standard rpg - A bit of a plus if you don't like having your hand-held through familiar territory\n-UI kinda wonky at first but it grew on me as the game went on\n-Music is functional but repetetive and forgettable\n-Backtracking got a bit tedious in the late mid-game but was  most of the maps had shortcuts keeping this annoyance to a minimum\n-Story is Light on content and no attempt is made at character development. What you will find is adequate in giving some purpose to your actions and establishing the setting. The interactions with the environment act as a placeholder for the immersion offered by other title's central story and characters.\n-Graphically lackluster - Still manages to be effective in delivering the gameplay mechanics but nothing to right home about. A few of the character sprites have enough originality to push this up a notch.\n\n\nStuff for improvement....\n\nLength - Just a back-handed compliment reallly. The 30-35 hours spent here had me satisfied but still wanting more. Replay value is likely determined by how much time you spent exploring the first time around. An added difficulty adds some points here but I am not overly excited at going through the game knowing most of the suprises have already been found.\nInventory/Loot System -  Only aspect of the game I found myself completely unhappy with. Picking through spoils of wars for scrap metal has never been my favorite rpg trope.\nSlightly Underdeveloped Systems - Crafting is somewhat interesting in that there is an element of scarcity and choice to looting. However combining a craftbook and one element is a little too simple for my tastes. Exploration is fun and usually rewarding but would probably benefit addtional context clues, maps etc. The majority of the classes have at least two skills or passive that interested me but there were two or three that need some expansion. One seemed like a complete throwaway to me but I may need to give it a second look.\n\n\nI loved this game and enjoyed it enough to get a litte depressed finishing my first playthrough. I can not say this game has a WOW factor in any particular area but the sum of the parts wound up greater than I could have expected. Lack of an exciting or dynamic selling point might be a defeating characteristic for many titles but Voidspire Tactics wins with solid and familiar forumula. Minimizing the aspects of the experience that are secondary or superfoulous in order to maxmize the parts of the experience that shine.\n\nFun Game. Solid Game Design. Money and time well spent here.\n\n9/10 - Exceptionally "Good" one of my favorite games of 2015","November 10, 2015","true","36.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Have only played a short bit, but am enojoying it. Voidspire Tactics is to strategy rpgs what Chrono Trigger was to jrpgs.\n\nThe combat initiating and transpiring on the same screen as exploration is immensely satifisying. Character location becomes very important and setting up surpise attacks is a challenge if you do not go the way of range attacks. Character death, if your party survives, only incurs a health penalty until you rest and recuperate.\n\nEnjoying the class system. Not very complex. Have a main and a secondary class that gain xp. Every ~400 xp gets you stars that can boost stats and proficiencies. XP is used to gain and increase ranks in abilities. Meeting xp reqs in different classes open up more classes. Looking forward to opening up some of the higher tiers.\n\nExploration is great. Reminds me of Pokemon. Have a skill that boosts vegetable growth, use it to grow plants that you can harvest. Use axes to cut down trees. Use bottles on beer kegs to bottle beer. All sorts of stuff. Don't want to spoil anything else. Just be ready to experiment and be creative.\n\nNeed to play more to give the story props.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rolldig/recommended/415920/","rolldig","Insept","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rolldig/","28 products in account","The core gameplay of Voidspire Tactics can be separated into the class system/character specialization, the combat gameplay, and the noncombat gameplay. There are also additional features like dialogue and inventory management, but they play more of a support role. This review of Voidspire Tactics focuses on the three main categories of gameplay mentioned earlier.\n\nScroll down to read the review, or watch the video review if you prefer:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563450552\n\nClass System:\n\nThe class system in Voidspire Tactics is relatively friendly to new players, but has a certain amount of depth and complexity to it as well, which becomes apparent over time. The ability to switch classes at any time can also lead to some interesting situations.\n\nCombat Gameplay:\n\nThe combat in Voidspire Tactics is great. The level design combines, the usefulness of the active abilities and spells , and the high overall level of interactivity combine together to produce a variety of interesting situation and a plethora of possible tactics to apply.\n\nNoncombat Gameplay:\n\nThe noncombat gameplay in Voidspire Tactics takes the form of environmental puzzles, which often have multiple solutions, based on your character's abilities. This is similar to Divinity: Original Sin, a game I adore, so I'm very happy with Voidspire Tactics as well. As a person who's not great at the traditional adventure game style puzzle solving where there's only one way to go about doing things, I love the noncombat gameplay in Voidspire.\n\nStory:\n\nAlthough this game features a dialogue system, a unique setting, and a story, I just don't find it very interesting. Coming from a crpg background, I'm used to more interactivity in the dialogue (I like it better when even the dialogue trees become a form of gameplay). What's more, the writing isn't compelling enough to make me care.\n\nOther:\n\nThere are some minor usability issues. In particular the movement controls are very strange, as you have to hold down the mouse button to walk instead of just clicking on a destination. Voidspire Tactics does have pathfinding, as shown during combat, so it seems unusual. The graphics are also low fidelity pixel art, which may be a problem for some people.\n\nOverall:\n\nVoidspire Tactics is a gem of a game. As a fan of tactical RPGs/SRPGs, I'm very happy with it. Not only is the combat excellent, but even the noncombat gameplay of Voidspire Tactics is fantastic. The story and graphics aren't great, but the the dialogue lines are short and to the point, and I don't mind the pixel art at all.","November 27, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrhiga/recommended/415920/","jrhiga","Rhiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrhiga/","172 products in account","TL:DR Apart from tedious inventory management and some minor technical issues, Voidspire Tactics is a real hidden gem of a game that offers an entertaining experience for tactical rpg enthusiasts and newcomers alike.\n\nI first caught a glimpse of this game searching for a decent Final Fantasy Tactics-like game because FFT is one of my top five games of all time. Now any game involving strategy/tactical combat always piques my interest and i must say when I first saw this game I was curious but a little skeptical about the graphics/presentation. After much consideration I decided to buy Voidspire Tactics on one of the generous Steam sales (i forget which).\n\nI am much satisfied with my purchase because even after the first 30 minutes or so this game introduced some mechanics and depth i haven't seen since FFT or Tactics Ogre, with a nicely implemented class system each with their own unique skill trees and passive abilities that can be kept throughout class changes. Even some of the puzzles, while not particularly challenging, in the game revolve around figuring out which combination of items/spells are needed to proceed into the next area which was a nice change of pace from the combat which I will talk about later. For instance, in one area I thought there was an impassible river towards one of the areas which I needed to advance to, but after finding out that Ice Magic can freeze the river I was finally able to cross, to my surpise that this game had that amount of hidden depth. All this depth translates over into the combat as well, with over a dozen different classes each with their own playstyle and nuances that can take some time researching what they are exceptional at. I love learning new things and Voidspire Tactics satisfies my need for discovering new class combinations, new spells, and even optimizing my parties' equipment.\n\nThe combat in this game is turn-based but what I most enjoy is how each character, depending on their class, has their own speed timer which will determine the next time they act, much like in FFT where their speed values are added with each round and when they reach 100 it'll be that character's turn to act. This feature adds a lot tactical planning and a strategic layer in the game because certain spells and abilities have their own speed value which aren't casted until its speed reaches a certain point, and in that time an enemy may move out of the area of effect. With the amount of spells, abilities, and stats gained from gear and experience I will have to say that everything comes together quite well when you're fighting enemies in combat.\n\nThe only glaring weaknesses I feel that the game could've done better is making a more manageable inventory system and a more intuitive UI; Finding out which of my four characters have certain containers with items not stacking when you pick them up is quite tedious and can ruin the fun for other less patient players. Mix that with certain items that you may need to use from a character's inventory (such as a pickaxe) will sometimes not be selected correctly when you click on it and the game registers single clicks as double clicks quite often which doesn't sound that bad at first but when you're forced to repeatedly use said item it can be quite frusterating. The last couple of nitpicks i'll make is the story is a little lacking and I wish there were more playable races other than the four at the start.\n\nWhen all is said and done I am really glad that I purchased this game. I've been putting some good hours in and it has been enjoyable seeing the different classes and abilities that each class has to offer, all while making progress towards a functional story that keeps me wanting to play. If only I didn't have to sort through all my parties inventory manually and making sure I don't accidently drop items that I need would that enjoyment be non-stop. Regardless, This game was a great find and has scratched the FFT itch that I've been waiting years for and I wish more people support more games from Rad Codex and I can't wait to see what future games they'll develop.","February 15","true","22.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I went in just wanting some Final Fantasy Tactics style classes/leveling, but got so much more! It has all of the fun class/character building of Final Fantasy Tactics, plus the exploration of a CRPG like Icewind Dale. I just completed it and unlocked a few minor things, so there may be some replayability aside from playing different class combinations.\n\nThe only cons are that the story is somewhat interesting but pretty lacking. I'm not sure if I missed something in the game, but I couldn't read half of the dialogue because it was in a different in-game language. There are also a few bugs that completely halted progress, but I was able to find guides from the developer on how to bypass them.","March 28","true","19.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The sprites are... not very good. The music is nice, but it loops too often. The mechanics are sometimes confusing and obscure, and it's not always clear what items you can use where to do what things. But it's a lot of fun, and you get to explore and dig through walls or fight a robot or whatever. I've got a faceless man who summons water so that he can electrocute things better, and a weird cat dude who punches people. A good team.\n\nDon't expect any deep engrossing story, though. There's a bunch of events at the beginning, but then it really just turns into a quest to explore as much as you can to find macguffins, which is fine by me but may not be what you're looking for.

Guide your party of four adventurers to try and escape the strange situation you're forced into at the start.\n\nThe game's combat and progression are easily its strongest suit-- positioning and facing are important, but on Normal mode there aren't many times that they're essential. Characters slowly unlock classes, abilities, and skills, and while a character can only use the abilities of two classes, they can use three passive abilities at a time from any class, leading to interesting combinations. Classes start generic-- Warrior, Scholar, and Scout are the opening options-- but become more diverse and complex with classes like the Enchanter, a hybrid caster/fighter class, and the Gatekeeper, a slow AOE caster that requires a lot of setup to unlock. Despite switching between classes, characters still feel more powerful over time through stronger items, more useful passive abilities, and permanent upgrades through skills. For example: one of the Scout passives allows the user to switch weapons for free, and crossbows typically require an action to reload. To avoid needing to reload, I had my Scout carry seven crossbows, switching them out after firing once for more damage.\n\nThe story starts with an interesting premise, but it's quickly made into a "find 4" quest and an endgame. However, the lore surrounding the world, while reasonably well-hidden, is interesting to discover. Don't expect the complexities of War of the Lions. The UI also has a couple strange quirks, and the base keybindings are kind of awful. These become less of an issue over time, but they're worth noting. There are also a couple glitches here and there--- the one that I noticed the most was an issue where I couldn't load the game from the title screen until I quit and reopened the game.\n\nOverall a very solid game. There are a couple of quirks, but the mechanics are solid and the game is short enough not to wear out its welcome.","February 14","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Basically binge-played it from start to finish.\n\nIt's a total gem. It has simple yet fun combat mechanics. Combat manages to be tactical while not being tedious or slow. It also has neat and (mostly) intuitive explorational mechanics which gives you multiple ways to get your party across terrain/interact with the game world (ie, you find thick foliage blocking your path - you can hack through it with a machete or just set it on fire with a fire spell. Find a river too wide to jump, so freeze a patch with ice magic if you have it. Etc.). I also found the story, though simple, to be well told. Well told enough, honestly, that I could have done with more.\n\nIn fact, if I have a complaint, it's that the neat explorational mechanics and the intriguing storytelling made me want more world to explore. Would love to have been able to go to more towns and get to a more open-world section to explore in a more freeform fashion. More dialogue, world building, yadda yadda. A lot to ask from a lone developer, but what it really means is that I really liked what I got and would like more of it please and thank you.\n\nGraphics are retro, yet retro in a way which is highly competent. The music similarly manages to be consistent in quality -- impressive for a game which seems to have been made pretty much entirely by one person.\n\nI hope this game gets the attention it deserves and you can make a bigger game along the same vein sometime in the future which I can buy.\n\nSeriously, well done.","December 14, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Try freezing it with ice magic, or breaking through the wall around it, or simply increasing your jump stat. Whatever you do to the world will affect combat as well, as there are no battle screen transitions.\n\nThe combat is solid, though you'll soon find your favorite tactics and likely stick to them through most of the game.

I could list all the stuff that they do down below in the description of the game, but I'd rather focus on stuff I've experienced so far.\n\nIt runs off of a 4 character party system that you can put whatever races you want in.  Want 4 humans, go for it?  Want diversity and each race, you can do that too.  You start with 3 classes, Warrior, Scout, and Scholar and you unlock several others throughout the game.  The first one I ended up unlocking was the rogue.  I earned this by gaining experience with one of the classes.  Once I had that unlocked, I was able to dual class with that character.\n\nThe combat is what you would expect in a turn based tactical strategy game, every turn and action is made up in "seconds" which determines turn order.  I really like how they've done the turn order in this game.  You have weapon specializations with different classes that improve their ability to use those weapons.  Like a rogue, for instance, is better at using daggers than any of the starting 3 classes.  The scholar has no weapon proficiency and relies more on magic.  That's not to say that you can't still use weapons you aren't particularly skilled at.  I like the weapon variety so far, most notably has been the crossbow and bow.  The crossbow you have to reload after every shot, whereas the bow you do not.  The trade off is that the crossbow DOES hit harder.  Honestly, I'm not too far in my Let's Play of the game, and so this is just off of my experience within the first hour or so of gameplay.  (I'm already a fan)\n\nMovement was a LITTLE bit weird at first, but you pick it up quickly, or at least I did.  I will say I am using a keyboard and mouse for this and haven't tried a controller.  You can move around with WASD or just the mouse and there are plenty of keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier.   However, if you are a fan of clicking on things to open inventory, use skills, or to fight with, you can do that as well.\n\nGraphics are really well done for the pixellated 16 bit style it's going for.  Things are definitive and clear, a chair looks like  a chair, a bed looks like a bed.  You get the idea.  An added bonus is that all the items you equip on your characters DO actually show up on the characters.  Some people love "retro graphics", some people hate them, others simply don't care.  I personally think there are times when it takes away from a game, and times when it doesn't.  Honestly, I really feel that it works fantastically with this game and I really prefer it to the cookie cutter RPG maker characters that could have been.  :)\n\nIf you enjoyed Shining Force 1 & 2, The Fire Emblem Games, Final Fantasy: Tactics or more recently, a rare gem Telepath Tactics, this game SHOULD really be up your alley.  The only thing I'd say negatively about this game is a preference issue as opposed to a true con.  I would have loved this game to be a bit more like Final Fantasy: Tactics, or the Shining Force games in regards to more units in your party.   You create your party of 4 and, to my knowledge, that's it.  Now, you can change their classes over and over, and learn different skills and what not, but I think your "4" are with you the whole game.  Now that's fine and honestly in Final Fantasy Tactics, you probably only used 5-6 non-story characters anyway.  Still I enjoy having a party of 10-20 and only being able to field 5-12 in any given mission.  It just makes the battles a bit more dynamic, feel a bit larger, and it adds to the replayability, in my opinion.  Still...please be aware this is a preference *I* have and it's not really a con.  As it stands, the 4 character party system DOES work well and I am still 100% loving Voidspire Tactics.\n\nMy final verdict is you should check out the game, read the reviews, research it, watch some gameplay and decide for yourselves.  I PERSONALLY love it and any turn based tactical strategy RPG fan should go buy this immediately.  For a 1 man studio, this game is miles ahead of lot of other stuff out there.  Seriously, check it out and if you are on the fence GO BUY IT NOW!  :D","November 9, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
