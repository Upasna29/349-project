A young boy named Eldin makes an appearance and - after becoming confused - Therese and he subsequently strive to make sense of their predicament.\nThere is a confounding mystery to be hashed out, but the majority of the story is of the interactions between two (almost) strangers; of the bonds that can form in no time.\n\nPart Two opens with a promise and a preamble.\nTherese awakes in some sort of classical-yet-modern manor, agitated at not knowing where, why, how. A young boy named Eldin makes an appearance and - after becoming disturbed - Therese and he subsequently strive to make their way out of their predicament.\nThere is a suspicious conspiracy to be hashed out, but the majority of the story is of the interactions between two (almost) strangers; of the love that can seem otherwise.\n\n\nThe art is well-done. There is a stark contrast between some of it; it's obvious that those (background) images that are of lesser quality were made to appear as such for atmosphere. How? "View full-size version in browser" for the first advertised image.\n\nAs for the writing, other than a few absent apostrophes and commas, one use of an incorrect homonym, and one misspelling ("breath" for "breathe") - it's perfect English (as I know it at least, fer wutever dats werff). There is a good deal of stuttering ("A-are..." "E-Eldin..." etc.), if that grinds your gears.\n\nThe story is great. Will not spoil more'n I already have.\n\nThe soundtrack is the worst part of the game. Any collection of sounds confined to seperate "tracks" is owed the title, but I didn't consider the majority of what I heard to be a sampling of a soundtrack; ambience that will either hit you as spot-on or make you wince a bit. To be sure, there is some music and I enjoyed what of it I heard; the music obeys the tone and gestures of the characters (i.e. abrupt or no transitions) and most of the sound will be of the eerie-but-maybe-annoying ambience. And that's just a personal problem, as my ears are sensitive; isn't even the loud noises that bother me, I guess just the pitch of the chanting - crackled in my earholes, yo.\n\nI recommend this game; I think the asking price is fair.\n\nEDIT:\nI played Part One twice; Part Two once. Read at my own pace (moderately fast(?)): 57 minutes.\nWill probably play through again at least once more.\nI would advise saving often, maybe when you hear the music change, just because there are several save slots, and some of the text is skip-worthy after having read twice, but some is worth re- and rereading. And you never know when those bits will come up.","August 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

This two-part "Novel" is a short story at best, the art is simple but effective, and so are the sounds and music, but the storytelling doesn't seem to go beyond common tropes.\n\nThis game is 3:4 and scales seamlessly to any resolution, adding black bars if needed.\n\nIt would be an ok VN if it was free, but instead for paying what feels like watching someone else play an adventure game, you could pick up an actual adventure and play that for more bang for the buck (Betrayer is on sale this week).","September 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

It's a short kinetic novel and quite an interesting one. First thing that startled me in the menu was "Begin Game"and "Begin Part Two". When I played the first part, I didn't realize that it was on the loop after a certain scene. So I was skipping it like an imbecile for at last 2 minutes straight. I was confused. Only then I remembered there is a part two. That was unnecessary. The whole idea of it is not new but the characters and the whole situation made it interesting.  I would have never guessed that Eldin is 10 years old. The way he talks and acts (not to talk about his body build). Unique art style and the animations are over the top. I've never seen anything quite like this in a visual novel before. It's a really nice touch. Too bad this beaut didn't last long. It kept me thinking when I was done with it. Since there's no ending and there's no actual beginning, it'll be a real shame to close the case when it's unfinished. All in all it's a good kinetic novel and I'd love to learn more about the characters; about the mad older sibling and the different reality.","September 14, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","2"

I'm not interested in dating sims / otome, and I'm not interested in hentai or anything explicit.  What I *am* interested in is a good story / good storytelling.  An emotional journey.  Interesting characters.  That kind of stuff.  So it seems like there should be VNs out there that have the great story/characters, without some of the other stuff that gets a lot of attention.  Oh, and I also didn't  want a game where you had to play it a dozen times to get all of the endings (and achievements).\n\nSo that brought me to this game, which (after being bundled) seemed like a low-cost entry into the genre and didn't have any of the obvious things I avoid.\n\nUnfortunately, this game at least didn't work for me.\n\nFor one thing, as some have pointed out, it doesn't have choices, it's pretty much just click-to-read.  Maybe if I'd realized that in advance, I wouldn't have been surprised / put off by it.  Some of the story was interesting enough.  The premise and subject matter was good.  The most frustrating part was that there are two "parts" of the story, but they are not connected in-game.  It's like you have to know you've done all you can in Part 1, then exit and start Part 2 to continue.  There wasn't a way to connect them in the game itself?  The result was that I was scrambling around for a LONG time (check out my playtime) trying to figure out what to do to continue the story.  The answer, it turned out, was to exit and start Part 2.  Meh.\n\nAnyway, I know this game isn't a crowning achievement of VNs, and maybe not the best introduction to the genre, but I can't really recommend it unless, I don't know, you've played all the VNs out there and noticed that you missed this one.","November 24, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

That is not to say that the author didn't work hard on this and doesn't deserve the asked price for such a great; artistic novel, but to say that the work is entirely too short for something that I re-read and still don't have an hour's worth of gameplay. I've played many visual novels and I think even a dollar less would be an improvement.\n\nAs for the story, I had seen the likes of it a few times before as an avid anime fan. However, there were a couple tricks I hadn't seen coming that I greatly appreciated. I loved the tone and as I said before, the artwork is just amazing I couldn't ask for more there. I'm wondering if perhaps there is more to this story yet to be added or if this is all that will be given.\n\nI really hope there will be something added onto this work, as I found myself really getting and loving the story only to be left at the end wanting for more. My only hope is that there will be a continued piece or maybe another story by the author. I'm now a great fan of their works and will definitely buy more-specifically if they had the same horror-undertones as this novel.\n\nAlso the sound effects and music just matched perfectly! I'm so happy with my purchase because I got to see all this amazingness but I'm sad it ended too soon. (As I've already said many times in this rambling review.)\n\nGREAT WORK! Recommended if you've got the money to spend for something beautiful. Not if you are running low on funds and are looking for something long. However, it does have some replay value if only because you're left desperate for more!","August 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Also take in consideration that this is a not a game, but a linear visual novel. So if you buy it as a game you risk to be upset, but if you buy this for the story, it is an interesting one, but it's very short, so be aware!\n\nFor its price it still totally worth the buy.","April 16","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like short visual novels. If Two Steps Back were a free VN, I wouldn't have anything bad to say about it. The art and music are used effectively, and (although I'm not sure if this was intentional) the freakish animations help set the mood. The story and character development are insubstantial, but as a short horror story it works well enough.\n\nBut for a commercial release, I expect better effort when it comes to programming and UI design. The first part of the story ends in a repeating loop, at which point you're supposed to go back to the menu and start Part 2. There's no reason for this. Why not add unlockable choices to find your way to Part 2 from Part 1? Why not leave Part 2 locked until you've read Part 1, and then give some in-game indication that you should go back? Why not do literally anything else but leave Part 2 accessible from the beginning with a fourth wall breaking note that you should read Part 1 first? That's not just bad design; it's actively lazy. So is using the default Ren'Py UI.\n\nI want to see more visual novels on Steam, so I hate giving one a negative review. But I really can't recommend Two Steps Back unless the designer gives it some serious polish.","September 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is probably the 'game' I liked least this year.\n\nSo, why?\n\nThere is exactly one puzzle to solve in this game.  The puzzle?  The fact that you have to quit out of the first part of the game, to start the second part of the game.  With the game giving you a warning that you should 'finish part one' first, even though there's nothing to 'finish' -- aside from getting into the endless loop.\n\nThe story started off cryptic and interesting.  Honestly, I was expecting something like 9-9-9 / Zero Escape here.  The theme could have been used well.  Instead, it was wasted.\n\nThere are literally no choices in the game.  And, realistically, there is no *ending* to the game.  Nothing is resolved, because the entire concept is an endless loop.  That means that the entire game is one big tease.  You're left with questions,\n\nUltimately, this is not a game.  It's not even like 9-9-9 on the iOS, where you make a few branching path choices...because there's no choice the player ever makes in the game.  *YOU* are not wanted here, aside from as an observer.\n\nI'm glad I got this game as part of a bundle, because I can't condone paying for it.","November 26, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
