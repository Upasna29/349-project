I am a refugee from EVE... in that I cannot take the community anymore. I blame it more on myslef in that I am older and the crowd playing EVE seems much younger than me. I don't mind the Players who pirate as much as the restt of the players. Having said that I read that this game was EVE light so I gave it a try for $10. I love it. I currently have it set fairly easy so I can learn it. Mining is cool, and with a small ship can be a little complex - in that you might not have enough power to fill your cargo hold and then have to stop mining while your charge rebuilds. Bigger ships have less of a problem. I had no problem killing the local rats in either system I have been in and have been able to buy a frigate to mine and explore in. Have had more fun in this game in 2.5 hours than I had last time I played EVE.  Graphics are ok.  It is a point and click/ menu driven game. My opinion, and to me that is good.  If you like space games like EVE, but would prefer a single player experience - got this game.","December 15, 2015","true","9.9"," 111 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","111","120","0","0"

The comparisons are hard not to make given the art direction and user experience of this game, but remember -- EVE Online is a massive undertaking by hundreds of people and tens of thousands of hours of effort, and this game is but a mere hint of a shadow of the things that are in that game.\n\nThat being said, this is a GREAT game for what it is, and it's reasonably priced even keeping its limited scope in mind.\n\nIt DOES have the feel of EVE Online in some respects.  The gameplay is very similar to your first few hours of cargo hauling or mining in EVE Online, but there it ends.   EVE gives you the complexity of a rich storyline, faction reputations, a complex and meaningful exploration option, and NPC pirates that make relatively smart decisions on their own - not to mention the multiplayer aspects of EVE that truly make that game great.\n\nThis game lacks all of those things, but what it does deliver on is rather enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThis game would be like never getting past high-sec ferry missions and mining in EVE Online, but if that is what you are after (and sometimes I am) this is perfect.  While the complexity is not high and there are no other players to play with, sometimes that is the perfect thing.  There are no disgusting conversations in global chat.  There is no griefing.  You are free to be as slow and deliberate as you want to be.  The danger from moving into a new system is predictable and scales slowly, and once you clear a sector, you are pretty much completely safe there to mine as much as you like.  You don't have to fear walking away from the keyboard for a few minutes here and there.\n\nI played EVE for years.  I'd often sit in 0.0 space, deep within my alliance's territory, and just mine the rocks.  It was soothing.  It was easy.  There was very little danger.  Then someone forgot to pay a bill and things went upside down quickly.  It was fantastic.  It was a worldwide event that affected hundreds of thousands of people, and I will never forget it, but the days when I can just sit back and accomplish things for my alliance while streaming netflix on the other monitor are over for me in EVE and have been for some time.\n\nThis game gives me the ability to do something very similar.  I do miss the alliance chat and the fact that every once in a while we'd get attacked by other thinking humans to spice things up - which is something that you do not get with Astrox - but this does fill a desire when I want to just relax and pretend to be a space miner.\n\nIf you are a recovering EVE carebear, or even an old-school EVE player who enjoyed more than just the multiplayer aspects of the game, then I would recommend this game highly.\n\nIf you are a recovering EVE rifter jockey who loves the thrill of the hunt, this game is not for you, but it's still a great game and it might even be worth checking out - it made me somewhat nostalgic for my early days in EVE.\n\n","January 26","true","39.3"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","52","62","2","0"

But I don't want to get ahead of myself.\n\nHere is the premise:\nYou spawn in a customizable universe in a small scout ship, just like a Frigate from Eve.\nYou have different slots for your ship, for weapons, afterburners and the like.\nNow you can makeyour way up the ranks while defeating pirates or engaging in PvA (Player vs. Asteroid).\n\nI find that mining plays a way too little role in the game. It's a good moneymaker and you can buy good weapons pretty fast and you need them. If you defeat Officers, they drop even better modules, just like in Eve with the Officer modules.\nBut it would be better if you would need to craft everything yourself. Right now, mining is only needed for upgrading your weapons and modules, which costs tremendous amounts of material. But why upgrade? There isn't much in the game to do. After you played through your initial universe, you have seen everything. There is nothing left.\n\nThe game is comfy, but not very engaging.\n\nNow the bad part is, if you have multiple ships (which you should due to different bonuses), managing them is a pain in the butt.\n\nEverytime you buy a scout to get your other ship over to your new station, the other ship in your hangar gets unfitted and all modules are returned to your garage. Why? Also, if you switch from a big ship to a Scout and back, you lost all fuel on that ship since the fuel seems to be tied to the player instead of the ship. That is very weird and costs a lot of money.\n\nAs I said the game is comfy to play, but that is not enough to really recommend it at this point.\nMissing content, little annoyances all over the place makes it not really nice to play.\nSorry.","May 3","false","10.6"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

It's not the sexy feature rich game on the scale of EVE, and the comparisons to EVE can't be avoided, because it plays a lot like it.  But its damn fun for what it is.\n\nYou create your name, pick an avatar portrait, configure very modular difficulty/galaxy properties, press play.  The galaxy is randomly generated.  There is a short simple surprisingly useful tutorial that is skippable, and you're on your way.  You mine asteroids, kill pirates, run missions, upgrade your ship and components along way.  You're a prisoner in a section of space essentially slaving to make money for the Corporate Government that put you there.  It's  a lawless zone with rules.\n\nThey way you move from one sector to the next farming, killing, looting, questing each sector with harder pirates to kill, cheif among them being an officer pirate, or even a pirate base.  It feels also like a dungeon crawl in some ways.  Which inevitably makes it feel repetative, but that's where all games end up eventually.\n\nBut, more features are coming, and I expect this labor of love will see continued development.  I think the Dev understands what makes games like this fun.  I've already got more than my $10 worth at 22 hours, and I'm nowhere near bored with it.  The only problem I see in its future is that unlike EVE with the MMO player presence, a single player game requires believable AI, and meaningful interaction with it, as well as a very well paced and balanced progression.  He doesn't have everything quite fleshed out yet, like the leveling and skill point system seems a bit clumsy.  A lot of missions early on aren't worth the time, unless you up the mission rewards in the diff settings, but that makes the good missions way too rewarding.  Fuel system needs more thought IMHO.  Just little things that don't break the game at all, they just need some balance here, some polish there....\n\nBottom line. I hope people buy this game.  I'm glad I did.","December 11, 2015","true","195.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I'll start by confessing that I haven't played EVE (I was interested, but figured I was too late to the party), and I haven't played this game very long (it was unbearable). That being said, I'd hardly call this a game; games are supposed to involve at least some element of fun!\n\nSo far this has been my introduction to the game:\n1. Here is your ship, and here is a space station. To go to the space station, click on it and sit waiting while your ship travels there on autopilot. (Alternatively, you can turn autopilot off and just hold the 'forward' button)\n2. Now that you're on the space station you can buy a few upgrades to your ship: basically weapons, a bigger cargo hold, fuel, and tools to help you mine. Not as good as it sounds.\n3. Ready to start earning? Go mine an asteroid, (i.e. click on it and wait for your ship to travel there on auto-pilot, or hold 'forward' for two minutes).\n4. Now you're at the asteroid, click to mine it. And watch and wait... for about a minute or so while your ship shows a basic mining graphic. (Such fun!)\n5. Done. Now click back on the space station, and wait a couple more minutes for your ship to get there, etc.\n6. Next we're gonna fight some space pirates! See those red dots? Click on one of them. Now you'll have to wait about five minutes for your ship to get there. Then your ship will automatically engage and kill those dots. Wow, that was great wasn't it. Now it'll take you another five minutes to return to the space stat...zzz\n7. 10 minutes later... more pirates and an officer this time. Now watch while your cruddy ship pew-pews those red dots. (Again, you can turn off autopilot, but what's the point?)\n8. Done. Now you get to watch for another five minutes while your ship slooooowly travels back to the space station.\n9. Next task: more mining.... only this time it will take five times as long. But you'll get more money! That money will allow you to mine more efficiently or fight space pirates more....\n\n... is this what my life has come to?

Really automated!!\n5) It's perfect to watch a movie or browse the web and play in a window.\n6) Not a twitch style game at all. So if you want some crazy fast paced space shooter, this really isn't that kind of game. It's more like a very cool Space Solitaire.\n\nIf you like EVE for the carebear side of the game with upgrading and trying out new ships, you will really enjoy this very inexpensive game. It's not as deep as EVE, but it's still fun and I think the dev is on the right track.\n\n\nWARNING: Don't make the game too easy with the custom levels. It's best to make it a bit harder since it's only about 100 sector maps to play through. You're game play through will be more enjoyable and it will hold a value longer.\n\nI really don't have any negatives since it's a low cost fun PVE game with decent graphics (not great, but passing).\n\n+1 for the DEV...\n\nThis is one of those, support the developer and get something back - type of situations . This game won't bring you thousands of hours of game play at this stage, but the 50 hours you will play, will be a fun time and it will be clear you're helping get a good programmer started in the industry.","January 9","true","42.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's a simple game.  And, if you're into what it's selling - which I am! - it's quite fun and relaxing.\n\nThe only space sim I've ever played is Elite: Dangerous (so, not an EVE player here!), in which I tended to do a lot of mining, trading, and pirate hunting.  Astrox has all three of these activities - including jobs ("quests" in a sense) - albeit on a far less high tech level.  Regardless, I've found it intensely enjoyable to go through the somewhat repetative gameplay, which is changed up by increasingly more difficult pirate battles, and the "Oooo shiny!" moments of upgrading the ships, or landing a character level up.\n\nThis wonderful little Diamond in the Rough may not have the crazy, amazing visuals of big title games - such as the aforementioned Elite: Dangerous - but I still found it just as amusing to play!\n\nI'm the kind of person that takes something for what it is, and Astrox is what it is: A Space Excavation game put together by one individual with a lot of passion.\n\nI am loving this game and I'm looking forward to playing more, which I'm about to do right now.\n\nProps to the Dev.  I can't wait to see where Astrox is going!\n\nBest $10 I've spent this year (and, of course, I'm the one who bought the game hours before it went on sale!!!  LOL).

First of all, options. If you ever wanted the ability to take EVE and remove everything you didn't like, well this is basically your chance.\n\nI personally always wanted an Eve-like where I could just mine in peace. I wanted to gather when I wanted to, and go looking for a fight when I was bored or in the mood to lose a ship. Eve failed here, Astrox did not.\n\nIn my 6 hour session, I was able (with the settings I had configured) to advance to the second best mining ship and secure 10 sectors of the 100 for safe mining. I very much enjoyed the process and was never at any point overly stressed about combat, in game grinds, or anything really. I took my time and found everything obvious or well explained.\n\nThe game is simple, but well done. There is enough depth, but after what I've seen I dont expect to find much more. Where this game really shines is in the easily configured gameplay, really letting you choose how you want to play before you even start. 3100 asteroids mined as victory condition might have been a bad first map, but I will most likely be back to complete it anyway.\n\nI very much recommend picking this up now, not only because its on sale - but because the dev is great (see forums) and the game only needs steam achievements and fleets (rather than single ship) to be perfect in my eyes.","December 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","3"

This also makes it to when you have a basic ship you can make changes to it to help with what ever you are currently working on.\n\nSo far I have enjoyed the time and would recommend this game to just about anyone.\n\nCONS: Minging/fighting is just your ship flying over to something and after you click on it it shoots and kills it. Mining and fighitng are no different really. The only thing different is when fighting they shoot back.\n\nLanding/Docking When you land or dock it is nothing more than a fade out/fade in and then you are in the docking bay. Same thing every time. Kinda gets boring after a while.\n\nPros: When you get board of manually controlling your ship or doing the same things over and over again you can auto pilot most things with the click of the button. What I liked the most about this was that when you advance into the game you have the ability to forget about some of the simpilar things and automate them.\n\nGraphics: The backdrops and details of the game are pretty well done and I appreciate the apparent time that was taken in making it a lovely game to look at.","January 3","true","346.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are some skills to learn and improve, component upgrades to figure out, and rare looted components, but not close to the depth of JtL's looting and reverse engineering. Graphics are simple but well done and controls are well-thought out.\n\nIn its current state, Astrox is probably the type of game I'll play occasionally when I have a couple hours to spare and don't want to get stressed out.

Each ship (as Eve online) have their personal bonuses which gives you a hint of what the ship was made for.\n\nNow, you can mine (which is basicly what you should do to get money), kill the pirates that are in each system (they dont respawn quickly unless you alter that in the settings when starting the game) and trade. That's pretty much it. And despite the 'lack' of things to do, the mining part of the game is the most relaxing thing i've done in awhile (23 hours after all).\n\nNow, what I would want for this game: Expand the ship list, alter the appearance of the ships that exist (They all look so similar that I forget what the hell im piloting) and expand nummer of systems that can be made (more then a hundred would be nice). I could have blasted my way to 100 by now if I wasn't determined to mine in each system.\n\nIt's a great game and I look forward to seeing what the Dev will be able to make with it.\n\n","January 20","true","23.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you want to try before you buy, check out the limited version on Kongregate: http://www.kongregate.com/games/momoguru/astrox.\n\nThis kongregate version hit the limits imposed by Kongregate some time ago, and is a little dated, but the steam version is still being updated and is growing continously.\n\nAstrox is easily one of the most entertaining casual games in my extensive collection. The gameplay is smooth and simple, while still allowing for a large variety of game play styles and approaches, and there is no hard limit to your potential for growth, just those imposed by your patience and carelessness. In Astrox, you are your own worst enemy (most of my deaths have been due to rushing or carelessness, but that's often just as thrilling as it sounds!)\n\nEach "new game" (and new game plus) has an insane amount of customization for the universe created, allowing for incredible amounts of replayability, and alot of customization to make the game ideal for your goals and gaming preferences.\n\nThe developer is quite active and responsive to feedback. The game has grown considerably over its life, and continues to do so.\n\nOh yeah, and the graphics are gorgeous and the price is a steal! I played extensively on Kongregate, as well as the Steam version, and have never regretted my purchase for a moment!","February 24","true","40.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I.e. suddenly getting 30 million for a mission, when I cant even afford a 5 million ship, made me move from like one of the smaller corvette class ships, to the biggest, baddest ship out there. And then loot was just overflowing.\n\nFeedback to developer:\n- With some tuning of the drops, missions etc. it will become even better.\n- Make it possible to see the station overview where you have resources or ships stored, with the # of systems/stations, it is impossible to keep track of unless you have a notepad whilst playing.\n\n\n","March 8","true","49.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The "inmate" background makes no sense considering this is a capitalist/tycoon game. The tutorial is basically the entire story.\nLittle to no replay value.\nSome of the sectors have intense red sections which can give you a headache.\nManual control of ship is almost impossible as without autopilot the ship will not maneuver in any reasonable fashion. So there goes my little fantasy of being a freestyle pilot.\nAutopilot will not navigate around asteroids and instead run into them repeatedly.\nPirates are little more than a nuisance.\nNo pause game, so if you take a pee break there is a chance you'll die.\n\nHonestly it just fell short in my opinion.
