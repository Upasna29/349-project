This typically requires that they be very simplistic, linear, and have a very narrow scope, the same features that allow Donald Trump to keep running for President.\n\nThis type of game has certainly enjoyed a resurgence lately.  I say resurgence because idle games have been around for a very long time.  Longer than video games for sure.  Idle games go back about as far as humanity, with discoveries by archaeologists revealing many of the idle games early humans played, such as "Is the tiger still in front of the cave?", and ones that have been played for thousands of years, like "Grow crops in the desert".\n\nThe idle games of our ancestors have about as much relevance to our lives as the presidential bids of the aforementioned Donald however, so let us move on to Time Clickers, which in case you have forgotten, is the game I am currently reviewing.\n\nAhem.  Oddly enough, Time Clickers comes along during a large spike in idle game releases, following such titles as Clicker Heroes, Adventure Capitalist, Wacky Clicky Whatever ♥♥♥♥ It, and FarCry 4.  So what does Time Clickers bring to the table that no one else has?  Seriously, the table is getting kinda crowded.  I tried to eat my cereal this morning and had to keep brushing aside power-ups the whole time.\n\nTime Clickers does, as the name implies, let you spend all of your time clicking enemies, so does every other idle game.  You can also spend your resources to hire and upgrade minions to do the clicking for you, and so does every other idle game.  You can "ascend", and start over while earning a sort of meta-currency to spend on permanent upgrades, and, yeah, so does every other idle game.  Honestly, I'm not having much luck finding any unique features in Time Clickers, so lets just move on, shall we.\n\nThe graphics are pretty cool, and are probably the only reason I'm playing it now after getting burned out on other, pretty much identical games.  Time Clickers just looks nice, and the cubes that make up the enemies are animated enough to make it feel like something is happening, so it feels a bit less, um, idly?  Sometimes, if I'm really getting immersed in the game, I like to pretend that the cubes are cylinders, but that's just the creative sort of person I am.\n\nI suppose I recommend Time Clickers, because it can entertain you for a while, and it costs nothing, but it's not the sort of hearty recommendation I would give to a game like Fallout 4, which isn't even out yet.  Idle games just aren't for everyone, but then again neither is Donald Trump, so what the heck.  Time Clickers for President!","July 23, 2015","true","79.4"," 685 of 781 people (88%) found this review helpful 855 people found this review funny","88","685","781","855","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/385770/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: The best of the idle/clicker games on Steam so far.\n\nThe infamous casual genre of clicker games emerged on Steam during the year of 2015. Time Clickers was one of the big three, accompanied by Clicker Heroes and Tap Tap Infinity.\n\nI started playing all of them solely because of their supposedly "easy" yet time consuming achievements. Being a simple genre, I will proceed to shamelessly compare it to these two during the course of this review.\n\nBasic features\nIn all clicker games you get to click a lot or if you don't like that, develop an idle build or start using autoclickers to do your bidding. Time Clickers is no different in that respect. What sets it apart from other clicker games is the form of MacGuffins, since they are abstract, different coloured blocks that you have to actually aim to click and shoot. By shooting and destroying blocks you get gold that gets you upgrades to destroy stronger blocks. Continue ad nauseaum, or until you have all the achievements.\n\nSoon you get to hire "a team" that automatically shoots blocks. Pistols, flak guns, spread rifles, rocket launchers and particle balls have slightly different shooting mechanisms and patterns each but they all boil down to dealing damage to a bunch of blocks. You can upgrade them in tiers to shoot faster, with more damage or towards a larger number of blocks. There's also a set of skills to buy with various effects to use.\n\nLike usual when the game is closed, the cool-downs of the skills count down and your team accumulates gold for you. It has become a standard feature in idle games but it's still useful to mention.\n\nTowards the mid-game\nAscension is usual in clicker games and Time Clickers is no different. Collecting time cubes from boss levels will make you stronger once you time warp (i.e. start over). Time cubes can be used to buy upgrades to your team, clicking power and skills as well as meta powers like starting wave and increasing the probability of time cubes. It's slightly slower to get your first time cubes than in other clicker games because of the aiming requirement (though the game contains an idle mode where the click guns slowly aim towards blocks).\n\nWhat sets Time Clickers apart from other clicker games is that Time Cubes are not spent but provide you bonus damage even after being used. You can also re-spec any number of times without cost. Every click is a shot so the idle mode can be useful when exploring the user interface checking out all the upgrades and stats. Finally, the game even lacks an in-game store rendering it the most generous free clicker game at least on Steam (I hear the mobile version has some ads).\n\nOnce you hit wave 1000 the game changes introducing additional variety of "ascension powers" called Weapon Cubes (though you don't need to time warp to use them). They exclusively increase your clicking powers and curiously enough also introduce an in-game constant autoclicker.\n\nThey will also grant you an ability to dual-wield other weapons beside your trusty click pistol, which gets ridiculous or hilarious (depending on your stance) when you get the third one and start the trial-wielding routine.\n\nLate-game\nIt's a long, long game to beat. The way the team upgrades are structured causes the game to stall for a (sometimes long) while at every 500 team levels, before taking a huge boost when upgrading team members to next Spec Ops levels. Then again you can just use skills (often the only way to proceed at that point) and come back when they cool down.\n\nTo get through this stage it is necessary to either wait and farm gold for a long time OR wait and farm time and weapon cubes for equally long time. I chose to do the latter.\n\nThe completion took me some whopping 1350 hours, and even with all the pre-farming for cubes the last push to wave 4000 took 10 days of grinding and stockpiling Dimension Shifts (game's equivalent of run-specific cumulative bonus skill similar to Dark Ritual in Clicker Heroes). There are few late game upgrades that are worthwhile so unfortunately a deep run with Dimension Shifts seems like the only viable option to advance to the end. Though supposedly you could even do it without farming massive amounts of cubes first.\n\nConclusions\nDevelopers have supported the game excellently, providing both balance updates, new mechanics (like the Weapon Cubes) and seasonal events to spice it up. Despite the end-game stall the Weapon Cubes manage to keep the late game interesting for a long time.\n\nBefore concluding, I'd like to commend the techno-music that accompanies the game. I kept listening to it longer than I like to admit. However, like with other idling games I eventually muted it.\n\nSpectacularly, I have found that I like playing Time Clickers, a game of a genre I find ridiculous as even casual games go. I particularly enjoy the farming. I find myself leaving it running when going to sleep just to stockpile some more cubes for the next ridiculously expensive upgrade that still remains unacquired.\n\nIndeed, weirdly enough I totally approve of Time Clickers. For that: Well done, Proton Studio!","January 11","true","854.9"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","34","40","6","3"

Just a small thing i really liked about Clicker heroes, but i guess to some extent it wouldn't suit the whole "wave" system they have in place where you need to destroy a certain amount of cubic structures to progress to the next one and each 5 waves, you must fight a boss to progress to the next, but you do have the ability to go back to the previous wave in order to earn gold to be able to break the boss before the timer ends. I haven't found this useful most of the time, since you do receive gold from some of the other easier to break blocks that i have mostly found myself just using those to strengthen my team and increase dps and dmg per click.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Its free, you do not need to pay to play the game nor are you able to purchase something in game as you play. No\nability to purchase gold, none of that crap. You wont think you're playing a free to play game that there's no need to\npay for anything, but yet get the feeling as if its being forced on you, in order to progress in the game.\n\n-A great "Time Cube" feature, that adds cubes to the game which you are able to collect once you've reached wave\n100, but they don't make it easy, they set a challenge in-front. In order to use these cubes, you must use "Time Warp"\nwhich resets your progress and then you'll receive your cubes, along with 10%+ dps for each cube. You will be given 10\ncubes when you reach wave 100, but to get more you'll have to progress and fight more bosses which sometimes have\nthese "Time Cube" cubes. These cubes can be used to purchase artifacts once you've used the "Time Warp" which can\ngive you a nice but balanced game changing advantage. I recommend using "Time Warp" at least once while playing.\n\n-A nice organized five "bots" system i guess i could call them that are referred to as your "team", rather then having\naround 10 that you will have to upgrade. You will only have to focus on five of them, along with upgrading your\nclicks(there's a limit that you'll reach quite quickly, but you get more dmg per click as you upgrade your team) and\nabilities that are purchasable which come with cooldowns.\n\n-There's a leaderboard which requires you to register on their website and pair your game with the account, but luckily\nits a very easy process. So if you're interested in being listed on their leaderboards, you can easily do so.\n\n-Nice bright colors to keep you awake, along with some nice effects to go along with it.\n\nThere are many more, but you'll just have to try it and find out :)\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Like i said before, there's the wave system which i would love to be able to change to waves i've finished. Its not a big\ngame changer to be honest.\n\n-While i was playing i noticed some frame drops which have stopped after some time, they don't really ruin the\ngameplay, but definitely something to take note of, as i am not running this on a bad computer that shouldn't easily run\nthe game. Then again, this issue might just be occurring on my PC.\n\nAs a conclusion, if you like addictive clicker games, this is what you need. The wave and Time Cube aspect of it, just opens up almost an unlimited number of playtime hours if you wish to progress in the game further!\n\n\n\n\n\n~RedWingz\n","July 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","30","34","6","0"

I played "Adventure Capitalist" and the "Cookie Clicker" like games for a while but quickly lost interest.  I think the reason for this was lack of player interaction.  I felt like I am better off just not playing the game and farming.  Now, THIS game.  This game is in a way absolutely BRILLIANT.  Sure, it gets coins for you while you are gone but when you are playing you are given a gun you can ACTUALLY aim with!  Fancy that!  Even with tons of upgrades alot of bosses CAN'T be killed without actually getting in the firefight, which entices players to play more.  I HATE time waster games normally because they are 99% of the time riddled with microtransactions or just sophomorically made.  Thankfully "Time Clicker" possesses none of those traits.  ZERO microtransactions, this game is actually\n\n100% FREE\n\nIt also has a cloud save system so you can play on the go on your Android or iOS device.  The soundtrack is pretty fun too.

I just think that if you're going to play it, you deserve a fair warning.\n\nTime Clickers is an "idle game", in the strictest sense of the word. But, if you've come here looking for a better Adventure Capitalist, you've come to the wrong place.\n\nSee, most idle games have walls. Walls where you can safely say "Okay, I'm not really making much progress by watching these numbers go up. I'll shut the game down for right now, go do other things, and come back in a few hours to progress again". In other idle games, after the easy beginning, these walls come a few minutes in. They only demand a few minutes of your time before it's safe to go back to the outside world. Not Time Clickers.\n\nI have 16 hours of playtime in my profile right now, and that's NOT "leave it running in the background while ignoring" time. SOME of it is, but not a lot. Time Clickers requires oversight to make progress. How it works is, you have to kill 10 enemies (the enemies being somewhat more complex than Clicker Heroes' enemies, but not by much), and then you advance to the next wave, with a boss every 5 waves. However, if you want to do anything efficiently, the game requires you to oversee this process of destruction, and leveling up your team members or risk having them being incapable of fighting the enemies. Making progress requires checking up on the game-at minimum-every few minutes, to either help your team get past a boss or spend the gold they've earned.\n\nYou'll never reach a point where it's better to just shut the game off and come back after a good night's sleep. Never reach a point where you can say "Okay, time to go do something else now".\n\nAs with every other Clicker game ever, you have to reset eventually to make any real progress, but it can potentially take hours to catch up to where you were even with your new bonuses. Resetting feels like a big decision, but the bonuses are simultaneously necessary while also feeling like they aren't really enough to justify it.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, and MIGHT be a good game for you, IF you have a lot of free time to invest in it. If you don't, leave now. Save yourself.\n\nESCAPE. PLEASE. YOU CAN GO, BUT IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT, THERE IS NO GOING BACK.","April 4","false","41.1"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","26","30","3","3"

I know I'm first in line.\nThat Clicker Heroes is a flash game and this one is made in Unity is about the only difference between the two, so don't expect anything revolutionary.\n\nThe only downside I could find is that Time Clickers is even more luck-based than any other title in the genre I played, with beating a boss stage often hinging on getting a random gold drop that suddenly allows you to triple your DPS. I'd prefer the game to be slightly more about picking upgrades cleverly than hoping for a kind RNG.","August 5, 2015","true","78.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here's why.\n\n1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.\nSo when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a "Shot". (Yes, that was a pun).\n\n2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.\n\n3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!\n\nSo in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time!

It advertises itself as a game that can be played in the background while your playing other games. This is both true and misleading. While it is true that you can flick the game in the back ground and have it work for you while your not looking at it, the game is designed so that your ai stand in constantly needs your helping hand. It seems your ai will never be smart enough to know how to get past the next boss.\n\nConcept: Basically your there to wage war against cubes with health that do nothing more than just stand there and look cube like. You have 5 ai's at your disposal to help you shredder these cubes. These cubes dont fight back, they dont move, they are just in the way of you getting to the next level. Every 10 levels you will come across a boss every 5 levels a mini boss. The only thing that makes these things slightly harder is that they are accompanied by a time line needing to be met if you are to destroy them. If you fail to destroy them in the time necessary don't worry about it the timer will respawn and the boss will respawn as it did to begin with. Hence the only thing you need to do is buy and upgrade weapons and thats it. You don't even need to aim.\n\nAfter you have reached level 100 you will have access to 10 time cubes which you can spend on a time cube skill tree which means restarting from the beginning again or you can go further after you have passed level 100 and try and collect as many time cubes as possible. So with all that in mind what is the point of all this? There isnt any. Its a complete time waster. By no means does this mean that it is a bad product though. Its very colorful and vibrant in fact with all the explosions and gold coins flying around you will feel like you have just witnessed a rocket launcher going off  at a casino.\n\nIt could have been enhanced to be more of a meaningful game such as making a co-op mode or even having the blocks move and have defense mechanism's or even having a consequence when you fail other than the boring yawn restart and do it again.\n\nStill it's the first time i've ever played a game where a cube with a quinttrillion health points blocks my access from the next level, no need to panic though it seems my pistol does 1quintzillion damage points and the next upgrade contains a number too large for my brain to comprehend.","August 30, 2015","true","260.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

While it isn't the first game to institute "clicker instances" or artifacts where you can sacrifice DPS for unique effects, it is interesting that it managed to translate a 3D shooter (of sorts, you can't move around or anything) into a game like this. While I haven't hit wave 100 or anything yet, there doesn't seem to be a shocking array of features and a lot of them you can find better implemented in other games. Despite this, the game is still enjoyable to sink empty time into if you'd rather stare at a screen instead of being actually productive- and I have to admit, shooting blocks is much more exciting than clicking a button.\n\nVerdict: Just try it- it's an idle game, so you're wasting your time regardless if you like it or not","July 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","0"

From Cookie Clicker, to Clicker Heroes, to AdVenture Capitalist, there are few I haven’t at least booted up. Time Clickers is my favorite of them all. It has a bit of an unfair advantage being a completely free title with no premium options of any description. This is because it is actually just a small, just-for-fun side project from the developers of Time Rifters (an FPS of the same art styings and presumably using the same engine). Unlike other clickers, TC requires the player to actually aim with a gun to hit targets. On paper this sounds like it would defeat the purpose of an incremental game, however what it does is add a neat bit of light strategy the player can use when tackling a particularly bullet-spongey boss. Other that that, the mechanics are largely the same. If you have played a clicker you know exactly how it works, if you haven’t then the game is free and there’s no reason to write an essay to explain the premise.","September 6, 2015","true","629.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's the artifacts which you can buy with those cubes.\nThere are 5 different Artifact-Trees. Abilities, Damage, Click, Gold and Progress. My goal is to rush the level and collect as much cubes as possible within a short time to get even further. I don't have to click at all, just upgrade my cannons from time to time and it still makes you happy, seeing the amount of cubes you've collected after a while.\n\nIf you love clicker games and a flair for futuristic stuff, that's the game for you.\n\nWARNING: RUN AS LONG AS YOU CAN!

If there are any issues with the game, they immediately (and I do mean immediately) investigate the issue. If an issue is found, they respond swiftly to resolve it. They're always happy to help players out with problems they're having, or even if they're having a little trouble understanding something about the game. (I know I've misunderstood a few things and felt like a complete idiot, but they never treated me as such.)\n\nThe devs have another game here on Steam that I believe they give equal attention to. It doesn't seem like they favor Time Rifters (their paid game) over Time Clickers, but I don't know for sure because I've yet to save up enough to buy Time Rifters.\n\nThis game doesn't even have a cash shop! There is absolutely no way to advance by paying real money! Now, if you play the mobile app (which you can link to your Steam copy via cloud saves) you can opt in to watch ads for bonus gold, time cubes, and weapon cubes (when the rainbow ball shows up) but it is completely optional! Don't want to watch a really short ad? No problem! Just opt out of the ad experience in the options menu, and you'll just get gold whenever a rainbow ball appears (which is all you get on the PC version).\n\nThis game is aesthetically interesting but also pleasing. However, it's not for all, and some machines might not like the beautifully animated fireworks and such. Well, you don't have to worry about that! You can simply adjust the options to better suit you and your PC without making the overall graphics quality go way down.\n\nThis is definitely one of those increment games where you'll have to start over a whole lot, but gain something by doing so. (One thing to note is that in this game, even the time cubes you spend will continue granting a bonus, so you don't have to save up a bunch and not spend them to get a nice big boost.) While I do tend to overall enjoy the genre, I often find the starting over rather annoying. Time Clickers does a fantastic job with making it a lot less annoying. Just remember to put points into starting out with more gold as you keep playing, and things'll be fine. (If you don't, it'll slowly become a miserably slow grind every single time.)\n\nBetter yet, you can completely reset your stats without being forced to pay real money to be able to and without having to completely wipe out or edit your save file!\n\nThe devs even give us small holiday events!\n\nTime Clickers is easily the best free game on Steam, and easily one of my all-time favorite games, free or paid for.\n\nThe devs have been doing a fantastic job and I very much look forward to seeing what they come out with in the future.

You actually aim and shoot. The music is really cool and it's satisfying to see the shapes blow up.\n\nHOWEVER: At first glance this game looks like their other game on Steam Greenlight, and I got really sad that it went from a singleplayer co op game with an awesome soundtrack to a shovelware (but good shovelware!) In reality, that game is called Time Rifters and it's essentialy the same asthetic.

I clicked on everything as fast as my hand and fingers could move. I upgraded everything and played it for several hours straight. eventually I noticed that I couldn't advance fast enough for what i wanted. So I moved to stage two.\n\nPhase two (experimental):\nThis stage I decided that maybe I would like to try and use an auto clicker to you know see if I liked it or not. and wow did it add to the game and for a little bit I was satisfied with this. I almost thought that this would satisify me like the first few hours I played, but like all good things it must end. So this is where I moved into phase three.\n\nPhase three (kinky):\nThis was my final form I became faster stronger and more efficient. I started getting scripts that auto aimed faster then the built in auto aim would ever be hope to be then grabbed one that auto upgraded everything for me eliminating almost all human contact with the game. Making it the most efficient I could possibly make it. This however eventually led to stage four.\n\nPhase four (shame):\nThis is the point I realized what I had done. I removed myself almost completely from the game. I had a one point been having a grand time and been satisified by just playing and nothing extra was needed. So I decided to return to my roots. this led to stage one.","December 22, 2015","true","214.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yifferino/recommended/385770/","yifferino","LP | Sleepy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yifferino/","154 products in account","Pros:\n-Clicker game with aiming mechanic\n-You won't be stuck on levels for a while, but resetting is always an option, considering you get more powerful with every reset.\n-It sort of "encourages" the use of an auto-clicker whenever leaving it on while going AFK, as the AFK mode in the game doesn't actually shoot for you, it just aims your guns at a random cube.\n-Doesn't take much to run so you can run it in the background of other games and if you have to wait for something in the main game just tab out of the window and play some of this.\n\nCons:\n-Music is obnoxiously loud (Yes, I know there's a mute button, used it ever since I got the game, but still.)\n-To be able to be on the leaderboards anywhere in the game, you have to also create a separate account for just a clicker game, which most people don't like having 100s of random accounts.\n-Eventually, there is a point in every run where it gets ridiculously slow, like Clash of Clans, kind of forcing you to reset, even if you're trying to go for a super high round.\n-To get any clicker upgrades past level 100, you have to make it to round 1,000 and then find "weapon cubes"; I've been playing this for a while now and have barely just recently gotten to round 500.\n\nFinal thoughts: This game isn't bad what-so-ever, in fact, it's one of my favorite clicker games, as it actually gives you something to do other than just click. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that likes these types of game.\n\nFinal rating: 7.6/10","April 7","true","68.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have only been playing for 30 mins but I love it so far! Now I'm gonna state some things.\n\nThis is not just "another clicker game" it is more than that. You actually have to aim where you attack and it isn't all about spamming the mouse button. There are also many more unique things about this game.\n\nLastly, I know that the first two backgrounds and the blocks are from another game. But, if you click on the developer (Proton Studio Inc), you will see that they are the creators of the other game.\n\nThat is all I wanted to say because the people disliking it are wrong about some things :)","August 4, 2015","true","25.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The look is like FPS arcade style.  Has a repeating techno track for background music and arcade sound effects.  The gold that is dropped from kills gets picked up automatically a few seconds later.  Has all the controls on the shooting page.\n\nHas an Idle mode button to auto aim your gun on cubes, but you don't get always on attacks. To make good use of idle button, you need to install a macro clicker program.  Idle mode aiming tends to attack random cubes. You manually aim your gun with your cursor.  Your teammates tend to hit the easier cubes first so you might need to attack the yellows to defeat a boss.\n\nJust 5 shooting weapons instead of heroes that can be leveled up, each with 5 powerups,  on the left side.  Your Click damage level is max 125%, and has 10 player powerups, last is "time warp".  You use the number keys to activate each powerup or can hit spacebar to activate all of them.\n\nTime Cubes are like souls or spirits and can be spend on special abilities without loosing DPS advantage. A Time cube start appearing in the critters at wave 100, killing a time cube powers up the Time Warp.  Time warp resets you to beginning while giving you 10 time cubes to spend. You have like five trees of different buffs to spend them in.\n\nEnemies are built of small colored cubes in a 3D pattern, where cubes might be hiding other cubes from your sight.  The cubes colors are:  white, red, yellow, rainbow.  Each cube has certain amount of health ( Yellow is highest). Rainbow is easiest while dropping more gold but rainbow cubes only appear on certain critters.   Randomized appearance of moving rainbow balls (extra gold drop) that you have to directly shoot to get the gold.  Bosses have a timer on them, if you don't defeat them, they keep reseting.\n\nHas Steam achievements, a live leaderboard, statistics, save button, fullscreen mode, setting button, mute all sound.  Achievement also give gameplay improvements.\n\nTry it, if you like clicker games, and looking for something different in a clicker game.\n\nfor more info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULYXyevttzA&list=PLsBqca1-_w7D8gq3ao6oMjfWCyh2MHZTQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GEzLrobJFg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULYXyevttzA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cZtRr5tohE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9CvilzpnQ","January 4","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Now this game is a clicker game, which basically clicking on simple things and upgrading your clicks and automatic clickers to become stronger and get even more op ♥♥♥♥. Now this game is so exception, this is a solid clicker game, but it is an idle first person shooter too. Though don't think the FPS part is high tense. Its just shooting blocks which is fine, but if you want to get far with this game you will have to spend time upgrading the automatic or your 'team'. What's fun about this game is that the music is good, and its rewarding when you destroy blocks. I also really love that their is no paywall in this game and the first 7 hours is just addicting. The upgrades feel well done and everything just felt rewarding. And then I finished 100 waves: and then they introduced 'time warps'. Now its a smart idea in concept. When you beat 100 waves you have the option to go back to start and your upgrade process but in return you get 'time blocks' (or something like that I forgot the name), With these blocks you can buy perks that will stay with you forever. And thats how you complete the game, play the game up to wave 100, start again with everything slightly different. And thats when I gave up, I mean what's the point of that?. But this game is still positive for a reason, this game is free and asks nothing; also the file is only 30 mb. So if I spent 7 hours of my time here and had fun? Why the ♥♥♥♥ not recommend this game so you guys can have fun for 7 hours?","July 25, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

Now this game is a clicker game, which basically clicking on simple things and upgrading your clicks and automatic clickers to become stronger and get even more op ♥♥♥♥. Now this game is so exception, this is a solid clicker game, but it is an idle first person shooter too. Though don't think the FPS part is high tense. Its just shooting blocks which is fine, but if you want to get far with this game you will have to spend time upgrading the automatic or your 'team'. What's fun about this game is that the music is good, and its rewarding when you destroy blocks. I also really love that their is no paywall in this game and the first 7 hours is just addicting. The upgrades feel well done and everything just felt rewarding. And then I finished 100 waves: and then they introduced 'time warps'. Now its a smart idea in concept. When you beat 100 waves you have the option to go back to start and your upgrade process but in return you get 'time blocks' (or something like that I forgot the name), With these blocks you can buy perks that will stay with you forever. And thats how you complete the game, play the game up to wave 100, start again with everything slightly different. And thats when I gave up, I mean what's the point of that?. But this game is still positive for a reason, this game is free and asks nothing; also the file is only 30 mb. So if I spent 7 hours of my time here and had fun? Why the ♥♥♥♥ not recommend this game so you guys can have fun for 7 hours?","July 25, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

After pondering this question, none of the idle games are in my library anymore and this game is the sole survivor of my uninstall massacre.\n\nWhat makes this game so different?\n\n- It's not "Free To Play" it's a "Free" game -> No microtransactions whatsoever, I searched for it and found nothing! (Even the storepage says so, but pff screw reading!)\n- It's enjoyable being active in this game -> In other games no matter how hard you try being active it will result in absolute nothing but blank stares at a screen of bars automatically disappearing or filling\n- Upgrading is streamlined -> unnecessary clicks for perks were removed and instead weaved in the upgrade mechanic itself\n- The skilltree has actual impact on all aspects of the game -> It effects active abilites, passives, clicks and quality of life immense and\n- The "Endgame Resource" (you know what I mean) is no simple sacrifice -> each resource you spent on your skill tree has still impact on your % damage preventing you from crippling yourself each time you reset (You can only improve!)\n\nWith that said I found an actual game between the almost identical idle games that doesn't hold his hand out and only sees your wallet.\n\nGive the game a try and compare it to other idle games you will see the difference in time.","July 24, 2015","true","675.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The added dimension creates a feeling of usefullness when clicking compared to other clicker games. The progression does eventually slow down a lot as the progression end game is comprised of resetting to gain timecubes, which can feel repetitive at times. The connectivity in the game allows you to connect to a live leaderboard, aswell as the ability to continue your game on your mobile phone and cloud saving.

Passive and active play are both rewarded. There are some unique aspects to the mechanics of the game which makes finding efficient progression paths interesting for veterans of the genre.\n\nThe balance of upgrades during progression is a bit wonky. Sometimes it's better to not upgrade because doing so would reduce the number of targeted blocks to increase damage, but this isn't useful because you're still one shotting. And progression will often speed up then slow down and speed up again because certain upgrade ranges are just more efficient that others.\n\nTotally free game, which is nice.","July 27, 2015","true","042.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately not, but hey.. it was free.\n\nSome games can get away with being a bit pointless or dumb because they either have some fun/humorous/deeper narrative/mechanic/branding/etc.\n\n...but the main mechanics of Time Clickers spoke for me in this instance, as the goal is, ideally to not have to play or pay attention to Time Clickers: even when it's running.","May 6","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Unlike other games like clicker heroes that basically just play themselves, you can get much further much faster by actually playing it. And that interaction is more itneresting too, becuase there are multiple weapons and you have to aim and shoot at stuff, unlike most of the games where you just press anywhere on the screen (you don't even have to look at the screen!)\n\nThese kind of games are dangerous and mess with the human mind ;) But if you play any clicker game, you should play this one over any of the others out there.\n\nOh yes, and as others have said. No microtransactions! This game is 100% free.\n\nSo lets recap. Compared to any other clicker game:\n\n1) better progression system\n2) It's fun blasting things, especially when you unlock new weapons later\n3) No microtransactions, totally free\n4) forgot to mention: Cool visual style.\n5) Your interaction with the game has a far greater impact\n\nAlso, definitely play Time Rifters or at least the demo.","December 19, 2015","true","157.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Experiencing this classic role-playing game again in beautified 3D was truly a nostalgic trip, from the cute friendship-themed plot to the touching end-credits sequence. However, as a remake, it does represent a big missed opportunity to fix several significant balance issues and mechanical problems — the difficulty I had going back after playing the much more modern Pokémon X shows how far Pokémon games have come in 12 years.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Ruby and Sapphire were the third installments in the Pokémon RPG series and the best-selling Game Boy Advance games of all time. They follow the tried-and-true Pokémon model of journeying to catch new monsters, challenging eight boss-like Gyms, and eventually fighting the Elite Four trainers and the Champion. Like most other Pokémon games they also put you at odds with a villainous team of Pokémon trainers, in this instance Team Magma for Ruby and Team Aqua for Sapphire, who want to use legendary Pokémon to forever change the region of Hoenn, where the games are set.\n\nNow they’re the first of the earlier games to receive the 3D treatment. Generation III was a big change from the first two for many reasons, most notably the introduction of Abilities (attributes that add advantages to battle, among other things), Natures (which affect how stats develop) and double battles (using two Pokémon at once was unheard of back in the day). Different areas had their own weather patterns, and the region contained varied topography, from a desert to a volcano to sandy beaches.\n\nIn 2002 I reveled in the newness and feel of having an untouched world to explore, and that sense of wonder carries over in Omega and Alpha. The scenery is rich, the adorable characters are even more adorable (especially little Wally!), and there’s more to many of the cities than there was before. I walked into Mauville City for the first time while playing Alpha and didn’t even recognize it. In the original games it was comparatively small and boasted only the bike shop and the Game Corner, but now it’s like a smaller Lumiose City from X and Y: full of little shops and tons of NPCs to chat with. I actually got lost in Mauville City more than once, and had a lot of fun rediscovering something I thought I knew well.\n\nAlpha and Omega also bear some resemblance to X and Y in that certain app-like features — Pokémon Amie, Super Training, the Player Search System — have all been integrated as part of the PokéNav Plus. The interface is overcrowded as a result and really cumbersome, but the online apps are welcome additions (especially Wonder Trade) It’s the new Pokémon search app, the DexNav, that is perhaps the most interesting addition for Poképhiles. Every so often, a wild Pokémon will peek its ears or tail out of the tall grass (or sand or water), and DexNav will alert you to things like the Pokémon’s level, ability, and even rare moves it might have. I found two Poochyena this way: a female with Ice Fang and a male with Poison Fang, two “egg moves” that you can usually only get by carefully breeding. Easy-access breeding material! The app has the potential to help EV trainers as well, since you can see what Pokémon you’ll face before you battle it, and in that regard it provides another alternative to Super Training aside from traditional, less-accessible methods.\n\nThere’s also an updated Berry map, first introduced in Gen IV, which is a serious help to anyone who needs Berries for competitive battle... or even Pokéblocks! Remember Pokéblocks? They help your Pokémon up their beauty or cuteness or what have you for Contests, which are of course a part of Alpha and Omega. These Pokémon talent shows have a Japanese pop-idol feel this time, which makes it all seem more modern and updated. Playing as the female trainer, I was literally and figuratively taken under the wing of number-one Contest star Lisia and her Altaria, Ali. Lisia is absolutely adorable, but the best part of Contests for me is undoubtedly the Cosplay Pikachu you receive after winning your first one. Change Pikachu’s outfit according to the five Contest attributes and Pikachu gets a different move! I might just be a super nerd, but it’s the best thing since Surfing Pikachu.\n\nReally, all the tweaks of original Hoenn features are improvements. Unfortunately, there are still a few big flaws that weren’t addressed, and they’re even more noticeable in light of more recent Pokémon RPGs. My least favorite part of every Pokémon game is the unnecessary inclusion of too many hidden moves, commonly referred to as HMs (Hidden Machines), which you must teach to your Pokémon in order to progress through the region and aren’t so easily unlearned. Anything more than Surf and Fly is too much, as far as I’m concerned, and Hoenn is one of the worst HM offenders. Alpha and Omega dropped Flash for a total of seven HMs this time around — and in the late-game you can summon Latias or Latios to fly you places, which means you won’t need a Pokémon in your team with Fly — but compared to X and Y’s five HMs, it’s obvious why the decision was made to pare them back in subsequent games.\n\nSecret Power factors into this too. It isn’t an HM, but it is another move that interacts with the overworld and is necessary for building Super Secret Bases. Maybe I’m just stingy with what moves I teach my Pokémon, but I wish I didn’t need a move at all to check out potential bases during my travels. That aside, having a home base I could decorate in 3D was a lot of fun, and sharing via StreetPass or setting it up for other players to fight through as a mini-Gym are both neat touches.\n\nIt’s not a new complaint, but Hoenn is still imbalanced type-wise, heavily favoring water. It’s especially noticeable in Alpha Sapphire, in which Team Aqua (the villains of the piece) use a lot of water types. It feels like there are water Pokémon in nearly every battle, and I have an overleveled Pikachu to show for it. You also have to navigate many bodies of water, since much of the late-game involves the HMs Surf and Dive to get from place to place. Diving was really neat back in 2002 when it was new, but I found it incredibly tedious in Alpha and Omega — an obvious example of how superfluous some HMs are.\n\nThe water itself is absolutely gorgeous with the new graphics and details, though. One of my favorite parts of the entire adventure was splashing through puddles that reflected the starry skies at night, and even diving was made better by seeing a school of Luvdisc swimming by. Building my Super Secret Base on the rainy Route 119 had an extra-comfy, drinking-tea-on-a-rainy-day feel. Everything in Hoenn, water or not, is either delightfully cute or strikingly beautiful, and I enjoyed seeing the entire region anew — despite the tediousness associated with navigating all that pretty water.\n\nThe Verdict\nAs a 3D remake, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby do a fantastic job of reintroducing Hoenn. Little details, like characters turning their heads to look as you pass or flocks of Wingulls flying overhead, make the region really come to life, and small updates and tweaks help make the journey smoother. Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats. The added online features could help mitigate some of the type imbalances — I’m a huge fan of Wonder Trade — and there are even a few post-game surprises to encourage you to keep training well beyond the 25-hour main story.\n\n7.8/10 - Too much water","May 23","true","29.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Not as much as some other games, and the changing scenery is nice, but it does get repetitive.

It's more like an exercise in addiction psychology. Boring, shallow, zero strategy, no weapon rewards, no one-time-use special power ups. A waste for anyone over the age of 8. If this is any indicator of the mechanics in their paid title, Time Rifters, then I would consider another title to spend $10 on.\n\nAfter leveling up your "team" to level 10 or so, there is absolutely zero reason for you to manually click/shoot anything ever again. At this point your role becomes that of babysitter. No matter how many time cubes or how much money you earn, no matter how you level up your team (there is no visable strategy to this, just dump your money into each equally), and no matter how you use your skill tree, you will be forced to run the game minimized so you can pop it open ~15 levels to upgrade your team. If you don't, the team stalls on the nearest boss and you stop earning time cubes; you still earn money but that offers little advantage than letting you level up your team so they can run untouched for maybe ~25 levels instead.\n\nSkill tree upgrades to your own weapon do little and you do not have a choice in the gun you use.\n\nThe game is ugly. 15 poorly designed backgrounds.... one is literally a "flashlight shining on a wall".","August 8, 2015","false","86.1"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","21","44","4","2"

It's just not doing anything different. You might read this and think "it's a clicker game, it can't be different" and I would still agree with you but it's so much less polished than other clicker games and therefore I'd choose those over this.\n\nAn actual gripe I have is the DPS system. It's not DPS. The weapons you unlock and level up fire at different speeds and damage is applied individually between them, they don't fire at the same time at a consistent rate. a formation with 1.1b health, should not take over a second to die when I have 2.28c "DPS" Call it damage.

It is presented as a clicker game in the vein of Clicker Heroes and such, and definitely aims towards the same audience. However, the execution of this is a sad milestone: In a very bad designed interface \ GUI you have to shoot (?) blocks to get to the next level. How about a lack of inspiration to create a nice setting? Blocks. And shooting them? With a team of sniper specialists? In Minecraft you have at least your fists or a pick, but a gun? And color-changing blocks are not that appealing. They are just boring. It definitely feels like somebody without the necessary graphic design skills quickly put a game together to ride the successful Clicker Heroes wave.\n\nThey also decided that more is better and fill it up with all kinds of upgrades and achievement stuff.\n\nIf you want to grind away your time, just stay away from this one. Much more visually appealing stuff (adventure capitalist, tap heroes, clicker heroes) is around which offer a better experience. Avoid.","July 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 19 of 47 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","19","47","0","0"

Free Game. Designed for fewest clicks necessary.  Idle functions run while outside of program. (Because these features are common to the genre, it is my opinions that "idle" game is a more appropriate name for the genre, the clicker part really only applies for the beginning of the game.) Insane amount of things to purchase between resets giving Time Clickers lasting playtime that keeps interest.  Cubic graphical choice is currently unique for this genre.\n\nNegatives This game is missing what has become a standard feature of these games, an online save.  This is currently the only idle game on Steam to exclude this feature.  Don't play if you don't like the idle genre.  Don't play if you have a problem with graphics in a free game are reused from a pay game.  (FYI- Clicker Heroes also reuses graphics.)\n\nPost Scripts Interested in early idle games?  Search the internet for: "Progress Quest", or "Coin Box Hero".\n\nPlease help me give these games their most appropriate tag.  Please add, "Idle" as a tag for this and similar games such as Clicker Heroes, AdVenture Capitalist, Tap Tap Infinite, and Crusaders of the Lost Idols.","November 4, 2015","true","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I have a lot of anxiety issues, and the simple mechanics and repetitive nature of clicker games gives me something to do that doesn't require a lot of brainpower.\n\nTime Clickers is not like the other clicker games I have played.\n\nFirst off, if you have photo-sensitive epilepsy, skip this game. Even when I used the simplest, most low-res graphics and animation options I could find in the menu, there was so much going on and so many flashing colors that I actually found myself feeling more stressed as I played. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wasn't prepared for it, and like I said, if you have photo-sensitive epilepsy, it's probably not a good game for you.\n\nStill, I like the idea of this game. Aside from the cosmetic differences, it is pretty much just like any other clicker game I've played. The damage bonuses and special upgrades are structured a little differently than I'd seen before, but it was easy enough to figure out. If you want a nice time-waster and don't mind the hectic, super-bright graphics, go ahead and pick it up. Personally, I'll be sticking to my more sedate clicker games, but it's really a personal preference thing.","February 10","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spend that cash on upgrades to your click damage. Purchase automatic damage over time, and upgrade that. Unlock special skills and use them to defeat enemies faster, or earn more cash per kill, and invest that cash into more upgrades so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest so you can kill faster and get more cash to invest...\n\nYep. It's one of these types of games. There's a prestige system that gives you a special currency that you can use to purchase various powerups that do a lot of things, such as decreasing skill cooldowns, increase gold dropped, increase dps,\n\nTo many people, this type of game seems boring. To those people, I'd suggest peeking at a few games like this to see what the appeal is. It's basically a distillation of most game genres that have some form of upgrade system, such as obtaining better gear or gaining levels and powerful perks.\n\nPersonally, I like these types of games. They satisfy that reward center in the brain. It's a perfect example of the Skinner Box.","December 10, 2015","true","281.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Time Clickers also has its brick walls. But you gain power aka damage fast enough to overcome them after the next few resets. In fact, it has no real-money shop - or I just haven't found it yet. Another difference is that offline-idling will not really get you anywhere in Time Clickers. You need to actually PLAY this game.

The purpose of resetting is to increase your damage to push farther. When that is ofset by the fact that you are increasing enemy health, which I have proof of, then I really have to question what it is that you want your players to do.

More important, developers are always working on the updates and you don't have to wait long for new stuff to come out, which makes this game even more interesting.

Don't have to spend hours on the reddit or wiki trying to figure out how to get anywhere. No horribly complicated calculations. The time cubes (Hero Souls in CH) act like talent points in rpgs but you never lose the DPS bonus when you buy the talents. This means you are always getting stronger. You can never make yourself weaker by spending points early. I am sure there is a optimum path to upgrade through, but it does not matter that much compared to Clicker Heroes.\n\nOh just a tip. For your first several runs, time warp as soon as you can. Level 100 gets you 10 time cubes. Levels 105, 110, 115, 120 get you you 3-4 time cubes. But getting to past 110 takes a little while at first.","September 21, 2015","true","127.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

AdVenture Capitalist hit me, and it hit me good. Now I found an even better one by the name of Time Clickers.\n\nIn similar games you will likely run into many, many brick walls - which will have you either buy real-money upgrades or quit that game for good. Time Clickers also has its brick walls. But you gain power aka damage fast enough to overcome them after the next few resets. In fact, it has no real-money shop - or I just haven't found it yet. Another difference is that offline-idling will not really get you anywhere in Time Clickers. You need to actually PLAY this game. And after 89 hours I'm nowhere near "completing" it.\n\nThe final proof of how great this game is: It made me write my first review ever!\n\n10/10 would time click again.","November 3, 2015","true","209.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a true fun F2P, and contains no microtransactions. Personally, I think this is a great incentive to look into Time Rifters, which by the way, has a playable demo, and I consider to be great.\n\nI only have one problem with this game.\n\nThe reset system is great. Once you reach wave 100, you start getting time cubes, which once resetting, are used to buy several perks that branch out in several skill trees.\n\nThe problem is, while it took me one week to reach wave 100, the next two runs took 32 minutes to get to wave 100, and all I did was invest in the FIRST perk in the damage tree. It became boring after the third reset.","November 24, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
