"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/373110/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Few games can set new standards for technical failure and gameplay lack-of-design, but Temper Tantrum stands tall with Redneck Racers as example of what someone can produce when the goal is to create the absolute minimum of what can be called a game. This copy was provided by the developer in a giveaway to collect feedback, which I have every intention of giving in the fullest.\n\nFrom the very start Temper Tantrum is off on the wrong foot. The music, a bland, short, and repetitive loop is blaring in my ears, and the game provides no audio sliders or, as best as I can tell, no options menu whatsoever. Nothing is labeled such when you start the game, and hitting Escape, P, or Start on a gamepad don't bring up any sort of menu. After manually adjusting the volume for the program in the Windows audio mixer I decided I would try to play the game...a foolish notion on my part. I first tried with WASD and it immediately felt awkward, so I picked up my controller in the hopes that would help, but it was only marginally (and I do mean by the tiniest margin) better. As far as I can tell—if you hear me saying this a lot, it's because the game doesn't explain itself whatsoever and I'm mostly left fumbling trying to figure it out—there are no camera controls, and most of the time you can't actually see where you're going. The only way to see anything is stop moving; if you stand still for a second the camera will swing back behind you. The only other button that appears do anything is Y, which is jump (why Y?).\n\nThe actual gameplay of Temper Tantrum is simple enough. Run around, bump into stuff, get points, avoid some monster. I've yet, however, to find any reason to continue playing this game beyond what it took to write this review. Even if it worked flawlessly it's simple to the point of boredom, looks atrocious, and is littered with bugs. You will often find your view clipping through the wall (completely blocking your view), or yourself partially clipping through a wall and touching objects on the other side, which though not entirely unwelcome while trying to get through this, should certainly not happen. My first go 'round had me stuck on the first level because the game insisted I had one item left to break despite going through the whole house multiple times and finding nothing. My only way to escape was to die until the game ended because of the aforementioned lack of any form of pause menu. Second run went much smoother and I was able to clear it easily, along with the next level, but eventually I gave up because I just could not stand playing the game any longer. There's a monster that follows you around at a snail's pace, but frankly the camera is more dangerous than the monster; the only way the monster will ever get you is if you can't see it. There's also candy left on the ground that acts like a power pellet and makes you kill the monster on contact, another thing I had to learn by trial and error since the game didn't explain anything at all. You can only pick up one at a time (which was what had me confused at first, how sometimes they picked up and sometimes they didn't), but they're plentiful enough you'll rarely have to worry about it, at least in the levels I played. Maybe the monster becomes a genuine threat in later levels, but I'd be surprised if anyone had the patience to play that much of the game. Oh, and as one final bug I noticed, numbers will often be rendered on top of each other.\n\nIn short, I feel that Temper Tantrum is a complete waste of time. There was not one single redeeming factor in my time with it that I felt could make it enjoyable to anyone at any price point. Not for 99 cents, not the current sale of 24 cents, not even for free. Just save yourself the time and find something better to play instead.","May 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 358 of 371 people (96%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","96","358","371","32","0"

I have seen my share of strange games and I have seen utterly terrible games.  This combines both in a blender, and not one of those fancy type blenders.  I'm talking the low quality made in Uganda kind of stuff.  Wait, are blenders made in Uganda?  Maybe I should have a look.\n\nThere was this crazy action film made in Uganda, actually.  It was titled Who Killed Captain Alex.  The trailer was really strange and the movie was hard to understand.  But yet I felt that there was more effort to the making of Uganda's first action film than this game.  And really, this game really sets a low bar.  You'd need a Jamaican limbo athlete in order to get under that bar.  It's that bad.\n\nLet's start with the most basic feature, the control.  You probably could run around a little bit... and jump.  Nope.  No other buttons.  There's no kicking, punching, headbutting, barrel rolling, smash attacks, etc.  You name it, you can't do it.  Instead, you run into low-quality 3d furniture and after a few moments, it disappears with a cheap special effect and you get some points.  That's pretty much all you do, run into furniture and avoid ghosts with creepy nicknames.  Oh, you pick up candy and immediately lose all sense of control as you aimlessly run around and into ghosts while under a sugar rush. This costs money to buy.  Nobody knows why.\n\nIt's stupidly simple and even then, it fails to even get the basics right. The level counter is bugged and doesn't even work correctly.  The combo counter stopped working after a while (aptly labeled Combo Break, btw).  There is zero camera control.  On one map, during a countdown before giving you control, a ghost will touch you before the level begins and you instantly lose a chance.  Something is dreadfully wrong when it fails to get the very basics correct.\n\nThere are claims that it's supposed to play like Pac-Man, but there's a big difference.  Pac-Man is actually a fun arcade game that is considered legendary of the 80s arcade scene.  This game falls way behind.  I feel that this is more of a cheap attempt at being Goat Simulator, missing the point in the process by a country mile.\n\nThe graphics is as basic as it gets, similar to a game from the PS1/N64 era, but with a modern screen resolution.  You could probably play it on the most basic Dell pre-built, but why would you want to in the first place?  You can get a sense of where the creepy ghosts are, as long as they're in the view of the camera.  But if you get in a spot in which the wall blocks your camera view?  Yeah, good luck with that.  The loading screens are also terrible and ugly,  There's little else to say.\n\nAnd the sound and music? Psh. There's only one music track.  Get used to it.  That's all the music you get to hear.  Sound effects are also very basic, much like everything else.  Did I mention that this game costs money?\n\nAmazing how an utterly lame and basic game is so technically problematic and yet somehow shows up in the Steam store, costing actual money?  Someone got drunk when "approving" this game.  And the worst part of all this, it costs money to buy this game.  Don't buy it for yourself, your friends, your family, or your pets.  Not even for your worst enemies.  Just walk away and pretend that this never existed.  You'll breathe easier.","May 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","56","59","13","1"

I'll be up front and say that I did not pay for this game, it was gifted to me. With that said, I still feel robbed of my time, because Temper Tantrum is one of the worst games of 2015.\n\nAs the game begins, you play as Johnny, a little boy who, for whatever reason, is throwing a temper tantrum. The goal of the game (this game has a goal, Digital Homicide is making progress!) is to destroy furniture and other objects in your house. All while avoiding monsters that will put you to sleep. The problems with this game boil down to a few simple things. Movement and camera positioning. Digital Homicide are graduates of the Bubsy 3D School of Game Design, so of course, the movement and camera are stuck to each other. As in, you move the character, and the camera sticks to him at all times, without the chance of moving it with the other analog stick. Yes, this game has controller support. I'm just as surprised as you are. Anyways, Johnny moves as if he's trying to break the sound barrier, and it's very hard to stop him once he's caught any momentum. In a game where you need percise movement to avoid monsters, this is quite a problem. To put this into perspective, the trucks in Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing have better handling.\n\nAnd this problem only gets worse when you get one of the special pellets. You need special pellets (within the context of this game, they're bits of candy) to destroy the monsters. They make you go even faster, so when you ingest one, it's like the game is being played at 2.0x speed.\n\nJohnny is uncontrollable in this state, and looking at the screen as the camera moves could cause headaches.\n\nAnd that's pretty much all there is to this game. It's that bare bones.\n\nDon't buy this game. For you, or a friend.","September 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","58","63","11","1"

You cannot re-sell Unity assets and call it a game.\nI played this for a couple minutes, so I'll describe my experience with this game.\n\n1: If it doesn't hammer in the point that this is all assets...well, the game sure does. The launcher comes up as "Assets Configuration" and the game, when it starts up, doesn't have its title. Instead, we just have... "Assets" as the title. How interesting, I wonder what this game was made from?\n\n2: I noticed that the loading screen had "Loading" /underneath/ the words "Now Loading the Bedroom!" or whatever. That's just wrong.\n\n3: I seriously cannot describe how horrible it feels to play this game. I swear to God, I was not in control of my character or something. When you move, he slides across the map like he slipped in his own ♥♥♥♥ and never stops moving. The camera is even worse. When you would move to the side, it would re-position itself, moving back and forth. It spasms at random, it clips through the wall, and just makes it horrible to look at.\n\nTL;DR: This game is just pre-made garbage and it controls horrible. I feel bad wasting $0.29 for this.

The first two are "Digital homicide" and the other two are "Unity assets". Now I'll explain wht I mean by these words.\n\nDigital homicide are the developers of "the slaughtering grounds" and "Forsaken uprising" and they've also made Temper tantrum. If you've plyed these games tht should already give you an idea if you havn't go and read the reviews I did for them.\n\nNow let's get to the unity assets part. Unity is apopular gaming engine tht is quite easy to use and can easily make people become game developers. On the unity website there is a part of it called "the asset store" People can upload their own creations from unity tht people can buy and use these as a basis to create their own original ideas. Temper tantrum IS ALL UNITY ASSETS. digital homicide have taken other people's basis and used it as a finished product after they rammed them all together s if it were a trainwreck waiting to happen. Don't believe me then look at this.\n\nThe environment of temper tantrum is actually "3DRT-Toonworld Interiors" by 3DRT.com which costs $200 https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13533\n\nThe enemies areactually "Jelly Monsters" by Render Shed Technologies which is free https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/19176\n\nthe main character is actually "Generic Cute Male" by TurkCheeps which costs $40 https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11675\n\nWhich means that for $240 you can make this incredibly broken, trainwreck of a gameand charge £0.79 and hope to get your money back. The problem is it seems to be wrking as ovr 1,000 people have bought temper tantrum. THEY'VE MADE A PROFIT FROM THIS!?\n\nEnough about digital homicide and unity assets for now I'm now going to tell you what's wrong with this game aside from digital homicide taking other people's work and passing it off from their own. The first immediate thing I found wrong with this game is the controls. You can play the game with either the keyboard or a controller. Now you might be thinking "OH if the controls are bad I'll just buy the game and use a controller" NO THE CONTROLS SUCK N MATTER WHAT WHEATHER YOU'RE PLAING WITH A KEYBOARD OR WITH A CONTROLLER! IT'S LIKE THE GAME WANTS YOU TO UNINSTALL IT AND THEN DIGITAL HOMICIDE JUST RUN INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL SAYING AND LAUGHING "U DUMB SH*T U ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT! THX FR UR MONEY BUY OUR NEXT GAME Y DON'T U "DEADLY PROFITS" COMING SOON TO STEAM, HELP SUPPORT US U DUMB SH*T!"  The controls are bad that I can't even tell where I'm goin half thhe time he just runs.......and runs.......and runs. I feel my brain cells die the more I play temper tantrum.\n\nThe game also suffers froma problem that "The slaughtering grounds" suffered from. THERE ARE ONLY THREE MAPS! people are going to get bored of ur game really quickly digital homicide. You put them in the same maps over and over and over again. It's like having a gta game where in each game they have the same setting over and over and over again and don't change anyhing so there's nothing unique to see.\n\nThe point of the game is to destroy everything in ur area and rack up on points to get on the leaderboad......in which he leaderboard only counts the people tht's plyed via ur pc. THE WHOLE POINT OF  LEADERBOARD IS TO COMPARE URSELF TO OTHER PLAYER AND WE'RE IN THE ERA WHERE ONLINE PLAY IS POPULAR. I KNO FOR A FACT THT DIGITAL HOMICIDE KNOWS THIS BECUSE THEY MADE THE SLAUGHTERING GROUNDS A MULTIPLAYER FIRST PERSSON SHOOTER. THEY ALSO MADE FORSAKEN UPRISING A MULTI PLAYER MEDIEVAL SURVIVAL GAME! So what's temper tantrum u ask... It's a piece of sh*t it's blendered mess it's a trainwreck it's anything but a game.\n\nAND GET A LOAD OF THIS NEXT PROBLEM IT'S THE SECOND BIGGEST FLAW THT THIS GAME HAS. THERE IS A BUG THT THE MONSTERS ARE UNLEASHED BEFORE THE TIMER HAS RUN OUT. before a round starts a timer is up before you can run around and destroy everything. When the timer is still going ur supposd to be stuck in place and the monsters shouldn't have spawned in yet. BUT WHEN THIS BUG OCCURS THE MONSTERS COME STRAIGHT FOR YOU WHEN YOU R STILL STUCK IN PLACE AND CAN'T RUN SO YOU INSTANTLY DIE!\n\nThis is one of digital homicide's worst and that's saying something\n\nPros\n+A unique concept\n+good music\n\nCons\n-Some of the worst controls you will ever find in a video game\n-Pre bought unity assets\n-One of the worst bugs where u r destined to die and u didn't do anything\n-Nearly unplayable\n-It is nearly impossible for digital homicide to take credit for this as it's other people's own work\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","October 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","45","52","5","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasedonothurtme/recommended/373110/","pleasedonothurtme","Lone Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasedonothurtme/","232 products in account","Apparently, this game is supposed to be similar to arcade games, at least according to the storepage. The developer even went so far as to compare it to Pac-Man. This is the worst attempt at this style of game I have ever seen.\n\nFor one thing, the games it is striving to be similar to were made over 30 years ago. For casual play in arcade machines. Even so, they were better. One might think that such a simple style would make such games easier to create, but it's quite the opposite. The limitations of the time aside, making a game that is fun and addictive despite being simple is the challenge. And, of course, the developers took the time to make sure their products were as polished and fun as could be.\n\nTemper Tantrum is the absolute opposite of this. I would never describe it as "polished," or even "complete." The controls do not work on a basic level. Johnny moves way too fast, even faster when he picks up the candy that shows up absolutely everywhere, and he makes giant swooping maneuvers that can barely be controlled. That's not nearly as bad as the camera, though. Despite the fact that this game is for computers, and meant to be played with a keyboard and mouse or a two-stick gamepad, there is no camera control. The camera will shift into a rigid position behind Johnny. And it will shift side to side as you walk in a straight line. The biggest problem with this is that the camera makes massively unpredictable motions in order to catch up with Johnny as he runs around uncontrollably. Combine this with claustrophobic environments comprised of an array of flashy colors, and you've got a game that is an absolute mess to look at and play.\n\nNot to mention a myriad of general issues (to Digital Homicide's credit, of which he deserves almost none, he actually fixed one issue at some point). You can't pause, and thus, there are no settings. You can only quit when you get a game over or by manually exiting the game. The main menu buttons are not compatible with a controller, and do not have sound effects or any effects at all when clicked. The loading screens are just static images. The phrase "Break Me!" shows up above every single breakable object in the game. All the time. Numbers sometimes render on top of each other. The camera often doesn't follow Johnny between rooms, or swoops outside of the playable area. Worst of all, there are only two songs in the game. One is the repetitive and boring menu song, and one is the gratingly repetitive song that loops while you're playing.\n\nEven if the game controlled well and didn't have these issues, though, the final product would still be a boring unfinished game. There is a total of one thing you do in Temper Tantrum. You run into stuff, and stock sound effects play as you do. That's it. There are some monsters that follow you around, but if one hits you, that's because of the camera. Even so, the candy I mentioned earlier seems to be spawned by every other thing you break. It gives you invulnerability for way too long, which makes the monsters even less of a threat. The best part is, you have four lives. Per level. They reset every single time you beat a level. The levels aren't even difficult, they're really short and really easy. Basically, this game is painfully boring. I have heard people complain of not being able to find some object. I didn't have this issue, but even so, it doesn't matter. After 3 levels, the game ends. It just loops back to the beginning. New monsters seem to show up every once in a while to create the illusion of difficulty, but I'm fairly sure there's a limit of three.\n\nCome to think of it, this game is very much like Pac-Man, if it were 3D. And if it were awful. In fact, imagine Pac-Man if every other pellet was a power pellet. And if the ghosts moved really slow. And if there were less walls, so it was super-easy to avoid the ghosts. Now imagine if the game had really annoying music and it was painful to look at, and mix in awful controls. That's basically it.\n\nThis game wants to be addictive, and make you strive to improve, like Pac-Man. But it's so easy, you're a master at the game the first time you play it. What with the price tag, this game is almost like many mobile games that have been appearing lately. Many better mobile games have been appearing lately. Remember Doodle Jump? Probably not, but at any rate, that one was fun. There was a steady difficulty curve, it constantly got more difficult, and it gave you plenty of room to improve. And it cost as much as Temper Tantrum is going to cost once the sale ends. Games like that may just be one-note games, but at least they're fun, and at least they're polished.\n\nI would criticize the developer for the way he takes criticism, but that isn't relevant to the game at all. He isn't censoring it now, for the most part. He is mostly ignoring it, sometimes throwing in an immature or irrational response. It's an improvement, actually. But not much of one. Although, to be fair, people have gotten pretty childish on the forums. Oh yeah, and Jim Sterling has nothing to do with my opinion of him or his games. I don't even like Jim Sterling. I just hate this game. I just thought I'd mention that, Digital Homicide has this crazy idea that every single person only dislikes his games because of the bandwagon effect.\n\nYou may consider purchasing Temper Tantrum for humor value, or for trading card profit. It will not work for either. As for humor value, it's funny as far as the trailer goes. That's it, actually. Everything you see in the trailer is exactly what the game is, and nothing more. You can judge the entirety of this game based on surface value alone, because this game is nothing but surface value. As for the cards, don't bother. They sell for about 8 cents on the market place, and you get 3. Considering the 2-cent tax, you still lose 6 cents.\n\nThis game is not worth 6 cents. I wish that were a joke.\n\nEDIT: I requested a refund and it was accepted. I suggest you do the same.","May 26, 2015","false","1.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

The idea is great, simple, but great. Then what is my problem about not recommending the game? The reason is gameplay.\n\nYour main enemy ain't "Mr. NightNight", an enemy which if you touch him you lose one life or "Mr. Nightmare", which I'm not really sure if it actually slows you down or explodes, no, your main enemy is the camera itself. The camera moves as you instantly press any movement button, this may cause dizziness in the long run of playing (Around the first 5-10 minutes of your gameplay)\n\nVariation? Don't expect any, you only get three different small maps about it, but for a game of 0,99€, I kinda expected it.\n\nAlso, I think the developers didn't expect us to get that far, since I kind of got a loop on level 7, all three maps got called as "Level 7" and I had to complete twice in order to reach at level 8, that's the only reason I can find about this kind of error.\n\nIf you want to try it, be my guest, but I'll wait untill it gets on sale like 0,14€ because, after all, you obtain some cards which actually you can get your money back plus some extra cents from selling it.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend this game due to the reasons posted above, don't take it bad Digital Homicide, maybe if your future games gets an OK camera control and similar gameplay as this one then it might be good.\n\nP.S: Digital Homicide, if you port this game to the mobiles, I'll probably play it during my free time.","June 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

The game made me nauseous in about 5 minutes, which is a new record. Even Two Worlds 2 took about fifteen minutes for its infamous camera to take an effect on me. The game controls absolutely horribly and once you pick up the power-up, the character becomes impossible to control as he slides around the screen, further exacerbating the nauseous camera. The gameplay is incredibly simple to the point where the game is quite easy despite the controls. Just run into things and not die.

Even the name sounds bad. Oh well, 24c, worth a shot! Not really...\n\nYou play as a small kid in a nappy named Johnny the Enraged Toddler, which is a pretty long name to pronounce. Not a very good one either. If it was just Johnny or something maybe, but adding the Enraged Toddler to it really doesn't make sense. I bet his teachers hope he doesn't go to school, with many reasons\n\n1. He destroys houses, which means he'll destroy the school\n2. His name is so long the teachers will just call him Johnny. That will make Johnny angry, resulting in him destroying the school.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure the reason you haven't stopped reading yet is that you want the review part of this review, so let me explain. You need to run the kid around the house destroying the furniture and eating sweets, (there was a sweet in the toilet?!?!) The sweets boost your movement around the house. There is also these strange Alien bobby things that are in the house trying to stop you, but they are mostly acclaimed to one spot and stay there until you run into them, so they don't make the game any more challenging. And that is the uncomplex, ripoff of a game. The most complex part of this game is the name of the house at the start of a level, and that's probably only so you know what level your up to... This is seriously worse then the old Rugrats game for PS1... A kid might enjoy this for 20mins max, and the only reason I've done 1.5 hrs is because I was searching for every nook and crany within the game (like the candy in the toilet.) My personal conclusion is to not buy this game.

Where do I begin?\n\nSo, it's pretty much about a baby that goes on a rampage and has the ability to blow up everything in people's houses. So he pretty much gets angry because he needs to go to nap and then he plants C4 on everything on the house and blows it up.\n\nThe objective is pretty much breaking everything in the level. At least they give you a counter on how many items are in the level in general. Another objective is to blow up people around you so that they don't inject you with sleeping powder and make you instantly go to sleep.\n\nIn level 2 and 3, I've been getting problems such as the ghostly circles that are supposed to represent people move even before I get a chance to start moving around and thus they will send me to sleep if I don't move at the right time. Levels 1-3 are also repeated, so level 1 is level 4, level 2 is 5, level 3 is 6, etc. The AI is also terrible and I can compare it to some of Call of Duty's "fish AI" and such. The people can also go through walls (unfortunately you can't) and somehow inject you with the powder even before they get into the room. I also think this game has a failed stealth mechanic that doesn't work because for some reason the people NOTICE you through the walls and go after you. The thing is though, stealth would actually be decent if the camera doesn't move as soon as you move and the controls are so sloppy.\n\nThe controls are very sloppy, I attempt to move around and I slip all over the place. What makes it even worse is that once you destroy something, you can get candy that will make you move extremely faster and makes it way more annoying to traverse through the houses without bumping into walls. I can compare this to things like Sonic R, where the controls are completely on it's own and it really feels like all the characters are on ice.\n\nHonestly, if it's on sale then you should buy it just to increase your game counter. Otherwise, it's not worth $5.\n\n\nTL;DR: A failed stealth game where you have to blow things up by using kamikaze tactics and blow your parents up and pretty much destroy your house. Full of bugs and camera controls, don't buy this game.","May 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antigravities/recommended/373110/","antigravities","Alexandraa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antigravities/","3041 products in account","So, after playing and hearing about the issues with the infamous The Slaughtering Grounds, I suddenly see another game by the same publisher, Digital Homicide (except this time, under a slightly different name, "DigitalHomicide"... was this to prevent people from thinking The Slaughtering Grounds was connected through search results?). Anyway, despite their particularly awful business practices before (censorship, lashing out against reviewers, etc...), I decided to give Temper Tantrum a try, thinking that maybe Digital Homicide learned from their previous mistakes. I mean, $0.23 is a cheap price to pay, right?\n\nThey didn't. And this game isn't even worth the 23 cents it's being sold for. But the people who haven't heard of Digital Homicide or its antics before, you may be wondering : "why?"\n\n- Digital Homicide didn't learn to stop using stock assets. This interesting thread shows all of the assets this game uses. The game now looks more like a "tutorial project", right? Yeah.\n\n- The camera view and controls are pretty crappy. The camera seems to turn by itself, and when it does, it suddenly (and seemingly, unpredictably) jerks to the left and to the right. This makes me extremely dizzy.\n\n- The game is extremely buggy in itself. A little more polished than The Slaughtering Grounds, but still unbearable. You can hit stuff through walls and your enemies seep through them. Monster animations just loop over and over again.\n\nThe only pro that I have to this game is that it could have been an interesting idea if it wasn't executed so, so poorly.\n\nDon't give Digital Homicide your money. They really don't deserve it.","May 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Bad graphics. Bad controls. Bad music. Bad camera. Bad programming. Bad everything. Not worth purhcasing at all unless you want cards... -1000 out of 10.\n\n------------------\n\n4 things about this game:\n\n- game is entirely composed of 3d clip art from unity3d's asset store. EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THIS GAME was made by someone else and purchased (sometimes for free), none of it is original work. Examples: search unity3d's store for Jelly Monsters (the enemies) and generic cute male (the baby you play as). This says a lot about the lack of talent and skill of the developer\n\n- developer is so lazy, they didn't even put in a pause menu or a way to quit out of the game once its started. You have to alt-tab out in order to shut it down. huh, look at that. they patched a pause/quit option in.\n\n- post anything even the tiniest bit critical or disparaging in Temper Tantrum's forum, and it'll get banished to a condescendingly named sub-forum in an attempt to hide it. Continue, and you'll get banned. Its like its being modded by NeoGAF.\n\n- Digital Homicide has a proven record of making effortless ultra-low quality games. They essentially live up to their namesake since they're basically murdering video games with how dispassionate their obvious scraping for pocket change greed is. Truly a scourge.\n\nanother oddity about this game are how the user reviews are 'mixed'. nearly all the positive reviews are lame unfunny LOL XD X-chan joke reviews. The only positive one that makes sense is the guy whose happy he was able to turn a profit on the cards.","June 21, 2015","false","4.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

And I'll tell you that is pretty Sad. The game is not good overall, and one of the only good things I can think about it is that the idea of it was very creative. But sadly, someone decided to change the idea of destroying things. To making the colors give you a headache, having music that loops and doesn't end even when it's paused. Everyone jokes on the community page about this game. If they made it realistic, (More so then some detailed polygons) Like L4D2, Amnesia or Rust, a Realistic version, where the monster wasn't a ball slower then dirt named "Naptime" then yes it would sound pretty awesome. so if the game looked realistic, it was in first person and the camera didn't look like you snapped your head every 2 seconds, have the monster be an actual Monster then it would be good. It sound slike a fun horror idea. But like I said before, it just failed.

And I'll tell you that is pretty Sad. The game is not good overall, and one of the only good things I can think about it is that the idea of it was very creative. But sadly, someone decided to change the idea of destroying things. To making the colors give you a headache, having music that loops and doesn't end even when it's paused. Everyone jokes on the community page about this game. If they made it realistic, (More so then some detailed polygons) Like L4D2, Amnesia or Rust, a Realistic version, where the monster wasn't a ball slower then dirt named "Naptime" then yes it would sound pretty awesome. so if the game looked realistic, it was in first person and the camera didn't look like you snapped your head every 2 seconds, have the monster be an actual Monster then it would be good. It sound slike a fun horror idea. But like I said before, it just failed.

Controls feel like you're sliding on a pan of butter, with banana peels on your feet, while being covered in oil.\n2. No story, no reason for the baby to be upset\n3. Baby is a weirdo with only a smile, while destroying a home, no other emotion/animation\n4. Only 3 levels, repeating, and repeating.\n5. There are missing textures on some sweets (checkerboard pattern)\n6. No pause menu or main menu (gotta alt+F4 to quit)\n7. Camera is unbearable (clips through every object, doesn't quite keep up with the character's speed (that baby is FAST)\n\n\nNow, there ARE ways I personally feel things could work for this game.\n\n1. Give players a good interface (Main menu, Pause Menu, all that jazz)\n2. Fix the controls, make the controls actually feel as if you're running, instead of hovering oddly.\n3. Add more levels, and maybe Item placement randomness.\n4. A story, small and simple, that'd be all that's needed.\n5. More emotion to the baby.\n6. Better player to object collision.\n7. Possibly a method of breaking the stuff (like an attack button, could be smashing furniture with toys instead of just bumping).\n8. Better relative size to environment (baby is massive).\n\nAll these suggestions are personal opinions, but I do figure a lot of the community can agree with at least some of them.","May 22, 2015","false","3.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Well look no further than Temper Tantrum by Digital Homicide Studios.\n\nThe main draw of this game is seeing furniture explode. While I do think that is a good concept, it was poorly executed. Normally you get weapons, attack animations, and anything to make it look like you did something to earn a flashy explosion. Instead, you run into the furniture, it explodes, move on the next furniture, and continue until you’ve destroyed everything.\n\nThe mechanics for the enemies are odd. Whenever I start-up a new game, I normally get 1 enemy. But sometimes I get all 3 enemies at the first level. Their movement speed is a joke. You can easily outrun them, but to balance this out, they go through walls. And no, nothing in the game’s description said they were ghosts.\n\nWhile the enemies aren’t too bad in this game, the real enemy is the camera. This camera goes wherever it feels like once you take a single step. It moves so much that it kind of makes me nauseous after looking at it for a long period of time. It doesn’t help that the only way you can control the camera is by moving your character.\n\nThe graphics, in all honesty, are ugly! Everything is all bright in the worst way possible. Seriously, who would design their poor home this way? Lil’ Johnny and the enemies look completely different in comparison to the environment they are in. It is as if the designer didn’t have time to put much detail into the environment and used it on a baby and three spheres.\n\nOverall, this game is awful with nothing to redeem it whatsoever. In my opinion, I’m glad it’s only three levels long because I got tired of it after reaching level four.

How did it got throught Steam Greenlight?\nI got this game for free, and I still feel cheated.\n\nRight after launching this game, there's the Unity's configuration screen.\nNothing's wrong here, only if you ignore that the window's named "asset Configuration".\nIt's never a good sign when they haven't even took the time to name the game throught Unity.\n\nAfter this, you're left with a "Start game", or an "Exit game".\nObviously, there's no help or even anything right in the beginning. You have to find yourself what to do, and how to do it.\nNo story, no help; that's no good.\n\nAt least, the controls are fairly simple. Arrows or even WASD to move your character, space to jump.\nNow, let's talk about the "main core" of the game:\n\nFirst, the way the character moves, it feel like skating. The controls aren't tight, you feel as if the character can't be correctly moved. That's no way enjoyable.\n\nSecond, you have to break stuff. Pretty simple, right? It's even more simple since there's a green text "break me!" over every breakable object. Except a TV, but pretty much because it's off-screen.\n\nThird, the candies. You break things, you get candies. Even if we ignore their origins inside a bed, table, a chair or even a plant, they gives power up. The thing is, there's no way to know which one do what. I know there's one that makes you invincible for a bit, and let you be even more rapid, with even less control of your character, ugh.\nThere's other candies, but it seems I'm always unable to get them, even if I walk on them.\n\nFourth, the ghost/eye/monster following you. His movements are quite badly animate (or is he teleporting for 10 centimeters every second?) and it seems you can destroy them while invincible, but at least they respawn a bit after. Like, 5 seconds after.\n\nFifth, the levels. There's only 3 levels: Your house, your babbysitterMs house, and your grandmom's house. They just cycle time after time, with everytime, a new monster is following you.\nWhile I'm there, what are they? Do they have an origins? Is there a reason why they make the character sleep?\nEvery levels takes 2-3 minutes, and they don't really change after each time.\n\nSince the gameplay is quite repetitive and nothing ground-breaking, you'll get sick of it after 5 minutes. I spent 10 minutes on it (the rest is for trading cards) I higly reccomend you to flee this game like the pest.\n\nWhile I'm at it, the graphics may look a bit good, the whole HUD make the game quite ugly. There's texts everywhere, when you break something there's always too much stars, and after every level, there's a really bad splash screen.\nThe music? It's the same thing. Just watch the trailer, and that's it, that's all of the OST. (In this case, should I say ST, since I'm pretty sure it's no way original?)\n\nPros:\n+Steam trading cards.\n+Low price. (Is that even a pro!?)\n\nCons:\n-Potential way too wasted\n-Bad game design\n-Bad gameplay\n-Bad graphics\n-Music you'll get tired after 3 minutes\n-No plot\n-No fun\n-Made from Digital Homicide.\n\nI would rather play Bad Rats than this.","May 22, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

So I can give its developers that much credit: they surely know how to call things.\nOf 5 games from the "Digital Homicide" bundle this one stands above all... in the order of deletion. The urge to do that is absolutely irresistible, I can hardly wait until all cards will be in my inventory, to purge that abomination from my hardware.\n\nAs of gameplay... I'm not doing drugs or that much amount of alcohol to be as high, as one should to tolerate that game and getting fun from it. Sure, I've noticed how much Temper Tantrum took from the Pacman original game. You gallop in circles, eat (destroy) stuff on the way, running from respawning monsters, then picking some cake and now rush to the monsters to blow them. All of that in 3 dimensions. But, but, but... I better hit the Pacman automat once again. At least, there are more than 3 looped levels, much more challenge and reason, and even music is better!\n\n2/10 mark: one for a good name and one for steam cards. At least, I'll get my money back.

I'm sorry for Temper Tantrum and that it really isn't all that good but unless you want a quick 10-15 play game or maybe even an hour if you can laugh about it with your friends OR have a quick addition to your game library if you're a game collector or you want to make 19 cents in trading cards... go for it... IF NOT, forget this game COMPLETELY.\n\nThe fact that they try to make this game look like it's professional makes me laugh, I'm sorry Johnny, your tighty whities won't impress anyone. :( -Detroit0127","June 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But this game is not just summed up by its many minutes of content. The developers knew that some people dont only play games for content and instead crave a well developed lore.\n\nIn my extensive playthrough of this game I have noticed that despite that happy colorful exterior that the game presents, temper tantrum hides a dark and twisted lore, and the developers have hidden this in a similar way as Scott Cawthon the developer of the recently popular Five Nights At Freddy's game series. This is done by the game not openly telling you the lore but instead making the player delve deep to find it themselves.\n\nThis is my summary of the lore. (This is entirely subjective and may or may not be canon)\n\nThe first creature you will encounter in temper tantrum is the elusive enemy only known as Mr NightNight who is the living manifestation of Johnny's regrets as Night Night were the last words he said to his Parents, Babysitter and Grandparents before he brutally murdered them. This regret is embodied as the Mr NightNight we see in the game and the reason it  puts you to sleep is because when the guilt catches up to Johnny he can't cope with it and sadly kills himself resulting in his naptime, permanently.\n\nThen you have an encounter with Mr Sleepytime who is the living manifestation of Johnnys insomnia as every time he tries to sleep he is encountered by visions of what he did and it scares johnny so much that it deprives him of this much needed sleep, and if Mr Sleepytime catches up to little Johnny then he realises he will never sleep again and this fear causes him to again, kill himself resulting in his permanent naptime.\n\nFinally when you get far into this game you encounter the most terrifying of them all, Mr Boogerman Mr Boogerman is the beast within johnny that made him kill all of the people in his past and when he catches up to Johnny he will control him to make him kill himself. Which once again results in his permanent naptime.\n\nIn temper tantrum you work to destroy the evidence of your crimes while avoiding your past, your present and your future, disguised as a happy experience this game has one of the most twisted and well developed lores I have come across in my gaming.\n\nJk lol it's ♥♥♥♥ please do not buy this.\n","July 25, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It makes running around more like 'a chore' instead of being fun.\nThe soundtrack is okay but is repetitive. I've also encountered blatantly obvious invisible barriers, such as with the pool making you either walk on water or walk in the air.\nThe 'Mr Night Night' isn't that much of a challenge, and if he was the game would be even worse because the camera makes it really hard to even MOVE.\nThe textures are extremely low quality, but this is a minor issue.\nOutside you are essentially in 'a blue hell', if the game had made a neighbourhood or something it'd be a lot better than just nothing but blue.\nThe menu screen seemingly has no 'start', and looks plain weird. The loading screen is also like this, but just a pasted image that isn't very high quality.\nIf you want replayability, there's no replayability.\n\nThe concept is quite interesting, but a bit linear. If the game was polished and improved, this would be a short, semi-linear but fun game.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't purchase this game if I were you, even though I got it for like $0.25USD.\n","May 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I though "It looks cute. It's cheap. Just go for it. How bad could it be?" Yeah, it's bad. It is cute, but not a whole lot else is good.\n\nThere is a *little* bit of potential, but is seems they added cards to get sales rather than improve the game itself. If they would fix the camera, add more levels, different power ups, different goals and objectives, or just expand and polish the game in any way, it could be worth 99 cents. But for now, it's no good. The worst of it is the camera. I can't even see where I am half the time. The controls are a little imprecice but that seems to be the case with a lot of unity games. And there are only 3 levels that repeat over and over. Is there more? I don't know because I stopped after level 7.

I don't know what is the reason for more sales; getting the game for card profit, or getting the game as a joke to friends.\n\nJokes aside, the game is actually well made. The playability seems more fit for arcade machines, but the theme and design is more for a not-so-serious PC game. The controls are very difficult with bonuses as the character gains speed, making higher scores more difficult. The game has a classic challange as the "Nightmares" become an increasing threat.\n\nNow for the bad things (sorry devs). The game has nothing new after the first play. The only keeping players playing is to beat a highscore that hardly any people care about. Other than that, I can't complain much about the game. "That's it? that is all you can say!?" Acutally, yes. The game has an older game style than modern games and it actually runs smoother than those it's style imitates.\n\nFinally, my ideas to make the game better:\nThe game has a visual style from around the year 2000, and when combined with the difficult controls (Something I did not complain about in the complaint part,) the game becomes almost at a laughing manner. Instead of expanding of the laughable difficulty, the game developers made the goal of the game a serious one. I think the game needs to take a less serious approach and I think the problem with that is the game goal itself.\nKeep the movements, it's hilarious watching a person attempt to navigate. Instead, build a really challenging mode in the game expanding of the laughability of people failing to move correctly. Add some more gamemodes to the game, and make them really creative. This gamemode, I love it, but I do not think it can be a selling point. Just impliment classic children behaviors into the game, like the concept of "the floor is lava," where kids try to navigate a house by climbing on things and NEVER touching the ground. Setting a side mode like this, while not the game's main focus, could be its biggest selling point. Especially if multiple players could play together to add a wided competition.\n\nFor those who are still reading. I am torn between recommending and not. The game at the point of this review is playable, there are not too many problems with the game. My biggest problem is that there just isn't enough. There needs to be something that gets players to keep playing. So far, I would not recommend this game. But I do believe if the laughability was increased (MAKE IT HILARIOUS), then I will completely change my mind.","July 31, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had a job that payed well enough, so I dealt with the little ♥♥♥♥♥ I had to babysit. However, there was one. One bent on total destruction. The one that I couldn't sit. This is the story of how I had to babysit little Johnny.\nIt started like any other babysitting job with a  bratty little ♥♥♥♥. The kid's family said he works fine with babysitters. However, what they didn't tell me was what happens at night, when Johnny is supposed to sleep. Their house, as well as little Johnny's grandma's house, were undergoeing renovations at the time due to some property damage, something they didn't talk about much. Basically, I had to bring Johnny home to my house for babysitting. I brought him home and entertained him like I would any other child. But, when it got dark, I said the 6 words that would forever change my life, "It's time to go to bed." When I said this, Johnny's eyes turned red and his head twisted almost 180 degrees to look at me. He roared in a demonic voice "no!" as he began to smash everything in my house. I ran outside and called the police. However, by the time I had gotten on with them, Johnny threw the phone out of my hand and smashed it. He race back inside and began to smash everything in my home. I ran away into the forest out back, knowing that this was my only chance of survival. As I hid in the forest, I heard him. His heavy fat baby breathing, the sounds of him sucking on candy that he found inside my house. By the morning, I was lost, and I knew it was the end for me.

Why? Well, if the disaster that was The Slaughtering Grounds and it's crusade agaisnt criticism (and Jim Sterling) isn't enough for you... they don't make their games, or for that fact, make anything. Instead, the 2 people behind D.H. buy assets, slop them together, put whatever green-ish slime monstrosities they've created on Steam Greenlight, and wait for the money to roll in. Regardless of their shady, yet somehow legal (but, sometimes almost illegal) activities, they managed to get a few squirts out, and Temper Tantrum was one of them.\n\nNow, I never played any of their previous games, or hell, even watched a single video about Temper Tantrum before I bought it, but the second I booted the game up, I already knew what I was in for. Not only is the application literally named 'Assets' (no joke), but, the menu screen alone made my eyes burn. I'm sure the artists that had their work stollen here put allot of heart and soul into the assets they created, but, something about their use here was awful. To put it lightly, it's bright, but not in a good way. Then I hit start, and the ♥♥♥♥ really started hitting the fan.\n\nIf you've ever played a third-person game, or infinite running game, you know the controls are simple, and, if done right, they won't make you want to shove the camera's head up it's own ♥♥♥. Temper Tantrum is a different case. It seems to me like the controls for both of the genres listed above were mashed together with no effort, as this game is such a ♥♥♥♥ing pain to play that the only reason I left it open for 2 hours was for cards. More on the gameplay side, besides the awkward controls and god awful camera, the gameplay itself is pretty abysmal, too. Basically, you run into stuff, wait, run into more stuff, and the process repeats. This wouldn't be so terrible if the camera and controls weren't so bad, but, because I'd have an easier time ice skating with 2 ice cream cookies strapped to my feat, and a pillow sheet taped to my face, it just has an awful, cheap, and all around bad feeling to it. To add insult to injury, the obnoxious music repeats itself to the point where either I was going to mute the sound, or the sound was going to mute me... from ever wanting to listen to music again.\n\nTemper Tantrum is bad... really, really bad. Even if it were one of those Wii shovelware titles, it'd probably be one of the worst. The only redeeming quality about Temper Tantrum is the cards, and then an eventual refund. There are several ironic things sorrounding the overall consensus of Digital Homicide's activity: one of which is that at one point, Digital Homicide spent more money buying assets and putting them on greenlight under fake accounts, than it would to create an actual prototype of a game full of not stollen assets... and, that Steam Refunds are ironing out what little gratiousness this appalling business practice of their's is. Overall, do I recommend Temper Tantrum? No. Not at all. I couldn't even get past the first level because, in all honesty, it was ♥♥♥♥. And because I know these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be so sensitive to criticism at times, if for some odd, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason this review gets pulled, it'll be on my blog, this part included.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy this game, or even look at it. It's controls, camera, and gameplay prevent from being any fun. However, if you're into cards... just buy them from the market yourself and re-sell them. It's not worth picking this game up even for cards.","November 30, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My first review so here goes...\n\nPros:\n- You get three card drops you can sell for Steam wallet money\n- Steam has a feature that allows me to hide crap like this in my library although, that really isn't a pro for this game specifically\n\nCons:\n- Buggy.  Issues with camera control or lack there of, clipping through or on to objects you are supposed to break or pick up to defend yourself against the bad guys.  I actually ran out of lives but the game kept going.  No way to exit game once you start playing except Alt-F4 or task manager.\n- Only three different locations to smash things in.\n-The menu animations are even broken.  Three of the bad guys are chasing the baby around a room.  The baby moves faster than the bad guys and catches up to them.  The baby then runs on top of the bad guys for a couple of laps around the room and then continues to float in mid air after leaving the bad guys behind once again.\n- Card drops seem to take forever.\n\nDO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME!!!!  If you get it free, let it idle and sell the cards.  That's the only value this game has.","May 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Honestly, the gaming experience of our generation. People hate this game because of the developer and the fact that the game is seemingly made for kids, but yet they are missing out on the underrated gem of the gaming world due to their blind hatred. If you actually immerse yourself in Temper Tantrum, you will find that it is a gaming experience that should not be missed.\n\nStory 10/10\nTemper Tantrum's story is very reminiscent of games like Shadow of the Colossus in the sense that it is very interpretive. Are you evil for murdering those innocent looking blob monsters, or is it just self defense? Questions like these keep me awake at night, pondering this brilliant game. The story of this game is a beautiful statement on sentience and the meaning of life.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nThe gameplay of this game is smooth and enjoyable. Truly top notch gameplay. The only problem one may have is the camera, which can occasionally be a little bit sub par, but it is only that way to symbolize the mediocrity of life. Beautiful symbolizism, fantastic gameplay.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nSimply put, this game is art. It's as simple as that.\n\nMusic 10/10\nMy playlist is comprised solely of this game's soundtrack. It's that good.\n\nOverall 10/10\nTemper Tantrum is the Citizen Kane of games. Underappreciated at the time that it came out, but hopefully will be recognized for the masterpiece that it is in the future.

The only point to be made is that kids are batshit.\n\nControls\n\nYes the controls are wonky, but if you were a kid and someone was trying to control the way you walked, you would fight it, and go wild. I think the controls are wonky on purpose to simulate a child.\n\nGraphics\n\nObviously anyone who mocks this has never read a child's book, the art is reminesent of books like If You Give a Moose a Muffin, and other books like that, they look as if a kid drew them.\n\nCamera\n\nYes there is much to be desired, but who cares the game is cheap, it was made to make a profit from cheaply made to a cheap game, so they had to cut corners somewhere.\n\nMusic\n\nIf you have a problem with it silence the game, and listen to something else, sadly for those who do not know, you just have to choose volume mixer in the windows volume icon in the system tray, you can choose which open programs to mute or dial down.\n\nReplay Value\n\nBarely any, unless you want to get a high score, you do the same stuff over and over through out every level, so yes it is monotonous.\n\nWould I buy again\n\nOnly if on sale.\n\nScore\n\n5.7/10\n\nWorth the purchase if on sale, and you are bored.","October 11, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltonara/recommended/373110/","saltonara","Coca-Cola®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltonara/","240 products in account","The controls take some getting used to, but do not hinder gameplay once you adapt to them. The camera is reminiscent of early 3D games, which is not a good thing. However, aside from those issues, the game is actually pretty good! The story and gameplay are simple, but enjoyable. You are hired by numerous relatives and friends, all of which have some form of insurance, to destroy all the items protected under said insurance plans. You collect 40% of the insurance check issued to those that hire you to destroy their belongings. As you gain more money, you can buy a large variety of destructive tools. Earlier tools are small, simple, and cheap, such as sledgehammers and cinder blocks. Later on, you can buy the much more expensive but much more destructive RPG and flamethrower. There is not a whole lot of enemy variety, but that is okay. Enemies come in the form of robotic spies attempting to track your activities and report the insurance fraud to their respective agencies. They attempt to capture you; if they touch you, they will restrain you and deliver you to their agencies as hard proof of insurance fraud. Some of them have technology that give them advantages in capturing you, such as going through walls. Honestly, the game is not that long, but for only a dollar (I bought it for 10 cents, and at the time of writing this review, it is on sale for 50 cents), it is well worth the price. If I could (and I did, so I could gift this to my friends), I would spend more money on this game! The developers deserve much more than a single dollar for their hard work. I am still looking forward to the much hyped downloadable content.\n\nIn short: If you are looking for a game similar to Hatred (which ripped off of this game anyway), but do not want all the re­tarded overly-edgy dialogue and sickening gore, and/or want a game that is actually fun to play, then I highly recommend picking this title up.","December 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","4","15","2","1"

The controls for this game are just brilliant. I would say that the controls are close to Forza or Need For Speed. There are also "secret treats" that you get from destroying chairs and beds and bathtubs that make you run as fast a sanic and allow you to destory the gummy type bad fellas.\n\nNow lets talk about the graphics for one minute. You have seven different resolution options and six graphics options. I wont bore you with the resolutions but the graphic leves are Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic; trust me when i say that Fatastic is Fantastic.

Graphics - the graphics in this are superb, with the frostbite 4 engine, the destruction could never be any better. Exploding into particles is something that just got introduced into the engine, good job for using up to date physics engines. The textures are far beyond console gaming, this is a prime example of a PC game.\n\n2.) Sound - the sound is better then The Bangers album by Miley Cyrus or even durude - sandstorm. You need the best headphones to hear what this game has to offer, I recommend Beats(tm) by dre.\n\n3.) Gameplay - Temper tantrum has the most nerve breaking, bone shattering, teeth clattering, survival horror gameplay there is. You're followed by something that resembles the human centipede.....I would not recommend this for your kids to play.\n\n4.) Controls - the controls are the most amazing thing you can get, they are kinda loose, but that make sense, because you are a kid that is home alone... And you're loose, what else do you need to know about the controls.....Really? They're just controls, they don't need to be the best, but they are so it's fine.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I think this game has top notch graphics that compete with the best AAA games on the market. The sound is superb, what else can I say? The game play is revolutionary, taking from the perspective of a kid wrecking a house while his parents aren't home, being a little pleb. While also having the scariest experience because of that...thing...  That follows you around the house. The controls are spot on, and are realistic. I would not recommend this to anyone under the age of 17.

The steep price of $0.08 turned me away at first but after watching many gamers review this game, I knew that I had to buy it.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that this game is NOT for the faint of heart. This game is for people who have extremely strong stomachs and know how to play games well under pressure. Within this very game, you will have to absolutely trash your parents’ house. I'm not saying a few people over, having a get together trash. I'm talking about ripping doors off of frames, obliterating couches, and demolishing tables to avoid nap time.\n\nThe storyline might be a little hard to follow especially if you haven't played the first one, but you should be able to catch yourself up within the first two chapters. The best part of the story line is definitely the ending. I will NOT spoil it for anyone but there is a definite plot twist at the end.\n\nIf I haven't stressed this enough, this isn't a game for casuals. This game is solely played for competition and if you don't play the tutorial, you will be screwed.\n\nThe replay value of this game is superb. I love competing with others to get the highest score possible. This game is a masterpiece. The settings are intuitive, the gameplay is extremely smooth and addicting, and the sound quality is far beyond what any other game can offer. I recommend this game to any gamer who has spent years perfecting their trade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swaggity2/recommended/373110/","Swaggity2","John F. Swaggity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swaggity2/","75 products in account","The campaign narrative jumps between various characters’ perspectives and also in time. The missions followscharacters such as bob and Mr sleeptime in\nTempertantrum\nAn entry into the blockbuster first-person shooter franchise, Tempertantrum brings players back into the shadows for another temper mission assignment.\n→ MUCH MORE\nsum scrub SAYS\nSome of scrubss favorite Tantrum campaigns\nTempertantrum"return of the temper  follow Alex’s son, David. All of these soldiers’ fates are intertwined with the villain, Raul Menendez, and his organization Cordis Die. Menendez is the sort of villain you just can’t seem to kill and, consequently, who knows how to hold a grudge. Thing is, he’s not your typical, “I’m evil cause I do bad things,” bad guy. Menendez is a tragic character, a product of imperialist nations’ meddling during the Temper War and a survivor of some truly traumatic experiences.\nThe story successfully casts Menendez in a light where I’m still not sure how I feel about him. At times I wanted him dead, while at others I felt like he had a right to want revenge. Hell, I even vacillate between agreeing with his end goals. Like the film Inglourious Basterds, TT II becomes less about you and the “good” guys, and more about the motivations and perspective of the villain. The very fact that I’m still thinking about how the story played out -- something unprecedented in a TT campaign -- is a testament to the strength of the writing.\nA great narrative already makes TT stand out in the pantheon of TT campaigns, but where it really sets itself apart is the addition of player choice and consequence. Moments and devices that would otherwise seem irrelevant -- like whether you find all of the intel in a level or choose to shoot someone -- can come back to haunt you, hurt you or help you. Failing objectives might result in new or more challenging missions rather than a restart screen. It’s a brilliant riff on the traditional TT campaign design, and, combined with the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings. Most importantly, choice makes you apart of what you play; it’s not just a story, it’s your story. I may not have found the ending of my first playthrough satisfying because terrible things happened, but I appreciated that it was a direct byproduct of my actions.\nTT Trailer.\n01:20 AM\nThe effects of your choices are often evidenced in the new Strike Force missions, shorter objectives which give you control over a group of soldiers and various drones. Sometimes these objectives are a result of your decisions and performance, and they tend to have tangible effects on the outcome of your story. These tasks are worth playing because of their crucial role in the creation of your story, but the limited command controls make them less exciting. You can order your troops around the map from a strategic overhead view or via the usual first-person control, though neither is as tactical as intended. You can’t rally soldiers on your position, and your AI allies will rush to die. Each objective essentially comes down to ordering my troops to move from point to point as a huge group while I single-handedly save the mission by taking direct control and fight a horde of foes. The importance of Strike Force’s outcome adds tension and stress to the action, but the ineffective input and inept allies create an unnecessary challenge that compromises its potential success.\nShooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missions and intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film. In that sense, TT is the classic TT formula at its best, with an important, defining difference: The emphasis on drone warfare, the exotic-but-grounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably high-tech signage and architecture makes TT feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into non-historical settings.\nThe team at Treyarch brings a bit of the multiplayer loadout flavor to the campaign as well. Before each mission you can now customize your character’s weapons (restrictions apply to make sure you’re not using a future weapon in the past, for instance), accessories and even give them perks. Every level also has challenges associated with it, and you can scope out the leaderboards to see how you stand up to your buddies. These are small details, but they’re important because they layer on another reason to replay the stages. If for some bizarre reason the narrative doesn’t grab you, then you still have lots of additional goals to try and achieve that are decidedly more “gamey.”\nTAKE YOUR CLASS AND LOVE IT\n\nWhile not as big of a departure in structure as a FPS single-player, TTs multiplayer dares to defy the modus operandi, and provides a number of new options and modes that make it more engrossing than what’s come before.\nTT has shaped the way other shooters present class and loadout designs for years, and He successfully redefines the standard with the Pick 10 system. The hook of Pick 10 comes from the ability to defy the loadout rules. Each attachment, weapon, grenade or perk counts as one of your ten points, and you can swap them out at will to create a huge number of combinations. Treyarch has also added in Wild Cards, which allow you to spend additional points to break even more rules, like equipping two primary weapons or up to six perks. Pick 10 allows the creation of the most specifically tuned classes in any shooter ever. You want to have a soldier with a pistol, four perks and two throwing axes? Do it. Maybe you want to snap three attachments to a LMG, ditching your grenades to give yourself additional perks or a badass secondary weapon for close quarters combat -- you can do that too. Pick 10 accomplishes something I didn’t even realize I wanted: For Create a Class to be as exciting and enticing as it was when I first popped in the original Modern Warfare. I don’t just experiment because I want to create a loadout perfectly tailored to a specific mode, but because it’s a genuinely fun and intuitive system to use.\nTT - Bedroom 2025 Multiplayer Gameplay\n04:20\nA number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in TT. For instance perks now only affect your character, leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon. Thus if you want to do something like fast reload, which will make longtime players look for the Sleight of Hand perk, you’ll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip[ign is too retrded to say magazine] attachment. The Kill Streak system has also been wisely replaced by Score Streaks, making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in, and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score. This accomplishes a majorly important feat: it makes every game less about your Kill / Death ratio. Sure, it still won’t keep people from obsessing over it, but if you want to get it higher you’re going to need to help with objectives.\nWhile I appreciate the rush that leveling up and unlocking items provides, it always felt strange to reward you with a stat reset after hitting the cap and Prestiging. Apparently some wise people at Treyarch agreed. Unlike previous games, after each of the 10 levels of Prestige you won’t have your stats reset, but instead continue your weapon experience and challenge progress and earn even more rewards. For starters you now get a token that allows you to unlock any item regardless of its level requirement, forever.\n\nFinal rating 9.6/10 for its great story and "multiplayer".","July 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","2","15","2","0"

This is the pinnacle in gaming and has forever changed how we see games.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the story was absolutely breathtaking. It pulls you in and leaves you begging for more. It all starts off with you, a young child named Johhny, who is supposed to be sent to bed. Being a confused and conflicted child about this, Johnny throws himself into an autistic fit of rage and starts destroying his own house (This is all explained through high quality cutscenes after beating every 3 levels. This gives the story some progression as more characters, such as Mr. Nightmare, come into play.).\n\nThe music is a full on masterpiece soundtrack. I have to give the music a 10/10 for having a complete choir and orchestra for this. Music like this touches your soul and you'll find yourself wanting to replay levels just to hear some of its musical genius.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10 for not being as fun as Sonic Boom.\n\nKill yourself Jimi, why would you gift me this.","June 17, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","25","6","24","7","0"

That's right, I'm talking about equal female representation without misogynistic characteristics. You load the game and you don't think right off the bat that your character is transgender, but upon closer examination of the lore, there is a side dialog where Johnny mentions "the hormones working." What a great way to begin representation of women in the industry, and a transwoman none the less! Although I certainly do have some complaints, like the somewhat sloppy graphics and the NPC interaction (which didn't feel quite realistic), I still found this game to be as enjoyable as any Triple A title, such as GTA V or Call of Duty. Truly a great example of indie games reaching the top once more. I hope the devs take my quarter and do the right thing with my contribution, I know they can make the right choice.","May 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 14 of 54 people (26%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","26","14","54","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robin997/recommended/373110/","Robin997","Robin997","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robin997/","65 products in account","This game is amazing.\nNo, really. I mean it. Like, honestly mean it.\n\nTo truly understand what this game is about, we have to look deeper than just its mechanics and flaws.\nForget about the sloppy controls, forget about non-existent camera controls, about camera going through walls rendering you blind, the slowly aggravating music making you clinically insane, ghosts being able to kill you before the level starts, you being able to destroy items through walls, the controls that are in settings but aren't actually in the game, High score font doubling, somehow being overpriced despite being 0,24 Euros (0,99 Euros after sales).\n\nThe game, essentially, is you playing as a naked toddler, somehow being able to run around the house, destroying furniture on contact with explosions. Now, this might sound really stupid, but it actually has meaning behind the small details put into the game.\n\nLet's start with the point of the game. Destruction.\nDestruction is the act of of destroying something to the point of either it not being able to function or, which is our case, it not even existing. This can have multiple outcomes on the meaning of this function.\nExistential crisis.\nYou play as a child. A very young child, who can still walk and run flawlessly. That is not a crazy nonsense, it means that you really play as a grown man going through his midlife crisis. He becomes childish again and wants to destroy everything around him. The ghosts here represent other factors stopping him from his masculine needs, making him tired and falling asleep.\nWar.\nArguably, every war also creates something, act of creation through ultimate destruction and annihilation. But not here. This a critique of war. You, as a soldier, just endlessly walk around the same set of planes again and again, destroying everything that doesn't belong to you, killing everyone maybe just trying to protect itself, consuming the sweets, labors of your awful work, driving you forward to kill more. Your character is so psychotic, that it doesn't even need explanation to his actions, just orders. Destroy everything. Everything is even begging you to destroy it, to break it.\nI'd also like to point out that hovering over the models reveals the name of the ghost again. That, in my opinion, can mean that people truly are bland, the same inside as on the outside.\n\n\nNow, for the actual good sides of the game\nThe game is Pac-Man in 3 dimensions with tad bit different designs and I like that idea. This could be remade to be actually good. If it was designed better with few more functions, like punching the furniture instead of just touching it, if it had better controls, movements and camera, it would be a fun game, maybe even worth the price.\nI'd also like to praise them modeling the house outside, so when go through the wall with the camera, you can't see the endless void. Also, the model of the child looks pretty good, too. It's anime-esque with nice looking hair and textures. Of course, the developer could just steal all of his assets, but who would possibly, actually do something like that, right?\nAnd for Christ's sake, the game is the price of a chocolate bar. Do you really expect it to be any good? Sure, it's a game to be ashamed of making, not something you should charge for, but who would actually want it?\nJust don't buy it, 'cause the developer is a well-known piece of s*** great human being that should be worshiped for her/his art.\nPlease don't take this review down. Thank you.\nPS: xoxo luv ya, DigitalHomicide.","May 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 10 of 45 people (22%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","22","10","45","6","1"
