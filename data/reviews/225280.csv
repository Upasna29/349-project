If you have finished everything you can team up with people and do a very hard mode to keep a challenge online. Even though dieing makes you start over you keep leveling up and adding stats. This really keeps it fun to play. Love the game. They keep working and updating the game frequently. The developers answer and read almost everything on the discussion which is great.\nSeriously Recommend this game to everyone.","December 19, 2013","true","24.7"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","73","79","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/recommended/225280/","thesickboy","SickBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/","483 products in account","*Review edited for release... still nothing but good things to say about it!*\n\nThere is tons more I could say about this game and how much I enjoy it than what is in this review, so free to message me on Steam if you have any questions. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new in your roguelike/dungeon-crawling experiences... it was *the* most polished Early Access Alpha I had ever played, and is even better now that it is released.\n\n\nGraphics\nVery nice and consistently styled, even in the character screen. The choice in what a friend of mine put as "playful yet macabre" is spot-on, and a very nice change of pace from other roguelikes (not that those are bad, but FMR is a unique breath of fresh air).\n\nSound\nEverything from the music to the effects is lovely and fitting to the visual theme. Moody, atmospheric, ethereal, magical, mysterious, spooky... that is what comes to mind while playing and it's a joy to listen to! Some of the tracks really remind me of the greatness that was the soundtrack for Psychonauts (my favorite game of all-time).\n\nControls\nSmooth and intuitive when using the keyboard+mouse (controls are customizeable as well, so you can play however you want). I don't play games this twitch-reliant with a controller, but feedback about it in general has been very positive.\n\nGameplay\nThe randomization, pin/item/relic/Loa/leveling "build" system works really well but isn't so random that you're screwed if you get bad drops. Since your core setup is however you want to do it (and very easy to experiment with), there is enough consistency to do theorycraft and gameplay mastery... a *very* nice change from the *completely* random roguelikes. I love randomization, but it's nice to have something to play that is a good mix of random and static.\n\nThe variety in gameplay is great, giving a pleasurable dose of strategic fighting and completely chaotic shmup-style play. Because FMR has this kind of variety, you never really get sick of it. Just when you're tired of one style, you roll a level that's totally different. I'm over 125 hours into it as of this writing, and I'm still not even close to be tired of any of it.\n\nProgression is incredibly satisfying, but I'll speak more to that below.\n\nGenre\nWhile the game is most commonly categorized as a roguelike (or rogue-lite), I see it as a mix of roguelike, bullet-hell/shmup, and dungeon-crawler. It's a fantastic mix, and adds a ton to the scale and variety of traditional roguelikes.\n\nDifficulty\nSome may find their intital play sessions to be too easy, but the difficulty curve is not even remotely a cakewalk later on. If you feel it's too easy, just keep playing...  later difficulties/quests are *much* harder and varied. You'll soon find yourself cursing (joyfully) at failed runs. Because of this, I do *not* consider this game a rogue-lite... if anything, it's just one that isn't ultra hardcore in the start and eases you into the insanity. A perfect game to introduce someone to the genre, but has enough hardcore craziness to keep even the most experienced of players happy.\n\nDifficulty in this game is where the real progression and satisfaction resides. Leveling/etc. is a nice way to ease the player into the various mechanics of the game, but the meat of it all is in the variety of difficulties you unlock. Don't expect to be carrot-and-sticked the entire time with pointless leveling and unlocks... instead, expect to get your satisfaction from mastering incredibly difficult situations that (in the later difficulties especially) require perfected playing skills.\n\nContent\nLevel modifiers, difficulties, level palletes, mission objectives, mobs (and their variations), bosses, items, Loas, etc. all have a great amount of variety already, and further post-release patches are planned which is just icing on the already delicious cake. I was already very happy with the content amount in the early alpha, and that has far more than doubled between then and release. Because of the amount there is, and because of how it's sectioned out between the different quests, you always have a ton of choice depending on your mood and a helluva lot to experience, master, and be surprised by.\n\n\n\nA quick note: I am in the credits for the game for the QA work I was voluntarily doing (a nice surprise, so thank you devs!). I am not a developer or paid contractor for this game and have no bias in that regards... I just love testing, and the community was silent during a time when they really needed feedback so I stepped up. My review would be exactly the same even if I hadn't done testing for it.","April 13, 2014","true","137.2"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","5"

It’s got a Torchlight/Rough Legacy feel to it, with   rpg elements to craft your character to your liking.\n\nYou’ll probably die trying to  survive the first 30 waves (to win the first stage),  which means starting over, but each time it’s slightly different because  you retain your XP that gives you added benefits due to the rpg elements,   plus missions and events change  as well as the dungeons being  procedurally generated,  meaning   something different every time you replay.\n\nThe design and character animations are  gorgeous, each enemy having a memorable skin. Learning attack patterns is pretty easy   (there’s a shed load  of them even in this early build). By the time    this game is  fully released it's going to be worth every  penny; though, no doubt  you’ll be able to get this  at a   good discount   very soon.  :)","December 12, 2013","true","1.8"," 58 of 71 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","58","71","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/recommended/225280/","zulmetefza","zulmetefza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulmetefza/","1233 products in account","To sum it up, open world Isaac. You will like this if you also liked Isaac. But you may like this even if you did not, since it has some unique properties as well. But, it does not feel that complete yet, although it surely is fun.\n\n(the game is not an openworld game though, but comparing this to Isaac the feel is there)\n\nFeatures:\n- The world is less randomized than it is required to be a roguelike. Actually, only order of the subquests and enemy types changes each time. While the map is also randomly generated, it does not do anything to the gameplay.\n- Mojo Mixer is a well thought mechanism, really adds to strategic depth. And feel of shrines whether it is a risky choice or a gift is well done.\n- It has a story, and a mild sense of humor.\n- Gameplay-wise actually this is better than its counterparts.\n- Just tried two of the gods, felt really unique. This is how it should be.\n- There should be more achievements and rewards for completing each quest for different gods etc.\n- Daily quests is useful to continue to play. So is endless mode.\n- Even though the gametime is short, it is a hard game even at normal difficulty. And there is 4 more level. So it would have long gameplay.\n- Use of wands is too shallow, since there is not any seperate wands inventory. Found a good wand but killed the boss already? This is sad, since it wont be with you for long.\n- Persistence between lives is not overdone, so it does not feel like grinding.\n- Item designs are good. But there are a few to be considered a roguelike. In my current playtime (6 hours) I saw more than half of them.\n\n-i forgot one thing. optimization with this game just sucks. I am playing at 1280x720 resolution and medium level of graphics, and it barely is okay with my newly bought laptop. (I played better games with better settings) Since this is a roguelike, and roguelike players are not into graphics that much, this is not a big problem.\n\n-UPDATE(03.02.15): This game's last content update was in May 2014. If this attitude of developers continue, I may change my review into a negative one, since being a roguelike requires randomness, and randomness requires lots of content.","November 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyCanadian/recommended/225280/","DirtyCanadian","DirtyBeardedCanadian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyCanadian/","698 products in account","FMR is a must grab on Steams summer sale, and here is my review on why.\n\nOver the Top Games is the independent game development studio( w/5 game developers) behind the multi-award winning NyxQuest. Founded in 2008 and based in Madrid - Spain. FMR was released on May 8th, 2014. It has a Voodoo theme that works & characters are "cute". The game mechanics are solid and fluid. ( I used the 360 controller so can't give opinion on K & M ) I haven't had any crashes or lag issues at all. The development team is planning to release free content updates as well.\n\nThe music is a nice horror/fun mix from the talented composer Alistair Lindsay, for thosse that don't know the name he has done games such as ~ Prison Architect, LostWinds, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, and even helped with the Rare classic Jet Force Gemini.\n\nThe game itself doesn't really hold a story ~ but buying this game I wasnt really looking for one. It's tagged as a rogue-like game but I find it a lot more forgiving than most true rogue-likes, as others have called it and I agree it's more rogue-lite. Don't let that discourage you if like games such as Binding of Issac ~ Rogue Legacy ~ Risk of Rain you'll find easy to understand gameplay with a fair amount of depth to it. Character progression & customization that you keep even after death. Boss encounters provide a fun challenge. Loads of items to find while running around. FMR has solid 3D graphic style, lighting & shadow effects all seemed solid.\n\nMy rating for Full Mojo Rampage ~\nGraphics 5 of 5\nMusic & sounds 4.5 of 5\nMultiplayer N/A ( but have heard good things.)\nGameplay 4.7 of 5\n\nOverall score 4.7 and worth the buy!\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my review, cheers!\n\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","8.9"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","30","39","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/225280/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nJust wanted to point out first that my game time that has been recorded on Steam is incorrect. I have spent at least eight hours playing this game.\n\nFull Mojo Rampage is a rogue-like game that has similar traits to that of Binding of Isaac and another top-down game, Torchlight. The game was released in mid 2014. Although the game promotes co-op game play, the game's servers are pretty empty when trying to find a multiplayer game; with that being said, the game is still mega fun to play solo.\n\nYou take control of a Voodoo master; game play is a top down shooter where you have a normal attack, and two special attacks which are different for each class. At the start of the game you have a very basic class but you are able to unlock extra classes as you progress by using medals which you collect throughout the game and by finishing quests. The gameplay is very simple, but extremely addictive. As you explore each of the randomly generated levels you run into plenty of enemies to test your voodoo magic on. The game is also very loot orientated too, you start out with an initial two equitable item slots; most of the items which you equip will be voodoo dolls, these will increase your stats. You also have three inventory slots which can hold items such as extra ability items (such as boost speed for a certain amount of time etc).\n\nThe graphics are awesome. It has that childlike aesthetic but still very pleasing to look at. The cartoony stylized characters have some great models and animation on each of the characters/enemies are also very good.\n\nAt times in the game I struggled with the difficulty; but then I remembered that it is a rogue-like, and you are meant to die. Thankfully dying  is not a massive issue in Major Rampage as you get to keep all of your money, experience and levels each time. This means you are able to build up your character to the point where it is very hard to die on the same bit over and over again. This also gives you the opportunity to fine tweak your character to exactly how you want to play it.\n\nEach of the levels appears to be randomly generated,  I can't remember seeing the same layout twice. In each of the levels there are also extra rooms around the map to go into which include shops to buy potions, or new voodoo dolls, hidden chests with coins and items in, or the feature which I really liked, the ability to combine two voodoo dolls into one, which then frees up another slot in your equipped-able items.\n\nA full playthrough of all the quests on one single character took me about five hours from start to finish. You also get the chance to replay the levels all over again on Brutal difficulty which gives you the chance to increase your characters level even further.  With the option of being able to unlock other characters the replay-ability factor in Full Mojo Rampage is very high.\n\nI really recommend Full Mojo Rampage to any fan of the dungeon crawling, rogue-like genre as the single player is very well done and will keep you wanting to progress further and further each time. Sadly I found it very difficult to find a game online, but being able to play with friends on co-op mode maybe another redeeming factor here.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you are a lover of Rogulike games, just buy it. This game is near ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perfect.\n\nAs the game's title say Full Mojo Rampage is Rogue-like games with playable voodoo characters in Vodoo reality. There is 8 playable character and need medals to unlock them (10 medal each). Each voodoo character has their own special abilities. Also you can unlock pins while playing the game and then you can use them to get some special buffs to your health/damage etc. There are some blessing which is limited to use (one time only actually) and requires medals.\nWhat I explained is our character and stats screen. You can change your character, select pins and blessings and one more thing that you can level up and upgrade your stats (health,speed,fire rate,damage etc).\nYou can only return to your character screen when you died via Exit.\n\nFull Mojo Rampage is not really a friendly game but you used to play it - it becomes to get easier. Anyway, as i said it's not friendly at the first times, but after some time you collect gold, you got exp then die, then return to menu, upgrade - unlock something and clear the quest. There is only 4 quest and different modes Survival Unlimited / Daily Quest / Night Of The Dead Spirits. Main 4 quest are includes 4-5 levels and some side quests with Vendor and Shrine level. You can buy something ingame or upgrade your pins/blessings later. Also there is some relics which is wearable.\nYou can unlock different game difficulties when finished a quest. There is more than 5 different difficulty for game and they're type of tumor and if you think that game is easy on current normal mode, play them, they are zero percent friendly.\n\nGameplay and goal is simple. You have wands, ranged. You can get different wands but they have charge. This game contains lot of enemy and boss types, it is good for a rogue-like game btw. Goals for clearing the level is basically like that ; There is two portal, destroy them or Find rums (hidden in the barrels)...\n\nAnd at last I want to talk about graphics and level design. Good enough, nuff said.\n\n4 Quests, dozens type of levels, dozens of unlockables... Maybe a little short but worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/recommended/225280/","uncleyar","UncleYar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/","2125 products in account","My first impressions. I love roguelike-inspired games such as Spelunky or Binding of Isaac but I'm not impressed with this one's gameplay so far. To its credit, its technical and artistic realization seems flawless. Haven't encountered a single bug yet, and the game's gorgeous.\n\nBut before I get to the pros and cons, information time for people who are new to the genre. This is not a true roguelike. Those are turn-based, have true permadeath (no permanent progression) and typically have unidentified items with sometimes dangerous properties. They do share procedural generation and random item and monster apparition with Full Mojo Rampage and other "roguelites".\nExamples of true, very fun, free roguelikes:\nhttp://crawl.develz.org\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/\nhttp://doom.chaosforge.org/\nThis said roguelikes have inspired a lot of real-time games, starting with Diablo. From now on we'll just call this game a roguelike because it's just more handy.\n\nCons:\n- The first level of the first mission, which you're gonna replay a lot of times, is boring with only two enemy types plus the occasional bigger version, healer or miniboss. You need to explore the whole thing to get all the chests and special locations, but it feels empty and uninteresting.\n\n****HERE'S A NOTE TO ROGUELIKE DESIGNERS: PUT MOST OF THE VARIETY IN THE EARLIER LEVELS, WE'RE GONNA PLAY THEM THE MOST****\n\n- Huge difficulty spike in the second level with the apparition of kamikazes and direct shooters, aggro a few too many monsters and you're completely overwhelmed. Then to have a chance to get used to it you must replay the first boring level.\n- Grindy. Because of the permanent leveling and permanently upgradeable unlocks, the aforementioned second level is gonna get easier, but only after you restart the game several times. But then, the first level is gonna be even more boring because it presents even less of a challenge. Contrast that to Spelunky and Binding of Isaac where you can never let your guard down even in early levels.\n\n****SECOND NOTE TO ROGUELIKE DESIGNERS: PERMANENT STATS PROGRESSION MAKES YOUR GAME GRINDY, STICK TO UNLOCKING NEW STUFF TO FIND WITHIN RUNS.****\n\n- Your max range is not well-defined, at its edge it can look like projectiles hit enemies but they don't. Thankfully there's always a sound for successful hits.\n- The items that change how you shoot are limited-use. That means you'll be shooting the same boring projectile most of the time. You can't even save them for when you really need them, as they instantly replace your default shot.\n- You get lots of items but they don't have the same impact as in Binding of Isaac or Spelunky, most give you either 5 to 10% passive buffs or one-use effects.\n- System for combining items sounds interesting at first, but it simply puts the characteristics of two items on one. So no Shin Megami Tensei demon combining here, it just means backtracking to free up an inventory slot: boring.\n- Enemies spawn as you move, and if you're moving towards the bottom of the screen, that means super close to you. Good luck if those are kamikazes. At least there's a sound to warn you of it, but I think the game would've been better with a Torchlight/Diablo-like enemy placement.\n\nPros:\n+ Great music\n+ Good controls, I like the mouse-driven shooting\n+ Nice graphics and theme\n+ Classes (gods) play very differently\n+ Many items to find and unlock\n+ From an initial look, good variety of environments and bosses\n+ The effects of items can be creative and funny: giant chicken, disco ball and so on.\n+ Daily generated dungeon which you can try and then compare your score to the community.\n\nI'll revise my evaluation if I play it again and it feels more fun, but so far I don't feel like going back to it... bad sign.","November 13, 2014","false","2.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","2"

I will mention Gauntlet rather a lot in this "review", btw.\n\nThe first point, and it's a reasonably large one, that this game scores over Gauntlet is that it has genuinely random (thus replayable ad inifinitum*) levels and a fairly expansive character customization section make this a far more worthwhile purchase. Gauntlet promised randomised, limitless levels and failed to deliver, preferring instead to rotate a level through 180degrees or make you do them "the opposite way round" (from start to finish in a 'death' level, for example). It's obvious, woeful and does nothing to hide the fact that you're always playing from a small group of levels that can easily be remembered, no matter what way round they are.\n\nThere are also more "world types" than in Gauntlet.\n\nThe player upgrade system is somewhat similar but, again, full mojo rampage has a better one. There's more to spend your ingame currency on and the prices of everything gets quite high so you need to take time to find cash. This isn't annoying, however. Also, found items can be sold in the shops ingame, which produces a lot of extra cash. Item drops are random and there are a LOT of different items that you can find. You can also mix together 2 items to get a single item with all the effects of the 2 individual ones. This is a fun way to make interesting "charms" to equip and also an interesting way to cause a sort of "inventory game" to arise, wherein the player must decide what stuff to keep/dump in favour of potentially more useful items. You can also expand your inventory, too, so it's possible to carry more. I liked this aspect of the game as, again, it adds another random dimension to things that makes each playthrough different.\n\nI've put a fair amount of time into the game and I still find it fun to go back and play more. Also, I have yet to complete all of the levels on "hardcore" difficulty, which requires a more levelled up character. I think, beyond that, there's "nightmare" or "insane", something like that, so there's plenty of reason to return and play more*. I will be trying to finish all the levels at all skills and will probably wind up doing so at some point. I see this definitely as a game I can return to in future as I've enjoyed it and it does a lot of things that I, personally, like in games.\n\nSome people have said this is tough but I think it's reasonably easy, it's far easier to solo than Gauntlet, for example, which is easy enough but you have to adhere to a plan/play style to get through. You have much more option to just "muck around" in full mojo rampage, as a result of the levels being more open and monsters spawning/wandering randomly instead of coming from "summoning stones" in closed rooms (another bad point about the new version of gauntlet).\n\nFinally, it's not really a roguelike, tbh. There's a lot of games called Roguelikes these days but I would say this has much more in common with something like Gauntlet or Alien Syndrome. Neither of which are roguelikes. Unless you count Gauntlet 4. People seldom do, despite it being by far the best version (genesis cart, have a look if you like Gauntlet). HOWEVER, I did play one game where I was transported to a random dungeon that was made of ascii and I had to fight various "G" and "M" symbols. This was excellent and I would probably play the whole game in this manner if the option existed. There are some nice little diversions like this in the game. As I've mentioned, you're never quite sure what's going to pop up and, for this reason and the others above, I rate this as a really good and fun game.\n\nThe online works well, too.\n\n*If you enjoy the premise and play style of the game, of course.","December 1, 2014","true","31.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyblade799/recommended/225280/","Skyblade799","[CZ]Skyblade799","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyblade799/","644 products in account","This game pleasantly suprised me.\nIt plays similarly to games like binding of issac or nuclear throne, being a top down shooter with a large inclusion of roguelike elements.\nThe gameplay involves doing a variety of differing quests in order to complete levels, while collecting items to make yourself more powerful. Some examples inclide destroying the summon pillars, collect x amount of items, and destroying waves of enemies quickly to weaken a boss. Combat is that of a twinstick shooter, focusing on movement while attacking surrounding enemies. Each level is procedually generated, and the player progresses over a world map aiming to reach the end through beating each stage. Death in the game without special items requires the player to start over in the chapter. In online co-op the players have a shared pool of 3 lives, but if that pool runs out, then they lose.\n\nThere are various classes in game which each have their own unique abilities and rampage effects. The beginning class has dodging, a sort of fire mortar, and the rampage involves summoning an ally to your aid. Later examples include the ability to summon stationary totems to deal damage, or sacrificing ones own health to deal damage. The inclusion of the class abilities gives a reliable way to deal with challenges without having to worry about your luck being down, and gives the player a fairer chance to survive without item drop luck being a trouble(compared to other games of the type)\n\nThe game includes more customization then just class though, also including various unlockable and upgradable pins which modify starting stats, many unlockable masks (for visual difference only), and a levelling system which gives minor stats through leveling. (Though this same leveling also is required to unlock use of the pins). The leveling so far hasn't seemed to imbalance the game, as it has remained difficult throughout. As well, it includes a variety of difficulty levels which unlock as you beat each chapter. Each difficulty level seems to add more hazards, as the one right after the normal difficulty makes enemies harder, whlist adding a chance for enemies to drop bombs after death (and there are about 3-5 more difficulties after that).\n\nThere are many items in FMR, with a variety of upgrades, weapons, and consumables. There are about 12 weapons, each weapon with a unique projectile. Each weapon not only has the base projectile type such as a beam or a boomerang style poison cloud, but also includes randomly chosen bonuses, including extra projectiles, bonue damage, and extra charges. Though each weapon has a certain amount of ammo before it runs out, each weapon can be stored in the inventory for later use. All relics and inventory items can be swapped out for others at any time for other ones, though as well the player is limited to a max of 5 relics and 5 inventory items after obtaining upgrades (the player starts with base 2 relics and base 3 inventory).\n\nRelics (also known as mojo's) are the primary items for upgrading your character. Their effects vary from the base mojo giving base stat upgrades such as health, damage, crit chance, or a percent chance of a homing missle, to the unique mojo's which give larger bonuses as well as unique effects, such as heal on critical hit, or enemies summoning a black hole on death. The inventory can hold weapons, relics (for later use) and usable/consumable items. Usable items are more often one use only, but others have a timed recharge. The inventory items have a large variety, with such items as a temporary spread shot potion, a disco ball that distracts enemies, a pipe which summons an allied cannon or kamakazee pack, and a passive knife which permanently buffs you once you land the killing blow on four elite enemies.\n\nThere are also coins for shop items and pin upgrades, and tokens for unlocking classes and masks. A feature which does bother me a little is the fact that coins are continuous between games, meaning that players can purchase all of the items they want after upgrading all of their pins, and don't have to worry about money like in games such as issac. I'd rather prefer that coins be added up into an upgrade bank after each run, but have each run start off with no money.\n\nEnemy variety is fairly big. Though each stage only has a certain amount of differing enemies, there are many stages to choose from, such as swamps, lava pits, caves, dungeons, and pipe ridden distilleries, each with different enemies. Each stage also features background secrets which grant items, and each stage has their own different looking secret (though a little more variety in the secrets for each stage would be appreciated). Not only is there a variety of base levels, but as you go through each chapter, a larger variety of quests and areas are given, and though the first chapter may lack in some variety in quests at first, progressing certainly causes the game to open up. The game also features boss encounters which do seem to change in some encounters, but since I've played some chapters more then otherss, I don't know which have changing encounters. Nonetheless, the bosses were challenging and fun, and each one functioned differently.\n\nAside from the main levels, there are also side areas accesible from the map, such as shops, mojo mixers, shrines, and challenges, all with very different ways of functioning. The shops are what you would expect, allowing one to buy and sell items. The mojo mixer is a unique area of incredible value, which allows the player to combine two mojos (upgrade relics) into one upgrade, saving precious upgrade slots, and allowing one to equip more relics. The shrines have a variety of effects, some being purely positive, while others end up being more risk/reward. The possible effects of the shrine depend on the class the player chooses, and in online co-op, all of the different players classes are chosen from for the possible shrine effects. As well, in online co-op, shrine reward items are distributed depending on how many players there are, so that other players don't get left out. The challenges are varied as well, ranging from destroying a mini boss in someones nightmare, to fighting off enemy skeletons to defend friendly zombies.\n\nRight now there are only base 4 chapters, a survival mode, unlimited survival, and a generated daily quest (similar to spelunky). Each chapter is procedually generated in both the selected map layout, and the individual stages, and though I haven't yet tried it, I would assume the survival would include some sort of random elements as well. Though 4 chapters doesn't seem like a lot, they have taken quite a bit of time to get through, plus  I haven't yet tried variety of other difficulties, or the survival mode. As well, if you enjoy the leaderboard focused daily challenges in something like spelunky, then the daily challenge will likely interest you.\n\nI haven't tried the local co-op, so I cannot speak for whether or not it is very different from the online co-op, but the online co-op is a blast, though some of the mechanics may put some off. Players have a shared 3 life pool, and once a single player dies after they are all lost, the the run is lost. As well, players must revive eachother when they fall. A player can obtain other ways of revival, but there is no way to regain shared lives to my knowledge. Players must share items they come across, including weapons, upgrades, items, and coins. I personally like this fact, as it ecourages a team sharing of items to help with other players builds, but there are a few downsides. The inventory and relic upgrade slots at the time of typing cannot be dropped, and players can accidentally pick them up, even if they have reached the maximum for that slot type. As well, coins are not shared, and cannot be dropped.\n\nOverall, it's a wonderful game in my opinion. I absolutely reccomend it.","May 15, 2014","true","28.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Until this day. It is quite addictive, every death and failure you experience makes you want to beat the string of dungeons more. It has a great mini-shop theme to it, in most dungeons there are two shops. #1 is just a general store type thing, allowing you to buy a randomized four items. #2 is a place that allows you to merge two items together. That is a really nice touch and I love the idea! The stat system I found quite good. It included all of the basic information I believe a game in similar style needs, although I do wish the stat system would be more consistent and/or more dependent on stats. Sometimes you get low level to medium level items and other you get high level to godlike level items. It doesn't happen often, but when it does I would consider calling your character overpowered. But, it isn't that much of an issue. Onto the music, graphics and storyline; The music is spot-on. I have no criticisms there! The graphics were also well done, style and otherwise! Things like rain were a nice tough indeed. Now, storyline... It has a small part in the game, and is mostly apparent at the starting cinematic. Bits and pieces are glimpsed rarely in-game. There is a lot of un-used potential there. Possibly another game mode? From what the cinematic and in-game things you do see, I can see no flaws.\n\nTallying up the scores!\n\n- Basic stat system (+1 | Could have gotten a +2.5)\n- Music (+2.5)\n- Graphics (+3)\n- Storyline (+2 | Could have gotten a +3.5)\n\nA grand total of 8.5 out of 10!\n\n(Did I miss anything? Leave a comment! I recommend this game, grab a copy definitely! Thanks for reading. Steam is only saying I have spent 5 hours in the last two weeks. Keep in mind I played this for 5 hours today.)\n\n~ Galen.","August 23, 2014","true","26.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can use two magic spells (determined by which parent Loa you selected before starting your session) that work on a cooldown system; there is no mana management. There are randomized loot drops and randomized levels born from themed tile sets. The gameplay is real-time; the world will not pause when the player(s) stop moving. Online co-op supports up to 4 players.\n\nWhile death is assured, your little character will keep experience points that allow them to increase their stats upon leveling up. Gold is also kept, and is mainly used to upgrade your voodoo pins (think of them as traits you can select before each quest; these can include increased health, damage, starting off with an extra inventory space, etc.). Gold can also be used to buy things should you come across a shop while playing. You will become innately stronger as you continue playing, which means that progression is essentially repeating the quest until it becomes easy enough to complete. Don't mistake this for boring grind though, I feel that the randomization in stage layout and treasure drops works quite well in varying up each playthrough.\n\nOnce a quest has been completed, you will unlock the next quest as well as an elevated difficulty version of the recently completed quest. There are multiple difficulties to beat; these arent just stat increases for the enemies, but also a variation in the types of enemies that spawn and unique modifiers such as enemies dropping bombs on death or having golden bullets that kill in one hit. I think there is plenty of replayability.\n\nThe visuals are quite nice, as are the aesthetics for the different levels. The enemies look decent enough, but I feel they aren't as inspired as they could have been. Most of your time is spent fighting either zombies, skeletons, giant spiders, or evil shamans. Yes, they are fitting, this is a game themed around voodoo after all, but more imaginative enemies would have been fun to encounter. The mobs you'll be spending the most time with either run straight at you, or spit out projectiles in your general direction. There is a bit of enemy variation though, some hop around and send out a spiral of harmful bolts each time they land, and one is a train of common mobs that conga-line their way off walls like that old school dvd splash screen, but overall they're just 'eh'. Boss encounter are pretty much upsized trash mob encounters; they'll spit out projectiles for some bullet-hell type gameplay, bounce around the stage, or just move at you to hurt you.\n\nThere is a wave survival gamemode of the endless or 30-round variety, and a pvp mode with deathmatch, team deathmatch, koth or ctf. There is also a watered-down local co-op mode. The 3 joining players will play as ghosts of the main character without the magic spells or inventories; they cannot equip their own loot.\n\nAll in all, I think it's worth the money & time. It's fun and there's plenty of content, with the devs stating they're totally into adding more.\n\nSome parting advice for co-op though, play with people you know or organize a like-minded group. The loot drops aren't instanced for each player and, being the internet, one person could easily horde all the stuff.EDIT: A patch has added the option for gold & voodoo pin items to be instanced for each player.\n\nI dig this game, and if the info & opinions I've shared don't put you off, I think you would too.","May 21, 2014","true","13.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've had nothing but a fun time playing this game so far.\n\nYou start out on a world map akin to super mario games, you select an area to go to and after/if you beat that one the paths leading to the next area(s) are unlocked.\n\nI played using xbox one/360 controller but I see it has native support for PS3 controllers and mouse/keyboard gameplay.  It is a twin-stick game where you move with the left stick and aim your attacks with the right stick.\n\nThe world map is semi-randomized in that the 'story' levels are laid out in the same order but the paths and branching rooms/events are randomized each playthrough.   The levels themselves are also randomized so the game is never the same twice.\n\nIt has the mechanics where your character starts out weak, but as you collect experience points and coin/medal drops from slain enemies, these carry over to your next playthrough when you inevitably die.   You get to choose to increase health/damage/movementspeed/attackspeed each time you level up from experience points.   You spend gold upgrading "permanent" items you find in the world, of which you get to choose to use a limited selection of on each playthrough.\n\nYou start out playing only one style of character (your "Loa" (voodoo god?)) determines the ability set that you use during that playthrough.   As you kill enemies, find secrets, open treasure chests you get items called 'Mojos' which add (for that playthrough only) various bonuses to your character (such as a % chance to fire a homing missile out of your wand, or +% bonus healing, or +health on kill, etc).  You start out with a few slots to put these items in, as you play you unlock or gain extra slots through various means.  You can also combine these Mojos together if you get lucky and find a room that allows you to do so, which adds the two items' bonuses together in one item, allowing you to add more Mojos to a now empty slot.\n\nEach 'world map' leads to a boss fight, where if you complete it you go on to the next section.  Each level seems a bit tougher, so you don't get very far at first.   I've played the game for several hours now and it looks like I have a looooong way to go yet.  There is a daily quest to do to compare yourself to others and see how well you do.\n\nVery fun game, hard to put down, recommended for sure!","August 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have 4-5 slots to carry all these lovely things around at the begining, but there's even drops that increase your item slots allowing you to carry more power. not to mention a mojo mixer altar where you can combine 2 Mojo Badges into 1 while keeping all the stats in a purple epic glow\n\nThe game has perma death (eek!) but the xp, gold and medals collected during the game last through your demise, allowing you to purchase more skill points - you also level up and get stronger the more you play, there is an afterlife for stats so its a rogue-lite\n\nThe developers have added veriety everywhere. Chapter are differant from each other each containing its own unique level bioms and missions (some are straight up kill everything, some involve finding items, theres a death labrynth maze level + more. the level layout is randomly generated), There's no ordinary class selection. In the voodoo world your 'class' is determined by which diety you choose to follow. Each of these dieties called 'Loa's' have ugly faces and award you with two unique active spells and one special passive skill. each deity also randomly spawns a unqiue consumable drop for you during play (some heal u, some do damage etc), and instead of skill trees you have upgradable voodoo pins; of which there are a lot, but you can only carry 2 at the begining, but you're able to carry more as you level up (i think i have 4 pin slots at lvl 11). you can mix and match your Loa skills with either healer pins or dps pins or cc pins to see which works for which play style\n\nThere's also a good variety of enemies to kill, and loads of stuff to find, upgrade and loot! The controls are tight (I use a xbox pad, its excellent for this), the soundtrack is fitting and the gameplay is difficult enough so that youll need to level up and replay each chapter few times before being able to beat it. The game is also very polished - running smooth since alpha, so smooth i forgot it wasnt released yet.\nA multiplayer mode was also added close to release - which i still havent tried, was determined to finish the single player first.\nall-in-all a charming indie shooter that oozes its own fresh voodoo character. Awesome rogue lite action. good times^^ - a big wet and warm thumbs up for this game! one of my favourites","May 8, 2014","true","31.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You level up your character to increase stats like health, damage, and attack rate to help you along your journey.

Yes, Full Mojo Rampage *is* like that Binding Of Isaac game. In that same way that BoI is like Berserk; Improved upon in virtually every way. It's like if Blizzard decided to put their unique, super-effective pass of polish and gloss on a BoI game.\n\n- The Mojo/Relic/Inventory system is a nice 'tactical balance' constant decision spot for the player to get caught up in, as are shops at which you can buy AND sell, and the Mojo Mixer, which lets you meld 2 individual powerups into a dual (cannot be melded further).\n- All Character Classes can be unlocked just by expending 10 Medallions (used to purchase Masks/Classes/Playthrough Bonuses), which are reasonably easy to find (can easily find 10 in a decent run - not even a good run). The Classes themselves have a good amount of playstyles represented, with the exception of a melee (although there is a close range / melee-esque class).\n- There are Persistent Systems for Player Level (each level you can upgrade one Stat slightly) and Gold, which can be spent in shops, or spent on upgrading persistent "Pins", which provide bonuses to your character such as extra inventory slots, more health or damage or critical chance, faster spell cooldowns, a chance to poison or slow enemies, etc. (you can carry 1-5 pins with you (Player level dependent) of the 25 or so available). Pins drop randomly during gameplay (I have yet to find a duplicate, but I still have 4 or so to find).\n- The level layout is randomized, as is the order or appearance of levels in the 'overworld map', for an extra layer of difference in each playthrough. Different Acts (Quests) have a very different base layout (in particular, Exploration Time Before Boss Fight decreases as you advance through the Quests).\n- Uses the same Elite Monster paradigm as Isaac/Risk Of Rain (and you know, Diablo/ Titan Quest), but I'm into the 3rd Act, and there definitely are not as many unique Bosses/Sub-Bosses as in Isaac.\n- Already has native gamepad support and genuinely good graphics (although I actually prefer the mouse aiming to twinstick shooting).\n- Has 2 Player Local and 4 Player Online Co-Op play (I have not yet sampled these modes)\n\nThe long and short of this is that Full Mojo Rampage gives me that 'Just one more game' feeling, as well as that pleasant surprise of getting that one item that saves your run, as well as that shock when your stupendously overpowered character dies miserably. Which brings me back around to just one more game.","November 26, 2014","true","22.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Overall great for an early access game.\n\nI haven't tried pvp game modes yet, so this review doesn't pertain to that at all.\nThe main gameplay in FMR is probably best described as a bullet hell style top down shooter, with random rogue-like and rpg elements. The solo and coop game modes are quest based, of which there are currently (as of Alpha 5) 3 quests and 1 survival quest. The quests themselves are randomly generated sequences of random dungeon-like levels and bosses, with other random surprises mixed in. When starting a quest, one starts on a fresh character, so all items and equipment (called relics in FMR) are only kept during this quest. If one dies in the quest, they cannot continue onward and lose all items / relics found during that run. However, players get experience towards level-ups which remain throughout all quest runs, and there are certain stat increasing items called pins that also remain. In this way, many have described it in terms of similar games as a mixture of The Binding of Isaac gameplay with Rogue Legacy style leveling. In my experience so far, I would say the items found during a run are far more important than stat collections from pins and leveling up, so it leans a bit towards the rogue-like side. I'd say it has a nice balance.\n\nAs for game performance, I have had zero issues in single player; the graphics look great and I have had no frame drops. There was slight lag in online multiplayer coop gameplay, but I think dedicated multiplayer servers are likely in store for a future FMR build, so that may improve. That being the only negative aspect I've yet to encounter, I give this game a thumbs up.\n\nFinally I should note the game development team is very active in the game forums, which is a plus.\n\nOverall, it is quite a lot of fun in its current state and will probably continue seeing great improvements during its development.","January 15, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now let's talk about the level randomization, it's 100% perfection, especially if you're going to play online with a person that has just bought the game, you'll experience that same feeling the person feels, excitement. Now heading on to the Shrines, here's the more that I think you should improve on, the Shrines can be REALLY rewarding at some times, but some of their spells are either too much or too little, like when you sacrifice -50% max health for more speed, I honestly think you could tone the speed down just a little bit, just my opinion, now let's move on to the gameplay itself, it has a few flaws but I see great potential in modes like Multiplayer, these flaws consist of only one thing that I've seen happen, I do not know if this is supposed to be a part of the game or not, but I will try to cast the fire bomb spell with the rmb and instead of the way my cursor is facing, it will shoot in the direction of what my Shaman is facing. So there's that. Overall I think this game should be a lot more popular on Steam, not to many games see my attention in the way that this game has, I would recommend this to anyone who plays The Binding Of Isaac to this game, it kinda has the same mechanic, die and you start over, but the way this game is built just makes it take a step foward infront of all the others, I honestly think that you should add Local Co-Op to this game though, seeing as that the Steam Machine is coming out, this would probably be the best couch co-op on Steam when the machine comes out. So bringing this review to a close, you like Voodoo, kicking ♥♥♥ in spooky graveyards, summoning a Loa that could ravage the countryside, and randomly generated maps for a new way to repeat that before said process? Get this game, it's damn well worth 15$","January 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say “little” but it is in fact quite vast. It’s still an in-development title, but what is present already would make for a full game in its own right very easily. Early access games usually give me a little bit of pause, but I took a chance on this one based on the art and gameplay style and thus far I have certainly not come away disappointed. Let’s jump right in shall we?\n\nTo begin with, I’ll cover the art style. It’s dark, it’s adorable, and quite frankly it fits with the overall game exceedingly well. It has an eerie way of feeling cheerful yet depressing at the same time. It’s quite a feat to have pulled off. There’s not much else to be said other than that it is beautiful and makes the game that much more enjoyable to play.\n\nNow to the meats of the game! The delicious Voodoo filled meats. Full Mojo Rampage is a loot-filled monster crushing extravaganza. It’s a roguelike at heart and doesn’t apologize for that very often. It does make a few concessions here and there but it does little to detract from the overall difficulty level in the grand scheme of things. You play as a little Voodoo avatar with one of several Gods chosen that determines your power set. Differences between them are fairly substantial with some focusing on a support role while others bring out the damage dealing mage archetype in you. The game is designed to be played cooperatively with up to four people, so the variety and tactical options are very intriguing.\n\nAt its heart, Full Mojo Rampage is an isometric dungeon runner. You accept a quest, the game randomly generates the world it takes place in, and you go about your merry way, Voodooing anything and everything standing in your path. Along the way you will collect one-shot items as well a gold that may be used for permanent items to boost your statistics. It’s a tried and true formula that holds up very well in the setting, with a couple of tweaks along the way. The first is that death is permanent. When you die, you are tossed back to the main menu and required to start anew. However, you do not have to start from scratch. Instead you retain your gold and experience and can use those to upgrade yourself or unlock a new God to attempt the quest with. It adds a considerable amount of replay value to the game. It may still be in early access, but the amount of content is still substantial and it will only get better as development continues.\n\nSo is it worth your time and money? That’s a decision that’s on you, as always. If you have friends to play with or don’t mind random games on the internet, and you happen to enjoy the action-oriented gameplay, it’s easily worth the current asking price. However, if you intend to play it alone or you’re not into Diablo-like games, this one may be something to pass up. It’s possible single player, but not designed to be played in that fashion and may discourage you. Take a look, do some research on top of this review, and decide for yourself! Just keep the difficulty in mind and don’t be disappointed.\n","February 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay is great, too -- many different elements (different locations, pins, mojos and consumables for loot, different rooms with various functionalities to visit, etc).  At first glance I loved the look and the music, and all the goofy/awesome looking masks, but the more I played with a friend, the more I appreciated the flow and the fun of the co-op play.  It's a very relaxing game, but not without a challenge, and it can get very hard on the higher difficulty.\n\nThere's not much I don't like about this game, but if I were to change something, I'd change the cards (gods) -- they're a bit random, and there's too few of them (8 or so).  If there were like twenty more cards, that'd be so nice and would open up tons of new playstyles.  I think the idea of them is really good, just need more options since some of them are a bit lackluster.  Seeing how random some of them are, I don't see how you couldn't just add some more random ones, just for the choice of it (see if it suits some).\n\nTo me, the replay value is pleasantly high, but I can see why people would think it can get a bit repetitive.  For the price though, it's more than worth it: the design, the unlockables, the gameplay -- it's all great for me.  I'm really happy this game was made, and is in my library for when I want to play with my friend.","November 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game has a few good points but also there are some major flaws that I have experienced in my first half hour of playing.  I will first elucidate the good, and then the bad.\n\nGood:\n- Its a pretty game.  Fairly unique style of graphics.\n\n-Seems fun enough. Its nice to collect things and it seems like there is a decent bit to unlock.\n\n-Has online multiplayer.\n\nBad:\n-Erases game progress.  In my first play session I got to level 2.  My second play sessions I beat level 2 and unlocked a new item.  There is no way to equip items without first going to the main menu, so i quit (the game is supposed to auto save) equipped the item, and loaded my game back.  It put me back to level 1.  Keep in mind that moments before when I had loaded the game it had me on level 2, so this is not a case of the game simply not saving.  It ERASED the progress that I had made days previously.  This is a huge error that needs to be fixed before I will spend 1 more minute on this game.\n\n-Too similiar to other games.  The voodoo theme is kinda fresh but other than that the game just plays like a tired twin stick shooter.  The controls feel clunky and the special attacks have terrible accuracy so you are forced to rely on your pathetic normal firing mode.  Kinds feels like a diablo III with worse graphics, worse controls, and way less content.\n\n-like I mentioned above, the user interface is poor, forcing you to retreat to the main menu in order to equip a new item.  This is a bad system, or a terrible oversight in the game design.\n\n-Zero online community.  I waited 20 minutes to find one game, hit refresh several times and no games at all.  Thought it might be better with some co-op action.\n\n\nOverall:\nIf the game erasing bug were fixed, if there was an online community, and if the controls were a tad tighter I might recommend this game.  Right now however, I feel that there are plenty of roguelikes to choose from that are better than this one.  Nothing is particularly wrong with this game (besides haivng progress erased) but there is also nothing that sets this one apart.  These are the reasons that I would not recommend this game.","November 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

I only noticed this because it went on sale on the Humble Bundle store, then realized it was on sale on Steam with the weeklong deals thingythingy. So as seen as it was 50% off I thought I'd buy the game, why the hell not. It was a very good decision. This game is extremely fun. The controls are very smooth, the art style is satisfying and the gameplay is that of Binding of Isaac, mixed with a little Spiral Knights for good measure. A little low on content, however it's Early Access, what do you expect? Everytime I see that title, it gives games like these a bad name. As good as it is now, I can only sit here and wait excitingly and anxiously for new patches and updates to make this game even more enjoyable.\n\nAlso has multiplayer.

With a beam wand equipped, I pretty much vaporized a boss). On other occasions, you will only find garbage mojos(the standard equips in the game). This also goes with the boss fights because so far theyve been the similar spam-bouncy-attacks-in-a-small-room-and-jump/spin-all-over-the-place where a few rogue hits will finish you off if you didnt luck out and find potions on the way since not even the random shops can be relied on to get them because they often only sell wands and mojos.\n\nThe monsters often spawn very close to you. In a game where a death means restarting at the beginning of the level and losing your accumulated mojos/buffs, having a suicide bomber appear and blow up in your face is simply silly.\n\nThe multiplayer is a ghost town.","August 20, 2014","false","10.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Sometimes I find something I like.\n\nSometimes I find a game like Full Mojo Rampage that I can't wait to uninstall.\n\nFull Mojo looks cute but looks are deceiving. I simply found this way too hard (or the controls aren't explained well enough). Started game, first room...dead. Respawn...dead. Respawn...dead. Respawn....dead. Respawn...dead. Yeah, this is fun. Not. Uninstalled.\n\nI know it's trendy to make games hard nowadays. But there's no reason for anyone to create a game where the player dies repeatedly in the tutorial or the first area. It's simply not an enjoyable experience. It's unnecessarily frustrating. This isn't supposed to be Dark Souls.\n\nI truly love the art style (or what I saw of it). Whomever is the artist really deserves some praise. But I'm sorry devs, you need to do a MUCH better job of creating a tutorial and an area where players can learn how to play your game. This happens occasonally with indie type developers - they get so used to playing their own creation they don't realize that the balance is incredibly off for other gamers and frankly your offering isn't compelling enough to make me want to deal with trying to figure it out. In short, you may have created a good game but it sucks because you don't give new players any idea how to play it.","December 14, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

In that sense, I was disappointed. Although it has stiff penalties for death and levels are randomly generated, you keep your stats between replays and can continue your next game on the same quest. The random level generation adds some variety but does not make each replay significantly different (think Diablo, not Brogue). So don't buy this expecing a wildly random experience like Binding of Isaac or FTL.\n\nSo it fails as a rogue-like... but it succeeds as an action RPG. The actual combat plays like a twin-stick shooter and the outcome is determined as much by aim and dodging as by stats. The graphics are great, filled with comedic voodoo iconography. Most of the abilities have excessively long cooldowns so you'll find yourself using the basic attack most of the time. This isn't so bad since the basic attack is satisfying enough.\n\nThe two-player co-op is fun and the networking code works very well.\n\nI do have a few quibbles, though:\n- Some of the dialog boxes have timers which arbitrarily prevent you from closing them immediately to proceed with the game.  Fortunately, they're not very common.\n- When playing multiplayer, your group is disbanded after each quest and you must re-form the group to continue.\n- The lack of variety will likely hurt the game's long-term replayability.\n\nOn the whole, this is a fun, polished, and bug-free experience, but don't expect it to hold your interest for more than 10 hours.","December 1, 2014","true","13.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Story is borderline non-existent but doesn’t hurt the overall game which servers mainly as a faced paced co op procedurally generated dungeon crawler, when starting up players will notice that instead of your typical class selection and slight customer customization instead players choose from several Loa’s (Voodoo deity’s) each with their own passive and abilities, a choice of visually cosmetic mask and several upgradable voodoo pins that work as perks.\n\nFrom there you (and you band of merry voodoers if online) go about finishing each randomly generated level by completing their objectives which while there are a bunch of different tasks they tend to blend into the same rather generically similar formula which are destroy all X and find all Y although there are the occasional events that add some change up like defending friendly zombies from skeletons or one of the Loa’s granting you x10 your max health but forgoing the ability to heal ever again in that chapter.\nDuring levels you mainly spend your time fighting off the large amount of spawns whilst searching for loot which will help or hinder your run, ranging from wands, items and mojos. Mojos are the main game changers as they provide random unique stat boosts like extra attack speed or damage, max health increases or even creating black holes upon killing an enemy, mojos and items can be switch out between the 3 equip and 3 inventory slots (which can be increased) allowing you to fully utilize your combo but without hogging all the mojos like in Risk of Rain or becoming completely overpowered like you could in Binding of Isaac.\n\nMuch like the infamous Dark Souls you should be prepared to die, but Full Mojo Rampage is a bit more lenient with your death where you carry all currency and exp gained which allow you to purchase pins, level your stats and unlock/change your choice of Loa in order to hopefully succeed where you once failed. However even though of course the idea of a rogue-like is to set you back to try again, I found especially once I started the 2nd chapter or played on harder modes that the games tend to last a bit too long to justifying the vast amount of progression you need to catch up on once again especially playing alone though granted I feel this more due to how long it takes to find someone to play with online.\n\nWhat little of multiplayer I got to try out was indeed fun, similar to Risk of Rain, multiplayer offers a plethora of chaos and enjoyment as you scramble for loot and try not to be the guy who lost the 3 shared lives per quest.\nThankfully FMR offers a round robin mode which gives each player a better chance at sharing mojos around instead of being left in the dirt; however my biggest gripe with FMR is in fact the local Co Op.\nWhile I’m one to passionately love couch Co Oping and love it every time a developer remembers that not everyone has developed a fear of playing a video game when physically near someone, FMR provides a very broken local multiplayer option.\n\nSadly unlike Risk of Rain where each player could choose their class and could collect their own items, in Full Mojo Rampage the 2nd player can do neither; yep, player 2 is reduced to nothing more than a severely gimped ghost version of player 1 who can’t even pick up or use items (they can pick up coins and key objects). For me this really hurt the local co op feature the game provides as it really feels tacked on seeing as it’s incredibly dull very quickly for your buddy and honestly I would’ve preferred they just didn’t implement it in its current state.\n\nSadly the lack of a multiplayer base is really all that there is to complain about Full Mojo Rampage, much like it’s fellow rogue-likes FMR has a very addictive formula that promotes replay ability (including daily challenges) but it does feel too stretched between the genres. FMR feels too simple compared to other dungeon crawlers like Torchlight or of course Diablo, and isn’t nearly as fast paced nor as challenging as the rogues like Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain. That being said FMR is a very enjoyable co op dungeon crawler that for those who enjoyed Risk of Rain and enjoy some random pick up and play gameplay is a good choice to consider which will probably land you at least 10 hours if you manage to get a solid amount of friends to play with.\n\nPros:\nNice visuals,\nLots of items to change gameplay,\nPromotes replayability,\nSolid gameplay online.\n\nCons:\nGimped local co op,\nSlightly repetitive,\nSomewhat small multiplayer base hurts online gameplay,\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nEnjoy the review?\nBe sure to come check out my other reviews @ http://morbidplay.com/.\n","May 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I want to vote "neither recommend nor avoid". The game works, has a quite decent theme going on and is fun to play. It has loot drops, plenty of unlockables, customization...everything you want, right?\n\nWell...the main thing is that this game made me realise how much I miss a tutorial because it isn't there. Not "tutorial" in the form of training wheel levels, but something to gradually gets you into the game. This game has everything straight from the gate (at least: I think so). Here are some items. Here's some gold. Here's a menu structure that currently holds more locks than choices. Here are some bars which may show your experience but may show something else. And so on.\nI feel lazy for typing this, but I never could be bothered to check where, how and on what you spend money on (okay, there are some in-level shops. But is that it?). I have no idea if I'm gaining a level. And either the game doesn't save your progress or the overall map is borked, but I swear everytime I start the game (I do small gaming sessions) I have to start from "level 2" anew. This also goes when you die...which may put you back more than a few levels.\n\nThe game certainly holds potential, but as it stands it really doesn't shine. I certainly don't play dungeon crawlers for their story, but absolutely nothing is pretty weird. Even weirder when that baron Samedi apparently is our friend. Or ally. Or God, or something.\n\nI know, I know: all in all, this is nitpicking. The big "but!!!" is mainly that it taps into the same vein Diablo and Torchlight 2  plays, but is up to par with these games at best, and usually worse. Visuals: up to par. Audio: a bit worse. Fights: a bit worse. Enemy variety: worse. Music: okay-ish. And so on.\nIf this game was in a vacuum, I'd thumb up this game.

Your character can level up and you can choose different classes through Deities cards for different gamestyles or synergizing a coop team (max 4 players).\nThe game offers 4 quests up to this date, a survival mode and a daily quest. The graphics and ingame sounds and music are really nice and the game still gets updated from time to time (I never experienced a bug ever).\nCons: Not a lot of people play online, so better to buy the game and recommend it to your friends and have them buy it as well if you want to play online...","June 1","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's no feeling of impact, no sense of power, and the sound starts to drive you crazy really fast.\n\nOk, sure, the game has a unique theme, decent ideas and a nice aesthetic, but it's not really a good sign when the core gameplay gets boring after a mere hour. The fact that the game expects you to die only to raise your stats a little bit and start anew makes the whole experience tedious and grindy. Not to mention, all the weapons you find have (very) limited uses, and most items only give you passive upgrades, rarely any new cool ability. And even when you find new items you most likely won't have any inventory space left to pick them up, which even further limits your character and adds unnecessary item management to the mix.\n\nKind of a pitty, actually, because there was potential here. As it is though, it's just tedious and repetitive.","January 3","false","3.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The leveling system also means that if somebody has played more or less hours than another, the parity between player's powers becomes a serious problem.\n\nJust not what I was looking for, and I can't recommend it to anyone who is expecting a more traditional rough-lick.","December 15, 2014","false","10.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The only thing you'll be hearing in this game is your wand goes pew pew pew, SOME (not all) explosions and zombies dying. Music is okay. Playing this game feels like playing any other game but you turn down the volume because you don't want your parent caught you playing video game in the middle of the night because you have school in the morning.\n\n- Lack of custom video setting option. Low graphic setting won't turn off the bloom, you're gonna need to change it manually by editing the setting file in my document.\n\n- Boring. This game is boring. Mobs of enemies running at you. You run, circling them while spamming LMB. Rinse and repeat. Plus the game is mute, this game just lack immersion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/225280/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","At first it seems like a fun game. There are staffs, relics, rampage, specific abilities, multiple different characters, pins, masks, random levels with different goals, random side places you can do things in, secrets, and hidden entrances that go to different rooms. Then I started to see the grinding. You die in like 2 seconds and health can be hard to come by. If you die you lose all of your progress. To do anything like get new guys, or masks, you need gold and medals. Medals take FOREVER to get. In the first 3 hours, I prolly got 15- 20, so enough for 1 to two guys. But theres so much grinding. Then you see blessings costs 10 medals. What they don't tell you is its not permanent. I spent 10 medals, or over and hour of time, and if you die you lose all of that. They should stay forever or cost like 2 medals, very stupid. Pins cost a ton of money too. Upgrading 1 fully takes about 1-1.5 hours of gameplay worth of gold, and each single one doesn't do THAT much. Then there are the guys. Some of the guys, like the one that can run faster or decrease his own damage, is worthless. I spent 10 medals and he just sucked. The game would be much more fun with friends, but of course there is no local co-op and NOBODY is playing it online, so hope you like single player. I hate rogue-like games but this didn't bother me too much at first because although I would lose it dangled so many options and unlockables like the carrot on the stick, like COD, and I was transfixed. Then I realized how much grinding and inflated gameplay it encouraged.\n\nBut what finally got me was the randomness/unfairness, mixed with poor boss fight. It is completely random what you get. One game I got 2 revives and a bunch of health. Then when I finally gave up on the last realm, I played for 3 hours and didnt get ONE single revive. I got more health can I could carry early on, but then I get to the final boss fight, and there are 2 crates containing coins but no potions. I had no potions and you can't go back to any stores on levels to stock up. Pretty stupid to make a game where you lose all progress, but you can’t buy potions or prepare for a boss fight where you could lose it all, just hope you get lucky and there are potions or a revive in the crates (why????). I would have been able to carry potions but of course with randomness again I didn’t get a SINGLE inventory slot upgrade from any of the 5 realms in the secrets, only all relics and potions. Other times I have maxed out both and kept getting inventory upgrades I can’t use, but this time I couldn’t get 1. So the randomness keeps it from being fair or proportionate. So I get to this boss, and he is super stupid. After 45 minute work of this time, and prolly 2 hours on the realm, I make it to him. There are spikes in each of the four corners. Then this boss shoots out like 10 giant red balls that bounce off walls and flood the screen. Then he moves around towards you attacking. So you are supposed to dodge 10 bouncing red balls continuously flying all over the screen, as well as him, and not be able to maneuver around because of the spikes. You clearly cannot avoid all the projectiles and him while trying to hurt him. Then add to it each of the red balls does like 1/3 your health, and I had about 1/3 increased health and no potions or revives. Well due to the unfair fight you basically can’t win alone on normal, I lost all 50 minutes of progress, because a fight I had no control over. No thanks crap rogue-like, try to make things do-able next time or more balanced. It was clear they wanted to use the rogue-like to force you to die and keep retrying to inflate game length because theres only like 4 missions. 4.5/10.","April 24, 2015","false","7.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

It's not a terrible game, but the core gameplay suffers from some problems.\n\nFirstly, you get a fairly limited view of what's going on around you. Particularly when moving south I felt blind as to what I was walking into. Enemies with missile/charge attacks generally have a range of around half a screen, which sometimes means you are being attacked from offscreen, or you don't get to see the enemy telegraphing their charge so when it comes at you there's no time left to dodge.\n\nThe levels are initially empty - you trigger enemy spawns as you explore. Most of them will run straight at you after their spawn animation, and except for the kamikaze types you can outrun them (by default; presumably if you put enough points in speed you can outrun kamikazes too).\n\nYou can choose from a bunch of characters which have a variety of spells, but all have the same peashooter basic attack. You can't take many hits either, and all of this combines to encourage a conservative strategy:\n\n1. Tiptoe around level until enemies spawn\n2. Run away from enemies while shooting at them\n3. Remain in the already explored area of the level until they're all dead (to avoid spawning more enemies)\n4. Rinse and repeat\n\nUnfortunately none of this is very hard, or engaging. Nor could I find any other viable strategy; the limited dps means you need to progress through the level fairly slowly to manage enemies as they spawn, and your limited health pool means you need to keep your distance as you can't afford to take risks.\n\nIt's a shame, because if it wasn't for these core issues it would be a lot of fun.","June 3, 2015","false","5.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

You pew pew pew your way through room after room of mobs, picking up items along the way. Where the smallest mistake can see yourself falling under the sword and starting from the beginning again. However what sets it apart from other rogue-likes is the items and the strong sense of progression.\n\nLittle by little you are getting stronger. You are aided by your choice of pins (which you randomly pickup) and your choice of parent Loa (which is the informal class system). Pins and like Pokemon; you got to collect them all. They boost one of your stats or can expand the number of inventory/relic slots you have. As you level up, you can have more and more pins. There is a big spike in difficulty with every new quest, however it never seems too daunting and you find yourself going back for more.\n\nIf you are finding it too difficult there is an option to play online or local co-op with others. This is probably where the game shines. I can't comment on it too much, as I have only played the one game online before the host disconnected as he died on the first boss fight. However, if you find the right group, I suspect you will be in for a treat.\n\nI've played a fair few of the recent spate of rogue-likes to be released by indie devs, this game is definitely in my top 3. It balances the fine line between challenge and reward well. After each death, I find myself closing my eyes and praying to all the Loas and all the shrines that the RNG gods are in my favour.\n\nTLDR: Get it if you love circle strafing.","June 1, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am really enjoying collecting medals, gold, masks, Pins, and new luas who change up my play patterns. Each run is different, and items you get allow you much freedom in how to play the game, and I can see myself more interested in mastering the intricacies and synergies than I was with Binding of Isaac, and I am a big fan of that game as well. The local multiplayer will be similar with those who are familiar with deathspank, where the second player is an assistant, with no sub items affecting their play; in a way, this is a good thing, as it frees them up to not have to think about inventory management, etc. Controls are rock solid, as is the multiplayer, There are ambushes, and you have a feeling of being overwhelmed by surprise attacks, entertainingly so, but it never feels unfair when you die, you simply learn from your failure, and apply it to the next run. When you do die, there isn't a feeling of loss, except if you got really good drops and you die early, because the medals and gold, exp, and new pins you pick up stay with you. this can lead to death being seen as a new beginning, as you have a chance to level up, upgrade and change your pins, and get new masks and luas. It would be great if the masks had more of an effect on game play (perhaps they do, I haven't seen one) The bosses are similar fare to what you would see in Zelda, and BoI. The Daily mission is a single instance across all players, this equality allows individual players to see how much better they are than the competition quite fairly, accounting for the odd stroke of luck that could give players an advantage. By giving everyone the same result from the RNG, the daily mission is an objective way of seeing how you stack up to the best. I readily await DLC or an expansion pack for this game, and I could see myself playing this for many years to come.\nThis is the game Binding of Isaac Wishes it could be.","May 14, 2014","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it's pretty basic with the combat system, the progression of difficulty as you complete each randomly generated level makes up for that. Your character customization is rather lackluster, but the character leveling isn't---in my opinion. You upgrade stats like health, damage, speed, and fire rate. Additionally, you discover coins that unlock new special abilities. The game is sperated into 4 Quests each with 6 to 9 or so levels. The downside is there are no saves, so you must finish all the levels at once to move on to the next quest. There are 4 or 5 difficulty settings all unlocked upon finishing a Quest.

Cute, easy to learn, unforgiving. Musically, early on at least, there isn't a lot of diversity but the Elfman-meets-Hillbilly hybrid style is cleanly executed so serves as a good backup to the gameplay. Thematically, to compare it to BoI's flagrant blasphemy, the game feels like a carefully made yet still accessible love letter to Vodou. Also, I stumbled across the insertion of some lyrics from an obscure Toadies song that I so adore. Bonus points.\n\nVery easy purchase if anyone is looking for another top-down-ish, arpg style rogue-like.","May 11, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found nothing but positive reviews online and decided to give it a shot. Let me just say, I am pretty impressed.\n\nIt is basically a 'Binding of Issac' where you improve the longer you're alive and get a lot better overtime. Each part of this game is very well put together; from the different gods, mojos (damage, attack speed and many unique effects), the cosmetic masks (which I hope they serve a better, more interesting purpose later), the weapons (while few and far between..and don't last very ..so you have to use them wisely) and the pins.\n\nOh god, how could I forget the pins. During the game, you collect gold coins to spend on upgrading your 'voodoo pins', which say give either +damage, or +crit chance..and you can upgrade them with the gold you get and improve your game everytime you play.\n\nThis game has a long road to go down, but this game is amazing now. With what I have heard about the dev team behind this (which is a small amount, considering I just got this game a couple hours ago), they are intently listening to the community and it really shows; they have an amazing game on their hands.","May 12, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of different maps and some special maps aswell. The story has 4 parts and there will be a lot of different opponents. If you get bored with the story there are 3 more mods (multiplayer. survival and daily quest). You will have 5-10 hours of just playing the story and it's pretty fun to play the story. The problems are after you pass the story it gets boring after a while and there is a difficulty changer (hardcore, annoying, etc.) but the enemies are actually insane to pass. Also multiplayer is dead, no one plays it and developer stoped updating the game (there is a reason why http://steamcommunity.com/app/225280/discussions/0/613940477699048998/ ).\n\nSo to conclude this review would recommend this game but only if it's on sale because I think 12 eur is a lot for 5-10 hours of story and currently dead mutiplayer.

You can only take 1-3 hits (depends on the enemy and difficulty)\n\nOverall it's really good and I suggest you to buy it if you enjoy Rogue-Like games like Risk of Rain, The Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy.

I am really enjoying collecting medals, gold, masks, Pins, and new luas who change up my play patterns. Each run is different, and items you get allow you much freedom in how to play the game, and I can see myself more interested in mastering the intricacies and synergies than I was with Binding of Isaac, and I am a big fan of that game as well. The local multiplayer will be similar with those who are familiar with deathspank, where the second player is an assistant, with no sub items affecting their play; in a way, this is a good thing, as it frees them up to not have to think about inventory management, etc. Controls are rock solid, as is the multiplayer, There are ambushes, and you have a feeling of being overwhelmed by surprise attacks, entertainingly so, but it never feels unfair when you die, you simply learn from your failure, and apply it to the next run. When you do die, there isn't a feeling of loss, except if you got really good drops and you die early, because the medals and gold, exp, and new pins you pick up stay with you. this can lead to death being seen as a new beginning, as you have a chance to level up, upgrade and change your pins, and get new masks and luas. It would be great if the masks had more of an effect on game play (perhaps they do, I haven't seen one) The bosses are similar fare to what you would see in Zelda, and BoI. The Daily mission is a single instance across all players, this equality allows individual players to see how much better they are than the competition quite fairly, accounting for the odd stroke of luck that could give players an advantage. By giving everyone the same result from the RNG, the daily mission is an objective way of seeing how you stack up to the best. I readily await DLC or an expansion pack for this game, and I could see myself playing this for many years to come.\nThis is the game Binding of Isaac Wishes it could be.","May 14, 2014","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has a bit of a shoot em up feel to it. I haven't progressed terribly far in the game yet, but I'm already hooked. I'm sure I'll love the multiplayer element but I have yet to try it out.

You pew pew pew your way through room after room of mobs, picking up items along the way. Where the smallest mistake can see yourself falling under the sword and starting from the beginning again. However what sets it apart from other rogue-likes is the items and the strong sense of progression.\n\nLittle by little you are getting stronger. You are aided by your choice of pins (which you randomly pickup) and your choice of parent Loa (which is the informal class system). Pins and like Pokemon; you got to collect them all. They boost one of your stats or can expand the number of inventory/relic slots you have. As you level up, you can have more and more pins. There is a big spike in difficulty with every new quest, however it never seems too daunting and you find yourself going back for more.\n\nIf you are finding it too difficult there is an option to play online or local co-op with others. This is probably where the game shines. I can't comment on it too much, as I have only played the one game online before the host disconnected as he died on the first boss fight. However, if you find the right group, I suspect you will be in for a treat.\n\nI've played a fair few of the recent spate of rogue-likes to be released by indie devs, this game is definitely in my top 3. It balances the fine line between challenge and reward well. After each death, I find myself closing my eyes and praying to all the Loas and all the shrines that the RNG gods are in my favour.\n\nTLDR: Get it if you love circle strafing.","June 1, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it's pretty basic with the combat system, the progression of difficulty as you complete each randomly generated level makes up for that. Your character customization is rather lackluster, but the character leveling isn't---in my opinion. You upgrade stats like health, damage, speed, and fire rate. Additionally, you discover coins that unlock new special abilities. The game is sperated into 4 Quests each with 6 to 9 or so levels. The downside is there are no saves, so you must finish all the levels at once to move on to the next quest. There are 4 or 5 difficulty settings all unlocked upon finishing a Quest.  I recomend it for friends who want a fun, challenging game and not looking to break the bank.","May 20, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full Mojo Rampage (FMR) has a certain quality to it that is so incredible. It may be the art style, which is very dark, yet very cartoony. It is composed of very gloomy blues, greens, dark reds, and purples for it's backgrounds, but pops with bright and electric colors on it's foreground. It feels very mystical, and is reminiscint of the environment in the Secret of Monkey Island. It plays almost like a twin-stick shoother, but with the core gameplay feeling like an ARPG, such as Diablo, or Torchlight. It also has an ALMOST perma-death, with levels and certain stats carrying over, but nothing else.\n\nYou will die time and time again, but be excited to start over. It is incredible how simple and yet how fun this game is, and it is only in it's alpha.\n\nI would reccomend anyone who enjoys Diablo-like games to try this game out, and for any roguelike fans to give it a shot as well.\n\nAre you a bad enough dude to voodoo?","January 16, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like any rogue-like game, you have to start from a beginning level and progress through multiple different other levels to reach the final stage. Each level has its own unique design and is filled with enemies and bosses. You can find items and upgrades to improve the stats of your character as you progress, making you more stronger.

Found nothing but positive reviews online and decided to give it a shot. Let me just say, I am pretty impressed.\n\nIt is basically a 'Binding of Issac' where you improve the longer you're alive and get a lot better overtime. Each part of this game is very well put together; from the different gods, mojos (damage, attack speed and many unique effects), the cosmetic masks (which I hope they serve a better, more interesting purpose later), the weapons (while few and far between..and don't last very ..so you have to use them wisely) and the pins.\n\nOh god, how could I forget the pins. During the game, you collect gold coins to spend on upgrading your 'voodoo pins', which say give either +damage, or +crit chance..and you can upgrade them with the gold you get and improve your game everytime you play.\n\nThis game has a long road to go down, but this game is amazing now. With what I have heard about the dev team behind this (which is a small amount, considering I just got this game a couple hours ago), they are intently listening to the community and it really shows; they have an amazing game on their hands.","May 12, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am really enjoying collecting medals, gold, masks, Pins, and new luas who change up my play patterns. Each run is different, and items you get allow you much freedom in how to play the game, and I can see myself more interested in mastering the intricacies and synergies than I was with Binding of Isaac, and I am a big fan of that game as well. The local multiplayer will be similar with those who are familiar with deathspank, where the second player is an assistant, with no sub items affecting their play; in a way, this is a good thing, as it frees them up to not have to think about inventory management, etc. Controls are rock solid, as is the multiplayer, There are ambushes, and you have a feeling of being overwhelmed by surprise attacks, entertainingly so, but it never feels unfair when you die, you simply learn from your failure, and apply it to the next run. When you do die, there isn't a feeling of loss, except if you got really good drops and you die early, because the medals and gold, exp, and new pins you pick up stay with you. this can lead to death being seen as a new beginning, as you have a chance to level up, upgrade and change your pins, and get new masks and luas. It would be great if the masks had more of an effect on game play (perhaps they do, I haven't seen one) The bosses are similar fare to what you would see in Zelda, and BoI. The Daily mission is a single instance across all players, this equality allows individual players to see how much better they are than the competition quite fairly, accounting for the odd stroke of luck that could give players an advantage. By giving everyone the same result from the RNG, the daily mission is an objective way of seeing how you stack up to the best. I readily await DLC or an expansion pack for this game, and I could see myself playing this for many years to come.\nThis is the game Binding of Isaac Wishes it could be.","May 14, 2014","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it's pretty basic with the combat system, the progression of difficulty as you complete each randomly generated level makes up for that. Your character customization is rather lackluster, but the character leveling isn't---in my opinion. You upgrade stats like health, damage, speed, and fire rate. Additionally, you discover coins that unlock new special abilities. The game is sperated into 4 Quests each with 6 to 9 or so levels. The downside is there are no saves, so you must finish all the levels at once to move on to the next quest. There are 4 or 5 difficulty settings all unlocked upon finishing a Quest.

There is so much to unlock, it would keep a completionist busy for hours on end =D\n\nDefinitely worth playing!","May 13, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

While the aspects of randomly-generated dungeons, and (sometimes) unforgiving gameplay make it both entertaining and challenging, the game still feels a bit empty after a few hours in. The concept of using voodoo pins, and voodoo Gods as a means of making your little character stronger is great, but especially the latter could use a lot more variety and additions to make it even more rewarding/tactical.\n\nI'm going to press the recommend button just because it's a funny and challenging experience playing co-op with a friend (or more) but I do hope more stuff will be added.","November 29, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though character progression persists between runs, dying ends a given run and it may take you several attempts to complete each quest. All is not well in the land of the dead and you, as an aspiring voodoo practictioner, have been chosen to perform a series of challenging tasks by the loa. From sealing portals Baron Samedi left open after a night of drunken revelry, to helping Maman Bridgitte brew a magic potion to following a cryptic vision from Damballa, your dimutive bokor must slog his way through graveyards, swamps and volcanic seas in pursuit of magical glory. Combat is very hectic and staying on the move and aiming quickly is necessary to survive. Though the success of a run is can largely depend on the random number gods and favorable item drops, persistence will be rewarded. At the beginning of a run you can choose a patron loa which essentially governs your character's class, determining your starting spells and passives, and you can equip one or more pins that provide passive bonuses.  The overall feel of the game is excellent, with a lighthearted presentation, excellent music and a surprising degree of accuracy to voodoo lore, including faithful replications of the various sigils. Local coop is possible but the second player is limited to a phantom duplicate of the first player and cannot collect powerups. The game's boss fights are excellent and suitably epic in presentation. Overall, an excellent and challenging, but ultimately forgiving roguelike.","July 30, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
