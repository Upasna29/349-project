And that's not the way you play Snakebird.\n\nPuzzles in this game force you to clearly state a problem that you face ("How can I reach this fruit?", "How can I push this block without making the snakebird fall?"), solve it in your mind, and try to execute your solution in game. This sounds like any puzzle game, but Snakebird just won't let you solve a puzzle by chance.\n\nI couldn't recommend it more. Apart from great puzzle design it has nice visuals, cool unobtrusive music and some adorable lovely creatures that are snakebirds.\n\n"This game induces causeless joy and laughter in me." - my friend Flasheek.","May 23, 2015","true","35.7"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","32","32","0","0"

Why are you still not playing this game?\n\nSnakebird is a pure grid-based puzzle game. Every key press responds to one action. You can undo any number of steps.\n\nYou control one snake at a time. You can move it like in the popular game Snake, and eat fruit as well. But what is this? The game takes action in a side view, so the snakes fall like in Tetris! The "snake" remains rigid, never rotates, and falls down only if there is nothing below it. The "bird" part, I suppose, refers to the fact that the creatures can slightly lift off the ground, only to fall afterwards.\n\nAnd there is not much more to explain. This concept gives birth to a vast amount of combinations and gameplay possibilities, especially if there are multiple snakes! Of course, some additional gameplay concepts are present, all very natural and intuitive. Spikes, movable blocks, portals and whatnot. Even the level exit portal acts as a gameplay element, because losing a snake often renders the level unsolvable for the other snakes.\n\nThe graphics are immaculate. Don't be fooled by the cuteness, though. The game is very, very difficult. Not much to do here for (most) kids.\nThe soundtrack never gets boring.\n\nIt may be "a little" early, but I would dare call this the puzzle game of the year.\n\n★★★★★★★★★☆","May 19, 2015","true","15.0"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/esatia/recommended/357300/","esatia","Esatia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esatia/","113 products in account","I'll be honest, the main factor which made me want to buy this game was how it looked. It also helps that I do appreciate a good puzzle game every now and then as well as the fact that Snakebird was on sale when I bought it. Having said that, don't let the cute and vibrantly colourful presentation of this game fool you into thinking that this is an easy puzzle game targeted towards the little ones because, believe me, it definitely isn't!\n\nThis is by far one of the most challenging puzzle games I've played. Initially, the first few levels will ease you into the game and teaches you about the basic mechanics of how to control the Snakebirds but there will be a spike in difficulty soon after. Some of the harder levels may leave you in a fit of rage as you try desperately to wrap your head around how to complete them, but when you do solve them (on your own, without the aid of a guide), you will feel a great sense of accomplishment. In other instances, you may end up kicking yourself for overthinking when you discover how easy a solution to a particular level is.\n\nSnakebird also has a very bubbly soundtrack as well as some of the most adorable sound effects ever. It is indeed a very unique experience, both aesthetically and gameplay-wise. I would definitely recommend fans of puzzle games (more so those who like a good challenge) to give Snakebird a go.","June 18, 2015","true","7.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etdp/recommended/357300/","etdp","Hodd Toward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etdp/","523 products in account","Snakebird is a PC exclusive (OSX/LIN as well) puzzle games about cute birds shaped like snakes in a cheery, bright world. Both the art style and the score of the game evoke a very touching, peaceful, and beautifully innocent atmosphere.\n\nHowever, that is nothing but a lie that is surface deep. Once you pass the first few levels which guide you through the mechanics, you are put in a situation where the world map begins to branch out.\n\n\nIt's adorable, isn't it? It's large, but it evokes a very friendly, inviting atmosphere. At first look, this is the kind of game you'd expect to see on your child's iPad or iPod touch, right?\n\nWrong again. This is just the selection of which of the 9 circles of Hell you'd like to traverse through first is.\n\nThe mechanics are fairly simple! You control Snakebirds, moving them around, getting fruit and moving obstacles. Sometimes you get one Snakebird, sometimes you get a few and you have to use them together as teamwork to reach the goal. Once all the fruit is collected, each Snakebird has to get through the colourful portal that opens up to leave the level. Thankfully, there is a button that is an equivalence to a "ctrl+z", undoing your last move.\n\n\nYou will make the Snakebirds die. They will literally quiver in fear as they stare down a pitfall, or a spiked block, or spikes in general. If another Snakebird is in danger, and you switch to your other Snakebird, he will glare you down with the force of a thousand suns. A look full of hate.\n\nThe first time I bought this game, I bought it full price. I played it for a while, before nearly tearing my hair out in frustration. I enjoyed a solid 8 hours of gameplay during a week where I had next to no consistent internet - and I hadn't downloaded many other of my games to my new harddrive. By the time I had internet back up reliably, I immediately refunded it. Snakebird had beaten me, beaten me into a bloody pulp. I 3-stock Contra with ease. I've had no issues toppling Miyazaki and co.'s Souls games, nor Bloodborne. Hardcore endgame raiding in MMOs? Been there, done that. Rhythm games? Bring 'em on, I got this. Shmups? I can do it, pass me the arcade stick. Fighting games? I'm slightly better than the average Joe.\n\nSnakebird? Snakebird broke me.\n\nBut I just bought it again in the Steam sale! I mean, it's half off, and I've spent time away from it. Maybe the difficulty was routed in me being frustrated by silly, easy puzzles?\n\nNope.\n\nSnakebird was, and continues to be, ballbustingly hard. I'm tearing my hair out here. Once I finally think I have the level beaten, I realize that there is no way for me to get both of my Snakebirds to the portal, or I've trapped myself to a point where I can't get that last piece of fruit so easily...\n\nAnyways, I'm going back to playing Snakebird until I have a stroke or brain hemorrhage. You should play it too.","November 30, 2015","true","9.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","16","17","8","2"

I ragequit and launched it again 10 times in an hour. That's the mindset it may put you into.\n\nIt is a really clever puzzle game. Unlike the all-too-common unfair games of this genre that go for the "reverse-engineering" of the random problem the creator put up by toying around, the puzzles in this one are real thinkers : you understand pretty quickly what you are supposed to do (though not always, I'll get back to that), but you'll be torturing yourself trying to actually get there.\nSolving puzzles in this condition feels very rewarding.\nSadly there is a drawback associated with this : the game doesn't tell you anything. You have to figure everything out yourself, and when the game throws new elements you weren't expecting to be interactive, it will just get you confused as to what to do. I think a simple explanations of a few basic mechanics early in the game wouldn't have spoiled the experience, quite the contrary.\nThe game saves the current puzzle in the state you left it on quit - but leave a level to the map and all your progress is lost. personally I'd wish it saved an instance of every puzzles so you could mix and go between them as you wish, without pressure.\nAnd yeah, the thing is ♥♥♥♥ing cute.\n\n30 puzzles to go at the time of this review!","June 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/357300/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Snakebird is a deceptively hard puzzle game that leads to frustrating but very enjoyable play.\n\nThe simple child like graphics would initially have you believe the game to be a kids game. However hidden behind this charming visual style is a game so difficult that it could possibly put dark souls to shame.\n\nThe concept of the game is present in the name of the game. You control a "snakebird" which is simply a mixture between a bird and a snake obviously. The game has a control method very similar to snake. You travel with your snakebird in a grid based pattern. Although you are allowed to touch yourself, unlike in snake, you do often find yourself getting your head trapped between the wall and your body making it impossible to escape. This concept carries through the entirety of the game and makes for very interesting gameplay.\n\nNow this concept may seem to simple to you to be considered a difficult game. Although the trick comes with the implementation of gravity. Your snakebird has to be touching the ground to be able to travel across the air. If not you can end up finding yourself falling. This can put you in some very tricky situations when trying to manouvere across the games obstacles such as water and spikes.\n\nI won't have you believe that I am good at this game though. I am not. So far, over 1 hour in, I have completed 7 of the games 53 levels. These probably took me way longer than they should have done. But although I absolutely love puzzle games, I do completely suck at actually playing them. So maybe my judgement of the exceedingly hard difficulty is clouded  by this factor.\n\nHowever there is one interesting little trick the game uses to help people like me along the way. When completely a level you are not only given one level to continue on with, but a selection of a few of them to try. This means if you get stumped on a level, then you can try out other ones at the same time that you may find easier to figure out. At the current stage of the game that I am at I have access to 5 different levels to try. Not that this helps me at all though because I have managed to get completely stumped on all of them. But that's just me, because remember I suck!\n\nThis game does have a delightfully charming art style to it that made the game very satisfying to play. The art style represents a very simplistic manor with very few shades of colour present. This would usually lead me to dislike the graphics style but in this case it does not. The slow swaying animations of almost every item in the game including trees, snowmen and clouds lead to an impressive visual style that expertly represents the cartoon-like graphics style I believe they were going for.\n\nA beautifully calming soundtrack complements this unique graphics style very well. The soundtrack is equally as simple as the visuals but works perfectly well with it. The calming nature of it manages to keep you sane while attempting the ludicrously hard puzzles. I do have one minor flaw with this soundtrack however. The songs on levels run on a continuous loop. It can get boring after a while and can even get a slight bit annoying to put up with. Couple this with the fact that you sometimes spend a large amount of time on a single level and it can end up getting to be a rather annoying soundtrack.\n\nI also feel since this is a PC game it is customary to mention PC specific parts of the game. There are some key options that are missing in the options menu for the hardcore PC gamer. The current options menu shows a large range of resolution options, fullscreen toggle and sound and music toggles. It also includes a grid option that is specific to the game which is a nice addition. I don't believe the options menu needs to have any kind of graphics options due to the very simplistic nature of the graphics. But it is missing a key option. It needs to have present seperate in game sliders for sound and music. I personally believe this option should be instantly present in every game and it is a flaw to not have it.\n\nOverall I absolutely adored my experience of playing snakebird. Even if it was rather frustrating at times. It was largely satisfying when you finally managed to figure out how to complete a level you have been stuck on for so long. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of hard puzzle games. The game is an absolute steal at the current price of £4.99. Although don't buy it if you get easily frustrated by hard games. This game is not for people wanting a simple experience.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a early review key by the developer of the game.","May 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/357300/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","Out of all the games I played in 2015 starring elongated narcoleptic birds, Snakebird is my favorite.\n\nThe premise is pretty straightforward: Steer your snakebird toward the exit.\n\nLike in the classic Snake game, your snakebird's head will move in the direction you choose, its tail following behind. If your snakebird eats a piece of fruit, its tail will grow one segment longer.\n\nUnlike classic Snake, your snakebirds are not self-driving, they are affected by gravity, and there are sometimes several to control within a single level.\n\nIf there is fruit in a level, you must collect it all to unlock the exit. In addition, you must guide ALL of a level's snakebirds to the exit, not just one. This might not sound like that big of an obstacle until you realize that some levels require your snakebirds to climb on each other to advance.\n\nThese are not easy puzzles. There are a few basic stages to ease you into the rules, but then you're thrown right into the heavy stuff. Thankfully, the game is not purely linear. When you solve one level, the levels adjecent on the world map will be unlocked, regardless of how they are numbered. This is a feature that I worry will be overlooked by a lot of people, and more puzzle games would do well to incorporate it. I couldn't tell you how many times I got frustrated on a puzzle, then left to play a different puzzle, and returned later with success.\n\nAnother great feature: the game remembers every move you make on a given attempt, so instead of having to restart a stage every time you fall offscreen or land on spikes or get yourself trapped, you can hit Undo as many times as you like.\n\nThere are multiple methods of controlling your snakebirds, but my personal recommendation is the skip the mouse during puzzles and use arrow keys to move, Tab to switch between snakebirds, and Backspace to undo.\n\nIf you're looking for a timewaster, you might not have a very good time with this one. If you're looking for actually difficult actual puzzles that require thought and planning, you should strongly consider Snakebird.\n\nGrapes / 10","January 9","true","18.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are several different mechanics to work with such as collecting fruit, using portals, pushable blocks and controlling multiple snakebirds. While the mechanics themselves aren't that special, the ways in which they are combined with the snakebirds lead to some complex solutions.

It is a very solid puzzle game - and it's a good puzzle game, not just a good game. I know I wanted a puzzle game that wasn't deceptive towards the player and this game does just that - that's why it's a good puzzle game, and not simply a good game.\n\nSnakebird is a difficult puzzle game. Use the Steam achievements to check out the completion rate of this game - that was an instant-buy for me. The art style happens to work wonders to keep players from the verge of frustration. Despite it looking like a children's puzzle game from the outset, it quickly ramps up and its audience changes drastically.\n\nThe game itself has incredibly varied graphics and mechanics, which helps for keeping your mindset changing throughout levels. Despite being abstract, it still manages to be immersive with a pleasant art style and great sound design to go with it. The level progression allows you to visit several individual levels at one point in the game, so a spike in difficulty in one level will not prevent you from playing the rest of the game.\n\nThe only flaws I could recall in the game are that your level progress does not get individually saved (however, if you quit the game during a level, it will save that, but only that). Another "flaw" could be the lack of a hint system, but such a feature would be a detraction from the main selling point of the game's challenge. The sound and music also lack sliders to change their percentage.\n\nOne word of note: your snake can stand on the fruits, just like any other block. I did not realize this at first because I thought the background scenery was the limit of the snake's movement path.\n\nEDIT: The undo mouse bind being on the fourth button is now on middle mouse, so I've changed my review to reflect this.","May 18, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

By combining everybody’s favourite Nokia game and one of the weirdest looking necks on an animal, Noumenon Games released an unexpectedly thoughtful 2D puzzler that’s receiving criminally low attention. While not everyone might want to trade their scales for feathers, it’s worth finding out why this indie title is even greater than the old cell phone sensation.\n\nOn a first glance Snakebird is deceptively simple, with soft bright colours and shapes giving the game its child-like innocence. Your perception is corrected quickly however, with puzzle designs that are extraordinarily tight and meticulous, and often only have one way to be solved. The mechanics are simple; there’s no real tutorial because the pick-up and play style and the game’s method of subtle teaching doesn’t need it. The objective in each stage is to collect every piece of fruit before successfully reaching the goal portal. Just as in the classic game of Snake each fruit you eat adds an extra unit of length, a mechanic that makes some levels an experiment in discovering which fruit should be eaten first. Players can move in a forward direction with only immediate turns available to them, turning what seems to be a stage that can be easily traversed into an abstract thought exercise. You’ll quickly run into a problem where you can’t back out, it starts to sink in that there’s a lot more to this title. Levels are precisely crafted, there’s no wasted space and everything presented has been a contemplated part of the puzzle. Stages begin with a single Snakebird, but soon players are asked to manage 2 or three at a time, quickly adding layers to the challenge. Later on moveable blocks become staples to puzzles as well, and being able to handle using these objects to interact together effectively is what’s key to success.\n\nFor the amount it stumps you the game hardly induces a serious level of frustration, and when it does it’s often just enough to motivate you to attempt a different tactic. Answers often require out of the box approaches; there’s almost a paradoxical feel to many of the game’s solutions. You’ll discover what needs to be accomplished and spend 10 minutes exploring every way why that’s impossible, only to eventually arrive at a moment where the entire puzzle makes sense. It’s about discovery in little ways, and learning how to test every theory your mind can toss at a problem and then some. Despite the sometimes impossible-feeling difficulty progression never really feels too far away. Upon death you’re replaced where you were just before your last move, and the always available quick reverse option to undo any mistakes you’ve made is a great design choice to make the player want to experiment as much as possible without feeling punished.\n\nThe classic world map layout is a great way to present non-linear stage progression; more skilled players can attempt harder levels after only completing a handful, but most will likely stick to the beaten path and enjoy the gradual rise in difficulty through the well thought-out introductions to new concepts. You’ll start to learn optimal movement patterns and ways to contort your birds just through design and ramping complexity. It’s refreshing how much credit the game gives to the player’s intelligence; puzzles are created in a way as to tempt you into all sorts of traps, but it has enough sense to let you work out what exactly needs to be done about a situation. There’s absolutely no fat to weigh anything down either. A great deal of care has been taken in presenting what’s vital in each stage without distraction, allowing each player to absorb every idea at their own pace. With such simplicity, it manages to teach complex ideas without uttering a word.\n\nThere’s a stark contrast between the feelings brought out by gameplay and what’s experienced through the game’s visual tone. The simple but elegant aesthetic relaxes you even on long sittings of little progress. The fine attention to detail is there too; there are adorable facial expressions on the birds to show their excitement or fear, and various clickable objects to randomly interact with. The multiple control setups allows for great ease of access. Players can engage through keyboard, controller, or even use the mouse to drag Snakebirds around. This control scheme leads us to believe that it wouldn’t be much of a stretch to see this game on the mobile market, and it would be a magnificent addition.\n\nOn the surface it might even look like a game for children, but Snakebird is far from it. With its excruciating difficulty and great feeling of reward upon completion, it deserves to be regarded among more well-known complex indie puzzlers. If you’re ever up for some serious low cost brain-bending just try to feed the Snakebirds.\nSCORE: 8.4\n","May 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The presentation oozes charm, and the core mechanic of combining the classic Snake with a variation on traditional Klotski puzzles intrigued me no end.\n\nI was not disappinted! This may very well be the most enjoyable puzzle game I've ever played. You're eased in gently for the first few levels, but the difficulty increases very quickly. Mercifully the game does let up now and then, giving you a couple of easier levels after introducing a new mechanic, such as moveable blocks and portals. Also, while the stages are numbered sequentially, you are not forced to play them as such, so if one particular puzzle is giving you a headache you can move on and come back to it at another time.\n\nThe later levels pose a formidable challenge, and a few took me close to an hour each to figure out. It never feels cheap however - while difficult, the puzzles are fair and after each mistake, I usually felt one step closer to finding the solution. With puzzles such as the aformentioned Klotski, I find my interest wanes and I eventually turn to a guide, but Snakebird engaged me in such a way that I was compelled to persevere, and the feeling of satisifaction at finally cracking some of the trickier stages was palpable.\n\nSnakebird is a prime example of how to do Indie games well. By focussing on one relatively simple core mechanic, Noumenon have been able to craft a finely honed gameplay experience, with far more complexity than you might expect.

The amount of care and effort that went into designing the puzzles is more than evident. The amount of interesting ideas that they managed to extract from such simple mechanics is incredible, arguably even moreso than Braid (which is already fantastic).\n\nIf you like puzzles, after playing this I can almost guarantee that you will be so disappointed at the low quality of a lot of the puzzle games out there. Would recommend to anyone who likes clever puzzles and wants a real challenge. If you think that games like Hexcells are pretty easy and boring then this is definitely for you (although admittedly difficulty did not appear to be its goal). If you thought that Hexcells was hard then you should play this to find out what great puzzle design means.\n\nAlternatively, would recommend to anyone who likes to torture their friends.\n\nGive me Snakebird plush please","January 20","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, the game is exceptionally well done. It looks beautiful and the game mechanics are extremely smart and intuitive.\n\nBut it is unbelievably hard. I have played Braid, The Talos Principle or The Swapper before and never really got stuck. Those games teach you basic principles and then present you with bigger problems where you can use your new knowledge. Not so Snakebird. Every level is a random puzzle without any connection to the one before. There is no communication happening between the developers and the player. Unfortunately, when this silent communication happens it is when I love puzzle games the most.\n\nI mean, anyone can come up with exceptionally hard puzzles. I could present you with a random chess board and ask you to show me the least number of moves in order to get to that same chess board configuration. There, you have a hard puzzle game. Unfortunately, the only way to solve it is to know the movement rules of each figure and then think it backwards, keeping infinitely complex decision trees in mind.\n\nA Rubik's Cube is the same and I think this is the best analogy. This game feels (and looks) very much like a Rubik's Cube.\n\nI made it to level 15 without cheating. After that, I had to look up the solutions for most maps on Youtube. At level 25 I gave up.\n\nThe thing is, I don't even know how to improve the game. It is a quite perfect game.

The game is fun and feels complete because it covers every way in which a snakebird could be used uniquely and interestingly.\n\nIt's harder than most puzzle games I have tried, but not hard enough to stop me from beating it quickly.\n\nI recommend this game to most puzzle players.","May 21, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun and feels complete because it covers every way in which a snakebird could be used uniquely and interestingly.\n\nIt's harder than most puzzle games I have tried, but not hard enough to stop me from beating it quickly.\n\nI recommend this game to most puzzle players.","May 21, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't hold your hand, it's a fair dinkum ball buster. It's really polished too; Nice animations and audio, the level feels alive.\n\nMy biggest (and probably only) gripe with the game is that when in the zone, switching snakebirds in a level that has 3 is not immediately obivious which one is selected.

Some of them almost appeared to be impossible (especially the rainbow ones!).\n\nThe core mechanic is really simple, but every time you think you know how it works and what can be done with it, there's more "impossible" puzzles thrown at you that you now how to make "possible".\n\nThere were really no nonsense levels (like tedious ones that are just there to pad out the game). Each puzzle do something different from the other ones and have their own solution.\n\nI got that "switch" in your head flipped a whole lot from when you didn't know how to solve the puzle to then understanding what the solution is(or one of them?).\n\nIf you like puzzle games Snakebird is definitly worth your time, it has pure and well designed puzzles!\n\n\n\n\nThe only problems I had were minor and had mostly to do with the controls.\n\nThe feedback on wich snake I just took control over wasn't very clear. I often moved the wrong snakebird (and if they fell off screen or into spikes it could get annoying sometimes because there's a little delay and the focus could switch to another snakebird).\n\nThe undo was also a bit confusing, it sometimes switches focus to the previous snakebird when you undo instead of just undoing the move you made. An example:\n--\nThere is a green and a blue snakebird.\nThe focus is on blue.\n>Switch focus to green\n>Move\n>Undo\nIt undid the move and also switched the focus to blue.\n--\n\nProgress on a puzzle did not save when I exited to the map then returned to it.(it whould have been nice to have).","May 13, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What makes the game so challenging is how well thought out all of the puzzles are. This game is not for everyone, but anyone who wants a challenging puzzle game will surely be pleased with Snakebird.\n\nUnfortunately, Snakebird has been widely ignored by the press. The game appears to be a casual game for children to play from its screenshots. But if a child were to complete this he/she would need a serious amount of persistence and brain power. This game is not designed for children, but some may enjoy it.\n\nEach area in Snakebird introduces new mechanics that serve well for making a variety of different puzzles. Every puzzle feels very unique and the gameplay always feels fresh. If you are stuck on a level, go on to a different one and come back to it. Snakebird will not only test your puzzle skills but also your persistance. People who are very impatient will struggle to finish this game.\n\nForget about the fancy graphics and mindless entertainment that a lot of next-gen games are giving nowadays. Snakebird forces whoever plays it to think and provides a good challenge for those who enjoy puzzles.

While some levels were incredibly easy (mostly starting level and when a new aspect is introduced) others had me pulling hairs out my head questioning whether or not the game is even beatable.\n\nFor a game that you could easily put in 10+ hours into, the base price is well worth it. However, if you ever see it on sale then it is a must buy.\n","May 20, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun and feels complete because it covers every way in which a snakebird could be used uniquely and interestingly.\n\nIt's harder than most puzzle games I have tried, but not hard enough to stop me from beating it quickly.\n\nI recommend this game to most puzzle players.","May 21, 2015","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda hard to believe how small a level and a bunch of snakes can be made a complicated level that has multiple phases.\n\nI have to admit, I didn't listen to the soundtrack. Maybe I should have but music for the start of the game didn't excite so I listened to my own music or nothing at all. Also sound effects were off.\n\nThe art is ok, not anything too impressive, or does not try to be anything what suits the game, but there are details enough that it feels fresh, and the crispness and brilliant colours feel natural.\n\nThe game length I have on Steam does not reflect fully the time I spent on it because I had the game running when away.

These puzzles are so hard, so unless you're especially gifted at solving them then you'll probably end up frustrated like me. It's hard enough to have a sliding tile puzzle in which you need to map out a string moves in order to reach a goal, but most sliding tile puzzles work on a tabletop, free of external influences. Snakebird adds to the sliding tile puzzle by adding the effect of gravity. So now, the complications have doubled. You have to plan for how the Snakebird can fall.
