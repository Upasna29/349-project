The graphics are very good, some of the scenes are gorgeous. The sounds and music are okay, voices are nice.The minigames are very well done. The HOG scenes are really gorgeous. The items can sometimes be hard to find, and a couple of items were mislabeled, but on the whole the HOGs scenes are of above average quality: very beautiful and challenging. Searching all the scenes with the medallion is fun and the idea is original, so kudos for that, devs.\nThe story is a fantasy tale, very cliché but it holds up fine. The game was unvoluntarily funny a couple of times, being a bit overreact and cheesy but that made it fun; the cutscenes are well done.\n\nI really liked it, played it in one go because I contstantly wanted to see next scene. It's like a good Artifex Mundi, without the deadly serious tone. I'm fine with the game being a bit short since I got it for sale with a nice dicount, 3 hours is a good minimum for a good HOG.\n\n(There's a problem with the game EXE erroneously being flagged as a virus and I had to deactivate my AV to be able to play the game.)","January 7","true","3.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

I enjoyed playing it in casual mode. Puzzles are interesting but not too difficult. I had a good rhythm going while playing. I would have enjoyed the beautiful artwork more if it were available in higher resolution than 720p.","June 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The addition of the talisman-view to find even-more-hidden hidden objects is a nice touch that adds some uniqueness to the game.\n\nGraphics seem a little outdated but they're colorful and nicely put together.  More importantly, the hidden object scenes are very nicely done without any pixel-hunting or egregious naming errors.  The scenes aren't immensely challenging but they aren't overly easy either.  Minigames are also nicely put together and some are refreshingly unique from the standard fare in this genre.\n\nMusic is pretty but voice acting is just plain terrible in most cases.  This is more common than otherwise in this genre of game, just be aware that if you're like me and really value good voicework, you won't be impressed here.  However, if you are also like me and play a lot of these games, you're probably already resigned to the fact that voicing is rarely tolerable and it won't bother you any.\n\nOverall, it's a recommendation due to smooth gameplay and some unique aspects although the story is a little formulaic.  Just don't go into it expecting a masterpiece, rather take it for what it is: a fun, simple way to kill a couple hours for a decent price.","October 1, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miss888/recommended/377120/","Miss888","MissyJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miss888/","20 products in account",""I was thoroughly enjoying this game until I lost a whole profile. In addition, I couldn't access a second profile after it kept crashing at the same point. Whenever I broke the same wall (not my house btw) in the game, it would crash.\n\nIt is a real shame that it cannot be rectified according to some sources. It appears a refund is the only answer at this stage. Unless, anyone else might know how to fix it? I would really like to complete all of the puzzles.\n\nIt would've been a 'thumbs up' for the game. However, I'll need to give it a thumbs down as I can't access two profiles properly now :("\n\nThat was then, I've since completed the game with a new profile without turning my computer off. An admin assisted me with my tech query. He suggested I change the difficulty setting and have it windowed completely. It still didn't work but when I followed those instructions with a 'new' profile and without jumping too far ahead of the game there were no problems. I'm glad I changed the recommendation to a 'thumbs up* and a 'high five" for the admin responding so quickly.

There is a travel map but no highlighted areas of interest. Also the voice overs are terrible and the graphics older. It will run on current widescreen monitors however, just overall not a satisfying game for me. You may like it however I would recommend getting it on sale.","June 11, 2015","false","2.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

I've been playing these types of games on a HTPC connected to my LCD TV, which barely meets the recommended requirements for this game.  Other HOGs have performed fine.  Performance for Chronicle Keepers however was sluggish; transitions from one location to the next took a noticeable pause, as did zoomed in windows for hotspots.  Kaspersky also quarantined the game executable complaining of trojan or something.  I reinstalled the game on my main gaming computer which has far better specs.  Performance was somewhat improved but it wasn't as smooth as other HOGs on the HTPC.  Bitdefender didn't complain about the game executable so I think Kaspersky's identification is a false positive.\n\nThe game itself is fairly short (took me ~4 hrs total).  The puzzles are fairly easy and the hidden object scenes for the most part were easy too.  However there was at least one misnamed object (ladybird instead of ladybug) and a few spelling errors in the V.O. captions.  Objects you had to locate outside of hidden objects scenes were sometimes very difficult to distinguish from the background.  Hidden object scenes also suffered from occasionally having several objects of the same type with only one of them counting.\n\nThe story could not have been more generic.  Descriptions of objective items were liberally sprinkled with words like "eternal" just to make the story sound more mystical.  None of the characters, or even the setting, was given any depth.  There's not much story depth to these games in general but Chronicle Keepers:  The Dreaming Garden has the most cardboard characters and setting I've come across yet.\n\nThe art work was fine and the locations were usually interesting to look at.  But the reasoning for you to do anything (acquire the eternal tree elixir, get the boatsman's lamp, etc.) came across as more contrived than is usual for this genre.\n\nNot recommended.  I paid $1.24.  I got my money's worth but there are better games on Steam, and far better HOGs you could spend your dollar on.","May 10","false","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
