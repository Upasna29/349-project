"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TorNis/recommended/331190/","TorNis","[TwitchTV]TorNis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TorNis/","396 products in account","First to review a game, so nervous ;-;\n\nI streamed a full walkthrough of this on Twitch and this is what I have to say:\n\nIf you are looking for challenging precision platformer, with high quality pixel art backgrounds, fitting music, engaging retro-style cinematic cutscenes - this game is for you.\n\nThe game itself is really simple, you play as Master Spy, who can only jump(+double jump roll, which is important move) and clock/decloak to solve all your platformer needs. Every level consists of 1 or more screen where you have to find keycard/s to unlock the exit to the next level. Be warned, levels quickly become from easy to really hard and each new level tries to add a new mechanic to the enemies or environment. Cutscenes in this game will probably inspire you to play more and more to uncover what's going to be next in the game. And speaking of cutscenes, I strongly suggest look for 8 very well hidden secret areas in the game which also unlock even MORE cutscenes to the main plot.\nNot gonna spoil much, but consider engaging gameplay experience.\n\nIf you played games like Super Meat Boy, Boshy or any other action precision platformers, you will find this game quite similiar to your likings.\n\nThe only minor complaints I have is that game doesn't have at the moment configurable Audio, only disable everything. No sliders for music or SFX. So Windows Mixer is the only thing you can do besides using your hardware's sliders.\nNo reconfigurable buttons and instead of classic PC platforming scheme of Z and X, game uses X and C buttons, "C" for "Cloak". Expect at first to missclicks a lot to Z when you want to jump, which will fail for you, if you are used to classic Z/X controls. Alternatively, you can use Controller.\n\nP.S. Press T while you are in game's level :P\n","September 8, 2015","true","7.9"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","40","49","0","1"

Be cautious.\n\n\nI noticed some people recommend it, despite the fact that they have refunded it or couldn't complete it. I'm not one of them - yes, it's a a really hard platformer, and if you like these type of games, you will get into it. However, the problem is the difficulty spike. The game slowly gets harder with every level, introducing new mechanics, until act 3 when it suddenly becomes frustratingly hard, more like "I wanna be the guy" type of game. The fact that "Novice" difficulty can be that harsh doesn't look like a well thought design. I finally gave up somewhere around 3-8.\n\nThe retro graphic looks nice and the music is very good - for a while. However, after some time the game loses it's charm - the music starts to get tedious and the specific graphic style connected with small levels and big character sometimes make it harder to be precise. The puzzle aspect is an interesting idea, but combined together with precision and a very tight timing eventually turn the game experience from fun to unpleasant.\n\nIn the end I have mixed feelings about this game - it's good as a platformer, but it's nothing truly amazing, and the difficulty curve around what seems to be half of the game ruined the overall experience for me. Then again, I've bought it with around 80% discount, and I'd say I got my money's worth. But if you're going to buy it for full price, make sure you're up to the challenge this game will pose.","May 15","false","4.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

It's a zero-tolerance exercise in perfection as you cloak and jump your way through progressively more challenging rooms.  Beating your face into a brick wall has never been quite this much fun!\n\nPros:\n-Really great pixel graphics.  From the sprites to the backgrounds to the cutscenes everything looks AMAZING.\n-Great spy music plays while you fail repeatedly.\n-Fun sound effects while you fail repeatedly.\n-Super cheesy dialogue that is a huge and welocme through back to zany over-the-top arcade games of yore.  It had a bit of a Far Cry: Blood Dragon vibe in how it paid homage the way it did.  I loved it.\n-Easy to learn but difficult to master; Master Spy is a one trick pony but using that trick in creative ways is really tricky and, in the end, satisfying when you win.\n-This game does a great job of easing you into more difficult situations; adding in guards, dogs, lazers, pressure plates, ninjas, sharks and they all are horrible and I wish they didn't exist.\n-This game is addictive. I keep going back after rage-quitting to give a level another go.\n\nCons:\n-I'm not used to games where you don't get extra skills to help ease the challenges as you progress.  Then again, he isn't "Learning-as-he-goes Spy".\n-There aren't enough opportinuties to take different approaches to a level.  A lot have just one viable way to win and figuring it out can be tedious.\n-A controller is manditory. Seriously. Unless you are some keyboard hot shot I'd streneously object to not having a controller.\n\nAll in all I'd be really disappointed if Master Spy didn't do well.  It's exactly what the hardcore PC gaming audience seems to eat up and it's too good a time to pass up.  I'd say "Master Spy" is more like a "Master BUY" oh my god ♥♥♥♥ me sideways for that.\n\nDisclosure; I was provided press aces to Master Spy for review purposes.

Why toss my hat in at this point? Because this game deserves it. The release was too recent to call it a hidden gem, but it's definitely a gem that deserves more positive reviews.\n\nChances are if you've navigated to this page you have some interest in this type of game. If so, I have only one thing to ask before wholeheartedly recommending this game. Are you very put off by having to die many times in the process of learning and then pulling off heavily execution-intensive plans? If not, get this game. Everything about the game works extremely well, particularly the soundtrack and controls - both important in such a rigorous platformer. It is true what others have said: Master Spy is frustrating because of how demanding it is, but almost never unfair.\n\nIt took me probably a little long to beat Novice Mode at 5.7 hours, as I kept grinding through levels even when my execution was slacking badly, but there are harder modes and a little extra content already revealed to me so far. If you're worried about playtime, I will definitely be playing more of this game, and even at this point I would definitely say it is worth $10.","September 13, 2015","true","13.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

You have to move and think very quickly, stages are short, difficult and intense. There's none of the waiting about or clearing levels of enemies in this game, so all the slow fiddly bits of stealth are gone.\n\nIt is *hard* though, you're going to lose a lot and have to learn from your mistakes.\n\nGreat music too (just listen to the trailer). Very authentic sounding retro sound effects.\n\nBackgrounds are lovely and apparently all are hand-pixeled, the cinematics are really neat too. It feels like the cinematics were really pulled from the glory days of pixely adventure games, rather than being retro for retro's sake.

Sure, under the hood stealth is avoidance and timing so the line is blurred. But this one definitely belongs alongside super meat boy and other high precision platformers rather than stealth titles. But don't let this turn you off on the game, it's really fun to play.\n\nThe comparison to super meat boy is a good one. It learns from it. Repetition is good when it doesn't waste our time. So you die and instantly respawn. And you will die. A lot. In one chapter I died more than 400 times. We have a wide spectrum of mechanics to keep the game fresh, the invisibility cloak makes you invisible and slower, some enemies move back and forth, some only move when you have your back to them, others instantly jump at you independent of cloak etc. You learn as you go.\n\nMy main criticism is that these levels are quite big. This kind of gameplay of high precision, difficult, repetitive, works better with short levels. There is a checkpoint system in the game but I don't find it nearly generous enough. And it is awkward to say the least. It saves when you 'pick' a file object. So naturally it disappears after you pick it up. Then you start asking yourself 'should I have picked this up after doing something else?' then you discover that there is a super hard section ahead and you picked the file (saved) before a less tough one, so every time you respawn you have to redo the less hard section first. You could reset the level and pick up the checkpoints in a better order but that requires replaying some of the level, which can be quite the pain.\n\nI'm still playing the game, cursing and yelling as I go, but I always return to it. It's very compelling! Worth buying.","September 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Highly anticipated, Master Spy spent a lot of time in development, but to its credit, for almost the whole time from the moment the project started there was a playable DEMO that drew you into the world of Master Spy. I followed Master Spy as it started its GreenLight process through Steam and was quickly accepted. I remember playing it for the first time in maybe late 2013 early 2014 and just KNOWING this game had to be part of my library.\n\nIt's a Puzzle Game on the outside, and a Platformer at heart, Master Spy has created an incredible array traps that require tactics to make it through each room in the game. Each new screen, or room, is a puzzle and manages to keep things fresh as well as keeping you on your toes. Master Spy invokes a special move allowing you to become invisible and unseen, this element of the game brings it to another level completely. At the end of each Mission you are graded on how many times you were caught or died, not to mention creativity. The grading system is one of those little things that I always talk about that just adds that extra competitive edge to the game, making you strive to do better the next time around.\n\n"In a world of corruption and decay, you're not just good at what you do - you're the best. And with the aid of your prototype cloaking suit and quick wit, you'll sneak your way past a multitude of enemies and obstacles, all while uncovering a plot of conspiracy and intrigue that thrusts you into a role far greater than your contract promised." - Master Spy (STEAM)\n\nThe graphics in Master Spy remind me of an old NES game, and it almost feels like one as you play through. There's obviously such an attention to deal and a good example of this is Master Spy keeping you engaged with a fantastic story with epic cut scenes full of 8-bit glory. The music in each room is done perfectly and goes well with what you're being thrown into. Certainly an awesome soundtrack for sure. Game mechanics are smooth and responsive, I couldn't ask for more player friendly game honestly.\n\nI really like the variations throughout each Mission. All the different traps that are incorporated into new rooms, along with the checkpoint system is just incredible. Don't let the concept and games retro look confuse you as to how hard it is. Master Spy certainly requires a lot of thought before proceeding onto the next part of the screen,.involving precise movements of moments of invisibility to continue. Even on novice difficulty the game seems almost unreasonable. Although when the end of the screen comes up and you complete it, it's almost like a relief that you finally made it, but totally satisfying. I guess the only other thing I can say is, once you figure out how to deal with the invisible ninjas, they aren't really that big of an issue anymore...\n\nWith that being said, this game is awesome. I totally suggest it with every bone in my body. I know the developer, he's a really cool guy, and put a lot of hard work into this game. AND IT SHOWS TREMENDOUSLY THROUGHOUT. If you are a fan of the NES era 8-bit style games, this is one for you, and perfect for your library. Your Mission if you choose to accept it is to become the Master Spy.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nPlayability: 9/10\nStory: 9/10\nChallenge: 10/10\nReplay Value: 7/10\n","February 5","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

The mechanics are unique, but not so convoluted that you lose track of what does what; the controls are simply "move, jump, and crouch to cloak", and the obstacles are fairly easy to comprehend the point of even without tripping them. Simple, but effective. And of course, the retro-style graphics, sounds, and music make for a great throwback to the old days; the plot, however, is in no way "old", as it manages to keep you intrigued the whole way through. However, I shall avoid elaborating on that so as to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe goal in each room is to collect the key cards to unlock the elevator at the end, and then get into the elevator. You must avoid guards, cameras, motion detectors, guard dogs, and plenty of other interesting obstacles and traps that almost become absurd (spinning sawblades and sleeping tigers? Someone apparently decided to spend their promotion paycheck on security advancements). A simple goal, but difficult to pull off without quite becoming frustrating. You need\ntiming, reflexes, and a keen eye; much more interesting than the usual "crawl around and hide behind walls" that seems to plague a lot of stealth games these days.\n\nI haven't beaten this game, but I can safely say that it will provide a very nice challenge even to those of you who consider yourselves particularly good at stealth platformers.

It's a very fun game and has beautiful pixel graphics, the music is great and, for the most part, the controls are tight.\n\nPros     Beautiful pixel graphics\nGreat soundtrack with fast, energetic tracks to compliment the gameplay.\nSimple to learn, hard to master.\nNo fighting mechanics, all about stealth, puzzles and speed.\nCons     While playing with an Xbox 360 controller I had many inputs eaten.\nOptions menu could be a bit more robust.\nConclusion\nThis game is really fun and the difficulty ramps up quite quickly to ensure you don't get bored. The controls are very simple and the gameplay focuses on puzzles over any "action fighting" style gameplay, which is a refreshing change from games trying to cram in half baked combat ideas to otherwise wonderful games. The game seems to be a good length for the price and the story is good so far. All in all, definitely worth a buy if you're into more stealth and less action.\n\n7/10","September 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The controls are more crisp than any NES/SEGA platformer, and the lack of hardware limitations means the backgrounds are absolutely beautiful.\n\nFrom a storytelling level, this game is also a near masterpiece--the so-contrived-its-almost-dada dialogue pairs perfectly well with the over-the-top plot, and the vector cutscenes tie the whole affair together beautifully--everything works together perfectly here.\n\nFrom a level design standpoint, Master Spy has a spelunky-style education system, where the game introduces new hazards and problems then encourages you to solve them via repeated death.  Unlike spelunky Master Spy has mid-scene checkpoints, meaning the game avoids some of the frustration problems you might get with Spelunky-like games.\n\nThis game is a fantastic example of mechanics, aesthetic and narrative all working together to produce a fantastic gaming experience.  10/10.","September 24, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game combines vanilla platformer gameplay with a core mechanic of stealth/avoidance, which rewards precision and forethought.  As the game progresses, new obstacles and mechanics are added at a very steady pace - just as you've started to get the hang of one death-trap, it throws a new one (or two) into the mix.  By the later stages of the game, you'll have to navigate some truly terrifying areas that want to chop you up in just about every way imaginable - but the levels are cleverly designed and follow a clear logical pattern.  You'll find that, as with most spy movies, if you move fearlessly and don't hesitate, the right moment will often present itself - you will always have just the right amount of time to jump away from that tiger, and find just the right window to slide between two guards, and have just the right timing to land on a spike trap as it disarms.\n\nThat's what it's about - evading certain death by the skin of your teeth and living to spy another day.  It's a really gratifying challenge, and it's accompanied by beautiful cut-scenes and music that give the game tons of style and charisma.  After beating the game, I'm really interested in revisiting the levels to find any extras and see if I can cut down on my times.","October 27, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's an difficult, yet rewarding experience that involves you having to work out how to get through a room and then having to execute on that plan without being caught. The enemies/obstacles individually feature some basic, yet very readable behaviors which is important in a stealth game. Those enemies/obstacles are combined and tied together wonderfully to with the level design to bring out some really intense and awesome moments.\n\nOn top of all of that is some great pixel art and music. Both of these tie together very well to bring out an awesome 80's action movie/NES aesthetic. This game also features cutscenes which are wonderfully reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden and help drive that aesthetic home.\n\nI very much recommend this game to everyone, but especially to anyone who enjoys platformers, stealth action games, or anyone who likes the idea of MGS1's arcadey stealth being transformed into a platformer and painted over with a coat of 80's action/NES aesthetics.","December 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is amazing! It's controls are simple, but what it lacks in complexity with controls, it more than makes up for with complexity in gameplay, much like the old style of video games this gem is based off of. Basically, the first level starts out relativley simple, getting you used to the cloaking and stealth aspects of the game. It forces you to learn what traps do what and how to avoid them by a bit of trial and error. I find this system MUCH better than outright telling you or forcing you through a tutorial, because it lets the player feel like they figured it out themselves and earned it. With regards to death or getting, the game is very generous, but in the right ways. Each time you get to a checkpoint, a nice little beep happens. There are checkpoints every one or two screens or so, so death won't set you back to far. Worried it sounds a bit too easy? It's not! This game is so generous with checkpoints because each area is very challenging. I've only played on normal mode so far and it's very difficult, but there's a harder difficulty as well. Pretty much, this game forces you to figure out how to get through a room's traps and guards, then use quick reflexes and timing to get through; it's a beautiful blend of puzzle solving and skill. Gameplay-wise I find this game to be nearly perfect (something VERY rare for me to say!). Now that I've shared my thoughts on the most important aspect, I'll move on to the more aesthetic parts of the game. The soundtrack is amazing! Definitley pick it up if you enjoy the music in the trailer. The graphics are very stylized to look like an old DOS game or something, and the virtual screen is curved to simulate the curve of an old monitor. The graphics are beautiful in their own way, and add some mystique to the game (perfect for a spy game!). The cutscenes, music, and sound effects work together very well to set a mysterious atmosphere. I have next to no complaints (again VERY rare for me to say). As someone who enjoys old NES games and a good challenge, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game.","December 21, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The music's neatn too, and the various puzzles introduced through the environment keep you thinking and twitching.\n\nIt's hard not to compare MS to Super Meat Boy (SMB) because you'll die plenty of times trying to pass a screen, with immense reward when you pull it off. That said, it doesn't pull it off as elegantly as SMB due to the nature of a MS level consisting of multiple screens with strategically placed checkpoints along the way. None of these checkpoints allow you to quit the game and keep your mid-level progress, so make sure you have a large chunk of time to play a whole level. Imagine in SMB if you had to complete 10 levels before you could save it and quit without losing that progress. That's what MS is like.\n\nSome of the checkpoints are poorly placed, making you repeat multiple screens over and over again. I've just hit one of those towards the end of a level and after already playing for a nearly an hour I just quit (losing my progress on that level) and I don't feel like playing it for a while now. Also, With no mid-level save you'll want to make sure you have a big chunk of time to devote to this, as you'll lose all progress in those screens within the level.\n\nMaster Spy is a fun, challenging game.

A key mechanic in the game is a cloak you can use to hide from human enemies and cameras - animals will smell and attack you, which makes sense. While you're using it, you can still move, but not very fast, and you can't jump very well horizontally.\n\nThat's not too bad when it's just simple timing, but it quickly becomes you needing to switch between being mobile and being safe from getting detected by most enemies really quickly, while dodging other hazards. You see some of that in the trailer, which I probably should have given a second look, so it's more my own fault really. There's nothing really wrong with the game at all provided you like precision platforming, I just didn't like that aspect of it.\n\nAlso as an aside, it's a bit lame when you have a cutscene of your character easily dealing with an enemy when you can't actually do anything about them in the game.","May 20","false","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

The music and sound effects are annoying after a couple of levels, and the missions are far too same old same.\n\nIf there was any way I could get a refund, I would!","February 24","false","0.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","3"

You would be wrong. The graphics, controls, and difficulty are a nice throwback to the 8-bit days. The soundtrack is catchy as well.\n\nYou will find yourself several hours later trying to beat one more level. Good luck.","February 29","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
