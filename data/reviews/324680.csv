I have at least 3000 hours played on the original version.\n\nYes. Most definitely yes. This is the game that introduced me to the RTS genre. Heck, it introduced me to the world of video games. I had no idea what was waiting for me. Countless hours creating army after army, attempting to beat the hardest AI.Playing the Campaign.Playing Multiplayer, with what was left of the community.It all has been time i couldn't have spent better elsewhere. And I'm glad i didn't. Seeing IC come back from the dead like this... TO STEAM NO LESS. I just can't wrap my head around this.\nNow, for the actual review:  This is my first game review so please don't judge. I will try my best :D.\n\n\nThings and points I like most about the game:\n\n1. It is fun. Every feature of the game is. From playing the campaign, all the way to making your own custom army that you then take onto the battlefield!!! Insert 300 reference here.\n\n2. It is creative. I think the whole over 50.000 possible combinations and the presence of a level editor say everything.\n\n3.It is challenging. Boy this one is so true. Especially if you are playing multiplayer. THERE IS NO MERCY ON THE FIGHTING GROUND. IN THIS GAME YOU EITHER WRECK FACE OR GET YOUR FACE REKT. Well...\nyou know...\nit depends on who you're up against.Either way, before you hop into online play, it's best that you know how to play the game the slightest bit. Preferably play the tutorial.\nSorry if I misspelled anything. ^_^\n\nNOW, FOR THE RATINGS. (Man this is long. You still with me? Hold on just a little longer.)\n\nGraphics = 9\nBefore you go and tell everybody that the graphics suck, just take in consideration the year this game was made. This was revolutionary back then! Sometimes small glitches happen but very solid nonetheless.\n\nMusic = 8\nThe soundtracks differ in every map type (Savannah, Jungle, Desert, Artic...).They are good. Nothing else to say here. Move on.\n\nCreativity / Originality = 10\nYou can slap wings on a snake.\n\nStory = 7\nI personally didn't like the story that much : P . Multiplayer, army making and skirmishes agaisnt the AI make up for it.\n\nGameplay = 10\nThe Multiplayer matches can be either fast-paced or slow-paced. There is no way to tell what kind of creature combinations your enemy has got in their armies, so it really depends on the game style of the players. A lot of maps that further increase the diversity of the games. They are either ground based maps, or water based maps. (Could be a mix of both too).\n\nOverall = 9\n\nAll this being said, this game is a must-have for every person out there that likes a very good Real-Time Strategy game.","November 11, 2015","true","452.0"," 382 of 418 people (91%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","91","382","418","53","39"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015801884/recommended/324680/","76561198015801884","koirassanikaan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015801884/","195 products in account","First of all, I'm biased-- I'm one of those strange and twisted folk who kept playing this game after its original release fell into obscurity, and for years now the Impossible Creatures community has been fluctuating with an average of a dozen or so people at any given time, worldwide. But then, one day, Nordic Games approached us few survivors and told us of their plan to re-release the game on Steam; we jumped onboard as beta testers, and the day has finally come for release!\n\nSo yes-- basically, I'm not the most impartial of sources. But it's important for me to point out that Nordic has in no way asked or cajoled me to provide this review, nor have they had any input into its content. I'm just a fan of the game. In fact, I know the game inside and out, and that's why you should listen when I say: holy ♥♥♥♥, Impossible Creatures is amazing.\n\nLook, let's get the honest criticism out of the way early on-- this game came out in the very early 2000's. It does not look like Skyrim. The models are fairly low-detail (watch the trailer and look at the screenshots) and a lot of the gameplay elements-- build gatherers, gather resources, build buildings, tech up-- won't blow anyone's mind in a modern context. But that's not why this game is important; it's important because of its quirky, brilliant central idea-- its gimmick, if you will. Because as you no doubt have already noticed, Impossible Creatures gives you the ability to send into battle units of your own creation-- magnificent (or hilarious, or both) mixtures of stock animals combined to most efficiently wreak havoc on your opponent. And that's obviously where the game shines.\n\nDon't get me wrong-- other parts of IC are phenomenal. For instance, the lush, beautifully painted maps, or the tactile, atmospheric soundtrack; all symptoms of a sumptuous, absorbing and vibrant style that has sadly gone out of fashion. This isn't the kind of game that strives to be edgy and dark; rather, it presents an experience you can actually enjoy, visually, audibly and emotionally. But the main reason you should buy Impossible Creatures is its depth of gameplay. The depth to this game is remarkable. That's why my people and I have been playing it for [commence italics] thirteen years [end italics]. Do you want to sneak into an enemy base and disrupt his resource gathering? Heck yes, son, chameleons crossed with cheetahs. Is there a mob of power-melee units trampling towards your coal mine? Mix some dragonflies with sharks and rain toothy hell on them from above. Perhaps you're the kind of strategist who prefers to turtle? Well, you're in luck! You can do that! Literally! With turtles! Or, hey, screw it-- if you prefer a more direct approach, why not just crush your opponents with a horde of elephants waving lobster claws? So with this in mind, there's obviously a huge scope for a variety of exotic and wonderful strategies-- and all of them can be successful, if you make good enough creatures and play with enough skill. If you have a playstyle, you can make it work. But this is all macro stuff.\n\nIt's the finer details that really make the game stand out. Even within overarching strategies there is an almost infinite scope for variation. For example, a fairly standard addition to any army is a level 3 melee unit-- a standard, versatile, mid-level grunt. But it's not like there's only one level 3 melee unit. Maybe you want something fast and poisonous, to inflict stings or bites and then retreat to a safe distance while the venom deals damage over time? Maybe you want something tough and powerful that forms herds and regenerates its health? Maybe your opponent crushed you last game with low-damage, high-health units en masse-- well, you can take a jaunt to the army builder and cook up something to deal with that; combine a wasp with a lioness and assassinate those meatshields into oblivion!\n\nThis variation on a fine, precise level is what turns Impossible Creatures into an art form. It's baffling just what people come up with-- and phenomenal to see it work for them. A friend of mine named Matt, for instance, once fielded a musk ox with the head of a condor. It didn't have wings, just a condor head sticking out the front of this beefy ox body. It was called "accept me as your king", and we all thought it was hilarious, because it was.\n\nThen it won a battle. Then it won another battle. Then Matt won the game.\n\nThe combination of musk ox defense and cheap, large, low-melee condor parts just happened to result in a strangely optimal creature-- it was cheap enough that Matt could spam it, but tough enough to hold its own. This is why you should play IC; just when you think you've seen it all, a new strategy comes along that completely switches the metagame.\n\nBut, naturally, even a game as diverse and clever as Impossible Creatures has gameplay issues. Mostly these relate to balance. Sadly, when Relic stopped supporting IC, it wasn't perfect (nor can it ever really be). As it stands, the base IC package includes the Insect Invasion mod-- Relic's last attempt at balancing the game (which adds a lot of very fun and interesting mechanics). II was released an incredibly long time ago-- long enough that players have been able to essentially solve the game, and find the truly optimal combination of creatures to use in any given situation. Suddenly, all the depth and variety in the game began to disappear. Which is why myself, Matt, Steve, Phil and Byam-- the original core modding team-- decided to make an add-on mod for IC called Tellurian.\n\nSince we started, we've added 20 stock creatures to the game. It's the only mod still being maintained, balanced, and patched (as a matter of fact, 2.03 is almost ready for release). It's free (not for profit!), it's fun, and it comes with a bunch of maps-- so if you ever get tired of moose lobsters and baboon sperm whales at level 5 (spoilers), visit this page:\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/tellurian/\n\n... And try out giant squids crossed with panthers. Or blue whales crossed with scorpions. Or pistol shrimp horses-- just get the mod, you'll love it, and every download is a little more incentive to keep the project alive.\n\nImpossible Creatures lives anew-- buy it, download it! And let's be honest, for its incredibly reasonable price, even if you hate the gameplay you can still get your money's worth making daffy combinations in the army builder (yes, I know, komodo dragon crossed with a skunk becomes a "komodo drunk", everybody finds that one eventually).","November 12, 2015","true","230.4"," 246 of 257 people (96%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","96","246","257","33","9"

I actually interrupted Fallout 4 day 2 to install and make sure this was working when I saw it.  I loved this game with an unholy passion and from my short testing it seems to be working fine on modern systems now.  I did have to right-click the Steam launcher and run as administrator to deal with a 'Steam has failed to initialize'  error when trying to launch the game, but once I rebooted steam as admin it's running absolutely smoothly.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it's a solid 8/10 RTS easily pushed to 10/10 by being one of the all time greats of Mad Science related gaming.  Runs very smoothly now, and graphics actually seem pretty decent considering when it was first released.  I'm pretty impressed and looking forward to playing it all over again.  Plus the expansion which I never played.\n\nI'll be going back to Fallout now, but simply owning this game again warms my mad science loving little heart more than I can possibly explain.","November 11, 2015","true","0.1"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","58","64","10","1"

All of its mods and expansion, reworked the game so it can run on Windows 7 and up, multiplayer, you name it. For those who haven't played this game before, long story short its a RTS game where you get to make your own units from mishmashing animal DNA you get as you play the game, be it a Horneceros, Crocorilla, or go full Wizard of Oz and make a bunch of Flying Baboons. Their strength and weakness depends on which body part of the parent animal you use on your monstrosity, you can make them amphibious, have opposeable thumb, winged but no-legs, spit poison, the sky is (literally) the limit in this game.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes unorthodox RTS or at least have played some of the older RTS titles like Rise of Nations, Generals, AoE and AoM. It might be hard to pick up the first time around, but after you get used to the unique gameplay and manage to find a good combination of limbs and body parts for your creature you will start to have a blast.\n\nPS : If you wish to play the tutorial and campaign, select IC in the Mod Selection option on the Title Menu screen.","November 14, 2015","true","17.7"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","45","46","4","0"

This of course leads to a lot of variety and options in your units, while you put together units to fit roles you choose and build the kind of units you want to see.\nIf you want a large amount of cheap swarming units, you can do that.\nIf you want a small amount of high quality units, that is possible too.\nMixed force with a few builing destroyers, some artillery, a front line and some ranged? Design them.\n\n\nThe rest is about as one would expect from an RTS. Gather resources, build (a small but functional) base, and use your army to control the map's important locations(Mainly more resource points), and then destroy your opponent.\nThere are only two resources, coal and energy, of which energy is renewable, but that is all the game needs. It doesn't overcomplicate things by asking for several different resources, that's not the focus of this game.\n\nThe focus is on the creatures, and allowing you creativity and customisation far past the standard for RTS games, with what is honestly an interesting campaign with humourous moments, a pretty decent storyline and good progression overall, it will not disappoint. Unless off course you focus purely on the graphics and other minor bad things to be found. As can be expected from a game of this age, the graphics are not exactly the best you can get today. But they are still functional and they do not look awful. They have aged fairly well.\nThe interface, and some parts of the design may be annoying as well - 'Your animals are under attack!' A very important thing to be aware of, and as such the game will tell you about it. About three or four times a minute, actually. When you've told them to attack the enemy base and are fully expecting them to be attacked. The camera is at times a little clumsy, and you may need to move it a bit to find an optimal viewing angle, but again, this isn't  a huge problem. Just something of the time it was released. And of course you might have some issue with defensive structures. Namely, before you get walls they may as well be made of paper and shoot pressurised farts for as much as they do to higher level creatures. Except the anti-air towers, of which three or more will single-handedly destroy entire airforces with only minimal damage to themselves.\nAlso, very minor, but annoying still - It crashes when I exit the game.\n\nI am getting close to 10 hours on this game, and I can't say I regret a single one of them. It is a great game for RTS fans, and a good game for those new to the genre as well. All of the good being good, and most of the bad being small stuff lands this one firmly in the recommend catagory.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MayaBurd/recommended/324680/","MayaBurd","Burdmom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MayaBurd/","69 products in account","In December of '02, while this game was being released in the States, as an Australasian I could only hear about the game which wasn't going to be released in Aussie and NZ until February '03. So, in December '02 I got in touch with ♥♥♥♥ Smith and managed to reserve a copy. My first pre order.\n\nAESTHETICWhen the game was released, we had to buy a new PC to run it because not only was it one of the very first games able to run on DX9, it required it to run smoothly and look gorgeous. And when I say gorgeous, I'm not kidding. The game still holds up its art style today and looks better than some new Steam releases out there. Inject ENBSeries (you're best with San Andreas 0.73) into this and if you're up to it see if you can't enhance the textures with Photoshop and good lord in heaven is it beautiful. The soundtrack in this helps to bring the mood of the game out and I could easily listen to it outside of playing the game. The in-game sound effects are not only fitting tothe game's theme but each provide absolute clarity to the function or state of a unit or structure, while the general foley heightens immersion. To top it off, the noir inspired cutscenes and voice acting are intentionally cheesy, to the point where the initially irritating "The critters are under attack!" soundbite becomes endearing. It's a very pretty game whose visual and aural design has stood the test of time.\n\nGAMEPLAYGameplay itself is also surprisingly well maintained: There was and still is almost no sign of glitching, and anything that does occur is insignificant or caused by third party mods. I think I even enjoyed one glitch that occurs so much that I'd rather a player discover it for themselves: combining some creatures results in their running animation speed up to like ten times the original. Instead of the standard of using an intricate resource system and combining it with a simplistic preset army, there are only two (easily interchangable) resources and the way a player uses them is defined by how their army is not only produced but initially built: there are previously made creatures from some of the example armies and campaign character armies but the best way to have fun with this game is dive head first into its main feature: the creation of a unit by combining two animals and choosing its specialisation by selecting which physical segment of each creature the resulting amalgam receives. Each animal has a set of internal stats, abilities and physical attacks associated with each segment. A player must be cautious: they must balance cost with offensive capability, special abilities and various key points. The game even has an army analyser to help players create units that will tough it out, hopefully to victory. One of the game's protags says it best: balance is the key to versatility, and versatility will allow you to be prepared for anything. Sadly, I do have to say that Relic did a very poor job with balancing, or at least overlooked the side effects that combination would have on balance. In an RTS game, it's possibly one of the worst things to be caught off guard by. Luckily, most mods fix this issue with ease.\n\nCUSTOMISATIONGood lord. It's a shame that the game's source code was never released (hint hint)because it made modding particularly frustrating, especially when it caused modders to be forced to retexture and reshape the wolf unit in Blender so not to have too few or too many polygons, disallowed the ability to customise map flags, made creating campaigns particularly tiresome, and as a result putting a chokehold on the limits of the modding scene. In spite of this, the modding community have really outdone themselves and in spirit of the original dev team's demonstartion of pushing the framework beyond what was expected delivered one of the greatest and fun showcase of mods out there: Creature Chaos, Shadow, Tellurian, hell, even Invasion Of The Killer Ants smooth out a number of areas where gameplay is lacking. I personally feel that the game's small but hardcore fanbase would not have survived as long as it has without people like Revan, Doggiedoodle, Delirium, Puglin, and so many more incredibly dedicated players behind the game, pushing it to its limits. I for one would greatly enjoy seeing Workshop integration to see what fresh ideas a wider audience can bring to the table.\n\nSUMMARYThis game has stood the test of time. And for good reasons. I feel that had it not been for some unfortunate circumstances, it would be as recognised and celebrated as Age of Empires, Rise of Nations or Red Alert. It was and still is worth the hundred bucks I paid for it almost thirteen years ago. I look forward to seeing it renewed by a fresh community, and wish for it to regrow above and beyond what it's ever been, because this game is simply one of the best Real Time Strategies available, and personally one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nFINAL RATING: 8.5/10","December 3, 2015","true","14.8"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","3"

Today it is still one of my most favorite RTS games. What makes this one so much fun? Building your own custom units using animals. It's simple in base building but the real strategy is building the perfect units and being able to face any situation by land, sea, or air. The campaign may not be the most amazing thing ever but it adds an extra level in the army building. You actually have to find animals in the game and get DNA to unlock new animals. Not to mention seeing different unit sto give you ideas on how to build yours.

Up to 9 different animal hybrids per 'army' which you then can use in battle against AI or people acorss various maps. Also the campaign acts as the tutorial whilst still providing a decent enough story but the main attraction is creating your own army via the many creatures on offer (51 in original game, about 100 including expansions/mods) and battling friends or strangers against their unique animal army.

From the cheetahs with lobster claws to the chimpanzees with lobster claws, everything I remember about lobster claws is there. In fact, it includes many animals I didn't realize had no lobster claws. I know some of my childhood friends (who had no lobster claws themselves) traded rumors about hammerhead sharks without lobster claws, but all the hammerheads I saw from my beach villa had lobster claws. The musk oxen grazing along the beach didn't have lobster claws, thankfully -- otherwise we'd have needed to reinforce all our homes with lobster claws cast in gold. Musk oxen were always charging buildings, but they didn't cause much harm because they didn't have lobster claws, which greatly increase the damage inflicted on buildings. Getting back to hammerhead sharks, I learned that they sometimes possess primate forelimbs (in lieu of lobster claws), and they can hurl small rocks a considerable distance. Despite their excellent vision radius, the giraffes with lobster claws were never able to throw things very well because lobster claws are not suited to ballistic activity. Speaking of giraffes, if you ever come across one with a lupine torso, don't bother running. It's got crazy endurance and will be in tip-top shape when you're panting and wheezing and collapsed on the ground. Even though it has no lobster claws, the giraffe can easily stomp you with its hooves or maul you with its non-lobster claws. Be very careful around giraffes, their appetite for the flesh of creatures without lobster claws is insatiable. Unless you have lobster claws yourself, then you're probably safe.\n\nIn short, all my lobster claw nostalgia is satisfied with this lobster claw simulator.\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I don't have lobster claws.","November 12, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","11","12","12","0"

The AI never actually changes; only resources, triggers, and very simple custom scripts for certain missions.\n>Multiplayer (IC Online) - 8/10\nPlaying against thinking opponents is certainly satisfying in Impossible Creatures. Unfortunately, due to extreme balance issues, game design oversights, and a complete lack of any and all forms of community management or organization, online gameplay often leaves me feeling dissatisfied and uninvolved, as though I could have better spent my time in a different, more recently-designed game. Still, the concept of Impossible Creatures' player-designed units cannot be found anywhere else, and presents an interesting dynamic in multiplayer scenarios. If more people used the Tellurian mod, I would have rated this higher.\n\nInterface - 9/10\nThe user interface in Impossible Creatures offers the player a lot of control over their units and their resources. The only negatives I would say are the lack of a chat log in Multiplayer matches and the pitiful default camera max distance.\n\nCommunity - 5/10\nSome members of the community are distinctly friendly, outgoing, and helpful. Others will troll you from day one, and each bit of advice they give you is intended to do you genuine harm for their own amusement. There is no community management system in place. There are no clans, no vote kicks, no bans. There is total anonymity and many people abuse it. There is toxicity, and integration into the game's unique community requires a lot of resolve and tolerance, because honestly, very few people actually want you to be here. They'd be totally happy if you weren't, and they will treat you like extra entertainment at your own expense. The people who don't will never stand up for you. It feels a lot like being in high school. You either fit in with their definition of "perfectly acceptable" or they will treat you like you are sub-human, even going to the point of talking about you in the third person in your presence. There's a distinct lack of maturity and mutual respect.\n\nI've rated this higher than my words would suggest because most of the experiences described above are the experience I've had with the Tellurian community, before the game was released on Steam. Though they are a large part of the game's community, they are not all of it, and experiences vary with each person. Yours may be better than mine, and the community may even improve since the game has been re-released. Here's to hoping.\n\nGraphics - 7/10\nThey're good for their time, and acceptable today.\n\n\n\nOther Notes\nModding Tools\nThey're helpful, diverse, and you can do a lot with them, but they're seriously broken. The interface editor is missing a critical file and cannot function. The others have a tendancy to bug out or crash. Most of your modding will be done using third-party softwares (notepad, .dll editors, etc.). The mission editor is adequate and quite functional, though, and can be used to create very professional-feeling maps with relative ease.\n\nTellurian Mod\nEveryone should be using it. End of story tbh\n\n\nOverall, Impossible Creatures is a very unique game with some interesting systems and players. It's fun and deep, and worth trying.","November 22, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The ability to customize your units adds another level of strategy to the game. Do you want a wolf with the head of a chameleon? Done. Great white and a tiger? Easy. Flying monkeys? Why not?\nThe campaign is also enjoyable, and gradually unlocking creatures forces the player to experiment with their army, which in my opinion is a good thing.\nOf course, the game is not without fault. 9 creatures can be a bit limiting if you want an army that is strong at all stages of the game. Pathing can be a little buggy, and can (and WILL) mess up your creatures' positions (ranged units in front, melee in back, that kind of thing).\nOverall, though, I give this game a solid 9/10.

Also, there are tons of different maps to choose from, supporting endless amounts of player strategies and gamestyles. And if you aren't satesfied with the maps available, you can always hop on the game's "Mission Editor" and create a map on your terms. The only real limiting factor of this game is the mind itself.

Create a wide variety of unit types like combining an archer fish and an owl to create a flying bomber, an electric eel with a wolf to create a ranged unit, a wooly mammoth and a sperm whale to create a real juggernaut with a sonic attack.","November 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Not just saying that due to the nostalgia value of remembering when I was a wee laddy, peeking over my dad's desk watching him play this on his computer. No, unlike many other memories of my childhood, this game withstood the test of time and is actually good. What makes it so good? It's main pull, gimmick, and attraction: combining creatures to make specific units with various abilities.\n\nThe pull of this game is its freeform army builder. The builder allows you to construct 9 units by mix-and-matching various body parts and pieces from two different animals to create a whole new unit. It's an incredible simple system that actually has quite a lot of meaning and strategy built in. Almost every part you swap; torso, head, front legs, back legs, etc, has some sort of statistical affect or grants a new ability. Simply changing one part can change the creature's role in a drastic way. And the best part? That creature's role is entirely up to you. You can make an army suited to your turtling playstyle. Or an army filled with fast, aggressive creatures designed for hit and run tactics. It's completely up to you.\n\nThe level of strategy in this game is deceptively deep. While on the outside someone might assume the game is fairly cut and dry; make creatures and throw 'em at each other, Impossible Creatures will surprise you with a hidden level of strategy. Where it differs from most RTS games is not only do you not know what your enemy might be doing, you dont even have a clue what his units even are. Is he going to be using Stealth? Maybe burrowing? Does he have amphibious units? Are his creatures mainly melee? Or are they ranged? You may have built an army of massive powerhouses only to find that you forgot to give any of them Immunity. And sure enough, here comes your enemy with an army chock-full of poisonous beasties.\n\nThe campaign? It's not terrible, and I liked it, but some may not share the same sentiment. Impossible Creatures in general has a very diesel/steampunk feel to it which I absolutely adored and believe contributed to the game's unique success in a way. The game makes up for it with an engaging army builder that you can spend literal hours in making your army juuuuuust right, and a skirmish mode which you can face down bots and the like to practice your skills and test your army. With the Steam Version, Multiplayer is back and alive and from the few times I've been on, it seems to have a decent playerbase. Despite being made in the early 2000's, the game still looks very good.\n\nAll in all, for $10, it's completely worth it. Grab it, play it, have some fun with it.","November 17, 2015","true","19.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Imagine a world in which you're in control of combing the DNA of animals perfectly. You're able to reproduce the animal kingdom the way you see fit. The way you combine creatures give them powerful attributes, which could be used for good or evil.\n\nKeep in mind, this game was created many years ago. I truly believe this game had the potential to reach League of Legends and DOTA 2s caliber. It was an original RTS with online gameplay which players enjoyed tremendously. There are two major reasons the original release of this game failed.\n\n1.) The developer and published had a legal dispute over another situation. They never worked with each other again, although Impossible Creatures 2 was in development phase. Due to their falling out, everything about IC was put on hold. It was no longer updated nor maintained. Eventually the online server was taken down. The community had some amazing people in it. Many people worked together to keep the game alive. There are some people who developed amazing mods for the game. The mods balanced out the game, created new content, and kept people playing through Hamachi.\n\n2.) The game had limited advertising on release. They didn’t advertise this game nearly enough. It had thousands of players to begin with, but it slowly died off without people being aware of its existence.\n\nIf you’re looking for an incredibly fun multiplayer RTS game, with unlimited possibility for strategic gameplay and skill. Look no further. This game will test your mind with rough competition online.\n\nThese ratings are based on steam release, not the original release.\n\nBalance: 5 (Fixed with the proper mods)\nGraphics: 5\nMusic: 4\nCinematics: 7\nStory: 7\nContent: 5\nControls: 9\nGameplay: 10\n\nOverall: 6.5","November 22, 2015","true","180.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You have to collect DNA of animals that are roaming around and then you can create creatures by combining the DNA into a unique new creature.\n\nThe game comes with a big campaign, custom Maps for Single Player (against AI) or Online Multiplayer, Map Editor (waiting for Steam Workshop integration to share Maps :)) and Mod Functionality.\n\nThe graphics might look a bit outdated, but the price for this old game is very good as it brings a very unique experience in RTS.","November 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The soundtrack is mostly atmospheric but adds so much to the charm of the game.\n\nIt's fairly standard RTS fare but for the ability to create your own armies - you may take parts from two of the many stock animals to create a combined creature, and then take nine of these combined creatures into any game you play. The range of strategies is far more impressive than I think the developers could ever have hoped for, with creatures of various sizes, stats and abilities available to each player.\n\nThe only downsides I found with the original game were with the balance - some creatures are inherently better when combined with certain stock animals, thus making others effectively redundant but for their novelty value. In the past few years this has been addressed by player-made mods such as Tellurian, which also adds a range of new creatures to play with. It's nice to see that these mods are still compatible with the Steam edition.\n\nAll in all, I reccommend this :D","November 12, 2015","true","16.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I too, have clocked in over 1000 hours prior to the steam release.\n\nLet me tell you about this amazing game, Impossible Creatures.\n\nCampaign\nFairly intriguing story for an old RTS\nGood progression, although difficulty ramps up fairly quickly for newbies\nMemorable characters\nDecent length, depends on player skill\nNo difficulty slider however\nCreature Combining\n\nI've been playing this game for a long, long time, and I still find new interesting combinations. The standard game has 50 stock animals, and with Insect Invasion, 10 bonus animals and the Tellurian mod this brings it up to about 95 creatures you can combine. And this isn't just straight up hybrids, oh no - you can choose exactly which body parts are from which animal. That's a lot of possible combinations.\n\nSome things to note about this style of RTS and unit creation\n\nHoly f*cking variety! You can make very varied armies (of 9 combined creatures) which are still viable in multiplayer\nMeta isn't as set in stone, there's counters for pretty much everything, naturally.\nCreatures have special abilities - such as electric burst with the eel, or camouflage with the chameleon.\nTotally messed up and funny combinations can sometimes be pretty good\nYou can name your own creatures\nKomodo Dragon + Skunk = Komodo Drunk :)\n\nMultiplayer\n\nInevitably, the thing that'll keep you coming back is the multiplayer. Now, back when this was my childhood, I mainly stuck to Player vs Computer, but having played a fair bit of multiplayer now I can tell you it's really damn fun.\n\nUp to 6 players, free for all, teams or various game modes\nAI isn't half bad for an old game\nAbsolutely insane battles with 6 players on large maps\nGames may range from 30 minutes - 4 hours (cough, Bikini Atoll, cough)\nCustom maps, mods (get Tellurian!) = Massive replayability\nQuite fast paced, something of a skill ramp but not crazy like Starcraft. Casuals will still have fun games with other casuals.\n\nRTS Elements\nIt's still your standard RTS fair, except making your own units is the big awesome part of it.\n\nTwo resources: Coal and Electricity. Getting a steady supply and managing resources is key.\nExpand with Workshops to other parts of the map, upgrade worker henchmen with Research Clinic and improve your creatures' stats with the Genetic Amplifier\nHigher level creatures (Levels range from I -> V) require research at your Lab (home base)\nUnits may be land, water, amphibious or flyers\nCreature combinations will generally be either Melee or Range, but special abilities mix it up a bit\nYou want to research up to higher level creatures ASAP, and have your army balanced so you can ward off rushes at earlier levels\nDefensive structures: Soundbeam towers for land creatures and Anti-Air towers for flyers\nGyrocopter!\nTl;Dr: Awesome game, RTS lovers or even casuals will have a good time.

I would happily pay triple the asking price, and it only gets better with mods, from the packaged in Insect Invasion and the community favourite Tellurian.\n\nI highly recommend this game, even after all of these years I still find myself wanting to play it and everytime I come back it  feels utterly refreshing. In my books, it's an easy 10/10 save for maybe except the graphics, but even those have their own little place, seeming somehow fitting to the game and it's atmosphere. PLUS the developers have stated they may do a sequel if it sells well enough...now c'mon who doesn't want a sequel to this game? I can only imagine the possibilities, and hopefully you do to.\n\nOverall, buy this game if not just for it's pure greatness, if not for the nostalgia, if not for the amazing premise, if not for the chance at a sequel, do it for yourself and do it to experience one of the (somewhat) forgotten gems in gaming history.","November 17, 2015","true","65.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's simple and a little dated, but still an incredibly enjoyable experience nonetheless. The Steam version also includes the Bonus Animals expansion and Insect Invasion pack right off the bat, bringing the total amount of creatures to warp into chimeras from 50 to 75, halfway doubling the amount. Multiplayer is a bit tricky nowadays and it's a shame Relic hasn't considered giving IC a sequel after all these years.

It may look like bad graphics but you have to give it credit for being an early 2002 game. I have played a good 200 hours of this game due to the fact that I have had it since I was nine- probably even more hours. I love the diversity that this game has and that fact that it is a noob friendly RTS game for all you non gamers out there. It also can become pretty challenging if skirmishing against hard or expert bots(they have all sorts of map hacks and are good at micromanagement). I like that fact that you can create your own armies to match the style in which you play. I also love the 15 mission campaign that comes with it. Really fun and you can learn a lot by playing it. It is a decent story  line. My most favorite part of the game, however, is the Mission Editor. You can make your own maps and missions. When I was younger I made many maps and had fun with the diversity. It is not too hard to use just make sure you make your scenarios folder in data then make an MP folder in scenarios and your set.The other good part is that the new steam version fixed the multiplayer. It is fun and easy to use so I totally recommend that you invite your freinds to play this game as well.","January 10","true","92.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Unlike every other RTS I've ever played, this one might have the highest replayability possible, because all the units are customized.  So rather than focusing on certain canned units like other RTS, it's hard to know if the units you've come up with are going to counter whatever someone else might throw at you.\n\nThe RTS has limited resources per map - so only so much coal will be available, although electricity can be converted into coal too.\n\nThe voice acting is fun and the learning curve keeps me coming back.  The UI is dated.  For example the ESC key is ignored and you have to hit the "menu" button instead.  I've only played a few hours and so far it's been worth the sale price of $2.99 for the game.

To this day it remains the only RTS I have ever enjoyed.\n\nImpossible Creatures has pre-battle strategy where you make your own army out of combined creatures. Maybe you'll fuse a sperm whale with an anteater to create a humongous blubber-lickinglicking "Sperm Ea... hmm Perhaps you combine a Black Widow spider with a Mountain Lion to create a Black Coug... the point is, all creatures have their strengths and weaknesses, defined by their health, defense, speed (land, sea &/or air), sight, size, coal/electricity cost, tier level and body part-specific abilities. The possibilities are endless. You could create a hideous tier 1 abomination only costing 50 coal, but it ain't exactly gonna be good. Instead, you could combine an anaconda with a dragonfly to make a giant flying tier 5 hugger of death with insane strength and bonuses, but it ain't exactly gonna be cheap.\n\nIn battle, you gather resources, build buildings to spawn your lovingly made creatures, construct defensive structures, buff structures, expensively upgrade your tier level instead of building defense and get rushed by better players etc. trying to murder death kill your opponent(s). Pretty standard stuff. But fun.\n\nThe campaign is hilariously over-the-top cheesy 40s-50s steampunk mad science adventure over 15-ish missions which go from easy to insanely hard really. really fast. Mostly because you don't have access to all your creatures, but have to gather them across all levels.\n\nThis game comes with the Insect Invasion expansion, which adds creatures with more niche and micro-management heavy abilities, so it's all good.\n\nSounds like a plan. I'm on it.","November 18, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Sorry if your a graphic freak, certain people i know are but you will miss out if you like startegy games and dont try it becuase you make whatever you want in this game basically in terms of units.... and there is no build limit except for on a few structures\n\nPros\n- mass aray of units that you yourself create.\n- mutiplayer is back up.\n- comes with the dlcs.\n- storyline is dated but still solid.\n- (to me this is a good thing) there is no massivly op weapon or anything of the sorts and the creatures you make that are amazing cost quite a lot which balances it out.\n- you do not need a good computer to play this on.\n\nCons\n- graphics if you care about that\n- can still bug out every now and then\n- no workshop yet :P\n\n\n\nThis is the game i love and used to play a long time ago and i still find enjoyment in it.. so i would rate this game 8.5/10\nIf they contiune this game and if they made another i will be on board the whole way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 12","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to have the disc but later versions of Windows rendered it unplayable, very happy it's now available for newer computers. There are two main types of gameplay, the story mode and the vs. Computer mode. The story mode involves finding creatures, taking there DNA and merging it with others to create the ultimate creatures to defeat the bad guys, all while experiencing an amazing story. The vs. Computer mode is a one-off battle against a computer, creatures are not created in the verses game itself but instead you load them from a pre-created army or a custom army you've made in the army builder, the army builder is where you can create armies of nine creatures to use in your verses game, you can either load creatures you've made before into your new army or make them from scratch!

This game always made me think about creating a new monster from two seperate creatures, Eagle and Bear? Why not! Ant and Orca? Go ahead! Impossible Creatures came out a LONG time ago, well not that long. 2003 to be Precise, and the graphics show as well. However the gameplay is my main concern here. Being able to create creatures by combining their positive adaptations within life, and ruleing out their cons, is fun; but commanding them to attack one another as if they were units of war, is a whole-nother story. Creatures can be created in the creature chamber and assigned to 'Armies' for use within battle. The Story is good, and the Characters have a good, vivid personality. Not into campaign? Well then Skirmish or Online (if its even still avaliable) are for you! Picking a map to fight on, send creations after anothers artocitys. It is truely fun, and the information given about each individual animal is HUGE, great for writing reports about. If you're looking for something to either, Play for the Creation, or for the Challenge, Impossible Creatures is definitly the Retro way to look.","April 4","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I was a child, my uncle told me, "You're a failure." He then put me to bed. I called him a queer. He slapped me. As I cried myself to sleep. I heard a rattling sound coming from the window. I looked up. It was the majestic shark eagle. I had only heard legends. I opened the window for him. He came inside my room. And then proceeded to tear me to shreds. It hurt, but I loved it.

I love IC but this version of it is bad.\n\nHaving played for almost two hours, I discovered several glitches.  The game crashed once (I never had it crash while playing the disc version for thousands of hours), the creature pictures are often completely black (which makes it difficult to see which unit you are building), and finally in the most recent mission the endgame trigger did not occur when it was supposed to.  I would have had to play the mission again and pray that it triggered.  All of this happened in not even two hours played and I expect there will be more glitches if I continue.  I am going to ask for a refund for the game.  Like I said, I've played this game endlessly and I know how it should be running.  This is a sloppy port to Steam and I will not support a developer who does this.\n\nI will keep looking for updates and will change my review if the developer fixes these issues.\n\nEDIT:  Developer seems to be aware of issues and is updating the game.  Most recent update was March 30, just a day ago.  One of the improvements is "reduce the chance of glitch where game does not end after completing objectives."  Reduce?  How about fix?  Or how about not putting a game on Steam without having ironed out the bugs, especially if they are significant?","March 29","false","1.8"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","10","3","2"

It's basically a novelty, but one I wish someone would repeat and do better.\n\nSo let's talk about that uniqueness briefly:\n\nYou can combine TWO monsters. The size of the creature will be the size of the larger one. This dumbs down the creature building a lot, although some would argue that it adds complexity since you have to pay attention to sizes. The result is that I keep wanting to combine small creatures since they're cool (tiger racoon? skunk chameleon?), but because they're tiny, their stats suck.\nSO I end up making a couple "throw-away" lower tier creatures for defense, and focus on the huge tier-5 monsters, then I mass produce those. With the right combinations, the high stats outweigh almost any strategy. Yes, some combinations COULD be countered, but the AI certainly won't do it.\n\nIf someone wants to kick starter something based on this, that might be worth money. Or if you want to see the novelty that no one else has done semi-well (that I know of), then go ahead and buy this and play it for a day. Otherwise, I do not recommend.","February 10","false","2.4"," 15 of 54 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","15","54","2","3"

I am a big fan of this game. I love animals. I have been playing for THOUSANDS of times and I still have original CDs at my home lol.\n\nMy first reaction when my friend was give me a link, MY MIND IS BLOWN!! Seriously, if I remember someone ask Relic Entertainment to put Impossible Creatures on Steam, that was really long time ago, now finally my dream is become true!!\n\n\nAbout this game that you need to create or own creatures and fights your enemy base, yes I'd say its a "Strategy" game.\nCustom army is the best part of this game! You can choose two animals and modfied its body parts whatever you like and make them looks like its your pet lol.\nThere's many of ways you can try out many different animals to combine it! That is your own imagination. You don't like some certain animals? Make it wrose! Its your world.\nStory mode is great, trust me, I never ever finish on that part lol. So I like to play custom game more, even I am alone.\n\n\nThere is a packages come out for Steam Edition, update patchs, Insect Invasion Expansion, Level Editor, and SDK (Source Development Kit) for create a new mod even you can make a new animals, so far. I don't really use it much since I just met the modding community, but I was used to playing with someone's mods. (Example Creature Chaos Mod)\n\nI wish if there is a next sequel or even a DLC, tho.\n\nI'd recommend for this game if you love this game since your childhood!","November 12, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was part of my teenage years. So much scope for experimenting, exploration and tactical variety. This is one of those 'Thank you Steam' moments. I tried to get a copy of this a couple of years ago and you wouldn't believe how difficult/expensive second-hand copies are to get hold of.\n\nConcept: 10 - You can splice animals together to make new, deadlier, cooler animals. Then you make them fight others. It's genius. There are a ridiculous number of combinations to try out, and some are just amazing. Need a creature to scout for you? Stick a giraffe's head and neck on a cheetah. Tortoise/electric eel combo? Live tesla tank.\n\nGraphics: 7 - Obviously they've dated but they're perfectly acceptable.\n\nMusic: 8 - Different music for each level/environment, creates a nice atmosphere.\n\nStory: 6 - It's ok, not great, but you'll be too busy splicing a crocodile head ontp a cheetah to care.\n\nGameplay: 9 - All the controls makes sense. It's a classic RTS layout. I never lose track of where my creatures are or what's going on in my base. No complaints\n\nMultiplayer: 9 - Because of the incredible tactical flexibility in the game, you never know what kind of opponent you're up against. It's shark-dog eat shark-dog out there. Just when you think you're prepared for the enemy's frontal assault - BAM! Whale-Lobsters.\n\nFinal Score: 9\n\nIf you like RTS, buy it.\n\nIf you've played it before, get ready for a very satisfying nostalgia hit.","November 15, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How can I put this...  Ah, heres and example.  Image this scenario:  You building up your base, having a nice and quiet time.  "By the time I'm done researching the final tech level, nothing can stop me!" you say, and you begin setting the creature creator into overdrive.  Suddenly, out of the corner of your eye, you see a flock of lobster-eagles swooping down to kill your workers, who are then charged by a group of elephants with dragonfly wings.  Before you can react, you realize that the lab is being attacked by panther-chameleons and walrus-komodo dragons!  You try and get your army to deal with the threat, but the units you've already build have been demolished by musk ox-sperm whales and chimpanzee-zebras!\n\nI'll let you imagine the rest.  In short, what I'm trying to say is that this game can be enjoyed even if all your doing is messing around in the creature creator, or your making both you and your friend (enemy) laugh your rears off due to the absurdity of both your armies.  So yeah, get this game even if you don't want to strategize, and just want to make your own ridiculous creatures.","January 1","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
