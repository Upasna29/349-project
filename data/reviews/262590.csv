"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phreakindee/recommended/262590/","phreakindee","phreakindee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phreakindee/","1263 products in account","The follow-up to Chip's Challenge for the Atari Lynx and Windows 3.1. You can tell it was optimized for things like iOS and Android, but this is still a worthwhile follow-up to the original tile-based puzzler.\n\nI must mention: The menus, the characters, and the levels elements are like an oversized dollop of cottage cheese: big and chunky. Plus the navigation of menus is just odd, where you use the mouse like you would a finger on a touchscreen. But PC optimization issues aside, it's your job to solve the puzzles as Woop. And yeah, he's no Chip, but the little bugger does have charm, I'll give him that.\n\nAs for the gameplay, well, it's Chip's Challenge 2.0, and that's precisely why I threw my money at the screen in the first place. If you're not familiar with that game, it's a tile-based Sokoban-like game where you have an area filled with locked doors and hazards, and it’s your goal to collect the required items before exiting the level. For the most part, it's the same game with new puzzles and a new look. Like, you're not collecting chips here, but little glowing blue things, and the enemies look totally different. But a lot of the puzzle elements are the same, like water, fire, ice, moving floors, etc. And you still have the same types of power-ups that let you circumvent these hazards where appropriate. There are five sets of levels to complete with 25 levels each, but the first selection more or less follows the rules of the original game. When you move beyond those, the game really starts to open up into its own thing, with a slew of new enemies, hazards, and puzzle components. It never has to give you a dumb tutorial either, since the rules of upcoming levels are clearly laid out for you with an easier level earlier on. But don't let the first set of levels fool you, this game can be just as brutal as its predecessor.\n\nWell sort of. It's a bit easier as well, with the ability to take back any number of moves at any time. This means you don't necessarily have to restart the entire level if you screw up, so no bummers here. Time keeps ticking while you do this, but it's far less rage-inducing to make a stupid mistake now. It even asks you if you want to skip a level if you suck to the point of shaming your ancestors. The levels are also far smaller than many of those in Chip's Challenge, and I assume this is because of the time and screen size constraints of the mobile version. And when you finish off or rage quit the main game, there's a fully-featured, easy-to-use level editor. You can upload your own or download other people's creations right from within the game. Oh and you can apparently get hats, because freaking hats man, why developers haven't shoehorned them into every game already is beyond me.\n\nPersonally, I find Chuck's Challenge to be a perfectly adequate successor to Chip's Challenge. It's more of the same kind of logical puzzle-solving with only a few concessions made for mobile platforms and slightly more forgiving gameplay. But even with a few iffy changes, if you enjoyed the original game or just enjoy these types of logic games, I'd give this one a look.","February 23, 2014","true","0.9"," 86 of 93 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","86","93","0","0"

But after an incredible show of dedication from the developers in addressing and fixing (nearly) every one of my complaints in the "massive invisible" patch, I'm finally giving the game a thumbs-up. Very impressive, guys! Previously, I felt that this game might have perhaps gotten more attention and understanding as an "early access" title, but now it has earned its status as a finished product, one which can be built upon. I'm confident that the small number of remaining issues left will be addressed, and even if not, they do not detract too much from the game's quality.\n\nThe puzzle design of Chuck's Challenge can only be described as some of the best you will see in any puzzle game, and that's no surprise because the game and most of its levels come from the brilliant mind of Chuck Sommerville, the man behind Chip's Challenge. While the puzzles are quite a bit smaller in comparison to Chip's Challenge, they are so deceptively simple that sometimes they blow the mind. You could spend a half-hour tinkering with a stage that's so small and simple and has such few moving parts, and in the end you can only blame yourself for not seeing that one obvious answer that was hanging in front of your nose the whole time. And that's one of the highest levels of praise I can offer to any puzzle game.\n\nThe game has some great anti-frustration features, namely the ability to undo any move at any time, and even to replay previous solutions (a brand new feature from the old versions)!! The undo functionality was previously horribly broken and allowed for bad solutions, but the "massive invisible" update has rewritten it from scratch seems to have made it quite bulletproof. Just be warned, if you're aiming for speed medals and records, the rewind feature won't help you much because it adds +5 seconds to your time whenever it is used, but it's great if you're trying to solve a puzzle for the first time and accidentally push a block into a corner or something.\n\nThe GUI has been criticized for being designed with touchscreens primarily in mind, but enough improvements and concessions have been made for mouse-and-keyboard users that it's not so much of a problem anymore.\n\nOh, and let's not forget to mention the level editor. Though the interface is slightly quirky, it's a cinch to hop into the editor and prototype a level idea, tinker with it, then upload it for the world to see into an ever-expanding database of user-designed levels, complete with individual leaderboards. The game has even implemented a new feature letting you click on a specially-formatted URL which will launch Chuck's Challenge and load a custom level automatically. Though it could stand to have a few more features (functionality for level packs, or some way of knowing which custom levels you've beaten), an eternal supply of user-generated content is the heart and soul of a game like this, and it doesn't disappoint.\n\nSome small quirks and bugs still exist, but they are absolutely benign compared to what they were before, and no longer detract from the core of the experience: the bliss of solving awesome puzzles. Overall, recommended for all fans of Chip's Challenge, as well as any newcomer or veteran to the block-pushing puzzle genre.\n\nHere's my upvote, developers. You've earned it.","April 24, 2014","true","60.8"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/recommended/262590/","K3W3L","K3W3L","http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/","2306 products in account","Huge nostalgic trip for me. When I was young (can't remember when, when I was 8 years old or so I guess?), I used to play this game called Chip's Challenge. It was a timed puzzle game with Sokoban elements. I never quite got to finish it as the levels grew too difficult for me near the end, but I remembered it fondly as one of the most favourite games I used to play. Hell, I remember being incredibly jubilant when my father helped me to beat Blobnet. Yeah, that infamous level with all the blobs.\n\nFast-forward to 2013/2014 and a talented team of programmers was assembled (may not be an accurate depiction of events) by Chuck Sommerville, the original Chip's Challenge creator, to work on the spiritual sequel. With the original sequel being put in stasis for years due to a publishing issue, we have this game in its place, at least until Chip's Challenge 2 finally got released.\n\nWith Chuck being the brains behind some of the puzzles (and he even appears as himself in the early game plot!), there is an overwhelming sense of familiarity immediately (for those who've played Chips). The predominant element in Chuck's Challenge, as is the case with Chip's Challenge, are Sokoban puzzles where you have to push blocks into specific positions. There are a few other nice puzzles based upon the mechanics with which the creatures move.\n\nMost of the game elements remain, just re-skinned for generation Y gamers - for example, the Teeth creature in Chip's Challenge that chases you around is now known as Snappy in Chuck's Challenge (and whose primary feature is still his teeth). There are a few new game elements as well - one that blows gas that makes you fail the level if you go within range, for starters. Also, coloured blocks with coloured pressure plates - you have to push all the correct coloured blocks onto the plates to open the gate. In terms of variety, it's a huge step-up from Chip's Challenge where you only had one type of block.\n\nWith the 16/10/14 Flummery Update, the game now boasts 150 main levels - roughly the same as the original Chip's Challenge had. The difficulty was kind of inconsistent - as usual, easy levels at the start, following that you get levels that vary between frustratingly hard and medium-ish difficulty. Thankfully, (and this is one of the advantages that Chuck has over Chip, I feel) the game allows you to rewind the puzzle, at the cost of adding 5 seconds to your time. Why is adding time a "cost", you ask? Well, in Chip, (most) levels were timed so you had to do it quickly. Here, times only serve as an indicator as to how well you compare with the rest of the world. There are medals now awarded for being as fast as possible, great for speedrunners. (Luckily for now, none of the achievements are medal-related.)\n\nFor the first time, Chuck's Challenge has an in-built level editor. You can create your own levels for others to play, and the Flummery update introduced support for the Steam Workshop. This is a far cry from Chip's Challenge where dedicated players made maps using third party software. Still, there's no function for making level packs, but at least making levels is now a lot more easier.\n\nDespite the nostalgic feels, this game isn't quite perfect. The game has oversized big buttons in the menu, giving it the feel of a mobile port. It's one of the better ones there, but scrolling the menu proved a bit unwieldy. Just a minor nitpick, though. A slightly more major nitpick (to me, at least - maybe there's someone out there who likes it) is the cheesy story behind how Chuck created levels for Woop (the alien that you control). The sound effects when the characters speak are cringe-inducing, and the story seems rather pointless. Thankfully it only lasts for the first few level packs.\n\nStill, this is mostly an improvement over Chip's Challenge in terms of almost everything. There's even a weekly puzzle to complete if you get bored. Oh and hats. Oh yes. Hats. I do miss Chip, he had this charisma about him. But Woop does have his own charm about him, and I gradually grew to like him, and causing him to die in all sorts of manners, and dressing him up in various hats...you get the point.\n\nWhen to buy: It took quite a while but the game and DLC finally got bundled - if you're short on cash, trade for the keys. This is however one game I'd recommend buying at full price if money is no object. :)\n\n9.0/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them?

These levels are probably the hardest (some of them I have no clue how it could be possible to solve them)\n- Ones which require your timing : it is all about going at the right pace, at the right moment (they can be tricky but not actually hard)\n- Ones which requires your fingers and nerves : just run from the beginning to the end, without stopping will often work. Trouble is that you can't afford the slightest mistake in the whole level as it is instant death (or forever trapped).\n\nOf course, whatever the kind of level you play, the ultimate goal is to get a good rank among all the players who have succeded before you (and there are good people out there, so it's not easy to get high in the ranks).\n\nWhat's more ?

That is pretty hard to do : most of the time, Woop will make one more step before turning, and this step will lead you into ... water !

Woop!”\n\nToday, GHT’s Indie corner brings to you a puzzle game called Chuck’s Challenge 3D. The developer is Niffler Ltd. and it was published by Nkidu Games. My first thought when seeing the pictures for this game was “cute, an alien named Chuck.” It reminded me of a cat we used to have named Steve… I love “people names” for cute creatures. However, to my disappointment, the purple alien’s name is not Chuck, it’s Woop. Fun to say, but not as fun as if he’d been named Chuck.\n\nNow you’re probably thinking “who’s the Chuck in Chuck’s Challenge 3D!?” Well, my friends, he happens to be a game creator that Woop has summoned (abducted) from what looks like his holiday and forced to make puzzles. I feel it should be called something like “Woop’s Wonderland”. Sure, in the end Chuck is happy and wants to make more puzzles for Woop, but I would suspect he was brainwashed into it. Vacation on a beach, in the sun and sand, or doing your job?… It really does seem like a difficult decision...\n\nTo read the rest of this review go to,  http://www.gamershonesttruth.com/chucks-challenge-3d-woop-woop/","November 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The developer sure succeeded in making the new set of mechanics work and making the whole thing look beautiful.\n\nWhile the game does a poor job of explaining what it is you're picking up through the ( slightly redundant, yet quite funny ) story sequences, I don't think anyone will have a hard time figuring it out on the go.\n\nI'd also like to mention that there's absolutely no lack of content here. There are numerous standard levels to play through and there's Steam Workshop levels if you want to keep going after that.\n\nOverall, this is a fun little game that I can use to fill up my spare time and sniff up some nostalgia with.","October 20, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The formula hasn't really changed an enormous amount over the years - move blocks around, dodge hazards, find items to bypass dangerous floor types, and so on.\n\nThe primary additions in this case are an Undo key, meaning that when you mess up you only have to go back a move or two instead of restarting the level, and a built-in map editor with online level sharing (though not through workshop, curiously...)\n\nIt doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, and the sound effects can grate on the ears after a while, but Chuck's Challenge is a charming and respectful update to a classic.

Chuck is the creator of Chip’s Challenge, a 1989 Atari Lynx release that eventually spread out to Windows, Amiga, ZX Spectrum and all the other notable computer platforms of the day. In both games, the main character must navigate a variety of obstacle filled mazes one block at a time, with the skill coming from completing levels quickly and without error or death. It’s a game with simplistic goals, which makes sense considering that it first debuted on mobile platforms a few months ago. Now, with a bit of polish, Chuck and his alien compatriots are challenging the Steam marketplace as well.\n\nRead the rest of my review over at Geekenstein.com! http://www.geekenstein.com/chucks-challenge-3d-review/","February 28, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Easy levels are for children under 12 or for monkeys ;) - much more difficult game is "Bug's Escape 3D" (Berušky II) or Berušky I (1 is free game)\nI recommend these games and Chuk's Challenge 3D - but not on the easy levels. Berušky I and Bug's Escape 3D is more logical than arcade. Chips' Challenge and Chuck's Challenge 3D is a mix of arcade and logical but also interesting. I prefer logical problems in Chuck's Challenge. Great that authors think about good respawning solutions - at the last position - in arcade levels\n\nP.S. If you buy similar game: "Bug's Escape 3D" and you can not pass some lvls - load the replay of these records http://ceskehry.wz.cz/navody/berusky2.htm  (by Domas)  (- paste to save folder - select profile and load replay for level- this is animations solutions).

They start off very easy but the difficult does increase quickly. This game will keep you busy for a long time as at the end of each level you get ranked on your time spent solving the level.

This is really the main feature of the game, as there are unlimited free levels being created by community. Plus the best user created level each week will become the weekly puzzle.

The puzzles vary from easy to impressively challenging.  You can skip any level you get stuck on and come back for it later.  Basically, you're moving blocks and skating across ice/conveyor belts to make it to the end of the maze.\n\nChuck Summerville is a renown puzzle designer and this is a reskin of his game from 1989 called Chips Challenge.\n\nI will say that the interface -- which was created for iPhones and Android devices -- leaves a lot to be desired.  If you die too many times, you'll get a message that for the most part implies that you're an idiot and asks you to skip that level and try again later.  Also, there are cutscenes that are activated by stepping on a shirt that is contained in the level -- also ragingly annoying.\n\nBut if you can get past the handful of interface issues and just focus on the puzzles, this title is a ton of fun.","February 28, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is essentially the same with improved graphics and sounds... but unfortunately it is extremely buggy. The most glaring issue is that often, completing a level will not mark it as complete, forcing you to do it all again. Aside from that, occasionally graphics will disappear or controls will stop responding entirely, requiring you to restart. But not recording progress is unforgivable for a level-based puzzler.\n\nOverall, while visually appealing, this game is ruined by its bugs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/262590/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","A hidden gem of a puzzle game! I wish I would've known about this sooner. It took me about 10.5 hours to beat every stage (everything up to and including flummery), but there's much more fun to be had going for more medals, weekly challenges, and using the level creator.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this game. It's very well paced and doesn't feel repetitive - each level feels like it has a unique "trick" to it and they add new items and enemies at a good rate. I found the difficulty curve to be great as well - I never really got frustrated on a stage and never felt like a stage was too long.\n\nThe levels are always just the right size - unlike chip's challenge where you would not be able to see everything you need to see sometimes (due to levels being really large), this game makes it very clear and precise while maintaining a charming visual aesthetic.\n\nOne of the things that makes this game really fun is infinite undo and rapid restarting. You don't EVER have to go through a section you've already solved if you make a mistake because you can just hit backspace. If you're trying to beat a level without undoing (like making an attempt to get a high score), you can just hit R and instantly restart if you make a mistake. And as a nice touch, the timer doesn't start counting until you make your first move.\n\nThe level design is really what makes this game stand out for me. It's brimming with creativity, polish and game design expertise, no doubt building on Chuck's experience with Chip's challenge. Levels aren't simply about pushing blocks into specific positions - they might be about dodging enemies, using switches, building bridges, etc...it does an excellent job of making every level have a unique concept/central idea/key trick, leading to a plethora of satisfying "eureka" moments as you discover them while playing around with the level.\n\nIt doesn't just stop at being a great solitary experience - you can compete for time on every stage using the online leaderboards. At this level of play, the game does become a bit more about execution and less about puzzle solving, but still maintains an aspect of puzzling as you try to figure out the most effecient path to the goal. So, regardless of whether the execution or puzzle solving appeals to you, you'll get something out of the leaderboards. With the stages that ship with the game, you can also just replay them to try to get the silver and gold medals. There's also community-created maps and a weekly puzzle (selected from the best of the community maps each week) - so each week presents a new opportunity to test your skills against other players.\n\nOn a completely different track, you can design levels and share them with the community. There's a rudimentary voting system so you can see how people like your creations. This game gives you such a variety of tools and such a solid mechanical foundation to work with that it's an excellent platform to express your game design creativity and feel good about making something fun for other people to enjoy.\n\nDefinitely give this a go if you like puzzle games. I've played a lot of puzzle games and this game ranks up there with my top 5, maybe even top 3.","January 31, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being able to make custom content means the game is much more usable and feasable as entertainment for kids. (On the premise of finding or making the levels)\n\nCons:\n- Uninterruptable fluff. In particular the 'help' texts that result from stepping on a 'shirt'. Sometimes you might accidently step on a shirt and have to click through a bunch of fluff again before being able to play the level.\n- Interface is a bit slow and can be a little awkward.\n\nOther:\n- Has some story/fluff content.

It is basically Chip's Challenge but with updated graphics, a few extra game elements, a level editor and user created content by putting the levels made in the editor in the Steam Workshop. If you are a fan of the original game, you really should buy it, not only because it has near infinite levels thanks to the Workshop, but also because it's dirt cheap.\n\nFor the guys who have never played Chip's Challenge before, Chuck's Challenge is a puzzle game where you control a character (Whoop) on a grid and you have to find the exit. On your way are doors, ice tiles, fire, movable blocks, pressure plates and a dozen different type of monsters. The monsters move in a predictable pattern: Bouncers bounce back and forth between obstacles, Limpy will always turn right if possible, Blue Golems reverse direction when you pull a lever etc. These few simple mechanics make a surprisingly challenging game. Don't let the aesthetics fool you: this game can be very, VERY hard.\n\nThis game is not without flaws, as of the date this review is written, there are a couple of problems. Main soruce of anger is the unresponsive menu screen and controls. There is a bit of lag between pressing the up key and going up, which takes a while to get used to. Despite that, the core gameplay is great and I recommend this game for any puzzle game fan, especially for the very low price this game is.","December 30, 2014","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the workshop challenges are really good, you can even find remakes of the original Chip's Challenge levels.\n\nThere are only a few things I see wrong with it. The higher graphics add a lot of quality, but the blur is unbearable. I turned the quality down just to get rid of that. Also, Chuck seems to have issues with only moving a single space unless you very carefully tap the direction controls. It could be easier to get to settings and the quit option too, rather than having to scroll all the way through the main menu.\n\nIt would be nice to see the original challenges officially ported to this game, or at least make it easier to find and play the workshop versions.

But let me be frank up-front: the story sequences are painful.  If you ever read what little story Chip's Challenge has, you'd quickly see that Chuck really should just let his puzzles do the talking.

The first maps might be easy but after that you dont get things served to you. Every single level is beatable and can be solved with what you can see, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to. All the objects and monsters are easy to figure out how they work (since they operate on a few simple rules), but that does not mean that things wont get complicated. The way I see it complaining about not being able to beat few maps is completely missing the point. You are supposed to be challenged by the maps and try several diffrent ways of solving them, sometimes coming back to them few days after and trying again. The usual in games today is people getting it extremely easy even on hard settings when it comes to puzzles and this is not what this game is about.\n\nThe bad parts about the game is the blur that comes when you zoom out, some of the design choices are questionable, the controls sometimes are a bit laggy (rarely a problem for me though, specially since so many maps are puzzles where you think not act quickly), the ui is sometimes a bid bad and perhaps worst of all the fact that the progress is saved online after each map (by the time they show you medal). Still the game is very playable and these problems does not take away the fun of solving the puzzles.\n\nTL;DR: If you dont like being challenged by puzzles and sometimes not being able to solve them then this game is not for you. I however love the fact that the puzzles are on the level that you can beat them but its sometimes pretty damn hard and takes time. The cons are annoying, but doesnt take away the fun of the game.","November 6, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, be aware of a few things:\n1) You have to be online and connected to a server to track progress - this means waiting after every level for your score to be recorded, otherwise the game won't register that you've completed a level.\n2) The level design is a lot easier and a lot less varied than it was in the Chip's Challenge games - however, this could be because there is a "rewind" feature to take you back steps, at the cost of a time penalty, so if you don't mind being marked down the levels become a lot easier.\n3) Some levels are lifted almost whole from Chip's Challenge games, others are just Sokoban (way too many Sokoban levels) and a couple seem to be from The Impossible Game? Only a few levels really strike a true "Chip's Challenge" chord.\n\nSo all in all, this is a decent game if picked up cheaply, and the level creation/player levels adds a lot of lifespan.

Although I have not completed the game, I feel I had "seen enough" to get the general gist of it.\n\nChuck's Challenge plays just like it looks: like an indie puzzle game. You move a cute alien around and guide him to the exit of each level. The game features hazards that impede your path or kill you, items that let you mitigate some of said hazards, enemies with varying behaviors, and occasionally mandatory collectables needed to open certain locked doors. The game's puzzles start off easy enough, but gradually scale higher and higher in difficulty.\n\nGenerally, puzzles come in two flavors: the "obstacle course" puzzles and the "non-threating moving blocks" puzzles. The "obstacle course" puzzles tend to be straightforward (although naturally get more bendy in their solutions in later levels) where you have to dodge enemies and navigate through hazards to reach the end. The "moving blocks" puzzles consist of small levels where nothing threatens your life but must instead move a limited amount of boxes around a tightly-packed space onto pressure switches to open the way to the exit. The game does sometimes blur the two together, but those make up the main "types" of puzzles you'll experience.\n\nChuck's Challenge screams "mobile game", but it's the good kind of mobile port. You'll see all the mobile staples; from the Angry-Birds style menus, the overtly colorful and cutesey (but low-budget) graphics, the 3-star time-based rating system, and how each world (basically a level pack of a set difficulty with a unique theme) unlocks only after beating a certain amount of levels before it. However, you'll find the game runs smoothly and the basic WASD movement to be acceptable. My only complaints port-wise involve how the graphics settings only allow you to switch between the Unity-engine presets ("Fastest" to "Beautiful"), and that non-movement buttons (such as manually undoing a move) require going into the game's manual to find the button for.\n\nMy primary complaints for the game involve one subjective feeling about the game's difficulty, and the poor audio balance:\n\n+Regarding the difficulty, I found the "moving box" puzzles to require much more thinking time and figuring out than any other puzzle in the same world. I have to hand it to Chuck, those puzzles make for great brain teasers, but also could use a much gentler difficulty curve. The non-moving box puzzles before and after them required ludicrously less amount of time to solve than those of the same world, and I can only imagine them getting much worse. To add even more frustration, the game claims to offer a "Replay system" which will show a clue how to solve the puzzle. However, I found that only one level I tried it on (the last moving-box level of World 2 I believe) actually had a Replay, and the rest did not. I find this feature to be rather useless as a result.\n\n+For some reason, the sound balance of the game is extremely off, even painful for headphone users. Enemy noises (those that play when the main character is near an enemy), as well as wearing the ice roller (item that lets you freely move on ice) play an extremely loud sound effect. Comparatively, the sound effects for collecting items, and even the main character's death noise, are very quiet. I'm not sure what happened, but the sound balance needs some work.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a quick and dirty puzzle game that boasts some legitimate challenge, Chuck's Challenge will fill that niche. It's cheap and regularly on sale as well.","October 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very rarely have I come across a hint that actually does its job without fail.\n\nNow this doesn't necessarily affect the gameplay in any aspects, but I do imagine this bugged hint system is going to cause some trouble later on when I find myself stuck and am in dire need of a hint to get me in the right direction.

However, be aware of a few things:\n1) You have to be online and connected to a server to track progress - this means waiting after every level for your score to be recorded, otherwise the game won't register that you've completed a level.\n2) The level design is a lot easier and a lot less varied than it was in the Chip's Challenge games - however, this could be because there is a "rewind" feature to take you back steps, at the cost of a time penalty, so if you don't mind being marked down the levels become a lot easier.\n3) Some levels are lifted almost whole from Chip's Challenge games, others are just Sokoban (way too many Sokoban levels) and a couple seem to be from The Impossible Game? Only a few levels really strike a true "Chip's Challenge" chord.\n\nSo all in all, this is a decent game if picked up cheaply, and the level creation/player levels adds a lot of lifespan. It has its fair share of faults, which is surprising for a game so simplistic.","June 1, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first maps might be easy but after that you dont get things served to you. Every single level is beatable and can be solved with what you can see, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to. All the objects and monsters are easy to figure out how they work (since they operate on a few simple rules), but that does not mean that things wont get complicated. The way I see it complaining about not being able to beat few maps is completely missing the point. You are supposed to be challenged by the maps and try several diffrent ways of solving them, sometimes coming back to them few days after and trying again. The usual in games today is people getting it extremely easy even on hard settings when it comes to puzzles and this is not what this game is about.\n\nThe bad parts about the game is the blur that comes when you zoom out, some of the design choices are questionable, the controls sometimes are a bit laggy (rarely a problem for me though, specially since so many maps are puzzles where you think not act quickly), the ui is sometimes a bid bad and perhaps worst of all the fact that the progress is saved online after each map (by the time they show you medal). Still the game is very playable and these problems does not take away the fun of solving the puzzles.\n\nTL;DR: If you dont like being challenged by puzzles and sometimes not being able to solve them then this game is not for you. I however love the fact that the puzzles are on the level that you can beat them but its sometimes pretty damn hard and takes time. The cons are annoying, but doesnt take away the fun of the game.","November 6, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I have not completed the game, I feel I had "seen enough" to get the general gist of it.\n\nChuck's Challenge plays just like it looks: like an indie puzzle game. You move a cute alien around and guide him to the exit of each level. The game features hazards that impede your path or kill you, items that let you mitigate some of said hazards, enemies with varying behaviors, and occasionally mandatory collectables needed to open certain locked doors. The game's puzzles start off easy enough, but gradually scale higher and higher in difficulty.\n\nGenerally, puzzles come in two flavors: the "obstacle course" puzzles and the "non-threating moving blocks" puzzles. The "obstacle course" puzzles tend to be straightforward (although naturally get more bendy in their solutions in later levels) where you have to dodge enemies and navigate through hazards to reach the end. The "moving blocks" puzzles consist of small levels where nothing threatens your life but must instead move a limited amount of boxes around a tightly-packed space onto pressure switches to open the way to the exit. The game does sometimes blur the two together, but those make up the main "types" of puzzles you'll experience.\n\nChuck's Challenge screams "mobile game", but it's the good kind of mobile port. You'll see all the mobile staples; from the Angry-Birds style menus, the overtly colorful and cutesey (but low-budget) graphics, the 3-star time-based rating system, and how each world (basically a level pack of a set difficulty with a unique theme) unlocks only after beating a certain amount of levels before it. However, you'll find the game runs smoothly and the basic WASD movement to be acceptable. My only complaints port-wise involve how the graphics settings only allow you to switch between the Unity-engine presets ("Fastest" to "Beautiful"), and that non-movement buttons (such as manually undoing a move) require going into the game's manual to find the button for.\n\nMy primary complaints for the game involve one subjective feeling about the game's difficulty, and the poor audio balance:\n\n+Regarding the difficulty, I found the "moving box" puzzles to require much more thinking time and figuring out than any other puzzle in the same world. I have to hand it to Chuck, those puzzles make for great brain teasers, but also could use a much gentler difficulty curve. The non-moving box puzzles before and after them required ludicrously less amount of time to solve than those of the same world, and I can only imagine them getting much worse. To add even more frustration, the game claims to offer a "Replay system" which will show a clue how to solve the puzzle. However, I found that only one level I tried it on (the last moving-box level of World 2 I believe) actually had a Replay, and the rest did not. I find this feature to be rather useless as a result.\n\n+For some reason, the sound balance of the game is extremely off, even painful for headphone users. Enemy noises (those that play when the main character is near an enemy), as well as wearing the ice roller (item that lets you freely move on ice) play an extremely loud sound effect. Comparatively, the sound effects for collecting items, and even the main character's death noise, are very quiet. I'm not sure what happened, but the sound balance needs some work.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a quick and dirty puzzle game that boasts some legitimate challenge, Chuck's Challenge will fill that niche. It's cheap and regularly on sale as well.","October 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
