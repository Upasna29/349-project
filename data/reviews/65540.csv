"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drxela/recommended/65540/","drxela","drxela","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drxela/","81 products in account","Although my Steam time says 22 minutes for this game, I played it mostly offline because I've had internet troubles. I completed the game after 31 hours.\n\nI had never heard of the Gothic series before, but I got interested in checking it out after watching an interview with Jonathan Blow, the creator of 'Braid', where he talked about gameplay and game design. In that interview, he described the Gothic series as, "like Skyrim, but with good gameplay". Such zing!\n\nI then found it on Steam and got a deal for all three games. I've heard 1 and 2 are amazing, and 3 is just okay (according to most hardcore fans), after which there are some spinoffs that are considered absolutely appalling. I'm yet to play 2 or 3 though, so this is just based on my experience with Gothic 1.\n\nI really enjoyed Gothic 1. It's an RPG adventure type game with open world exploration. The story is great, the characters are interesting, the world is a good size (large enough to explore, not so large that it's overwhelming). The controls take some getting used to, and I recommend reading up on Google for some explanation and guidance on it. After about two or three hours though, it's a piece of cake. (You can also find the original manual for the game - yes, it was made in the era of actual game manuals - which will help in explaining a lot of how the game world works)\n\nThe main thing about the controls is that a person or item needs to be selected first before you press something else to interact with it. For example, if there's some berries on the ground, you press the select tool and then press action to pick them up. If you're trying to pick up a particular item on the ground amongst others, you press the select tool, press left or right to toggle through which item is highlight and then press action once the item you want is highlighted. Same goes for interacting with people and even moving items around when trading (explained more below). You also need to highlight a creature and then press action to attack when you have a weapon ready.\n\nYou start off being introduced to some characters and one of the three main camps. You eventually learn about all three camps and you'll need to choose one to join (each with its own way of living, style, etc). You can access almost any part of the map at any time, although early on there are places where the people and creatures will absolutely crush you until you're strong enough to survive (kind of in a Dark Souls way). You can learn all kinds of skills, including one hand or two hand weapons, agility, stealing, getting resources from animals you kill, etc.\n\nA lot of your time will be spent trading with people, so take your time to collect everything you find as it will be worth something. The trading system appears odd at first, but like the controls, it's a piece of cake once you learn in. You put things into the middle you want to trade from your side and get from the other side, then you press 'Enter' to make the deal. The values at the top will show you if you're getting a fair deal or not. The NPCs you trade with will accept any deal that's equal or where they get an advantage, so be careful. You could end up trading away things worth 1,000s for 10 worth of stuff.\n\nMost of this stuff you will learn over time, and there's a joy in exploring and learning to understand the world. However, there are other things that you'll wish you knew at the beginning. Some things I learnt after 20 hours into the game just by accident that would've been good to know from the get go. Here are a few of those things:\n\n1. You can switch weapons using the number keys, but you can also hold down the space bar to toggle through them.\n2. When your character is out of health and not breathing on the ground, he is dead. The game will not load a previous save for you. It's up to you to pause the game and manually load up a save. Otherwise you'll just sit there staring at your dead corpse forever. :O\n3. Armour really matters in this game, both for you and enemies. There are some enemies you won't be able to even damage unless you really stagger them and get a lucky hit in. For those ones, you'll need to wait until later in the game to get some better weapons. Same goes for you though. Once you have some quality armour, a lot of enemies won't be able to really do anything to you.\n4. If you're falling from a great height, hold down left or right and you won't get damaged. Can save your life and also make travelling the world a lot faster at times. (this is obviously a glitch and not an intended game design, but still)\n\nThis is not a positive review based on nostalgia for this old game. This is the first time I've ever played or seen a Gothic game (in 2015). Gothic 1 is not a perfect game, but if you can get past the graphics (although there is a mod that will help with that a bit), and get used to the controls, it has great gameplay with and an interesting storyline. I'm looking forward to playing Gothic 2 (considered by most fans to be the best in the series).","March 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 84 of 95 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","84","95","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/65540/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","- When I was washed ashore, one of the guys punched me in the face!\n- They do that to all the newcomers. They call it "Standing Godfather".\n\nThis short and absurd dialogue exchanged between our nameless hero and a shadow - an agent of the old camp - basically summarizes the tone of the whole Gothic series, starting with this first installation: ruthless, cruel and challenging. Its dog eat dog world from the moment you start your game, and it won't get any easier for quite some time. Nevertheless, coming out in 2001, Gothic is one of the first open world single player RPGs where you get to choose your own progress; roaming around, choosing quests and eventually deal with one primary problem that would very much define your whole story. With this game, Piranha Bytes set the baseline for all Open World RPGs that will be eventually advanced by The Elder Scroll series and many other wondrous RPGs, changing the market expectation of a computer RPG forever.\n\nWith the opening cinematic, we are informed that there has been an ongoing war between humans and orcs for ages now, and the King Rhobar II desperately needed magical ore to finance the war. Thus, he ordered a mining colony populated with prisoners to be established by all criminals, bandits and cutthroats of the land. 10 of the most powerful mages put a magical barrier over the colony. Yet, something has gone wrong. The barrier extended beyond the intended limits; trapping all and any that were present around at the time. The barrier was harmless for the one coming into the colony from the outside, yet it was impenetrable from the inside. None would be able to leave alive... Taking advantage from this mishap, the prisoners revolted and killed all guardsmen, seizing the control of the colony. Desperate for the ore, the King came to an agreement with brigands exchanging all kinds of earthly goods for the ore needed and still keeping to send in new prisoners for the work force.\n\nThis is the point our nameless hero - whose "name" or its instant of not being revealed in any circumstances is an ongoing gag for the series - a prisoner of unknown crime, is sent down to the colony, to deliver a message to the Arch Mage of the Circle of Fire. We are given the message, kicked down to the colony to meet some locals - and get smacked by them as a casual welcome... From this point onwards, it's gonna be a zero to hero scenario. Our relatively mundane character will become the one hero of the land through exploration, careful choice of allies and smarts enough not to do or say certain things in certain conditions.\n\nI must say that the setting and the story are fairly creative about the idea of a society established by criminals. Anyone and everyone in the colony are convicts or at least shady enough people with their own agendas anyhow. Most NPCs you'll end up meeting are pretty much a**holes and they'll lie, cheat and change alliances easily. Characters have motives, depth, agendas and personalities. So, not trusting anyone becomes our main motto quite easily. Even though the game world is relatively small here, the setting itself - with 3 primary gods, orc/human wars, different lore and system of different camps, the nature of magic and runes, fiends of vile realms etc. - are imaginative and intriguing, yet sadly the storyline hasn't been thoroughly developed into its full potential in this first game. As the series progress, we'll become increasingly invested in both our character and the setting of the world - especially with Gothic II, which I'd consider a masterpiece RPG.\n\nAnimations and display are nothing miraculous considering the age of the game, yet they are really good for their time. We are even capable to observe some basic facial features, mimics and remarks of NPCs while they are making comments - which was altogether quite new and fascinating for its time. The game world is kinetic too, with NPCs having routines, sharing meals and attending mundane business when you are not interacting with them. Even mob monsters do sleep according to day/night cycle!\n\nLet's talk about the sucky parts of the game anyhow. Controls from hell are the primary problem that many people would prefer to pass this game. Mouse is merely used to direct camera angle - like an action adventure and you are expected to arrange a handful of odd key combinations for everything. If you are to rearrange key bindings, you'll probably override some other management option and render everything much more complicated than before. So... it's either getting used to hellish controls or not playing this game. You'll be expected to use 2-3 key combinations just to pick an item from the ground! That is some meaningless chore, I won't lie. But if you get used to it, you won't be even aware that you are arranging the combination after some point.\n\nLet's make our peace with one certain fact at this point: dying is a natural and common part of Gothic series. With this kind of gameplay difficulty and somewhat bug-ridden environment, you gotta be either a hardcore fan of the series or a bit masochistic to learn and have fun from getting your a** kicked in casual ways. Combined with hellish controls, combat becomes fairly hard and disorienting sometimes. You are expected to perform a series of combo attacks, blocks or dodges to face your enemies or else, anything coming your way might make an easy meal out of you. When you bear the controls finally, you'll notice that input detection bugging quite annoyingly sometime too. AI is somewhat imaginative too; maintaining different approaches of combat for different kinds of enemies and monsters. Some will downright charge, some will hunt in packs, others will dance around you and some others will try a couple of hit and run tactics on you.\n\nThe AI and the environment texture are fairly old and buggy, so I strongly recommend installing some mods before taking on this journey; and for that purpose I'd certainly recommend GOG version of the game rather than Steam version, considering its way more stable with less crashes or conflicts. Worst case scenario, you are able to use a series of cheat commands called the Marvin Mode - which was used by developers to test certain modification - to arrange nearly anything in the game. Many things in game are left semi-developed due to time management problems on Piranha Bytes' part so installing Dark Mysteries mod + Ironforge Patch would fill in the blanks left by developers and fixing most glitches perfectly if it doesn't cause any problems for your system.\n\nThis game - with its scenario, its environment and its humor will always find a way to surprise you both in good ways and bad ways. Even after stating all its problems - and casual ways to work around them, I strongly recommend playing this game as a part of computer RPG history at this point. It is not only nostalgia, it is a classic - alongside Gothic II.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 27","true","49.5"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","59","60","0","8"

It's open-world and mostly non-linear, though completing certain parts of the main storyline progesses your game to the next "chapter" which can change things pretty significantly.\n\nSave frequently and don't skip the dialogue quests, because you're going to want that experience to actually survive outside of the camps (and sometimes inside too). You're pretty much dogmeat early on, and fighting multiple enemies at the start is almost guaranteed suicide. Yes, the game is difficult in the early stages and that's why I like it - you're a nobody that gets beaten up from outset, continually threatened and attacked, but you rise up from that to become a hero.\n\nYou can choose whatever playstyle you wish by advancing certain stats and using the proper gear/items. The main builds are melee fighter or mage (archery exists but doesn't seem entirely viable for several reasons), but you can hybrid as you want and there are some thief/rogue skills available as well.\n\nNearly all dialogue is voice-acted, which was a pretty big deal back when the game came out. A number of NPCs roam around in the camps, making background conversation with each other, wandering off to pee in the alley, and heading to their homes at night, adding a realistic atmosphere to the world.\n\nWhile Gothic is an amazing game, it's not without its flaws. Enemy AI can sometimes be abused to allow you to casually pick off enemies. The game tends to crash a lot later on (it often has to do with it not loading sound files for the orc weapons properly on startup, which could be a huge problem if you or an NPC/mob has one near your save location). The game lacks a crafting system which was disappointing when a conversation early on with a blacksmith suggests you can actually craft more than a standard sword (you can't). The tools are in place for it, because you can cook meat in a pan and smith some basic items... but that's about it. Additionally, some content was stripped out of the North American version - a side questline involving a bandit camp as well as an in-game music concert (though mods have restored these). There are a number of mods available for the game that range from additional content to crafting to entirely different gameplay styles.\n\nSome experience problems getting the game to run on modern systems, but there are a number of resources/fixes posted on the forums that have worked for most people. That said, it took me about 7 steps to finally get the game to run (and in doing so it wouldn't completely log my full hours played on Steam, which is nearly double what's officially posted). Because of this, I'd recommend buying Gothic when it's on a big sale just in case you can't seem to get it working... but if you do, you'll find a satisfying RPG worth many hours of play.","December 31, 2014","true","74.9"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","63","67","2","0"

(and they say Morrowind was a revolution for RPG, PFFFFT!)\nThe story is not the best, but it's good and interest enough to keep player in the loop. Combat and control will confused people who just started the game, but you will get used to it.\nBecause this game was made by a German company and wasn't well marketed in worldwide, it wasn't well known (even up to now) and was result in being a very very very underrated gem. Therefore, if you are a RPG player, this game is a must.\n\nHere are some recommend mods for you:\nUnofficial patch: http://www.worldofgothic.com/dl/?go=dlfile&fileid=164\nThe game itself is not really buggy, some claim this patch causes more trouble than it worth but I had no problem with it.\n\nTexure patch: http://www.worldofgothic.de/dl/download_247.htm\nGothic 1's textures are very outdated, with this texture patch, it will bring most textures from Gothic 2 to G1. It's not your kind of fancy HD texture pack, but it will improved the graphic A LOT and keep the visual style in a lore-friendly way.\n\nIMPORTANT: This game is no longer working with Steam overlay, so make sure to disable it if you don't want to get error and ♥♥♥♥.","October 19, 2014","true","35.3"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","61","71","4","0"

Though this does sounds quite usual to today's players, I still have no idea if Gothic was the first 3D RPG that introduced such feature just to add immersive feeling, what I can say is it's quite an useful function in this game. The sound design is also outstanding in its age(except for npc's chatting lol) and its background music is very well done that not only adding points to atmosphere but also can be seamlessly switched between different areas. The storyline is good enough to me that not only makes me keep goin on but also provides a comparatively convincible explanation of that border of an open world lol (instead of some kind of "invisible wall"...)","January 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","50","58","0","0"

Several different endings and skillsets encourage players to replay the game and dig deeper into the story.\n\nThank you Steam for offering this (rather old) game on your platform !!!  :)\n\n\nSome technical remarks:\nTo get the game running on newer OS avoiding the Access Violation Error right after the start you'll have to make sure GOTHIC.exe runs in compatibility mode (Win XP works fine here). The file can be found in Steam's standard directory:\nC:/Programs (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Gothic/system\n\nFor many steam users the game starts in window mode and won’t let you access full screen mode.\nTo fix this you either need to install a patch as described in Karuhm’s Guide:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=132167831\nor people who don’t want to do that can simply overwrite the video resolution settings in the GOTHIC.ini file, which is located in the same folder as GOTHIC.exe.\nIf the non-cancellable Pyranha Bytes intro video annoys you, just search for the „playLogoVideos“ entry in the .ini-file and set it to 0. There are lots of useful settings in there.","July 4, 2014","true","30.1"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

To start off I will say there are elements in the game that are rather old-fashioned in comparison to how games have progressed, for example the developers took an extreme use of the ctrl key that is normally used for crouching (or walking depending on the person). So that being said the combat, menus, lockpicking, and nearly every action you can think of is bound to the ctrl key which takes time to get used to.\nThe story of the game was all that a generic story tells and nothing more. I wouldn't expect for people to play this game and be stunned as to the twists that the story told, everything comes at face value in the game, and it's meant to be taken more light-heartedly than other RPGs of it's kind as told by the dialogue and various cutscenes.\nThe combat is relatively interesting and I was reminded of the style of combat that Witcher (CDProjekt RED) decided to use as well. So much so that I even thought perhaps it was the same developers working on the games. I can't say for sure but it is mighty suspicious knowing that Gothic 1 was distributed by CD Projekt a subsidary of CD Projekt RED. It's mainly odd that no one mentions the connection that Gothic 1 had rhythmic styled fighting where you press the directional movement (with ctrl) in accordance to how your character holds the sword. At any rate I can help but feel that Witcher was inspired by Gothic possibly through the connection mentioned above or simply because it was quite popular for it's time, your choice.\nI'll go ahead and say there wasn't anything sound-wise in the game to make me hate having to hear the same song over and over again. But I also won't say I heard anything too spectacular aside from the one german band that wandered it's way into Chapter 2 of the story in Old Town.\n\nNow for some odd faults I found with the game. I'll say previous to this that there was an unofficial patch I found out about after finishing the game with a vanilla playthrough. This could be a fix to all the problems I'm going to mention, but I feel I should say some of them anyways.\n-Ladders are completely broken in certain areas which can leave players stuck\n-Enemies can completely dodge attacks infinitely until you block and allow them to attempt a shot at the hero\n-Enemies grouping give an unfair experience due to you being unable to attack anything but the single target you lock on to while they can mindlessly swing at you\n-Getting hit causes the hero to get 'stunned' See: Enemies grouping^ to understand why this sucks so horribly\n-Any and all animations are not invincible animations and while I can understand why this is placed in certain areas, the final boss desperately should have had some sort of invincibility frames when doing actions\n-Mud\n-Humans are completely annoying to kill which leads back to invincibility animations as you have to stop attacking them when they fall to the ground, and THEN press ctrl+up to finish them off otherwise they'll infinitely stand back up\n-Mud again because he got me stuck in the bed when he tried to dialogue with me as I tried to sleep and was forced to reload a save quite a ways back\n-other odd glitches and whatnot such as clipping through the floor and just dying or sliding off areas that didn't appear to be unsafe leading to untimely deaths\n\nOverall despite the glaring flaws towards the end of the game (at least to me), the first half of the game was amazingly fun.\nThe main reason I disliked the last half of the game is because it felt like it was working backwards while trying to progress, for example I had someone working on giving me a piece of armor while I had already gotten the end-game armor. And he still hadn't finished the armor that was weaker than the one I'd gotten. It just felt like I was constantly dealing with stuff like this. Another instance was when I was a high-ranking member of the city and was told that I couldn't buy armor since I was a stranger.\nTo me this is something easily worth checking out and be sure to look for the unofficial patch, perhaps it'll make the game even better for you than I since I had encountered so many bugs.\n\nAlso there are tons of bugs with simply STARTING the game\nHere's a quick troubleshoot list before I found an end-all solution for my problem\nIf you get an error when you try starting the game, i.e. you can launch the game but then you get an error when you load or start a new game.\n-Disable Steam Community\nIf that doesn't work\n-Run Gothic as an Administrator\nThe final one\n-Disable sound in the .ini Gothic file or in the settings menu\nThis doesn't have to be the background music, but it does take away all dialogue/sound effects for the rest of the game including cutscenes. But doing this fixed the game entirely for me and I no longer had any start-up issues.\nAgain patch may or may not fix this.","June 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","45","60","0","3"

So funny to see many critics towards the game because of its "simplified skill system", "over complicated controls", "bad voice acting", "lack of quality animation"... And you know what? I will not be busting myths there.\n\nJust make a statement: without that mature, realistic and hardened gothic game, players around the globe was in chains of stagnation, where all the brightest RPGs were an extensions to already acclaimed ideas (like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or Final Fantasy X). Pyranha Bytes created a new pattern, made a new trend.\nI'm grateful to them. And to that game, which I explored the length and breadth 13 years ago. In which I lived for very long time.\n\nAs of question "is it worth buying and playing now?", well, it is working for me. If you played it earlier and want to refresh memories, or if you are a fan of old games in general - you may give it a shot. And if you simply want to bate your curiosity, like "I wonder, how it was 14 years ago?", just go for youtube letsplay and try a Risen game.

There's a guide on the Community Hub which explains everything.\n\nI remember getting this game from a PC magazine called LEVEL. They had the full game on a CD, I was so little and so naive back then. I used to play this game for hours...and hours...never even getting past the first chapter but enjoying the game more than a kid enjoys christmas.\nThat's how good this game was and still is. While it's somewhat hard to recommend the game since it has a few bugs here and there and it's old, I do so because I loved the story and the gameplay of it.\nFor a game from 2001, this is extremely well done. It's very immersive you if you let it. You can talk to every single NPC from the game, ask him how he's day has been, how things are going and so on. They have their own routines, jobs... it's awesome.\nWhen you learn new things, such as the one-handed sword fighting skills, the NPC actually explains to your main character how to behave, the form he needs to take and how to swing, it's epic.\nAbout the story, well.. it's great and well explained. One thing you should know if you've never played the Gothic series, is that the game doesn't really hold your hand. You don't have waypoints or anything like that. You only have your journal which explains what you need to do (kind of).\nThe combat is not that easy and takes a while to get the hang of it but it's very entertaining and in Gothic II it's even better.\nThat's all I have to say for now.

It has quite a large world to explore and all of it is hand crafted by the designers. Its not huge but not a computer generated world like in elder scrolls games. There are many interesting places to explore many interesting characters to meet and monsters to kill. There is no special area for strong or weak monsters. You can bump into strong monsters anywhere. So you should learn to escape and come back when you improve. An important rpg feature most games lack unfortunetely! And monsters are also hand placed by the designers and dont respawn frequently or level up with you. They are static throughout the whole game. It has very strong story and atmosphere. You feel like a rat to be kicked around at the start of the game. Everyone pushes you around. But in the later game you feel yourself like a real hero. Exploring the wilderness is an horrifying experience. There is surprise at every corner. I experienced this kind of feeling in very few games. Story unfolds slowly and its epic! And there is night/day cycle. Npc's sleep at night, do their daily jobs during day and some of them gather around fire and chat in the evening. Everyone has his own place to sleep and work. Most of the people dislike the controls but i think it is more than ok. You will get used to it in no time if you be patient and will like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/recommended/65540/","killerfrosti","Pepsiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/","606 products in account","Reading through all the Gothic reviews I noticed barely anyone has something negative to say about the game, so yeah... I'm afraid this is going to be the most negative review on gothic and some people are probably gonna hate me for it, and if you disagree with my review feel free to hit the dislike button but please read the entire review first.\n\nFirst of all I did really enjoy the game, and I do concider myself a Gothic fan, I'm definitly not the biggest Gothic fan but I do think that the Gothic trilogy is the best RPG franchise ever. This game is without a doubt really great. the controlls are a bit akward but you can get used to it. the storyline is pretty danm good. you take the role of the nameless hero who is send to the prison colony with a letter for the magicians of the circle of fire. the colony is surrounded by a magic barrier, you can get in the colony but you cannot get out of it alive, so your goal is to escape the colony. I won't tell anymore than that about the story because I donnot want to spoil anything for those who still want to play it. besides the main story there are a lot of interesting side quests and there are a lot of interesting memorable characters.\n\nthe leveling system is a bit different from other RPG's like The Elder Scrolls. every time you level up you get 10 learning points/skill points which you can spend to improve your skills or learn new skills and you have to find a teacher to teach you instead of let's say increase your fighting skill by fighting hoards of enemies. I really love the leveling system for multiple reasons, it's something refreshing because you donnot see that in any other game and it gives you the option to train skills you're not using much at that moment because your skills with let's say two handed weapons isn't good enough yet to handle strong opponents. there's quite a lot of variety in skills and it will be difficult selecting the skills that work best for you, like should you train hunting skills so you could obtain trophies from dead animals, or alchemy to create your own potions or should you just train your fighting skills/strength/dex and so on, every skill is usefull in it's own way.\n\nthe world is also interesting. there are three camps, the old camp which was the first camp, the new camp which consists of people who disagreed with the old camp and there's the sect camp which consists of people who pray to the sleeper, a giant beast who will free them from the prison colony once it wakes up according to their "religion". besides the 3 camps there are a lot of different sites you can visit, and what i really like about gothic is taht some areas are filled with creatures you donnot want to meet if you're a low level which makes it even more rewarding if you're finally strong enough to search for loot in that area.\n\nIf you're a new player the combat system will be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, well the controlls in general will probably be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ but it won't take long before you master it. I think the combat system is really interesting as you use three buttons to fight and one to block and timing is key in performing combo's so mashing the W button won't do you any good.\n\neven though I really love the game this game isn't all good and I have to be realistic about it. this game does have some major problems. the game crashes from time to time, i'm pretty sure it's a compatibility problem as i donnot remember this happening on windows XP. the lockon is buggy as it won't follow your enemy when he's rotating around you from time to time which makes an already difficult game unnecessary difficult and sometimes your lockon remains locked on a single area or target even when it dies making it impossible to turn towards other enemies, sometimes your melee weapons won't do any damage for a longer period of time during combat, you could literaly keep hitting your enemy for minutes without them losing any health. and last but certainly not least if you close the gate to the old mine in the first chapter you won't be able to open it again in the second chapter because the lever (or whatever it's called) is bugged making it impossible to enter the old mine and therefor making it impossible to progress unless you cheat.\n\nI really love this game, I really do and I definitly want to give it an 9/10 but the game can be really frustrating because of these bugs making some situations feel unfair because mainly the combat fails you at that specific time, and I hate to say it because I was able to look past these bugs because i was dedicated to finish this awesome game but most new players won't so I have to give this game, because of it's problems, a 6/10","December 9, 2013","true","34.2"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","35","50","0","4"

It's brutal , unforgiving and controls are hard to figure it out (kinda bad but  they fixed it in Gothic II )  It's really easy to say "this game is not worth my time , we are in 2016 what is this garbage man really " well actually I said that too (about 7 -8 years ago) however this game worth your time and money.\nThis game is difficult ! I mean you will probably blame the game %90 of the time , like monsters are overpowered , controls are bad , you can't even do any damage to some strong opponents.You don't even have quest marks! You need to learn how to use map. You will get lost most of the time . Ohh well we can talk about those situations another time , no need to scare people from the beginning right?  First you will walk with Diego everything is fine but wait some bullies are trying to take your money by offering protection , how hardcore those guyz can be ,    right ?  "Come and get it"  but damn , they will beat you up so bad you will probably cry. You are just a simple messenger ! You are not fighter , paladin or mage. They are not gonna respect you , they are not going to let you sneak upon them and steal stuff and they will beat you everytime they can because they are NPC's of this world and this is their world. YOU ARE NOTHING , you are just a prisoner who needs to deliver a message. This thing is the reason why this game is so beautiful and awesome . LEGENDARY NAMELESS HERO will learn how to fight , how to use magic he will make some friends , improve his talents , join a faction (Old camp , New camp , Swamp boyz) , smoke weed etc.( You can smoke weed anytime and anywhere you want (BLAZE IT!)). There are 3 faction / camps you can join one of them. Every one of them have different quest-lines and they are changing the story a little bit. Thanks to Kai Rosenkranz soundtracks are awesome and improving atmosphere. I don't want to say anything about story just play it.\n\n-Story 9/10\n-Gameplay 7/10\n-Atmosphere-Soundtrack 10/10\n-Overall 9.6/10.\n\nRecommended !

Yes the controls, graphics/acting is kinda eh but this game is great. The storyline is good even though the acting is kinda eh at times. Gothic 2 picks it up and makes it grand.\n\nRegardless, I am writing this review because I think people should play it, it's a good 7/10 for it's time period which I played when it came out. NOW, for those who are putting up negative reviews cause the game doesn't work.\n\nGo to STEAMAPPS/COMMON/GOTHIC/SYSTEM/Gothic.exe(It should be the G icon). Right click it, go to properties, compatibility mode, then put it to Windows XP SP3. Click apply, and then launch the game through steam. It might crash when quitting the game but who cares about that. The game works without any silly fan patches and etc.","December 29, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I had done so when it was released.\n\nFor the new guys, Gothic was the first RPG that introduce:\n1.	Open world\n2.	Full speech dialogue - the death of text conversations\n3.	Classless character\nAnd also revolutionary features like:\n1.	Gamepad control\n2.	Nonlinear story progress\n3.	… and many more\n\nBack to its age, it was a diamond. From every aspect. Even graphics - Piranha used revolutionary techniques like blinding on longer distances.\n\nUnless you want top today's graphics or arcade combat, I suggest with no second thought.\n\nBelow are some gameplay elements you may wonder about:\n\nNo, there are not 1234456654 possible random weapons and armor to accompany you on your every level.\n\nYou get experience, which is points to use on a trainer to learn something or improve an existing knowledge. Besides the level based learning points cap, all choices are free.\n\nWhen you lay on hands on a decent weapon and armor, then you will really feel what it is like. A good simple sword will deal real damage and armor will really protect you.\n\nNo, you cannot block a wolf's attack. Or other animal. But you can block a weapon attack if you time your block properly regardless who your opponent is. Still you cannot take on strong opponents that most likely wear armor that your weapon cannot really penetrate.\n\nYou start as an errant boy, become hunter/archer/thief, then fighter, then mage. By story you become a mage but you may keep dispatching enemies via melee. But magic is magic here - you really hit hard with spell casting.\nHardcore players may stick to a class but there are still learning points for secondary alternatives. Even if you become a top mage you certainly have miscellaneous other skills like acrobatics or skin animals or been expert at least on one melee style or range combat.\n\nAnd some tips:\n1.	Gothic is very hard, and especially at the beginning, deadly hard. Be patient and if you don’t like dying, treat is more as a RPG simulator than game, it is deadly realistic. Dark souls is arcade compared to Gothic\n2.	You can play with mouse and keyboard, keyboard only or joy pad. Familiarize with controls. Make sure you ‘have it’.\n3.	Action and forward is action. Like pick up, open chest or door, talk to someone or strike melee or range or spell. Melee also has moves for action and left or right and block for action and back. Locks are picked by action and left or right at a predefined sequence. If you fail the sequence, your tool will probably break and you need to start over.\n4.	Exhaust dialogs. Save before. Sometimes you better not say something yet. Few times you get into deadly trouble if you lie to someone who you shouldn’t for example.\n5.	Explore everything at the vicinity which is free or monsters there are manageable.\n6.	Monsters you can kill – it is important to know what you can handle each time. All monsters with the same name are the same. If you can kill a wolf, you can kill all wolfs. One after another of course.\n7.	To kill 2 or 3 or more monsters at the same combat you must either be very superior at armor (not damaging you or damaging like 5% max per hit) or a combat genius or both.\n8.	Use a bow to scan ahead for enemies. If you don’t have be careful until you do.\n9.	Starting monsters are youngsters of the kind. Don’t get full by graphics alone – same monster is adult later on and much more difficult. Read the name – always.\n10.	If you don’t like dying to find out if you can manage an enemy, the only safe option is bows because you cannot escape melee easily and strong monster may kill you with 3, 2 or just 1 hit. With a bow you can safely get an idea and run if the idea was not good!\n11.	Pick up everything. There is no inventory space or weight or other limit.\n12.	Ore is the game currency.\n13.	When trading, use items as payment by priority and not ore.\n14.	Also, if you can give items to get the traders ore, do it.\n15.	There are cases where you need ore to buy, armors mostly.\n16.	Try to keep few items of each kind at least until you enter a camp. That’s for food and miscellaneous. There are some quest you can finish instantly that way.\n17.	Complete what quest you can complete and kill what you can kill. Gaining levels will help you increase health and get learning points. Learning points will help you deal more damage.\n18.	If you go melee you need strength. +1 strength is +1 damage. Very useful because you can hardly get a better weapon just because you level up. Loot is also rare from that aspect. You will find weapons but worse than the one you have that you probably bought. Skill with one or two handed weapons helps in combat but increase damage only because of higher chance to do critical hits. So it is strength first, weapon skill afterwards. Chance to hit is full manual, if you check distance and timing your blow correctly you hit, else you miss. So it is all about your combat skill, then character strength and weapon, then weapon skill.\n19.	For ranged combat you need dexterity and bow or crossbow skill. Dexterity increase damage but not at the rate strength increase melee damage. Bow or crossbow skill however not only increase critical hits but chance to hit. The shorter the enemy is, the less it moves and the higher the ranged weapon skill, the higher the chance to hit. So plan is dexterity required to wield the best ranged weapon available, top skill possible. Please note that there is extra resource cost – arrows and bolts are not to be found at sufficient quantities and you will need to restock.\n20.	For defense now, you can only buy armor. It is not a matter of cash alone however. You need to advance your status by joining a camp and raise into the hierarchy to buy better armor. Baan a member of a guild now, the level counts as a secondary filter for having access to better armor.\n21.	Entering magic, you may start with the brotherhood and gain access pretty fast but limit to circle 4 from them, or wait to go with fire or water mages at old or new camp and go up to circle 5. Not sure what happens when the story drives you to the old camp and you may join the water mages. Again not sure about Xardas who only teaches circle 6, but I guess you can reach circle 6.\n22.	If you plan to be a mage don’t bother save all learning points. You better focus on gaining levels instead. But focus to a single other killing method, like melee with 1h or 2h or bows or crossbows. Save learning points, but not all. Learn what you see fit.\n23.	Learning to take furs and trophies early on is very rewarding. At some point cash is useless but learning this will bring that even closer. Combined with stealing from chest, especially from the inner building at the old camp, will solve your finance limit problem for the rest of the game.\n24.	Don’t kill humans unless they are attacking you. Early on you can’t kill anyone anyway, later on you don’t have to and at the late part of the game you have to kill some folks but it is obvious.\n25.	You can talk to anyone, but only people with a name have an active role on quests.\n26.	Try to solve all quests possible, some will eventually fail because you solve others.\n27.	A quest may turn difficult, try an easier one.\n28.	On journal, except quests, you can find info about traders and teachers.\n29.	There is no map. You can buy one however. Still memorization of the world is necessary, more or less.\n30.	Be careful when climbing and double careful when going down.\n31.	Except from area exploring and quests especially early on, don’t try to exploit all in the game, do all correct and in the correct order. The game is very rewarding and fair give back for the casual, smart and careful player. There are many secrets and details. Try to satisfy all you may end unhappy and overwhelmed.\n32.	Experiment a lot. With scrolls, combat strategies, people, other consumables, heights and anything you think of. There are plenty surprises for the smart player.\n","August 7, 2014","true","84.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The story's surprisingly well-done, the gameplay's (extremely) challenging and rewarding, and it provides a level of immersion that had previously been unrivaled in RPG's similar to it. There's one massive problem with it that really makes it hard to enjoy however: the controls. It quite simply has the most idiotically awful control scheme I've ever seen in my entire history with RPG's. This ends up making the game far more difficult than it really is, because the player has to adapt to a system that's designed specifically to cripple them. Still, it's worth looking at, especially for fans of the later games in the series who never got to play the original.","October 25, 2011","true","1.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/recommended/65540/","morgannin09","Morgannin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morgannin09/","237 products in account","Valve really screwed up on pricing this, given its age and the fact that Gothic II, with the add-on, as well as Gothic 3 and the first Risen, are all half the price of this one. It makes no sense, but it's due to the fact that Gothic has not been available for sale on Steam until very recently.\n\nAnyway, into the actual review: This is the game that really defined and revolutionized the Western RPG. It gives you a delicately hand-crafted world filled with dangerous enemies and characters with extremely varied motives, who follow a daily schedule. And it plops you right into the middle of it, with little more than the shirt on your back. Go ahead, try and take down the first enemy you come across; you'll probably get pummeled a few times until you learn how to fight.\n\nSo there you run into the first justified complaint: The controls. While it was an ambitious, complex control scheme, it simply failed to be utilized correctly, due to its general clunkiness and unresponsiveness. However, if you get used to it, you can endure the awkward use of mouse-and-keyboard interface to really enjoy the depth of this game.\n\nThe setting is truly unique as far as games go. Instead of a world full of peasants, paladins, mages and monarchs, you are dropped into a prison colony which has been entirely usurped by the convicts themselves. Nearly every character you meet is a criminal, to a greater or lesser extent. It becomes a point of stress as you delicately choose your words and who to interact with to ensure you don't run into a twitchy cutthroat or crafty thief. Thankfully, the determined adventurer will find enough NPC's who guide you through this troubled world safely.\n\nThe three factions in the game give a lot of depth to the opening chapter. You can explore three unique settlements: the Old Camp, occupied by a rigid hierarchy of convicts who adorn themselves as agents and soldiers, and answer to the tyrannical Gomez; the New Camp, a ragtag group of rouges and mercenaries, who live in careful harmony, and who answer only to their chosen leaders; and the Swamp Camp, or the Brotherhood, a group of fanatical monks and novices who believe they have found the path to salvation in a mysterious diety known as the Sleeper.\n\nOnce you're past the first chapter and have chosen your faction, the game gets increasingly linear, perhaps to its detriment, but the story escalates and becomes exciting enough that you may be able to ignore the fact that you're given only one path. As you continue to develop your character, you may open paths to magic, giving you a powerful arsenal of spells to rain hell and become the colony's ultimate powerhouse.\n\nSo I've really talked up this game, but now the question is: is it worth the price? Well, if you're going to play Gothic II or 3, I definitely recommend taking the time to play the first one, to help you really understand the world and conflict, as well as learn where the characters you encounter repeatedly in the sequels have come from. Of course, I've already stated that this game should not be priced twice as high as the next two games in the series, so I wouldn't hold it against you to wishlist the game and wait for it to go on sale. But at $20, it's still worthwhile for a classic RPG that set the standards that developers such as Bethesda and CD Projekt made sure to abide by.","October 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

While I love this game so much I'd marry it, it's also broken in so many ways. I had to install some (fan) patches to actually get it to run sanely on Win 7, and thankfully I even could restore In Extremo's little scene in the second chapter.\nYet so many things are kaput - either due to the original code, or introduced later thanks to new hardware - that it's hard to tell new people "play it, it's cool". You always had to explain five pages of things to a newbie (e.g., don't walk into a forest just like that - the controls are easy you just have to get used to them - do most quests before deciding for a camp - etc. pp.), but now you have to add ten pages of technical issues one might encounter.\n\nClimbing on higher ledges didn't work anymore (for me at least), which means I had to cheat my way up some hills. Sometimes a dialog with an NPC breaks completely and you have to kill the game's process. (Experienced this a lot of Lester and Xardas.) A lot of enemy react strangely now; I blame the patch which removed the 30fps restriction. Collision became more awkward, sometimes the player hangs forever on a slope, so you have to reload. And there is absolutely no working fix for the vanishing inventory items.\n\nMy 13th playthrough probably is my last one because of these issues. I still do a "recommendation", because nostalgia.","May 2","true","24.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I couldn't beat it back then and after many years I bought it again to fulfill this part of my childhood. It was quiet different than I remembered, to be honest.\n\nI had some complications on getting this game to start, as it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game. A short problem, as there are many solutions when you google it.\nA bit annoyed but excited I started the game and met the first enemy: the controls! I was so confused that I had to switch back to google and get some explanation. But I don't consider this as a bad point, because the controls may be hard to learn, but easy to master. After an hour of active gameplay it already felt very natural to me and picking up items wasn't difficult anymore.\nThere are some possibilities to build your character. You can pump your guy to a musclular sausage and focus on strengh, or pay attention to dexterity and use a bow instead. You don't have to stick to one stat though and combine! Magic is also an option and you can spend your skillpoints on max. mana or use better spells (which you can't learn, but buy them as runes).\nI've tried everything: Swordfighter, Archer and Mage, and I can tell that the battlesystem in Gothic 1 is terrible and great at the same time. For attacks you focus on one enemy with holding your click. With ranged attacks, such as arrows and spells, you can only hit the actionkey and let the focus aim. There's practically no skill needed and only stats count. Swordfighting on the other hand is a bit different. You keep your focus on one enemy and hit one of the movementkeys for attacks. What I absolutely like is that it really feels like you use the momentum of your weapon. You can use some little combos and it's satisfying when you hit your target.\nBut what destroys the satisfaction is that sometimes the enemy won't take damage from hits. As a high level fighter it is possible to brutally let your rage go on a lizard for a minute even though you'd one-hit that thing, just because it doesn't take damage for some reason. I don't know if I just overlook something but it's an issue that's not only ruining the fun for me. It gets really frustrating when you face a horde of enemies and while you beat up one beast for nothing, the rest of the crew chews you for breakfast.\nBut besides the battlesystem, Gothic gives a good first impression when it comes to atmophere. You start with empty pockets and the weakest stats possible. Even the easiest creatures are dangerous and you pick up everything you can, even unuseful garbage. Being on the lowest part of the foodchain, you try to gain some experience to have at least a chance to survive in a fight and you have nothing more than a rusty axe. Without armor it doesn't take much to fall unconcious. So what do you do? You increase your strengh, surprise someone with better weapons with some kisses from your axe and drain his inventory empty. After that, you knock someone else out who has a better weapon whan you and so on and so on... You climb from the bottom to the top and when you joined one of the three camps and get better armor, you can fight like a real man!\nBut there's an enemy you can't fight with weapons... We call them bugs, and they are present in Gothic! Jammed winches are famous here and you should be happy when a gate opens on action! I counted! In my playthrough I had to pass 6 gates which you have to open via winch and 2 'were jammed' for unexplainable reasons. It's a common thing in Gothic 1 and the forums are full of this problems. The game would be unbeatable when you're stuck in that way, but luckily they included cheats in form of "Marvin-Mode" which lets you teleport to certain waypoints. Probably this Marvin-Mode was made for such situations, but it's annoying anyway when you have to tap out and open up the webbrowser. Oh, and the game doesn't like it when it doesn't have your full attention. You have a 50:50 chance for a crash after tapping out. But even mid-game crashes happen, so save your game every 5 minutes! In my lategame I encountered a crash because a soundfile was absent. It's awfully frustrating and a big minus for the game.\nAn aspect I enjoyed in Gothic was the simplicity. The HUD consists of only a healthbar and sometimes your mana. There's no questionmarker, read/listen what your NPC has to say, damnit! No minimap in the corner or experiencebar. No textfield which constantly tells you obvious things like "You obtained a Rusty Sword (1)!" and the hotbar for weapons and spells is also hidden. Only the things that are needed right now is on the screen and you have your whole screen to look around the world. Normally you don't have more than 3 quests and because there's no questmarker to hold your hand, you have to think a little bit. I only got stuck because of bugs and I never had the urge to put myself into shame and dig up a walkthrough.\n\nThose crashes, bugs, strange battlesystem and sometimes stupid AI give me a bad view of this game, but it also has a lot of enjoyable things! If I could, I would put Gothic right inbetween good and evil, but because I can't do that I have to choose either "Thumps Up" or "Thumbs Down". And hey, I played many hours, so I had to be somehow entertained. Give this old piece of art a chance!","July 10, 2014","true","31.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It was made back in 2001, and you'd better be prepared to jump through some hoops to get this thing working. I ran this game under 8-bit color mode with Windows XP Service Pack 3 as the Administrator, and even then I couldn't get the opening cutscene to play (the other cutscenes worked fine, though). I can't guarantee that you'll need to do as much as I did, nor can I guarantee that you'll need to do only what I did. Keep that in mind when looking at this game.\n\nStory:\n\nPeople don't play this genre for the story too often, but it's still there, and still worth mentioning. You play as the Nameless Hero (yes, that's his title), sent to The Colony, a magical island prison, to deliver a letter to the Magicians of Fire. You'll end up joining one of the prison's three camps, the Old Camp, the New Camp, or the Sect Camp, in the process. To say much else would be to delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just say that the story is a lot better than would be expected, but it's still no Dragon Age.\n\nGraphics:\n\nGraphics have come a long way since 2001, and Gothic is nothing if not proof of that. The game looks, to put it frankly, terrible. Models are blocky, the textures are blurry, characters look like they were barfed out of a Dreamcast, forests in the distance are replaced with a really crappy-looking forest picture...thing, and so on. I didn't have much of a problem with it, to be honest, but others most certainly might.\n\nVoices: Terrible, but laughably so. That's really all that can be said about this one.\n\nCombat: Normally, when you start off in an RPG you can swing a sword with ease, but the problem is that said sword is made of dirt and you do no damage. So, you buy an iron sword, put some points into strength, and start movin' on up in the world. In Gothic, however, The Nameless Hero starts off swinging his weapon so clumsily he might as well be on resident drug Swampweed. You overcome this by paying trainers to teach you how to more proficiently use items, but doing so means you're not putting points into Strength. This creates an interesting tossup; is it worth doing more damage if your character can't swing the sword at all? Is it good to flashily swing and spin your weapon if you do so little damage?\n\nCombat is simple, but effective. Block when the enemy attacks, attack when possible. However, the majority of enemies will kick your ♥♥♥ so hard it'll fly off to the Orc Lands until you level up a ton. It can be annoying, sure, but when you finally take that beast down you'll feel fantastic.\n\nTechnicality: Oh god. This game has some horrific bugs. It occasionally crashed on me. Oh well, I saved a ton for reasons mentioned above. I can't climb certain ladders due to the geometry of the map. Oh well, there are ways around those ladders. The game repeatedly crashes in a certain late-game area unless you hack the game, turn off the sound, keep playing for about thirty seconds, hack the game again, and turn the sound back on.\n\n...\n\nConclusion:\n\nDid I sound like I hated this game? I don't. I actually quite like it. The thrill of powering up and taking on tougher foes can't be easily matched. The story is surprisingly pretty decent and I cared to see the end of it. The bugs were awful, the graphics were painful, and the compatibility was hard to get around, but despite all that, I can't help but wholeheartedly give this game a great thumbs up. You won't get it 'till you try it, but once you take it for a spin, you can't put it down  until you see the end.","October 13, 2014","true","48.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/recommended/65540/","furrjacker","Furr Jacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/","262 products in account","Gothic is an open world Action-RPG. You play a nameless hero who gets thrown into a mining colony in which a few mages casted a magical barrier to seal everyone inside but end up trapping themselves in it as well and thus after a short talk with Diego, you set off to accomplish a mission inside the barrier and the story evolves into much more, and it's a pretty good story which I don’t want to spoil.\n\nThe game doesn't look all that amazing, it hasn't aged well but there's still a good bit of attention to detail at times. While the textures are pretty good, the modeling is a wee bit odd, animations are actually kind of funny and the voice acting is hilariously awful, with some dodgy translation from its original German release. Presentation wise, it's not all that great.\n\nBut the gameplay is what's really important and it's something quite special. You are thrown into this vast open world, and right off the bat you can notice how awful the control and the UI are, they take a lot of time getting used to but it's worth adapting to, trust me. One of the first major choices you are given is to join one of three camps: The Old Camp, the New Camp and the Swamp Camp. And that sort of, in a way, determines the difficulty in the beginning of the game, with the Old Camp probably being the easiest to join, but the choice is up to you and choices in this game matter, because it's a roleplaying game.\n\nThe combat system in the game takes a while to get used to but at the end of the day it’s a really good combat system, it’s very timed and skill based. At first I thought it was awful, but turns out I just didn’t understand it and I don’t want to go into too much depth because I’d like you to figure it out on your own like I did.\n\nThe game has a fairly moderate sized open world and it's yours to explore freely. It makes sense to have an open world in this game, everything feels connected in a way and as you travel the colony it all feels really natural. It also helps that the game heavily rewards exploration, just don't get discouraged if you stumble across a really powerful beast that'll kill you in one hit, that's just kind of how the game is, if you stumble across something like that, it just means you aren't ready yet, but if you see a place being guarded well, you bet your ♥♥♥ there's something good there, you just need to come back at the right time when you're ready to take on the enemy and you feel great once that finally happens, but I'll get to that in a moment.\n\nAfter playing for a bit, you've probably have noticed that this game is brutally difficult. When you start this game, you're absolutely worthless, the game pushes you on the ground and laughs at you and you have to deal with it, but the more you play, the more you level up and train, the better you get at the game, you eventually get to the point where you can laugh back at the game, and, I'm not lying here, being able to get to that point is one of the most satisfying feelings I've had in all of gaming. You really get this feeling of character progression with the protagonist and you feel like an absolute badass by the end of the game once you finally figure out how the combat works, you get used to the controls, you're powerful enough to take down the strongest of enemies and it all feels fantastic.\n\nSadly though, I have experienced some bugs in the game, some of which are game breaking, but after some research online, I managed to find a fix for the game breaking bug, so it's not completely hopeless.\n\nSo if you can handle a game without any handholding, a game with a brutally unforgiving difficulty and rarely some annoying bugs which may require some tinkering around to fix, you're in for probably one of the greatest RPGs of all time.\n\nAlso, I would highly suggest to get the game from GOG instead of Steam since the Steam version has quite a few problems. Also be sure to check PCGamingWiki for any issues you may be having.","May 10, 2015","true","59.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Also, it's pretty buggy on its own, so SAVE OFTEN. If you can get past these inconveniences, Gothic is actually good: being an open world RPG, you can go everywhere from the start (with the risk of glitching the game) and do/be lots of things. You create your class as you play (warrior, ranger and wizard, or a mix between them), just  don't mess the skillpoints placement from the start.\nEarly in the game the combat system may look clunky or even broken: that's because the main character sucks so hard he'll die with a sneeze, but once you'll get proper equipment and better training you'll be able to play genocide or destroyer of ecosystems. Few games gave me a sense of impotence at the start like Gothic, I liked this aspect of the game. The economy system, instead, was a big let down. It's really basic and easily exploitable.\nGood story and setting, easily replayable. You may want to install some mod/patch to restore contents cut from this version.\nOverall a really good game, if you got it with the Arcania bundle you got a really good deal.\n\nSAVE OFTEN.","June 16, 2013","true","101.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

One time was on Steam, but with mods, that's why the playtime counter didn't work. If you should encounter problems with starting the game I recommend you to visit worldofgothic.com, or search the game hub. I'm sure you will quickly find a solution for your problem. Furthermore I recommend you to take a look at the widescreen patch and the FPS fix.\n\nIt's a really well made (controls need getting used to it though) roleplaying game, where roleplaying is defined by actually playing a role, making decisions with eminent influence on the game's world and story, befriending and antagonizing with several NPCs and interacting with many little things, even if it is just to sit down on a bench, rather than having tons of loot and a skilltree.\nHowever, the lack of a skilltree doesn't mean that there is no character development. In fact, it will feel far more present than you are used to it by most of the games. Right at the beginning of the game you will discover a strict hierarchy in the game's world with you starting at the very bottom. Many players abandon this game, because the protagonist is so extremely weak in the beginning, but if you accept this fact and slowly but steady climb up the hierarchy you will encounter moments, which are extremely rewarding and make you realize that you made significant progress with your character. For example getting your first real armor.\nThe game offers you to join one of three factions, which provides quite a different gameplay, depending on your choice. This also guarantees at least a second playthrough, if not even a third one.\nThe world itself is lovely designed, surely the graphics are pretty much outdated by now, but just the arrangement of all the objects and the overall design is amazing. It's still one of my favourite worlds I would like to visit in real life.\n\nI know it can be quite rough to dive into an older game, if you have never taken a look at it before, but in this case it definitely deserves a chance and even a second one. Once you've overcome the quirky controls and prefer games, which aren't casualized you will love this game.","December 4, 2013","true","0.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This can become a bit absurd at times (for example, in instances where the difference between entering a new area by slaughtering a monster with little difficulty and beating it for hours with no damage is just one measly level up the world begins to seem considerably less "open"), but at least for the first chapter or so of this game (its most thrilling sections) this isn't as much of a problem just because basically everything will insta-kill you. So you have to make do with running and sneaking about. Once you choose a faction and the storylines kick in the game drags a bit (the Orc temple portions at the end are outright terrible grinds), but the early portions of the game are enough to earn it its status as a classic.

Soundtrack is lovely and again nostalgic which makes it just better.\nWhen you start game controls will feel weird as they are different then most stuff you see in modern games or games in general however i personally got used to them quite fast( approx 20 mins), they are not bad just different.\nCombat is awesome, when you start game you are nothing and you know nothing including how to properly use weapons, every time you learn how to improve for example Two Handed sword fight style the NPC who teaches you this skill will explain how to use it, yes you heard me he will explain not just you went learned and that's that, no. Learning techniques in this game is something which every RPG should have but pretty much none has.\nStory is fun as it is set at quite unique place, it is jail but like none i have seen in any videogame, to me at start story felt week but when i joined one of three factions i will receive tasks which i should do and certain things will happen and then to me personally story begins, it is interesting, fun & well written.Few things/problems this game has:\nAI, when you have some quest in which someone accompanies you, AI is real pain. For example Lester can stuck on top of Table etc. When npcs follow or they go to somewhere like Stone to his workplace he can stop and not move and if you want to reinforce ore armor you have to reload.\nThere are few occasional bugs and glitches but nothing really serious, only thing i personally had problem were 2 ladders on which when you get to top its pain to get on ground and most cases you fall down.\nThis game may not work on modern systems, in such cases you should go to Guides and follow one of them, Sadly i had this issue but thankfully there were guides with which help i could fix and play this game once again.( You just have to install 2 or 3 files which will make it run and/or turn off overlay)Amazing game with few minor flaws, recommended to every RPG fan, pure and simple classic and must play if you don't care about how game looks.\n10 out of 10, even tho game suffers from few bugs and glitches it is one of those game which i loose track of time completely and i love it.","May 15","true","23.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

THE ACTUAL GAME TOOK ME AROUND 60 HOURS.\n\nOk now that I got that out of the way. I must say this: I don't think there is another game like Gothic out there. This game has a great atmosphere, like none you have encountered. You are a prisioner in a penal colony full of criminals traped under a barrier. You may not realise it but the barrier works with the fact that this game is pretty small for an open world and it feels right to be this way. Everyone will try to bully you in a way of another (remember these are criminals not fairies) and it will be very hard to get on your feet (the game dosen't hold your hand, you will try to squeeze every little resource you can get ) but when you get  to be someone , that hero in shining armor getting revenge on those who bullied him (oh yeah the revenge is coming belive me ) you will feel like a god, more so because you got there by yourself and you know how hard was for you at the begining.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A GAME, THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nI don't have what pros to point, this game speaks for himself, you have to try it, however  I will point some cons as a warning for those who want the game:\n\n-It is kinda hard to get this beast to work, search for some patches online .\n\n- The graphics are very old, you might want to look for a DX11 mod.\n\n-The controls are clunky but you will get used to it fast. The combat is kinda unforgiving as you will have to time every hit in order to work. I quess it's part of the challange.\n\nTHAT'S IT GO AND PICK THIS GAME RIGHT NOW ! 10/10 (no joke and I am kinda harsh with games)","June 1","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The choices you make are up to you along the way to join what guild, quest and adventure to do.\nWhen I first bought gothic I got it because of a sale. Shortly after playing a few minutes I got addicted and before I know it they turned into hours.\nIf you don't like games that have bad grathics and controls I don't suggest you playing this. But if your like me who dosnt mind and enjoys Action RPG. I suggest you give this old game ago. You may get hooked like me.\n\nNote: There may be a part of the game that glitches and needs a patch than you can find on the gothic website.

It's huge in every sense of the word - long, hard (that's what she said :P) and has a level of freedom you wouldn't expect from a game more than ten years old. You can do pretty much everything you want - sleep, grill meat, forge weapons, make potions, skin animals and take their teeth  and even smoke pot and sell it for profit - and go anywhere you want in the game's world without a quest asking you to go there.\nThe sun rises and sets, NPC sleep, wake up, work, gather to talk with each other, etc. etc.\nBeing a RPG, the development of the character is always important in such a genre, and Gothic really shines in that department. You start as a poor weakling who gets beaten up by everyone and hardly can kick  harmless little creatures called meatbugs. Then, as you complete quests and defeat enemies, you gain XP which can be converted in strength, dexterity and mana points. You go all the way to a badass warrior, a lethal ranger or a supreme mage - you chose how you want to play it.\nAs for the bad parts, I just can think of one: the game is VERY buggy, and that can totally ruin your game experience if you don't know how to avoid it.\n\nA few important considerations about the game if you want to play and enjoy it:\n\n- Steam doesn't provide a game manual for Gothic, and that truly sucks.  If there are some games which you can start playing without reading the manual first - most modern games carry in-game tutorials - this is NOT one of them. The controls are a bit akward and if you don't read about them first I guarantee you won't be able to play the game at all. Just visit the Steam community page and you'll easily find a link to download the official manual in PDF.\n\n- You can and you SHOULD run the game on Windows 7. My desktop computer is a Pentium IV with Windows XP, and I thought It would be better choice for this game to avoid system compatibility issues. Well, that was a mistake. The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.\n\n- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.\n\n- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.\n\n- Go to a place like worldofgothic.com and download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.\n\n- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there. Play this game for the RPG experience and the story, and you will enjoy it.\n\n","January 1, 2014","true","69.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Despite the clunky controls, blocky graphics and absolutely TERRIBLE voice acting there's something about this game that keeps me coming back for more at least once a year. This game has massive replayablity as well. It's not flawless though. It starts off great with tons of things to do, but after you join one of the three camps the story gets a bit linear. The mage path was kind of disappointing as there were no mage exclusive quests or anything. Come to think of it, there are almost no guild exclusive quests neither. Good thing Gothic 2 fixes most of these problems. One thing that is cool about this game is that you get absolutely WRECKED by any higher level monsters in the beginning. Much like any other RPG you will get stronger as you level up and you will be able to fight and kill higher level creatures. But the thing about this game is that you never stop getting stronger and you become very overpowered towards the end of the game until you can kill practically ANYTHING with a single hit (provided you leveled your character effectively). There is nothing sweeter that beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of the guy who bullied you in the beginning of the game and frorced you to pay protection money. You do however become overpowered a bit too early in this game, so the final chapters seem a bit grindy. Again, Gothic 2 fixes this. I strongly recommend you play Gothic 2 first just to get into the story, and If you like it, then play Gothic 1. I think someone new to the Gothic series would have a hard time seeing past the flaws that this game has unless they played Gothic 2 first which is a much more polished game. There are also some game breaking technical problems in this game if you playing on anything newer than Windows XP. For example, I kept running into the well known "orc axe" bug which crashes you to desktop. This bug would have prevented me from finishing the game had I not downloaded a community made fix for this particular bug. There are community made fixes for most of the problems but you have to be pretty good at finding them. Gothic is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get running properly, but the satisfaction that you get from the game (especially on your first playthrough) is worth it. Your first playthrough should take about 40-50 hours if you play like a real man, not like a little walkthrough reading girl. ;)","July 4, 2015","true","31.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To get this game to work on Steam I had to run community patches that ended up playing the game's .exe file outside of Steam so it seems to not have recorded my play time. I beat the game in about 30 hours, which is similar to my first playthrough years ago.\n\nGothic is tough to get used to. You really have to get past the archaic control design to see the beauty of this RPG, but to anyone who loves open world RPGs that favor exploration, I urge you to get this series of games. You will be turned off by the control design, you will be turned off by the fact you have to do a multi step fan patch on a German website that feels overly complicated. Just do it. Then figure the game. Once you have it running, give yourself 90 minutes behind the barrier, and I bet you will come back for more.\n\nThis game's world captures your imagination as you explore it. You venture off the road in the wrong direction and you die. You learn to save and you learn very quickly which ways to go. Leveling up means something. Quests mean something. Joining a group means something.\n\nGet this game!

This game is totally awesome but can be pretty complicated at times, This is the game that will make you want to shank your eyes out after a lengthy encounter with a mole rat, If you want to use your mind and totally escape from the hell that is horrible game industry. The story is amazing and is much better than the average casual RPGs such as Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sync87/recommended/65540/","sync87","All ˅ Nothing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sync87/","268 products in account","Gothic is an open world action RPG published in 2001.\nYou're character is basicly part of a big outdoor prison, so the atmosphere is grim and the characters displayed are mostly malicious tough guys.\n\nThe acting and dialogue of these people in general is very comprehensible which helps the immersion a lot. There are no white knights here. And you're characters isn't either. The very intrudging atmosphere is also delivered by the fact that almost every being in this game has his own unique daily activity routine. Talking, sleeping, hunting, smoking and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThough the controls seem very clunky at first one gets used to it quite quickly. The combat is very fast and much about landing your hits in the right time. It's skill demanding and can get quite frustrating if you're running into an enemy which is far too strong for your level. But because of the game's open nature you don't necessarily have to face those enemies at that time.\n\nConclusion: Once you get along with the dated graphics and odd keyboard controls it's a very enjoyable experience.","December 10, 2013","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steedofsteel/recommended/65540/","steedofsteel","Nazey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steedofsteel/","36 products in account","You have to either be looking at this game through rose tinted nostalgia, or be autistic to enjoy Gothic 1.\n\nThe game's controls are archiac and awkward.  A lot of people say "you get used to them" and sure, you do, but I could also get used to my uncle fingering my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ every night as a child.  That doesn't mean it's pleasant.  And it's not just the controls, it's the combat gameplay and design of the game.\n\nGothic 1 is difficult for all the wrong reasons; the AI cheats.  As soon as your attack animation triggers, like, the milisecond it triggers, enemies will dodge your attacks.  Every creature from molerats to wolves seem to have gone through a lot of combat training because they all dodge in perfect synchronization.  Blocking rarely works, for example, when I tried to block a lizard my animation would instantly stop working as the lizard charged for no apparent reason.\n\nThere is no key to switch the target you are locked on to, you can only look at what you want to attack with your mouse camera, which means you have to pray you can some how keep the enemy you want to fight locked onto.  Praying wont save you if you fight multiple opponents though, which as fun to play as it is to watch as a bunch of creatures dance awkwardly around each other.  And you better bet every living creature in this game travels in huge packs.\n\nBut the AI isn't "smart", you can just jump on a piece of terrain and glitch all of them out as they try to grind the boulder you are standing on to dust by rapidly smearing their face against it.  Cheesing this way got me through some difficult encounters, but it's boring and the fact that I have to abuse glitchy AI should tell you a little bit about how much fun the combat is.\n\nQuests are locked behind a level gate, and while you get some XP off of quests you will need to grind your experience off of monsters.  As a low level character, this is stupidly difficult for several reasons.  First of all nothing ever tells you what combat skills are good, or the fact that you need to heavily invest in one combat skill and nothing else (there are even things to bait noobs like learning how to skin an animal, which costs the same skill points you'd use to train your combat skills).\n\nThis game came out in a day and age where you had to actually read the game manual to know how to do anything, because the game literally tells you NOTHING about essential controls.  Not even checking the settings menu will show you essential key combinations you need to know.  This isn't "challenging", or an "RPG that doesn't hold your hand!", this is forcing me to google ♥♥♥♥ because the designers made an unintuitive control scheme and didn't include any indications in game.\n\nThe english voice acting is totally misplaced for most characters, it sounds like they just got random people to do the voices.  It's a german game so it's forgivable, but when the leader of a religious cult sounds like a backwater american hick I can't help but laugh.\n\nThe game crashes often.  I applied the community patch and the player patch and whatever, but the game still crashes often on Windows 7.\n\nThere is no quick save/quick load button.  A minor quip, but all of these little things add up.  You can't walk backwards, you just skip backwards like an idiot.  There is a LOT of going back and forth and back and forth and backtracking between the same areas, with no fast travel, for really tedious quests that have you talking to an NPC, running all the way back, talking to another NPC, running back... a lot of your time will be spent just bunny hopping all over the map.\n\nAll of this is a shame, because underneath all the grime is a gem of a classic RPG that could've been so much more.  There are some cool ideas here that show that, in some certain aspects at least, Gothic was ahead of the game when it came out. As it stands, I can see why this game is only really popular with a few people who are fond of it because they experienced it long ago or grew up with it or whatever; it's too rough around the edges and there are too many nuisances to justify the experience.

That's right, the first 10 hours are mindless boring fetch quests that don't advance the plot at all.\nControls are bad - like, unredeemably bad.  I shouldn't have to press CTRL to select a chest, UP to open it, CTRL+SHIFT+RIGHT to take all the contents, JUMP to exit the chest menu, then DOWN to close the chest and regain control of my character.  That should be AT MOST a 2-button operation.\nYou can only target one enemy at a time.\nYou can only damage the enemy you have targeted.  If you're surrounded by enemies swinging your longsword left and right, and the enemy you have targeted is out of reach, you don't damage anyone.  Even if your sword is clipping through the enemies.\nYou can't turn while blocking.  If you block and the enemy runs behind you, get ready to load a save.\nYou can't switch weapons while walking backward.  What a joke.\nThis game's idea of "challenge" is enemies that spam stun-locking spells that literally prevent you from doing anything.  I hope you like losing control of your character and watching him dance in place as an orc shamman keeps setting him on fire.\n\nThe story is decent at best, but I got so fed up with all the BS in this game that I started cheating halfway through, and played the last half with God-Mode on.  Even then, I played it all the way through to the end waiting to see what all the hysteria was about, but there's nothing there.  People played this when they were kids so they think it's a masterpiece.\n\nSpoiler alert, it's not.  This game is a complete waste of your time.\n\nDon't buy this.","October 25, 2015","false","71.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

Everytime I try to start a new game it crashes. Which is a shame because I hear this is a great RPG. So instead I'll give a review about the one part of the game I can use, the main menu.\nThe font is nice, really gives it that gothic feel that I assume it was going for. The options are simple, sound, video, game. The stuff you'd expect. From what I can see the control scheme seems odd, but you can rebind them to your liking. There is no mouse support for the main menu however, meaning you have to navigate with the arrow keys, which I don't like. All in all, this is a good main menu simulator; I just wish whoever was in charge of the steam version of this game cared enough the put the "video game" part in.","December 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","29","2","7","7","1"

While there are fixes available that can make it somewhat playable, I've been plagued with a large number of issues right out the get-go, biggest being the control scheme of the game; for reasons I cannot fathom, all of my actions are bound to my move keys, which means that I can't do anything without first pressing forward at the exact same time; which makes trying to be precise with things impossible.\n\nAt the moment all I can say is that the game is currently unplayable.  If you do happen to see this game in a bundle with Gothic 3 (how I managed to get it, along with II) and want to buy it for nostalgia purposes because you were part of the fanbase that gave this game a try in your childhood and liked it, don't bother.  While this is exaggerated I'm fairly sure that this game won't work on anything higher than Windows 98 without causing you problems...I would attempt to refund this (in fact I have) but I purchased this game long before the refund system.  Had I have known that this was an issue I wouldn't have purchased it.\n\nValve, seriously, warn us when you sell content like this; you did it with Fallout 3, I'm pretty sure you can do it for Gothic.  Unless you plan to somehow work with the devs in secret to try and get an update for this game (good luck with that) then there's really no reason why this needs to even be in your marketplace.  Please, do us a favor, let GoG handle the older games like this one; at least they try to make it playable for modern tech.","April 6","false","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

Lord knows the blood and sweat I invested in the grueling 21 hours I put into this game. With that out of the way, let us commence:\n\nI hate this game. I heard many a person say it was great, it was one of the best RPGs ever and that it rivaled Baldur's Gate, Morrowind and similar products. I decided to try it.\n\nFirst off, the controls are clunky and take some getting used to, due to the fact that this game was made with a "Mouses aren't needed!" mindset, so the intended way of play is with the keyboard only. Seems somewhat puzzling, but remember that the game is "old" and it isn't that hard to become accostumed with the keybinds (plus, you can use a control scheme that includes the mouse if you so desire). However, I was able to adjust and proceed.\n\nI won't speak of the graphics, because as I've said it's old so I won't judge that aspect. As far as the music goes, it's average. A mild soundtrack that didn't produce any awe inspiring moments in me or has any memorable tracks. It's just there.\n\nAnd now for the gameplay... Oh dear God, the gameplay, and more specifically the combat. Never have I experienced such a rage inducing, badly made, awkward combat. In case you're wondering, picture Morrowind's combat (or any modern TES game for that matter), but the weapon movements are handled in a horrendous rhythm game type move set. You have the left and right swings, the up command for combos and down command for blocking. Sounds simple, except that in practice, it's so poorly implemented and executed that it makes even one on one fights a daunting task (and don't even attempt to picture how fighting a group is done).\n\nAs for the story, I won't speak of it due to spoilers and the fact that I didn't finish the game (I reached about half of chapter 4, when you  must collect the ingredients for the Ulu-Mulu ). From what I played, it was a slow crawl that remained uninteresting, albeit with a few good moments. However, as I've stated before, I didn't finish the game so I can't discuss the whole experience or evaluate any denouements.\n\nI'll say it again: I tried to like this game. I seriously did. But in end, it was too much for me, I had to uninstall and move on. If you still wish to play the game, go ahead as you may enjoy it and find it entertaining. I just wanted to provide people with a warning, lest the same occur to them.","August 22, 2015","false","21.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

Also, it came out in 2001, so there was already kind of a set standard for accepted controls. Like "i" for inventory and stuff like that. This game says "♥♥♥♥ that, I'm gonna make every action a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do. Is there a mouse connected to your computer? ♥♥♥♥ that, I prefer Keyboard only." You know those games that set "c" for crouch instead of left control? Yeah, this game is worse than that.\n\nStory is good, environments are cool, and the exploration is what intrigued me for as long as at did. '\n\nHowever, this Steam port sucks. It's glitchy and it's just not stable on modern PCs.\n\nBack in the day, I loved this game. IMO it does not stand the test of time.\n\n5/10","July 6, 2015","false","6.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

For some reason the Devs thought it was a good ideal to make all interactions be a combination of holding the first mouse button and pressing one of the direction buttons. You may have forgiven it for something like that at the time of it's release (we didn't know better back then... sort of) but these days when there's no lack of open world RPGs it's just too much to ask to put up with it unless you're a die hard Gothic fan.\n\nSo that's my recommendation: Don't pick it up unless you're a die hard Gothic fan... in which case you'd own it already wouldn't you?","July 15, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Yes, I know it's been 13 years since this game was launched... but, I simply was not prepared enough for a disappointment like this. My problem with this game is not its graphics or visuals effects (I didn't came here looking for that) but the whole game mechanics... and I think that has nothing to do with the launching date.\n\nFor the past 8 hours I've been trying, really hard, to play this game and the only thing I feel is frustration. For what I can see, the story seems pretty decent and attractive, but the absurdly hard to play combat system and controls, along with the lack of any help to understand how to do the most basic of things (from grabing an object on the floor, to trading, read a map or equip weapons) just prevents me to get into the story.\n\nWhenever I try to accomplish a small mission, I get killed again and again by the most small and dumb creatures just because of the difficult combat mechanics: it's not about the keyboard (you can just easily change it in order to use WASD instead of the default keypad arrows setting) but the complex use of the keyboard to hit a target, and above all that: the inability of the character to keep the target centered while fighting.\n\nOnce I got somehow accustomed to this way to manage the keyboard, then I got into the world map: I've been running up and down the whole island trying to get to an specific point, but it seems impossible: I just can't remember the way I got to the point where my character it's supposed to be and now all possible roads appear to be full of really hard to kill beasts and enemies. Then, it's starting to get dark... and there's nothing you can do to put your character to sleep in the wilderness, so you just basically have to stand up there, waiting for the sunrise to come.\n\nI really don't understand how this game has so many high reviews. I respect the people that think that it's the best RPG they've ever played and frankly the story seems really nice. Don't hate me, I just can't get into it.\n\nOne last piece of advice: I'm running this game on a Windows7-64 machine. The only way I managed to even start the game without crashing, was changing the gothic.exe file to run in Windows XP compatibility mode... and even like that, I can't watch the opening videos (does has sound, but screen is black).","September 15, 2014","false","7.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Straight installation and trying to play, the game probably won't work for anyone. While not everyone will have to fight a tiger and climb a mountain to get the game running, I did. I spent more time fiddling with this game trying to get it to run, and crashing, than playing it, and when I got it running it was running at a consistent 10-20 fps.\n\nIf you know you actually want to buy this game and play it, go for the GoG version. GoG actually puts time into their releases of older games. I heard their version of Gothic 1 actually runs without having to do any outside BS.\n\nEither version you play, you're probably going to have some issues that come with playing an old game on a modern OS, but the Steam version kicks harder than the GoG version.","February 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","10","28","3","0"

WELP i guess i will start by saying that i am a fan of alot of old school games particularly RPGs but there have been a couple i have not played yet including this one so this seemed like a great purchase..........or so i thought.\n\nI have found myself enjoying a lot of RPGs that by today would be considered "outdated" or even "obsolete" by many people today the most notable being Morrowind (i mention Morrowing for a good reason which you will find out shortly) ........ ♥♥♥♥ i an even one of THOSE people that say it is  the best Elder Scrolls ...yes even compared to Skyrim (although i still enjoy it).\n\nSo when i saw the Gothic collection on sale and looked at the steam reviews being mostly positive  it seemed like a perfect fit and a great deal, i was genuinely excited ....... until i started playing.\n\nNow i am used to old games not really working with modern OS and computers so it did not really surprise me that it did not work right a way (although this DOES NOT EXCUSE steam for selling them as is).\nRegardless i looked in the forums and sure enough there was a friendly user giving instructions and links to mods that would fix all this and sure enough it did so all was well and i started the game.\nNow like most old games there is not a lot if any hand holding (which i prefer) so i had to figure out all the controls and mechanics...no problem....but here is where i learned of Gothic's .......uh....."unique" combat system.\n\nNow i am not going to sugar coat this..........the combat system is ATROCIOUS ......like just god awful. Now there will be people who defend this saying it is just different or it takes some getting used to...and while there is some truth.....it is mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, even some veterans admit it is bad. You can see what they were TRYING to do but......they failed...they failed spectacularly.\n\nI compare it to Morrowind's combat system as i feel it is the most fair comparison. Now while Morrowinds combat has it's flaws....there is no denying that it was mostly functional and a lot of the complaint against it was due to its DnD system as it hits (especially early on when you're weapon stat was ♥♥♥♥) would miss and felt unrealistic  as well as......well......admittedly kind of boring a lot of the time.\n\nGothic's combat ......sigh.........holy ♥♥♥♥ .....its just a ♥♥♥♥ing chore.\nWhile some of this is mitigated with training (from trainers) and experience with the system it is mostly just hitting left and right with some rhythm. EVEN WORSE however is drawing weapons/spells which is just ♥♥♥♥ing horrible with you and you're character spazzing out just to try and DRAW A GODDAM WEAPON if you so as much have any MORE THAN 2 WEAPONS.........and god help you if you want multiple spells.....better hope you're enemy just patiently waits while you're character flails his arms around like he's in the weirdest rave in existence (pro tip....they don't). i could go on but......i would actually prefer not to.\n\nNow lets get on to some RPG elements starting with what some might deem the most important-the story. Well i can't really say to much on this to me it was kinda "meh" to me, some may disagree but as it is very subjective i am not going to get too much into it maybe it has an AMAZING ending...i wouldn't know as i quit at chapter 5 (close to the games end mind you) from all the cumulative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of this game.\n\nMore importantly i would like to discuss one of the reasons this game is praised it's - open endedness ...or lack there of. SURE the game makes it SEEM like you can do anything and go anywhere but it is ARTIFICIAL AS ♥♥♥♥...let me explain.\nFirst thing you will notice is that EVERYTHING can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you......fine you think after all this is an old school RPG and i am lv 1 i will just grind a little and gear up till i can reasonably explore.....NOPE see the way this game's "open" world works is if you are not at the right lv and story progression (which is really the ONLY way to get better gear namely armor) you will die...simple as that and i don't mean it might be a fair fight if it is 1 on1 and you were pretty good at fighting you could possibly win....no i mean you get ♥♥♥♥♥ .....savagely from things that are maybe 1 tier higher then the game's equivalent of rats of which might still beat you're ♥♥♥.\nIt reminded me GREATLY of MMOS where you stumble into a high lv area only in the beginning this is LITERALLY EVERYWHERE BUT THE STARTING AREA.\nSo you think fine it will lighten up a bit.......and it does......about halfway into the game when you can do something else then story quests and EVEN THEN god help you if you want to go somewhere the game does not want you to go (namely future story areas these "MMO high lv areas".\nAnd that's when you realize ....you have discovered most of the map..what seemed pretty big in the beginning is actually quite small and what you have discovered is pretty barren and boring with some packs of mobs here and there (again very reminiscent of an MMO only there is no random quest you can stumble upon or interesting structure with few exceptions).\nIt is a very barren world where they only thing of ANY interest is the camps (starting areas/Hub/etc) and quest areas which you can only REALLY go to if you are at the right point in the story/quest...........................................how THE ♥♥♥♥ is this "open-ended".\nThe only good thing in choice/variety is the 3 camps which you can choose to join in the beginning which adds SOME choice and replay value but after that.....pretty much the same.\n\nI could go on with this game but i do not want to make this even longer than it already is. Overall this game is mostly a chore and i barely had any fun with it aside from some glitches and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I. So it just absolutely BAFFLES me how this is getting mostly positive reviews on Steam of which i can only attribute to nostalgia .\n\nLook i am sure this game was....."OK" at the time when it was new and unique. It has some interesting mechanics that COULD be good if it worked but..... they just ♥♥♥♥ing don't. I am sure it even introduced some new mechanics that would become standard but it has aged HORRIBLY and i can't imagine liking it even back then.For a good game in comparison i recommend Morrowind which blows this game out of the water (although that's not saying much).\n\nIn summary the only people that i can imagine liking this game is people that have played it before and have nostalgia for it. If you have never played this series THEN STAY THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY. Don't be fooled by these positive Steam reviews like i was. I used to think rather highly of them but i guess i learned my lesson.","May 10, 2015","false","96.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","2","11","2","1"

While both are in the same genre...they couldnt be more different. But Gothic 1 always stood ahead, just barely, (and so far) is still my frontrunner for favorite 3d rpg of all time.\n\nThe biggest flaw that will immediately ♥♥♥♥ off anyone born 1993 or later is the combat. Compared to what's seen today, Gothic's combat is borderline archaic. I played it with only keyboard. No mouse was needed. Essentially it's Quake 1-esque. I'm actually kinda chuckling to myself when I think about it and compare it. But having played, and beaten the game more than 5 times (and ALWAYS finding some new area or new hidden spot with a ring or sword I missed), I wouldnt change it.\n\nThe story is original. To me at least. Though perhaps I wouldnt be surprised if it was already done on a Syfy channel series honestly. Regardless...The world was one of the first to truly feel alive in a game. Though basic, characters in the game had actual routines throughout the day. Hearing npc's in the old camp chit chat while next to a fire during the black of night still feels like home to me. And I still laugh at the very blatant drug-related abuse at the Swamp camp.\n\nThe "Nameless hero" is likeable. His voice you hear all throughout the game isnt annoying...though not yout typical "badass" gruff character type of most of todays games...he's got a very Guybrush Threepwood likeability. Learning skills about hunting and what not is nice. And outfitting him with a new sword or heavy, fur adorned armor feels rewarding. Plus, if there's a chance...just a slight chance, a ledge looks reachable...try for it. Exploration is rewarded.\n\n...If you can get past the combat's...let's say..."antiquated uniqueness" and the dated graphics, Gothic 1 is very much worth the price of admission. It's hands down the best in the series that Piranha Bytes did, and I think it's due to the smaller world of the sequels. It doesnt try to stretch itself too thin unlike the others and thus, it has more life to it. Even though I did like 2 and 3, they never captured the essence and overall charm that 1 did. Still, I'm sad to see that PB still doesnt have the rights back to what should be theirs. Everything about the world/lore is their creation and that hand-holding mess of "Arcania" should never have the name "GOTHIC" above it.\n\nIf you like good story telling, decent voice acting, and a world filled with it's own unique charm, get Gothic 1. You wont be sorry.","December 5, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gothic 1 starts off with you being thrown into a prison colony and you'll have to decide which of the three factions causes suits you the best.\nThe game is fully voiced with some pretty goofy voice-acting quality at times.\nThe interface can be rather cumbersome but you can definitely get used to it. What might stick in your craw are the controls; movement often feels clumsy; combat is stiff but does require a bit of skill to time your attacking and blocking correctly. Get the rhythm right and you can take on some really tough customers and walk away with a kickass new weapon and a bunch of money.\n\nIf you're willing to put up with Gothic 1's quirks then you will be pleased as peach when you move on to Gothic II, which follows up the story immediately; it's also an excellent upgrade in all technical aspects. Better progression, bigger map, higher stakes, vastly better interface and control..\nCertainly something to look forward to.\njust watch your ♥♥♥ on that third one its a little special >.>\n\nGood luck on your Gothic adventures.","March 15, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I don't tend to replay heavily story oriented games unless they're really good, and I've replayed this one twice since 2001. The story is simple, focused, and immediate. Gothic doesn't have you spend hours reading tome upon tome of useless irrelevant lore trying to legitimize the fantasy world you've been thrown into. Instead the world and story unfold quest by quest through characters all relevant to you and your place in the story, in a setting and with an atmosphere that really draws you in and has you believe the sense of desperation the characters are supposedly experiencing. If you're looking for immersion, this game does it damn good. Music is some of my favorite from any western RPG and helps further with the immersion. Gothic is no drama, just a good believable RPG. 10/10","July 14, 2012","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had been hearing about it here and there from RPG fans, and I can see why it is considered a classic. After finally getting it to work (look up and download the Gothic 1/2 System Pack), the learning curve for the weird controls really messed me up for awhile, but while frustrated, I was at the same time intrigued with the atmosphere and other stuff being presented to ever think about quitting. Summing things up...\n\nPros:\n+ Open world with a strong explorative element\n+ No hand holding (learn as you go, and save a lot!)\n+ Cool dark fantasy feel\n+ Creative terrain and environment design with what resources the company made use of\n+ High level of freedom, although the lack of direction may end up confusing some\n+ The feeling of steadily growing from a scrawny weakling to the baddest dude around is great! Just make sure you commit to a certain stat path to avoid mediocrity\n\nNeutrals:\nVoice acting was... okay. Not the worst I've ever heard, and occasionally "bad" in a way that was more funny than annoying. Music was limited with atmospheric tracks, which is fine, but would have personally appreciated more background emphasis at important parts\n\nCons:\n- Because it's so old, it was kind of a pain getting things running to start\n- Controls are archaic to match the setting!\n- Most characters were generic and flat, with few as memorable as the protagonist (being fully voiced), Diego, Xardas, and whatever crew you spend the most time with\n- Would've been nice to see more of an ending resolution to when that freaking barrier came down. Also more consequences to having joined a certain camp\n- Final confrontations with key antagonists were kind of anticlimactic, and could be easily cheesed using the environment and summon scrolls. Nitpicking? Probably.\n\nOverall:\n8.5 out of 10\n\nDespite the oldness, frustrating combat, and occasionally flickering textures requiring a reboot to get rid of, Gothic is definitely worth at least one play through. Looking forward to playing the sequels (once I get them to work!)","September 17, 2015","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Correct me if I'm wrong, but an open world like that was a real innovation at the time this game was released. It was so much fun just to wander through the woods and meadows to explore the Gothic universe (and boy there was much to see).\n-The graphics, the style of the gear and the NPCs was just marvelous in my understanding (and for that time of course).\n-The quests and the storyline were very good and not to spoil anything:  there are many twists and surprises - the story wont let go of you. And there are many many sidequests, which are also fun to do - there wont be any boredom\n\nTo finish the report, I would recommend to play it in the original language, because of the flair (german).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/recommended/65540/","ryanrad3","RyanRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/","492 products in account","There is one RPG series that perfectly encapsulates the rags to power archetype. I have yet to see any other RPG perform it as well. Developed by the German based studio Piranha Bytes, the first of the game in the Gothic series was released in November 2001. I remember it still, back in 2002, I was browsing Amazon, hungering for an RPG when I stumbled upon this game and it's rave customer reviews. I was not disappointed in the slightest.\n\nGothic has you playing an unnamed convict that is about to be thrown into a prison-mining colony that is cut off from the outside world by a magical barrier that had backfired. While it is safe to enter the barrier, it is impossible for anything living to pass back through the barrier once inside. An uneasy agreement between the king and the convicts has resulted in an exchange of goods for the magical ore the convicts mine. Your character is plunged headlong into the situation when asked to contact the Mages trapped within the barrier.\n\nYour character has absolutely nothing at the start of his journey besides the clothes on his back. You must make your way through the prison colony, finding gear, gaining power, influence, and combat skills. The colony is a rough place mostly ran by former criminals and bandits, who mainly only respect strength of arms. As you progress, you will discover the colony is ran by three factions, one of which you must choose to side with. This decision determines what armor types, and combat training will be made available to you throughout the game.\n\nFor the year 2002, Gothic was a marvel. While Morrowind was impressive in it's scope; being released later that year. Gothic provided a large open world with the freedom of choice that not many RPGs in that era could emulate. Plus the difficulty of the game was extreme, if I got a penny for every-time I had to reload my game, I'd be rich! These were the days before the Souls series, when video games were starting to curve into the more trivial side of the difficult spectrum.\n\nThe best feeling about Gothic is the path of gradual power you gain throughout the game. When you first start, you'll be lucky enough if your puny self can defeat a mole rat. You'll wield a club as if it's a tree trunk; with both hands, flailing wildly and ineffectually. As you gain some combat training, your stance, and how well you wielded your chosen weapon type will improve. As you gain more combat experience you will become faster, and maneuver more smoothly into combos and parrying.\n\nIn a colony full of former convicts, muggings are something you'll see often. They won't kill you, but they sure will shake you down. If you refuse to pay up, they'll find other ways to get your hard earned ore. (The currency of the cut-off colony) This is where the Gothic games got the silly moniker of being a 'mugging simulator'. Once you become more powerful, you can do the same to other characters, gathering wealth and equipment on the backs of others you are able to defeat. Or maybe getting back what was taken from you way back, when you couldn't defend yourself. Pay back always feels so sweet.\n\nIf you become powerful enough, or skilled enough at the combat to take down a guard, you're really in business. Guards that you have previously beat up will remember you, and refuse to see you perform any crimes. They will even go as far as to turn away and exclaim that they saw nothing. Something about that simple sort of persistence really impressed me back then, and to this day still does. While the goal of mugging every character in the old camp isn't a story goal, it's a fun one to strive for in between odd jobs and quests.\n\nThe three factions could be differentiated by the designs and colors of their faction specific armors. Once you decide on, and join a faction, you will be presented with the armor set corresponding to that faction and your rank. As you gain more prestige within your chosen faction, you will get better and cooler looking armor. This creates a fun curve that combines the acquiring of armor and an evolving character design, along with the game's story, which is a beautiful combination for any RPG gamer.\n\nTo this day, every couple of years. I find myself playing through Gothic once again. To be terribly honest, the graphics have not held up that great. However, once I get back into the fantastic gameplay, I find myself hooked all over again. Working my way up to mugging those jerk-wad guards that always shake me down! This is always my ultimate goal when playing Gothic.\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","July 25, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place in a prison colony where you play as a nameless hero. You start off as a weak nothing, often getting mugged by stronger criminals. You can build up your character in various ways ranging from a weapon master, a marksman, or a wizard. Your main goal is to join one of the 3 camps in the game. Ranging from the crazy Sect Camp, a cult that believes their god will free them, the New Camp, filled with mercenaries and rogues who desire freedom, or the Old Camp, which wants to take advantage of their situation. Fight your way through giant ant monsters called Minecrawlers, orcs, demons and even golems and become the most powerful man in the colony!\n\n\n"SPOILER" If you want to be a hardcore mage, do not join the Sect Camp.

Gothic doesn't have you spend hours reading tome upon tome of useless irrelevant lore trying to legitimize the fantasy world you've been thrown into. Instead the world and story unfold quest by quest through characters all relevant to you and your place in the story, in a setting and with an atmosphere that really draws you in and has you believe the sense of desperation the characters are supposedly experiencing. If you're looking for immersion, this game does it damn good. Music is some of my favorite from any western RPG and helps further with the immersion.

For people who are younger than 20, you dont understand what its like to first experience a true day/night cycle, and to experience actualy A-Life. A game that lives and breaths with or without you. NPCs who go around and do their daily things and live their lives and remember you and your actions.\nThis was one of the first games to ever feature this.\n\nYou probably played Skyrim right? Well the settlements in Gothic are just like that, the people live their lives, they do their daily things, they go to bed at night, they might pick fights with out, and they remember your actions.\nThis was BIG back in 01 because no one else was doing it. NPCs around that time just stood there waiting to be talked to, or they may wander around in a room, thats about it, you would never see a NPC from one camp randomly decide to walk to another or patrol around the landscape or hunt.\n\nAnother thing that made this game so great was how gritty and mature it was. This isnt a childs game. This is a game in a world full of Convicts. Everyone hates you, and you have to survive tooth and nail. You start out as a true weakling with no training, and really have to work your way up. You cant even take on the weakest of NPCs at the beginning of the game, you may have to resort to stealing and attacking them at night just go scrape your living. You have no idea how to fight, you can barely hold up a sword, and one swing and you're on your ♥♥♥, and guess what... they dont kill you, they loot all your money (ore) and take your weapon, and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Yeah YOU yourself get LOOTED if you lose fights.\n\nAnd maybe you'll come back a few hours later when you're stronger, and take your revenge for that crude sword you worked so hard to get. It might not be very useful now, but its the principal of the thing, it was the best piece of equipment you could have ever owned at the time, and that ♥♥♥♥ stole it from you.\n\nSeriously, ground breaking game.","December 26, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/recommended/65540/","ryanrad3","RyanRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/","492 products in account","There is one RPG series that perfectly encapsulates the rags to power archetype. I have yet to see any other RPG perform it as well. Developed by the German based studio Piranha Bytes, the first of the game in the Gothic series was released in November 2001. I remember it still, back in 2002, I was browsing Amazon, hungering for an RPG when I stumbled upon this game and it's rave customer reviews. I was not disappointed in the slightest.\n\nGothic has you playing an unnamed convict that is about to be thrown into a prison-mining colony that is cut off from the outside world by a magical barrier that had backfired. While it is safe to enter the barrier, it is impossible for anything living to pass back through the barrier once inside. An uneasy agreement between the king and the convicts has resulted in an exchange of goods for the magical ore the convicts mine. Your character is plunged headlong into the situation when asked to contact the Mages trapped within the barrier.\n\nYour character has absolutely nothing at the start of his journey besides the clothes on his back. You must make your way through the prison colony, finding gear, gaining power, influence, and combat skills. The colony is a rough place mostly ran by former criminals and bandits, who mainly only respect strength of arms. As you progress, you will discover the colony is ran by three factions, one of which you must choose to side with. This decision determines what armor types, and combat training will be made available to you throughout the game.\n\nFor the year 2002, Gothic was a marvel. While Morrowind was impressive in it's scope; being released later that year. Gothic provided a large open world with the freedom of choice that not many RPGs in that era could emulate. Plus the difficulty of the game was extreme, if I got a penny for every-time I had to reload my game, I'd be rich! These were the days before the Souls series, when video games were starting to curve into the more trivial side of the difficult spectrum.\n\nThe best feeling about Gothic is the path of gradual power you gain throughout the game. When you first start, you'll be lucky enough if your puny self can defeat a mole rat. You'll wield a club as if it's a tree trunk; with both hands, flailing wildly and ineffectually. As you gain some combat training, your stance, and how well you wielded your chosen weapon type will improve. As you gain more combat experience you will become faster, and maneuver more smoothly into combos and parrying.\n\nIn a colony full of former convicts, muggings are something you'll see often. They won't kill you, but they sure will shake you down. If you refuse to pay up, they'll find other ways to get your hard earned ore. (The currency of the cut-off colony) This is where the Gothic games got the silly moniker of being a 'mugging simulator'. Once you become more powerful, you can do the same to other characters, gathering wealth and equipment on the backs of others you are able to defeat. Or maybe getting back what was taken from you way back, when you couldn't defend yourself. Pay back always feels so sweet.\n\nIf you become powerful enough, or skilled enough at the combat to take down a guard, you're really in business. Guards that you have previously beat up will remember you, and refuse to see you perform any crimes. They will even go as far as to turn away and exclaim that they saw nothing. Something about that simple sort of persistence really impressed me back then, and to this day still does. While the goal of mugging every character in the old camp isn't a story goal, it's a fun one to strive for in between odd jobs and quests.\n\nThe three factions could be differentiated by the designs and colors of their faction specific armors. Once you decide on, and join a faction, you will be presented with the armor set corresponding to that faction and your rank. As you gain more prestige within your chosen faction, you will get better and cooler looking armor. This creates a fun curve that combines the acquiring of armor and an evolving character design, along with the game's story, which is a beautiful combination for any RPG gamer.\n\nTo this day, every couple of years. I find myself playing through Gothic once again. To be terribly honest, the graphics have not held up that great. However, once I get back into the fantastic gameplay, I find myself hooked all over again. Working my way up to mugging those jerk-wad guards that always shake me down! This is always my ultimate goal when playing Gothic.\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","July 25, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An excellent told story where I as a player can choose my allegiance between three different factions full with memorable characters. It feels like your actions matters and has consequences, even though this may be imaginary at times. The game is full of action, but it's the exploration and interaction with the inhabitatns of the world that makes it such a great ride. The controls and combat is awkward at first, but after a couple of hours you're used to them and won't think about it anymore. As many before me have mentioned, this is a game that's challenging. You really have to be alert and careful in the beginning as all enemies are lethal, but as time goes by and you learn new abilities it gets quite easy in the end. For some this is off-turning, but for me it made the game even more exciting as danger was lurking around every corner and when the end game came you really felt mighty.

In-game.\n10/10.\n\nAlso the steam version of the game WILL NOT LAUNCH with Windows 10 (and prior releases if the reviews are to be trusted). Here's how to launch it correctly :\n\nFirst, start the game like you would do normally. Nothing will happen but Steam will say that the game is running. you'll have to go to the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+del, or to open it directly, ctrl+l.shift+escape), then go to details, then right click on GOTHIC.EXE, then click on "analyze wait chain", then close whatever program's interfering.\n\nThen you'll have to download the 1.08k patch, then the player kit for Gothic 1, then the system pack. Once you've done all this, install them all, IN THIS ORDER : if you don't, the system pack won't be able to install.\n\nAND THEN you'll have to go to the root directory of Gothic 1, go in the System folder, right click on gothic.exe, select "properties", select the "compatibility" tab, and tick the "run this program as an administrator" box.\n\nIf you're patient enough to do all this, then congrats, one of the best series of role-playing games of the early 00's awaits you, adventurer.\n\nIf not, you're forgiven. just get the GoG release, I hear there aren't any bugs.\n\nFIX YOUR DAMN GAME, STEAM !\n\nPS : Don't trust the numbers you're seeing here, I put waaaaay more than enough hours into this game to be able to have an opinion on it. The system pack comes with a launcher that bypasses steam I believe, that's why I seem to have played only an hour when I really have played dozens.\n\nPPS : Also, beware of exploring TOO much. This can lead to bugs that can potentially break your game. For instance, in my first walkthrough, I explored the monastery north of the swamp waaaayyyy before the story tells me to go there. When I did, the game bugged and broke. I couldn't progress into the story anymore, no matter what I did, because I was supposed to open the gate leading to that place when AND ONLY WHEN a certain NPC was there. So yeah, be careful. Don't go to any remote place until the game specifically tells you to do so, or if you're willing to play through hours of content you've already done, back your main save file up by saving in a separate file AND THEN do it.","November 21, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeniath/recommended/65540/","xeniath","Rakanishu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeniath/","83 products in account","It looks like the majority of the glowing reviews for this game come from those who played it way back in the early 2000's when it came out. Prepare for another review from someone with nostalgia-tinted glasses on. I'll keep it as spoiler-free as possible, but I make no promises.\n\nBack in 2003 Gothic was an obscure game adapted into English and sold in NA by an obscure and now defunct company called Xicat Interactive. A friend picked it up at random at EB games (back when it was EB games) and it quickly became a favorite of my entire circle of friends. Truly a hidden gem.\n\nThe intro video (which hasn't displayed properly since upgrading from Windows XP) introduces us to a fairly run of the mill medieval fantasy setting with orcs vs. humans. Nothing too original there, but as soon as the Nameless Hero is introduced and the magical prison of the mining colony is established it's hard not to get hooked. The story takes off immediately with the aid of the iconic ally Diego, who gives the player a crash course on the colony and an invitation to join one of the three factions of the world.\n\nOne element I was always fond of is how the designers figured out a way to make the "invisible wall" mechanic work into the storyline so well. The barrier, and the lands visible outside of your reach, contribute to a genuine feeling of imprisonment and fill you with a desire to know what sort of world extends beyond the confines of the colony. We know there is a king, a desperately needed supply of magic ore, and a war with the orcs, but all of that is put on hold as we are made perfectly aware that there is no escape and the only way to survive in this hostile territory is to make it to the first town alive. This proves harder than it seems...\n\nThe most frustrating and difficult aspect of the game is figuring out the controls. Re-configuring the defaults is pretty much mandatory and figuring out how to pick up something off the ground is arguably more challenging than any of the trials you face in the progression of the story. But, once you understand the "action key" function (holding LM button + pressing W when an item is highlighted) things get a little easier; at least until you're killed by the first scavenger you encounter.\n\nThere are some other perplexing situations where the controls could have been a bit more intuitive. One being the trading system. Once again the action key is needed here, and you hold LM button + press either A or D to move items from one side or the other. Also unexplained is the fact that you control not only your inventory but that of the merchant as well. It took me quite a while to figure out that you can press shift to move in stacks of 100 and the "turn" keys to move in increments of 1. Another confounding issue comes up way later, when you use a transformation scroll for the first time and cant figure out how the hell to turn human again. Just one button will do it (I think it's Enter).\n\nAfter playing games with finely-tuned and flueid combat mechanics like Dark Souls, the combat in most RPGs pales in comparison. The Elder Scrolls games are already a bit tedious and repetitive in their gameplay, but in this area Gothic has not aged well. The target focus is very awkward, and keeping track of and keeping yourself facing the enemy you're trying to kill can be frustrating. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that you cannot effectively fight while moving. Thus, following a strafing target can be a hassle. The noticeable lack of shields further simplifies the combat, but does make you rely on the "block" mechanic.\n\nWhile weapon upgrades are critical to being able to take on tougher enemies, armor plays an ever greater role in the character's growth; both as a status symbol and in terms of survivability. Due to the combat being as rudimentary as it is, being able to take more hits proves more useful than being able to dish out more damage.\n\nThe magic system is decent. There are several tiers, each unlocking more powerful spells. Most of these are youyr typical elemental or psychic type spells, but there are a few in there that are pretty unique. Unfortunately, not all of them are all that useful and some are plain useless (I.e. pyrokenesis).\n\nBugs are common occurrences in Gothic. Some are typical visual errors and others can cause frustrating movement or combat glitches. There's a bug that occasionally makes your lock-on targeting stick after the target is dead, leaving you unable to focus on another or shift your aim. This can be fixed by pressing ESC or putting away your weapon. A few can only be fixed with cheats. Anyone who has been permanently locked out of the Old Mine knows this. There have also been runs when zoning out of an area would cause the game to crash every time. As far as I know, those glitches are unfixable and a previous save game will need to be loaded. So yeah, make backup saves. Playing around with Marvin Mode can be fun as well as useful, as some of these bugs can be solved with noclip.\n\nThe story told in GOthic is highly immersive and the progression gripping. We are given the most freedom in the first act, when we are encouraged to explore all the camps and venture as far into the wilds as we dare. Things become a bit more linear in the following acts, but the writers do a good job of weaving the story together in a way that involves all the camps and the key players together in interesting and surprising ways. Side quests are not very plentiful and named NPC's are also few in number, but the quests are all fun to do. The quality of the script is pretty solid and can be quite amusing at times. The voice acting is comically overdone, but that contributes a bit of charm in its own right. Some of the voices, especially Xardas, are quite good.\n\nThe only complaint I have about Gothic's story is the ending. The "final boss" isn't much of a challenge, and the encounter doesn't give you an opportunity to take full advantage of your arsenal. The ending offers a satisfying conclusion to the story, but not a satisfying test of your abilities.\n\nLastly, Gothic's musical score is great. From the gentle, ambling melody of the overworld to the lively theme of the Old Camp to the dark and mysterious temple ambiance, this game has a very memorable soundtrack. The title theme is especially good.\n\nOverall, Gothic is an amazingly impressive first production from an indie game studio. The limits in budget and game development in its time are all the more noticeable now, but it still manages to impress with its well thought-out storyline and immersive world. It's sad that anyone jumping into the Gothic series this late in the game will not have as remarkable an experience as those of us who did around its release, but I still think this is a game any RPG fan can fall in love with if they take the time to get used to the admittedly weird controls and tolerate the bugs that might pop up.\n\nStory/Characters: 9/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 8/10 (for it's time)\nMusic: 10/10\nOverall Enjoyment: 9/10","May 24","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
