At this price, I'm not particularly disappointed with the game, but my review will be if it costed the full price let's look over some pro's and con's.\n\nPro's\nFun story mode\nUse of turrets combines Run and Gun, and Tower Defense\nMultiple choices in types of weaponry allow for more versatility in combat-----\nCon's\nVery user unfriendly (Little or no tutorial, UI is confusing and poorly designed, If you wander off from the campaign, to say shop for new gear, there's no button to go back to the story map.)\nRepetitve gameplay\nMission rewards system; Each story mission has 3 quests you can do to get large sums of currency, but once these are complete you cannot redo the quest, making currency more difficult to aquire if you cannot advance in the campaign.\nUninnovative. We've all played flash games almost exactly like this (Though, in fairness, this is of higher caliber than those)\nBugs. Though it's released as a full game (Today) It's multiplayer is broken to the point of not working, additionally, There are two currencies, one for purchasing gear, out of missions, and another for turrets, in missions. The currency for out of mission purchases shows always, including during missions, however, the currency for buying turrets, never shows, meaning you won't know if you have enough for a turret until you try to buy it and cant, which brings me to my next point.\nThe turret purchasing system is nonsensical. You start with the ability to place turrets, which brings you into a sort of panning mode, that let's you look at all the nodes you can place turrets, and place them accordingly, if you have enough resources. Let's say you purchase 2 turrets, and are done. Your ability to  access the turret construction/repair/selling menu is locked out, for a period of time (Wanna say 30 seconds). In short, if you want to build a turret but dont have enough, you have to wait until the menu lets you back in to try to find out if you can build it yet.-----\nI'm sure they'll fix the bugs as things go on, but the unoriginality and UI were very disappointing. If you really enjoy this type of game, I would reccomend grabbing it at its current price, but not for any more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/264300/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Guns N Zombies is a money hoarding, tower building, and mutant popping survival game with much more emphasis on the shooting than on tower defense. It takes roughly 6 hours to go through the first time and is actually pretty heavy on the graphics so it will heat up your computer despite being an indie game. The game definitely has its problems but it’s worth it to play if you enjoy horde survival games and are looking for a cheap one to kill some time.  7/10\n\nGuns N Zombies’ story is pretty thin, and is told through short cutscenes at the start of each mission. Some sort of disaster happens in the not too distant future, related to biological testing and cybernetic implants. It results in the world being overrun with zombies, but the truth is they’re more like the creatures in Killing Floor, since almost all of them are cyborg creations and only about 1% of them are actually zombies.\n\nGameplay is third person isometric perspective, similar to the Diablo games, but with all guns and no melee attacks. This means you can get surrounded pretty easily, especially near the beginning of the game. When you kill an enemy there’s a chance they’ll drop a blue crystal, which is the “money” of the game. The more powerful enemies drop more crystals, but I didn’t realize until about halfway through the game that there seems to be a limit of how many crystals can exist at once. This means you need to pick up the ones on the ground if you want more to appear, otherwise you’ll be killing enemies, and nothing will drop. Between missions you can spend your crystals on upgrades such as body armor, better weapons, and upgrades to your turrets. Also bear in mind that you have a character level, which limits what equipment you have access to. Most of the gear you can buy has a level requirement, and the levels don’t actually have any other benefit (you don’t get stronger when you level up, you just get the ability to buy better gear).\n\nThe “tower defense” part of the game is actually pretty limited. Each mission only has a few places where you can actually place a tower (referred to as turrets), and you have a “cool down” between placing and upgrading the towers. This means you can’t just lay down a huge number of towers and expect them to protect you. You place a tower, and you can’t upgrade or place a new one for about 30 seconds. This means that you’re going to need to fight for yourself about 90% of the game, don’t count on the towers to save you.  There are 2 character classes that you can choose from at the start of the game, a fighter class and an engineer class.  The fighter has more health and can have 3 special abilities (you buy these). The engineer can create more and stronger towers. I’ll grant you that some of these high level engineer towers are pretty awesome (black hole cannon!), but the 30 second cool down is a real party pooper. In many levels the enemies spawn endlessly, so you’re not just waiting 30 seconds, you’re fighting for your life while waiting for it.\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics and some cool enemies and weapons. There are also some boss fights but they mostly consist of running away as you shoot backwards at a giant monster chasing you.\n+I really like games where you have the opportunity to grind for money and buy upgrades (so you can become more powerful than you’re “supposed” to be). Guns N Zombies lets you replay missions as many times as you want so you can get more crystals for upgrades. I’m pretty sure you can beat the game only buying like 3 weapons out of 20 or so. You certainly will not have a high enough level to buy the most powerful guns without replaying missions A LOT.\n\nCons:\n-There is very very little documentation for this game online. I couldn’t find much information other than the game’s steam discussion page. This is a real problem because the game does not have a tutorial or even an option screen to see key bindings. I don’t need to change the key configuration; I just want to know what they are!\n-The grind for money can get tedious by the end. Yes I like grinding for money, but if you want the most powerful guns in the game you really need to replay the same levels over about 50 times. I ended up buying the most powerful rocket launcher, and it was almost exactly the same as the second most powerful, it just had a larger clip. A waste of about an hour of grinding since there’s no save/load to undo the purchase and try something else. On the plus side, all that grinding gave me about 80% of the game’s Steam achievements.\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/264300/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Guns n Zombies is a top down shooter in which you fight, you guessed it, Zombies. You fight hoards and hoards of them. This game was released in late 2014.\n\nYou control one of two playable characters, one seems to be more of a standard run and gun character whilst the other is more of an engineer. You have two weapon slots in which you can customize which weapons you can carry by buying different ones via the upgrade shop. The currency that is used drops from various different zombies as you mow your way through the hoards.  Your character also has a special abilities, which have a timed cool down, and these again can be upgraded through the shop.  This game also tries to add in a little bit of tower defense mechanics too, each level has a number of different "build points" - where you can build your turrets, ranging from explosive cannons, to machine guns, or just something as simple as a slowing down sort of turret.  To me this feature seemed a little bit pointless as it didn't really add anything to the game for me.\n\nThe controls are very simple. WASD to move around, mouse to shoot, and the number keys for your special abilities. To me this seemed like the best option over using a controller, but some may prefer to play twin stick shooters on a game pad.\n\nGraphically I felt like Guns n Zombies was not really up to par, it just looked dated and run down. Most of the textures were certainly not high res, animations look a bit weird, and environments just looked bland and boring if I am honest. All of the menus were also in a strange aspect ratio that I had never seen before. They looked like they were made for the hard of hearing.\n\nI am going to be honest, I lost track of the story about half way through - the game does a really bad job of explaining what is going on, it's all in sort of a Power point presentation show in between each level, and offers no clues on what is actually happening. For me to ended up getting to the end with no idea as to what had transpired.\n\nThe difficulty in Guns n Zombies is actually pretty high. I was finding my self dying on the early levels, and often found my self having to go back to the previous stage just to earn more currency so I could buy the next weapon up. For me, that is just a badly designed way of doing it. I shouldn't be made to replay the content I have just done in this type of game - I could understand it in an MMO of sorts, but not a twin stick shooter like this.\n\nA playthrough on single player took me just under four hours to finish. For me that felt like way longer than I would of liked it to have. Maybe this was because I just wasn't enjoying my time playing, I don't know. Where all of the compliments and positive reviews seem to come into play, is the multiplayer co-op. Personally I wasn't able to find anyone to play with, so I was stuck with the single player. If you can get a few friends together to play, you may well have a ton more fun than on your own.\n\nApart from the strange aspect resolution on the menus, there are no major bugs that I encountered, everything seemed to run smoothly at the higher resolutions, which is always a plus point.\n\nSadly I am not going to recommend Guns n Zombies here; I just didn't have fun whilst playing it. It felt very vanilla, slow and just not fun to play. I would say that you really should not pick this up if you are planning to play it as a single player game, you probably will not have fun at all. If you are going to get one or two friends together to play co-op, sure, playing with friends makes everything better, but I can certainly see it making Guns n Zombies all together more fun. I would say pick it up if it drops below 50% off, just because it offers a good pick up and play feel, but nothing more than that.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/falconpunch444/recommended/264300/","falconpunch444","falconpunch444","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falconpunch444/","341 products in account","Lets start with the things I don't like. There are very few.\nThe menus, I find them a little awkward to navigate (might be because i play with a controller, still there are alternative way of structuring a menu for controllers that i have witnessed that work well (Shoot Many Robots being one game that does this well))\n\nThe missions where you have to collect a certain amount of currency for the bonus star. This criteria often conveniently plops itself on the missions I don't want to replay. I just find this extra side thingy a little cheap and unimaginative.\n\nDead ends in the level design. When kiting the zombies all Killing Floor style I like to have somewhere to run and sometime you find yourself in a dodgy alley with nowhere to go and yeah, you know the rest..All that is merely a single hydrogen atom on our vast sun. This game is nice.\nCo-op. Yep. Nice feature and all to have in a game however sometimes you find Co-op games can scale up the difficulty too much making single player a chore. The reason why Co-op is being mentioned here is mainly due to the fact that it works and doesn't ruin the lonely single player experience.\nLeveling is a nice thing to have in a game however mostly nit so much when its a grind. Luckily for us there is no grind as the levels are spaced out just right, leaving you with a nice sense of accomplishment as you go through the missions; put those stripper poles back in your attic, you don't need them. I finished the game playing normal (did the first 2 stages on Hell) and got to level 17 of which the final item is unlocked at level 20.\n\nApart from what I said a minute ago about the dead ends the level design is rather nice, All of the levels look different so these guys haven't done that annoying thing that some developers do and recycle the bean can out of it. *phew*\n\nEnemy variation. This is done nicely. You can see where they got lots of the inspiration from. The Goon being similar to L4D's Tank, Witch is basically a Siren from Killing Floor and the Kamikaze being very much like the Suicider of Dead Island (Minus the creepy laugh and slurring of the work "yeeeaaaahhh"). Each enemy has a easy way to clear them out. None of them are particularly hard to kill however they shouldn't be underestimated, strength in numbers. I found myself dying from the weaker enemies due to the sheer quantity of them coming at me.\n\nWeapon variation. You have 4 types of weapons. Assault Rifles/ Machine Guns, Shotguns, Explosives, Snipers. These get very sci-fi very fast with lasers and railguns and even singularity rockets. The idea to use fictional weapons in the game means that you can significantly vary how each one behaves making them different, not necessarily better or worse (You are now man and shotgun, you may now kiss your.. Please don't). Most weapons are an upgrade on the last so there isn't much point in going back to many of them however the few such as the singularity rocket launcher is very useful for controlling where you want the enemies to go and also condensing a large crowd.\n\nThe classes in the game at this point are nice, I am excited for the DLC and arrival of the first female playable, It would be nice to see an even amount in male and female characters regardless of the demographic however if that's how the developers wanted their game, who am I to say anything. Anyway, off that tangent. The 2 classes are cool. The Warrior with a damage resistance increase however basically useless towers (Only really good as a distraction for enemies) and then there is my personal favourite, The Mechanic. He has a huge range in turret arsenal however this comes at the cost of only being able to have 1 ability (whereas The Warrior can have 3). Only having 1 ability isn't that damaging to your game as there are a couple that pull nicely and even in the later levels on Hell difficulty the turrets can really deal hefty damage, There is a singularity rocket turret also so that means you can switch out that Launcher for something with more damage output.This was just a small amount of the things I like about the game and i could go on but I wanted to keep this review short (Good job me!!). The amount of playtime you get out of this game for £5.59 makes that a very reasonable purchase, I finished the game at 7 hours however i had been messing around with both characters so it is probably completeable in an average of 5 hours or so. I got this game in the recent sale for a steal at 55p so my expectations were not that high however it has exceeded them with simple, fun gameplay.","May 30, 2015","true","9.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","14","16","5","0"

The game is also rather confusing as it lacks much of a tutorial system (it took me a minute to figure out how to use turrets and abilities, as the ingame prompts aren't very clear).  For an early access there are a good number of levels, and there is an upgrade system but I haven't played enough to really comment on it yet.

It has some bugs here and there, but the game play is pretty great.  If you like the twin stick genre.\n\nThe gunplay is accurate and you'll notice some differences when you upgrade your weapons which makes it rewarding.  The turret system didn't interest me much at first, but it's growing on me.  The graphics aren't mind blowing, but they make for a fun atmosphere for running around and blowing up zombies!  The story is skippable, I haven't paid much attention to it.  I'm just here to shoot stuff in twin stick style, which is ace.\n\nAs for bugs, I've noticed on a map or two where it doesn't register the end of a wave.  That's kind of a bummer, because you have to quit your current game.  There's at least one invisible item I can think of so far that I've ran into as well, which is difficult mostly becase there's a perk achivement attached to it.  Otherwise, I've had nothing but fun with this one.   There's also online co-op supposedly, but I haven't attempted it and the boards state there's a lot of problems with firewalls.  Be aware if that's your primary goal for this one.\n\nThere's an upgrade system in which you can buy better weapons, stats, etc. and it all works pretty well.  It serves as a good carrot to go back and replay maps to grind out levels and beef up your character for the later maps.  However, there is no real tutorial that I found that shows you all of this stuff.  Not a big deal, you can figure it out easily enough.  You just may be confused for a bit.\n\nFor it's current $1.19 price tag in the Halloween sale, GunsNZombies is a steal!  For the full $8, I may not have jumped on it so quickly, but $5 feels like a great price for it.

This game was designed very well, with replay value in mind.  There are many levels and locations to battle from, many weapons to choose from and upgrade, and turrets that you may place down giving it a touch of tower defense.  I would recommend this game to anyone a fan of this genre or zombie games.\n\nThere is one con I have found in this game, you get stuck on random objects, forcing you to scramble a few directions to get unstuck.  It happens more than it should and for how great of a game this is, it's a buzz kill.  However, this is the only 'con' I can find in a game that does so many other things right.\n\nIf you're reading this review, you are already interested in buying and I say go for it!","June 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Co-Op can't for I was randomly looking for zombie games over the head top down view and found this and am I so happy I did! Performance is awesome steady 60 fps no stutter. I like this game better than a lot of 50 dollar games. If you like over head games try its 7 dollars help the devs make co op even better! BTW this is what early access is for small dev's trying to make a name for themselves, not some million dollar company charging 30 dollars for early access.  To be honest they need to have requirement if the company want use early access on steam they shouldn't have revenue over 500k, unless a small indie company makes a good first game and does another early access\n. Big name companies are running the early access purpose by trying to lure customers in with it, it really needs to stop. This is a very fun game and addicting one, how many times have you wasted 50 bucks on crap games???? It's only 7.99 you be able to play and either enjoy it, wait for co-op or play a couple hours and never play it again but you will get your monies worth ONLY if you like top down shooters, I love most and this is definitely worth getting for early access and playing after it releases!

You must also use number keys to use some special habilities, for example in the first stages you can activate a dron that helps you killing every zombie near you.\n\nThe main story is explained using slides between the stages but its not the best point of the game.\n\nGraphics are correct, music and sound are quite normal.\n\nThe game has a co-op mode and I think that this option gives you a better experience than the single mode because this game remembers Gaunlet to me and in that game i was enjoy a lot playing with friends.\n\nIt has achivements and trading cards.\n\nNice game for sweating adrenaline\n\nPD: Thanks to Shade00","November 9, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

From what I have seen so far you are in the middle of the zombie apocalypse trying to find out what caused the disaster. It gives some sort of slide presentation in between each level to try and explain the story, but overall it is rather ordinary.\n\nGameplay-I am currently playing through the singleplayer mode, but I feel co-op may be better, and so far it has been quite difficult and to pass the stage sometimes you might have to grind up money to purchase a better weapon (which there is a wide range of) to enable you to succeed. This can cause repetitive gameplay which is always a bit of an annoyance but there is a variety of levels with different objectives.\n\nIt can be enjoyable trying to lure zombies away from something you are trying to protect and to turn their attention to you so you can mow them down. However, if you accidently make them follow you into an enclosed area you will have no hope trying to awkwardly maneuver through them. This is also due to the fact that the maps feel very confined.\n\nYou can choose to use your guns to exterminate the zombies or use turrets. When using the shotgun and letting out a small burst whilst trying to walk in a direction your screen will gawkily try to decide which direction you should be facing and kind of spaz out. This can also happen when you brush pass a zombie. When shooting I found that some of the shots wouldn't be detected on the zombies (this wasn't just my bad aim). Playing with turrets can make the game have a tower-defense aspect to it which was interesting, but the way to purchase them was questionable because if you press TAB to see if you can build one and find out that you can't, or you just accidentally pressed that key, it will lock you out of your ability to access the turret system for a short period of time.\n\nGraphics-The graphics are rather simple and not terrific in any way, but the cartoonish feel to them lets it slip by.\n\nHUD-Isn't much of a tutorial and there is no key rebinding\n\nMusic & Sounds- Music and sounds are okay. Nothing special.\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Wide range of weapons\n✔ Turrets adds tower-defense feel\n✔ Enjoyable to lure zombies\n✔ Cartoonish style is effective\n✔ Levels with different objectives\n\nNeutral\n✔/✘Music and sounds are okay\n✔/✘Graphics aren't special\n✔/✘Story is ordinary\n\nCons\n✘ Repetitive gameplay, even with weapons, etc.\n✘ Turret system is questionable\n✘ No tutorial or key rebinding\n✘ Maps feel very confined\n\nConclusionI am rather undecided whether to recommend this game or not. It feels like the type of game that should have "Mixed" reviews. It definately isn't bad it is just plain mediocre and really doesn't do anything new to this genre. That being said I did enjoy some parts of this game but I feel it might be better for co-op (I have heard there are some problems with it currently). Some of you may very well enjoy this game a lot so if you want it, grab it on sale as you may be disappointed paying full price for it.\n\n6/10\n\nLiked that review? I have others!\n\n","November 22, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That being said I was amazed at how much I loved guns n zombies(-n aliens).\nIt sat around in my library for a while, because i had got it on a sale a few moths before and I wasnt expecting much of it so I hadnt played it yet, when I saw they released the DLC n aliens, it was on sale as well, I got it and went on to finally trying out the game.\nNext thing I realized I had been playing for five hours and was late for my dialysys treatment (which i have to undergo 3x a week), when I got back home from it the first thing I did was turning on the PC to keep playing it, it´s really addictive.\n\n-The Good\n.Lots of RPG elements, leveling (though no real stats or choices when leveling, that would improve the game even further), which is mostly for item requirements, but so many diferent guns, all of them upgradable, armors, turrets(which you can use or not, it´s up to you).\n.Different classes, there´s one, for instance, that is specialized in turrets, another one in support turrets, I´m playing as warrior, specialized in combat.\n.Replayable missions, each one with their own set of achievments and individual dificulty\n.You can resurrect by using a currency that you get as reward for some achievments, it´s really good to respawn from that unfair death when you were finally beating that level on hell difficulty whith all achievments, but it´s restrict to a few uses in the entire playthough, so it doesnt make it easy.\n.Lots of creative guns, very well balanced, each one with a unique design and way to play it, they have really different playstyles for different guns, it´s amazing, all of them upgradable as I mentioned.\n.top equipment is expensive(in-game money only ofc) so it´s a reason to replay missions a lot and aim for all the achievments, which reward you with cash or respawn currency.\n.Lots of different enemies, very well designed, beautiful really, incredible AI, not easily tricked, each enemy has a different way to fight against it as well.\n.Tower defense elements if you use turrets, the class I am playing doesnt have all, so I use them mostly to draw off mobs so I dont get swamped, although in some levels they are really helpful.\n.good, compelling story\n.CHEAP, really cheap for what you are getting, and it´s often on sale.\n.Have I mentioned all the guns?\n.A lot of replayability, you are going to want to finish it once with each class\n\nThe Bad\n.A couple achievments are broken, but the dev said they will fix it\n.It could have more RPG elements, like stats, and a character sheet, and choices to be made when leveling, skills maybe. ( they do it with gear pretty well though, but both things would be sweet!)\n\nThanx for the great game","January 16","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Better for co op I would think. The graphics are a little on the plain side. You have your character I played the mechanic. The graphics while very plain looking are ok. I do wish they were a little more detailed and the animations feel very stilted to me. Like the bad guys are missing some frames of animation. The maps that I played on felt very cramped and their was lot of junk on the ground that acts as walls.\n\nIt kind of feels like a poor mans killing floor. However you can set up turrents that will fight for you. This isnt explained in the game very well at all. I had to do trial and error and I also sold a few turrents by accident as well thinking I was upgrading them. That was a tad annoying. Not much to say really. Its a very simple shoot em up like robotron where you use one joystick to move and the other to shoot.\n\nThe game is ok. Nothing really stands out for me though. Its not terrible I just would have liked some better graphics. If I had to grade the game a 7/10 would be it. For co-op I would give it a higher score of 8/10.","June 26, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The graphics and game play is solid though nothing inventive I’ll be honest, the price tag however, made it all very worthwhile.\n\nThere are 19 stages of which you can blast through with 2 characters in the core game, each stage has their own difficulty slider and objectives, so you’ll be grinding for a while to complete everything in full. During my 20 hours worth of game time, this did not feel dull for one bit as I unlock different tiers of equipment and abilities.\n\nAs for the down side the game is unpolished in some areas with its typos and grammatical mistakes, the biggest gripes I had surprisingly were the stage sceneries, made too small and too dark to make out on the map but just big enough to block your path completely. These inanimate obstacles were more deadly than the zombies themselves, the only real annoyance I had to suffer with.\n\nI would recommend this any time of the day, even more so during a sale, just don’t buy this expecting a big budget title.","November 17, 2015","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it is a horde. And often you are alone. Later you'll be able to deploy turrets using some nano-techno-thingamajig (not your expertise) with some bigwig scientist's help, but maybe he started it? But you don't really play this game for the plot, do you? It's just one mission after another, attack through an area, blast the objectives, etc. etc. Collect "money" and "nanopower" from the dead zeds, use them to upgrade your weapons and equipment (and you can switch among your weapons, like assault rifle, shotgun, electro gun, grenade launcher... ) including the turrets. And that's about it. With multiple starting characters (more healing, more turret, more shooting) and different upgrade paths, there's a little bit of RPG feel to it, but most of the time you're just too busy shooting.\n\nGraphics are a bit lo-fi for a 2014/2015 game but the things move at a good clip. Sound's unremarkable. Gameplay is exciting but rather repetitive. Developers do come up with some variations including defense, attack, clear area, but there are only so many ways to kill zeds.\n\nOverall, GnZ is one of those games that you should only buy when it's on sale.","November 3, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is almost impossible to play with others online.","October 30, 2015","true","18.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because there was a bundle of the DLC and the game for 99 cents, I bought four copies and gave them to some of my friends. So far, we have had a great time playing, but there are a few bugs. For future advice DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON FULLSCREEN. While playing on fullscreen mode, my friends and I have experienced many bugs. For example, on my friends MacBook, everytime he died while playing in fullscreen mode, he couldn't click on anything.\n\nNow on to the good parts. Personally, I am very fond of games in which you can upgrade your character or your weapons. This game is a great example of one of these. You buy weapons with in-game currency and you can upgrade them. You can also buy armor and skill upgrades. I love the design of the characters in this game. The zombies look intimidating but fun at the same time. Also, the pokedex-type manual for zombies is a nice addition that allows you to browse through all of the enemies you have met.\n\nOverall, I would rate this game 7/10!","October 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For that price, I would definitely recommend it as I felt like I got my money's worth.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of objects your character can get caught up on and unless you grind a lot, you're not going to get all of the weapons, or even most of them. Some of the weapons are completely useless and glitched, and the medic is an awful class with no offensive turrets. Maybe she would be better in co-op. I'll rank the weapons and classes according to how good they are, so you might not waste your time with the crap weapons.\n\nIt's way better to stick with one weapon type, or less, per level you unlock and prioritize armor and health.\n\nCharacters (best to worst):\n1. Mechanic (TURRETS)\n2. Warrior (3 abilites)\n3. Medic (Heals, bad at killing things)\n\nWeapons:\n1. Sniper rifles (fully penetrating, good damage)\n2. Auto rifles (late ones pentrate, high rate of fire)\n3. Grenade launchers (later ones suck enemies into explosion area for CC, but do pitiful damage)\n4. Electric rifles (Close range, doesn't seem to damage all the time? Would not suggest)\n5. Shotguns (Terrible, why would you make shotguns horrible??? Only seem to damage at point of full spread)\n\nEDIT: Order of weapons.\n\nAlso, I would highly suggest playing through on hard difficulty because it's not that much more difficult than normal and you can unlock more weapons, etc.","October 23, 2015","true","91.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The graphics and game play is solid though nothing inventive I’ll be honest, the price tag however, made it all very worthwhile.\n\nThere are 19 stages of which you can blast through with 2 characters in the core game, each stage has their own difficulty slider and objectives, so you’ll be grinding for a while to complete everything in full. During my 20 hours worth of game time, this did not feel dull for one bit as I unlock different tiers of equipment and abilities.\n\nAs for the down side the game is unpolished in some areas with its typos and grammatical mistakes, the biggest gripes I had surprisingly were the stage sceneries, made too small and too dark to make out on the map but just big enough to block your path completely. These inanimate obstacles were more deadly than the zombies themselves, the only real annoyance I had to suffer with.\n\nI would recommend this any time of the day, even more so during a sale, just don’t buy this expecting a big budget title.","November 17, 2015","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

'Lacks common and main core features such as Co-Op.'\n\nJust a heads up before you read the pros and cons; I am rating this game as a "Finished and published product" which it does not feel like. Perhaps the game will change over time, but for now I do not recommend this game. I literally purchased half a dozen copies in hopes people in my gaming community could play together, since this game was not in Beta or anything.. Thinking Co-Op would work. It does not; Repeat CO-OP DOES NOT WORK.\n\nPros:\n+ Good variety of weapons.\n+ Familiar style game and mechanics.\n+ Has a lot of potential, and "Possible" features.\n+ Somewhat comical and cartoony outbreak storyline.\n\nCons:\n- Lacks a tutorial (Not everyone is an expert Zombie Survivor).\n- Needs to bring something to the table (Nothing unique here, except the comical feel.. Wait other games got that too).\n- Repetitive gameplay (Gets quite boring if you're gaming alone, new zombies do excite however)\n- Feels like a grind - A not good one either, after the first runs of each 'Scene' funds become scarce.\n- Lacking sound effects, or not notable ones (That just draw you in).\n- No custom settings - Such as changing Keybinds, user interface, and other common options elsewhere.\n- Co-op isn't working.\n\nThe game definately has potential- it's hard to recommend it due to the simple fact that there are similar games which are better; and the fact that it's a comical feel/cartoony game it's supposed to be for a laugh, yet it lacks that for the simple fact you cannot enjoy it with friends (Co-Op). I get it, it's an indie game and it's decently priced; yet that's no excuse for putting out a product that feels like it's in alpha, or closed beta. Despite all of this, consider this game down the road, it shows appeal and ideals that can forge this game into something fun and for everyone. Hopefully the developers will continue to refine and polish this game, and soon; I can't wait to see what it turns out to be.","November 17, 2014","false","5.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/recommended/264300/","comacoma","that's what she said","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/","1794 products in account","Boring repetitive twin stick shooter that has no point to exist on big screen. Basically the game is about the guy who is locked in small area and shoot things dead and plant some turrets to help him shoot things dead (gimmick alert).\nThere is no story apart from some pics with boring text (humor is unfunny too), missions are bite-sized with grind-based progression. Literally you need to upgrade damage (the only stat) or buy a new gun which is the same gun but has more damage. Basically there is half of dozen different gun classes and each thing in class is essentially the same thing. And to be able to upgrade your damage you need to replay previous missions because you don't earn anything if you fail because you didn't had enough damage. There is some active skills (upgraded the same as weapons) and character leveling for unlocking the guns with more damage. Achievements are grind-based, upgrades, leveling, everything is grind based.\nYou just shoot things and do boring missions, most of which are cheap and boring way to force you to replay the previous levels again. There is no dodge or melee mechanics, you can stop firing to move a bit faster and that's it. There is lives system - mobile-like - you have a pool of lifes for all levels which aren't refilled (as the game isn't f2p on PC, devs just decided to let them spawn as any other pickup on levels).\nThere is no local coop too, which could be actually point of buying for home gaming system users.\n\nYeap, you've guessed it right. It plays and feels cheap like a f2p mobile game which it actually is. Visuals and sounds are competent, there is online coop for boring people who play boring games, but there is nothing which may justify it's existence on big screen. It's just nothing to write home about - just another good f2p mobile game desinged as f2p mobile game that looks and feels like f2p mobile game. But this is PC. It'd feel right at home on Nvidia Shield or Playstation Vita, but on PC only undemanding boring people will play it. People like you, buy it on deep discount.\nOr if you want to have fun you might consider some of proper twin-stick shooters on PC: Shadowgrounds, Narco Terror, Gatling Gears, Renegade Ops, Lara Croft, Assault Android Cactus, WH40K Kill Team, Nation Red, Crimsonland, Meltdown etc. Buy them instead, they are superior in every possible way.","July 13, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'd love to use the triggers/bumpers to do certain actions, because that way I can keep both thumbs on the analog sticks.\nA camera angle adjuster, so I can make the angle I'm viewing the action more "top down" rather than at an angle. One time I almost died because I thought there was a narrow path through what turned out to be a dead end made by the edge of the map and an unseen object, because a sign or billboard blocked the view.\nLastly, those vital blue glowing things that are the game currency are at times hard to pick up, what with dozens of undead swarming straight at you, and while they stick around a good bit of time, I still had moments of watching my hard eared blue glowing thingies dissappear because the masses of fleash eating abominations unto god wouldn't let me get them. Just a boost to the pick up range for these blue thingies would be great.\n\nNow, having got the negative out of the way, I just want to say this game is FUN! What's not to like about mowing down undead hordes with a variety of weapons, turrets, and drone helpers? Okay, it doesn't look as amazing as Killing Floor 2, but for such a budget game, it looks rather nice. game can be played with mouse/KB or controller, so take your pick, both worked for me. I like how even using a controller for playing the game, I can still use my mouse for menus and such, too. (far more intuitive to use mouse for that, I think)\nWith 3 characters, it provides a bit of replayability, but I'm still early in the campaign.\n\nShort version: Wish i could rebind controls/ change camera angle/grab blue thingies better, but it's fun with replay potential, and the fun lasts longer than a snickers bar.","February 6","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I definitely reccomend this to anyone who loves coop survival or zombie survival games.\n\n9.75/10","July 21, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of "Yet another zombie defense" game that I got for ~10cents on sale.\n\nThe graphics are easy to the eyes, clean and simple.\n\nIf you don't mind spending a few bucks for a few hours of mindless fun I would recommend the game, especially since it has multiplayer option.\n\nPersonally, the game is lacking challenge. The excitement and fear that comes from being chased by zombies, that I am looking for in such a title, simply isn't there.","August 4, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even in the narrowed niche of zombie themed, Dead Nation (on ps3) is far superior for a lot of reasons. The graphics were ok in this, but not great. The animations were pretty poor at times, and even the splash art is incredibly stiff. But it’s passable surely.\nBiggest gripe is probably controls. It just doesn’t seem responsive/smooth enough for the type of game it is. I was playing M+KB which worked fine, but it just seemed like there was something holding it back from being right. Might have just been how some of the guns worked. The sniper crossbow was kind of a pain to use. The aim laser would come up and shoot at the same time. It should be two separate buttons or just aim at all times, instead. The AK47 worked as expected. Shotgun was fine. The electric taser thing seemed more powerful but it’s very limited range, but at the same time it seemed like the monsters had to be in a precise distance from you or it didn’t work properly. Just weird quirks like that bugged me. Also, the WASD keys didn’t seem real great either. Maybe I should try the game with the steam controller and see how it works.\n\nThere were sound glitches too. I’d be shooting but playing with a friend and his gun sounds would override my gun sounds, or the music would, or maybe the gun sounds just dropped out. So then I wasn’t sure I was even shooting. That’s annoying.\n\nThe levels were ok, but the camera and some of the 3D obstacles were poor, in that I couldn’t always see where my guy was, or I couldn’t see that I would get stuck in a dead end, or something similar. The environments looked cool though. The enemies were pretty good (psi-brained doctor zombies), though sometimes pretty silly (motorunicycle riding cowboy gangs?). Actually, the models were a little hit or miss. Some looked really good, some were so simplified it was bad (floating skulls that just looked like orbs). Effects looked pretty good. Bodies/gore was not persistent, which is too bad. I didn’t feel overwhelmed even when there were a lot of monsters. Dead Nation had that down perfect. Actually, Dead Nation is a top tier game in this genre in every way, and GnZ is clearly a low budget indie, so maybe I can’t really compare them. I wish I had Dead Nation on PC.\n\nIt was fun though. I experienced some lag while my wife was watching Netflix, but it went away after a while. But I was still able to play it, despite being 8-10fps, it wasn’t like rubberbanding or stuck in place or anything. We did have some weird connecting issues when we first started going and then one random drop. But mostly it worked well.\nThe upgrades and abilities and things you can “buy” in between missions is cool. I played engineer, who starts with crossbow and access to turrets. Unfortunately you have to pay for turrets in game (with blue junk) and they can only go on nodes. Lame. I should be able to drop one anywhere. Also, you are completely vulnerable when trying to build them (in like a menu system that is really poorly done) But I had a cool floating orb helper ability that was quite effective. I also like the addition of objectives in each mission beyond survival and getting from point a to b. They are more like arenas instead. Dead Nation is definitely A-B levels.\n\nSo this game is kind of a hit or miss. For 79 cents, absolutely recommend. I wouldn’t pay over 5 for it certainly.\n","January 6","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd love to use the triggers/bumpers to do certain actions, because that way I can keep both thumbs on the analog sticks.\nA camera angle adjuster, so I can make the angle I'm viewing the action more "top down" rather than at an angle. One time I almost died because I thought there was a narrow path through what turned out to be a dead end made by the edge of the map and an unseen object, because a sign or billboard blocked the view.\nLastly, those vital blue glowing things that are the game currency are at times hard to pick up, what with dozens of undead swarming straight at you, and while they stick around a good bit of time, I still had moments of watching my hard eared blue glowing thingies dissappear because the masses of fleash eating abominations unto god wouldn't let me get them. Just a boost to the pick up range for these blue thingies would be great.\n\nNow, having got the negative out of the way, I just want to say this game is FUN! What's not to like about mowing down undead hordes with a variety of weapons, turrets, and drone helpers? Okay, it doesn't look as amazing as Killing Floor 2, but for such a budget game, it looks rather nice. game can be played with mouse/KB or controller, so take your pick, both worked for me. I like how even using a controller for playing the game, I can still use my mouse for menus and such, too. (far more intuitive to use mouse for that, I think)\nWith 3 characters, it provides a bit of replayability, but I'm still early in the campaign.\n\nShort version: Wish i could rebind controls/ change camera angle/grab blue thingies better, but it's fun with replay potential, and the fun lasts longer than a snickers bar.","February 6","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and frantic as you blast your way through hordes of the undead and each mission offers a diffrent set of objectives to complete. So the gameplay, at least early on, doesn't get stale. While the graphics will not blow you away, they are clean and the enviorments varied. Which is to say most people, not matter your PC setup, should be able to run this game smoothly. Overall I would rate this title 7.5/10","April 23","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
