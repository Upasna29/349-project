"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/373970/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nLetter Quest: Grimm's Journey Remastered is an addictive spelling game - this remastered edition came about quite quick, given that the original release was only brought out on Steam a little under a year ago in November 2014. This remastered version hit the store front in August of 2015.\n\nThe main gameplay element in Letter Quest is spelling words in order to deal damage to your foes. You play in a side scrolling dungeon crawl type environment, and you have to defeat a number of enemies in order to reach the treasure at the end of the dungeon.  You have fifteen letters each round which are randomly selected for you and you just need to spell out a word, each of the letters have their own special rarity, so if you stick some Ws and Xs in your words, they will end up doing more damage compared to sticking to simple words like "Door" or something, very similar to the likes of the rules in Scrabble or Words with Friends.  Some of the monsters have special abilities, weaknesses and strengths, for instance, one enemy might not take any damage from any words which contain the letter E, whilst others may take double, triple, or sometimes twenty times more damage from words containing other letters. Some enemies may use a special ability and make your letters also have a debuff on, such as rendering them useless and dealing zero damage from then, poisoning them, duplicating them, or stopping you from using them all together. All of these combined with the other strengths and weaknesses of the monsters can really lead to some interesting runs.\n\nEach run through a dungeon you are also collecting gems from defeating the enemies, completing small quests and looting the jewels at the end of the dungeon. You can in turn use these gems to upgrade your character with health points, more damage, and dodge chance increases and many more. This allows you to build your character however you want. Along with a huge selection of weapons to choose from as you unlock more from either progressing in the story mode, completing quests and challenges. There is so much to unlock in Letter Quest that you can be farming gems for hours and still not have it all unlocked.  Each stage has four levels of difficulty; completing each stage grants a star, and rewards you with more gems. You can also replay previously completed dungeons if you want to farm more gems too.\n\nLetter Quest has a really nice looking aesthetic too; the graphics are very simple 2D, but the games own unique style really shines through. The UI is really nicely designed too; obviously you are going to be spending a lot of your time looking at the letters at your disposal, so it's nice that the game also includes a number of different skins for the letter's style, letting you change it up once you get bored of one style.\n\nEven though the game classes the main mode of the game to be "story mode", there isn't really any story at all. There is absolutely no back story, or any dialog in the game, and to be honest, I wasn't all that bothered about the lack of a plot either.\n\nI found Letter Quest to be a fairly difficult game; but as you get playing, you get more and more used to it, practice makes perfect. If you are good at games such as Scrabble, or you know plenty of fancy big words, you'll excel in this game. The RPG element is not exactly difficult to master, you can create any sort of character build that takes your fancy, I focused mainly on health regeneration because my fights tended to last a bit longer due to only being able to get six letter words most of the time - there are builds which focuses on farming gems, doing massive amounts of damage, or just simply not taking any damage at all.\n\nCompleting Letter Quest with the majority of the stages being completed on all four difficulties, took me just over twelve hours to finish. I felt that it was a really good length, and given the amount of replay ability, I can see Letter Quest easily hitting the fifteen hour mark if you fancy taking on the endless mode.\n\nLetter Quest can be played entirely with a keyboard, since you are typing out the words. You can also play the entire game without touching the keyboard and purely using the mouse too. I also spent a lot of time using my Steam controller on this game, and that works perfectly with the trackpads, there are a few community made binding sets which all work well too; so if you have a steam controller, give it ago with Letter Quest.\n\nI fully enjoyable myself whilst playing Letter Quest - this is a casual game but will completely suck you in and get your addicted straight away. I and my partner played this game together for the most part, and minutes soon turned into hours and hours soon turned into long sessions ploughing through the levels together. It's a game which you can quite easily keep installed on your machine and jump into every now and again too. There is very little to learn in terms of the gameplay as it purely uses your own spelling knowledge. Letter Quest's regular price is Â£5,59, which in itself is an absolute bargain for the amount of content on offer, and the quality of it - so if you can get it any less than that, pick it up in a heartbeat as you won't find a better word based game on Steam.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It boasts 40 different levels each providing 4 different challenges for the player (giving you a grand total of 160 challenges). If that's not enough for you, the expert mode unlocks once you've completed the game on the regular one. The RPG elements allows you to customize your character and allow for a natural progression since the challenges become tougher as the game progresses.\n\nThe remastered edition has improved animations and the new endless mode for a different challenge that improves replayability.\n\nNot being a native English speaker, I consider the game the provide a decent challenge while not pushing me away. It actually has that "just one more" quality that will have you engulf many hours in it without really noticing. A real word aficionado might find the regular mode on the easy side but will certainly enjoy the more challenging expert mode. It took me about 10 hours to complete the main quest and roughly 75% of the overall challenges. Depending on your level of vocabulary, you can probably complete the whole thing (including achievements) on normal in 10 to 15 hours.\n\nOverall a really enjoyable game that's easy to pick up and play for a quick session or to really dive into for hours at a time. I suggest you give the demo a try even if you're not usually a fan of word games.","August 8, 2015","true","10.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","1"

The game itself will appeal to anyone who enjoys Scrabble, Puzzle Quest, or slaughtering dangerous monsters through the power of their vocabulary.\n\nTouch screen: This is one of the best games available on Steam for anyone who owns a windows tablet, as it controls absolutely perfectly through touch. It's honestly flawless: not once did I feel hampered, annoyed, or even mildly inconvenienced using the UI through touch. If you own a windows tablet, you should own this game. (For info's sake I play on a Surface Pro 1.)\n\nAlso, the dev is a pretty nice guy. Despite this being a niche game and not exactly making the creator wealthy, he went out of his way to ensure that all previous purchasers of Letter Quest recieved the remastered version free of charge. I appreciate that.\n\nOh yes, works just great in both Windows 8 and Windows 10.

I love the style of this game, its like a dungeon crawler x puzzle typing game.  The animation is cute the challenges make the game fun, great scaling on the star difficulties.  The quests add an element of challenge as well trying to complete certain parameters for extra gems to buy things from the shopkeep such as stat boosts and BACON!! (used in place of health potion).\n\nThere isnt really too much on the negative side. If you were wondering about keyboard functionality the keyboard is responsive no problems there.  I suppose I have had a few bad jumbles of letters in a row but they give you a shuffle button to use it counts as your turn but at least you arent stuck with bad letters turn after turn trying to make words out of them.\n\nAll of that said I would recommend this to people I think it could be fun for anyone, maybe moreso for those who enjoy typing or puzzle type games. I would load this on my surface or tablet and take it with me when traveling I feel this would be perfect for that :)","August 5, 2015","true","3.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

Whether you're super brain or fuzzy old me, it's playable by everyone who can spell English words.\n\nYou play as Grimm, a little reaper who is on a quest to get pizza. You venture through various locations where you have to beat up monsters by spelling words from 15 available random letters.\n\nAlong the way, you free shopkeepers who sell you stuff for the gems you earn; upgrades, special abilities, books, potions, weapons. There's even two more characters to unlock that you can play with, with different stats (but all upgrades, special abilities, and stuff transfer)\n\nThe monsters vary too, some have special conditions to take damage at all, or to take double, or even quadruple damage. Some throw stuff at your letters that makes them dangerous, unavailable, or adding no points to a word. Sometimes some letters aren't available, sometimes you're limited in the amount of words or letters you may use. and more. Always something new and different!\n\nAt every stage (location) you have a plain normal level, one with limited time, one with varied special conditions, and one extra tough one. If I'm not mistaken, there are 40 stages. Plus of course the new endless mode (haven't tried that yet).\n\nAnd for those like me who don't like timers, just pause the game by clicking help (better than making a screenshot and pausing the game). I like it a lot that the game does not force the timed rounds at all cost.\n\nAlso, I got this for free because I own the previous version. That's a very neat move by the developer. He's also very responsive and friendly.\n\nWith the new engine opening new developement options, I still hope he'll add a free play mode/level with picked/random monsters, after the final boss has been beaten.\n\nBut in any case, as it is it's a fun, charming game. Even losing a level makes me smile with the cute animation of little Grimm lying there with x'ed eyes. Or the Dust bunny whacking me over the head with the duster.","August 6, 2015","true","116.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

Part Scrabble, part 2D Crawler. Really just a well made game. I will say however that it doesnt recognize a fair amount of words, but yet somehow all the racist and hate words made it into the game. Not sure why. They probably thought it would be funny if you kind of had to use them while in battle.\n\nAnyway, really fun, and with the ultimate reward at the end.

There is loot, potions, various unlockables, character development and... yes, there are quests! (scrabble-like, mainly about building specific number of words meeting specific criteria).\n\nThe game has a high replay value (it's a word game, after all), and after beating Story Mode (there is little story about it, actually - rather a sequence of challenges), there is so-called "Endless Mode", where it's just you, monsters, and the question - how long can you survive?\n\nProduction value is high as well - it's a casual game, but a very polished one. Cartoonish presentation adds a lot of charm - it's cute, colorful and clean. Ingame music is diverse and works really well; it didn't force me to turn it off, and I was playing for hours.\n\nI would recommend this, if you find tradidional word games boring, but like the idea of word-building game with defined goals and/or light cRPG flavor. Well, even if you don't, it's still worth trying.\n\nPros:\n\n+ high replay value with Story Mode and Endless Mode\n+ graphics and decent music (and high production value overall)\n+ achievements very well balanced - manageable, but giving you a nice feeling of progession.\n\nCons:\n\nNone.

Attack damage is based on word length and rarity of the letters.\n\nPositives\n+ The game is well explained and easy to understand, so you can start playing straight away.\n+ The difficulty is increased in ways that logically fit the theme.\n+ You can replay any level (with new letters) which is fun to do and also provides more currency to buy stuff.\n+ The developer is active on the forums and is adding missing words.\n+ Loads of upgrades and items to buy, to match different play styles and levels.\n+ The remastered version was free for owners of the original.\n+ Each level has variations, to keep things fresh and increase difficulty.\n+ Special enemies have additional word requirements, to increase the challenge.\n+ Loads of extra challenges and achievements (i.e. use three words that don't have vowels).\n+ Includes definitions of words.\n+ A campaign mode with levels and an endless mode, if you want to see how far you can get.\n+ Tons of replayability. Every level is procedural and the campaign can be replayed on expert mode.\n+ Options: Can change key bindings and resolution. Fullscreen on/off. Different volume scales for effects and music.\n+ Makes you feel a bit smarter!\n\nNegatives\n- Some of the quests go against the idea of the game. For example: "Take 200 damage". This isn't something to be proud of achieving and it doesn't add any challenge to the game. It just rewards failure.\n- A minor design issue occurs when using the keyboard on a level with the same letter on the board twice, but with different attributes (i.e. one is normal and one is poisoned). There doesn't appear to be a way to specify the desired letter, using the keyboard. However, this issue only matters on timed levels and only in that situation, so isn't a big deal.\n- Some profanity does not count as valid words. So it's disappointing to come up with a word and then the game doesn't allow it. At this point the player has already typed the word, so I can't see the benefit of not allowing it. This should at least be optional.\n\nIdeas\n# It would be nice to get a bonus, if a timed level was completed significantly under the time.\n# Bit surprised that there's no quest/achievement for getting really long words (10+).\n# Long word definitions get cut-off (e.g. Islam). This could be solved by showing the text in a tooltip.\n\nOverall this is an well-designed and entertaining game. All of the negatives are minor and are far outweighed by the positives. Definitely recommended.","August 16, 2015","true","20.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Iâve always enjoyed playing word games, especially on PC and Mobile devices. I would hate to think how many hours I spent playing Words With Friends. The problem with some of these games is that they require your friends to join you. I usually feel like playing a word game late at night when I canât sleep, and pretty much everyone I know is already fast asleep, which creates a problem. However, problem is now solved: I no longer need a friend to play a word game, since I have Grimm and Rose to keep me company.\n\nClick this link to read the full Review:\nhttp://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/letter-quest-grimms-journey-remastered/","August 18, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was very kind :3\n\nI've only reached the forest so far, it's upgraded and cleaned up quite a bit from what the original used to be. The unity player touch is very nice. The music is well done and the achievements have been expanded. My only real complaint about this game is only that the vocabulary list was never expanded apon. Lots of modern day nouns and verbs are missing and I had hoped that famous locations would also have been included but are not (Ex: Rome, Greece, etc).\n\nOther then that the game is a nice, peaceful time waster with some brainstorming required, especially on the time trial modes. I haven't messed with Endless yet, but will as soon as I play the story out.","August 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If i were to compare this game to another to give you a general idea of what you're in store for would be, Boggle, that's right, the classic game night word game Boggle wrapped in an RPG.

Now the Remastered version is giving me an excuse to play it all over again.\n\nIf you like word games, you probably don't need to know much more than that the letter distribution is good and the mechanics are sound. If you need a little more to be sold on it, there is character progression with power-ups and abilities that you can unlock and buy, and the combat mechanic feels balanced and fun. The enemies have varied attacks, including tainting the tiles with such hurdles as poison or spikes (which deal damage to you when you use them) or even turning them to stone (which you can't use). There is room for strategy (do I use that S to make CASTLE now, or save it for later, when I can use it at the end of the word and get a bonus from my "pluralize" spell?), the achievements are motivating (all doable with a little patience), and there are in-game quests to keep you going and shake things up when it starts to feel repetitive.\n\nAll in all, a clean, well-made word game with well-implemented RPG/combat system - and this version even has an endless mode with its own challenges and achievements to shoot for, so after you finish the main storyline there is still more to enjoy. Easily played for a few minutes or a few hours at a time. And as a bonus, the original and remastered versions each have their own set of trading cards to collect! Finally, the developers are friendly and responsive to suggestions! Really, you can't lose with this one.","August 8, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Flash platform can be conveniently replaced with the OpenFL + Haxe environment, would have saved the author a lot of time. Anyway, I'll take this as a training exercise for future Unity games, right?\n\nThe Remastered version adds a new optional soundtrack, which is pretty good but a far cry from the magnificence of the original's soundtrack. Seriously, when you have talent like this, you credit them, instead of pushing them to the side. It's still easily the best indie soundtrack I've heard since the days of Shatter and VVVVV.\n\nThere's also the endless mode. I tried it once, and found it stressful. I play LQ for relaxation, so it's a no-go for me. Maybe it's possible to save between battles and not have to do it all in a single session, I'm not sure. I'll have to play it again in the future though, since I'd like to 100% this game's achievements for once. I got my 40th star in expert mode a couple of days after the game's release, must have been one of the first. I greatly enjoyed the difficulty curve; perhaps because I'd already finished it twice in normal mode.\n\nLQ, whether in normal or remastered mode, is more polished than the earlier (and unrelated) 'Bookworm' games, which LQ shamelessly borrowed from. Then again, it's fair game when you're taking from a company (PopCap) that made its fortune on Bejeweled, which was itself heavily inspired by a lesser known game...\n\nDo whatever you want, but play this game.

Now the concept itself was what enticed me to buy this game in the first place, but when you actually get into the game you start to realise that the game becomes rather dull and repetitive. The quests are relatively easy to complete, but the amount of "crystals" (the in-game currency) you get per quests are sort of miniscule compared to the amount that you need to even buy one upgrade when you get to higher levels. Each level also gets exponentially more difficult so unless you are a Scrabble genius or have been buying A LOT of upgrades, you wouldn't be able to pass the level, which just sort of turns this game into a grind hell.\n\nAlthough in saying that, I haven't explored the game enough to know if there is some sort of mind-blowing story or a very rewarding experience waiting for me at the end. I'll update this review when I have progressed further into the game, though for now I can't really give this game my recommendation for the torturous first few hours I am experiencing.","May 18","false","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Decent amount of upgrades\n\nCons:\n1. Gameplay is too simplistic for me. Too casual\n2. Very easy.\n3. Monsters varied but in an almost meaningless way\n\nI know there are lots of variations to the game. Each level has 5 obtainable stars that amount to at least 5 different playthroughs. Monsters have different abilities or conditions that affect your grid of letters. You can use the gems you obtain throughout the game to buy upgrades or items. But, in the end, it boils down to this - You are spelling words out and that is it. Whether you have a time limit, less letters to choose from, or a strict condition you need to follow, you are always just spelling out words. Just not enough for me to want to play or recommend to others.","December 9, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cactmari/recommended/373970/","cactmari","Cactmoore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cactmari/","172 products in account","Some time ago, I played the living eff out of the original "Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey", and I had a blast. When I saw the "Remastered" version in the Steam Store, I was about ready to buy a copy when I noticed that the developer had kindly given a copy to everyone who had purchased the original. There are two reasons I bring this up: 1., because I got the game for free, so any comment I have about the value of the game may be coloured by that, and 2., because it gives you a pretty good indication of how dedicated, friendly, and all-around great Bacon Bandit Games are.\n\nThe game itself is a pretty simple word game with some simple RPG mechanics grafted on top of it. Basically, you play as one of two Grim Reaper sort of characters on a quest to get pizza. For reasons that are neither explained nor relevant, hordes of colourful monsters are hell-bent on keeping you hungry. So, you battle these monsters by spelling out words from a random assortment, with longer and more difficult words doing more damage. These simple mechanics end up being quite a bit of fun.\n\nFair warning, though: this game encourages quite a bit of book-lernin', so if you're against educational games because of some sort of silly principle, avoid this one. On the other hand, if you'd like to brush up on your spelling and vocabulary, or you're learning English as a second language, or you just like word games in general, I would strongly recommend this game.\n\nHere's a list of a few pros and cons:\nPROs:\n- it has pizza\n- characters and monsters are fairly cute, if that's your thing\n- word games can be pretty fun\n- simple pick-up-and-play, casual gameplay that you can play in small doses, but is also addictive enough to keep you going\n- the game's dictionary is pretty good, and gives you the definition of every word you spell\n\nCONs:\n- sometimes the game's dictionary displays a less-obvious definition, which can feel silly. For example, I spelled "bean", and the definition I got was in the sense of hitting something, like a "bean ball", rather than the legume.\n\nAnyway, great game. Give it a chance.","September 3, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're at all interested in the genre, this is the game to buy. Anyone who's into RPGs will probably also enjoy this, though to a lesser degree. Overall just a fun word game with a lot of neat mechanics and fantastic presentation."\n\nIt's remastered. Everything is animated now, new soundtrack, tonnes of content (new modes). The definitive version of a great game!","January 6","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays similar to Bookworm Adventures except that you have a 5 by 3 grid (15 letters) versus Bookworm's 4 by 4 (16 letters).  Certain letters do more damage, but I found that the word length has the dominant effect.  The game throws challenges at you, making you play certain letters, play letters from specified rows, and including tiles with good and bad effects.  Various challenges like playing words that begin with a vowel either as a requirement or for increased damage really changed the way I pieced words together.  What I really like is that this game will give you the definition of the word you wish to play.  Several time, I would stumble onto words I didn't know while trying to form my own and actually learn something.\n\nThe main complaint I have with this game concerns the achievements and quests.  Quite a few of these will be attained the longer you play regardless of your skill level.  This kind of makes it pointless.  There are achievements that require\ncertain types of words like palindromes that are actually interesting.  It is also odd that there is an achievement and quest to play words with no vowels.  Y, and W are considered vowels at times, so I do not think words like SHY, and CWM actually contain no vowels, but that is what the achievement wants.  Mostly I find myself ignoring the achievements and I acquire them as I play the game regardless.\n\nI do enjoy playing this game though.  It is a good, challenging casual word game.","April 23","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enemies get tougher as you progress through the story mode, but you get to level up your attacks and health as you go. I think the dictionary is probably Australian English, it's not recogised a few UK colloquialisms for me, but seems to have been fine with some words I've picked up from Aussie TV shows. An easy game to pick up and play for 5 or 20 mins, nothing to offend the kids during the daytime and even captures their attention sometimes.","May 22","true","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With so many word games out there, it's hard to find one that shines brighter than the rest, but Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey Remasted does so brilliantly.  The visuals are appealing, the music is nostalgic, and the drive to complete your goals is always there.  An "Endless" mode is there to satiate your letter crunching once you've completed the meat of the game and does invite additional challenges or competition between friends, if you're old enough to remember when high scores mattered.\n\nIt's certainly not without flaw and admittedly, the last several hours I logged were simply achievement grinding with little emotional investment.  The second half of the quest mode becomes a breeze with the appropriate upgrades, but by then you probably don't care because you're working to tick off another achievement.  (Assuming you're as compulsive about that sort of thing as I am.)\n\nOn sale or not, I highly recommend this game.  If you were interested enough to finish this review, it's exceptionally unlikely this game will disappoint you.","May 30","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
