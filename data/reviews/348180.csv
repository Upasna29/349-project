Tin Man Games have pulled off another great conversion of a 32 year old book.\n\nThe story is based around the captain of a starship (you) who has been thrown into a black hole and ends up in another universe. You'll need to explore the new area, beam down to various planets, interact with different alien races, and try to find clues to help you get back home. At the same time, you'll need to manage your crew, and maybe get into a skirmish or two.\n\nThe music and grapics are superb, and fit perfectly with the atmosphere and sci-fi theme. The character creation & combat system are structured differently than The Forest of Doom. You can name your character and crew, and even your ship. All the stats will need to be rolled, unless you want to choose a predetermined crew (if you have no friends). Want to name your ship 'Serenity', and your crew after the characters in Firefly because you're still bitter about the fact they they only got 1 season, and Lizard Lick Towing has somehow got 6? Go for it! The combat system is slightly more complex as you control more than one character on occasion. You choose which crew members you want to beam down to unknown planets. You could choose your Medical Officer and Science Officer, end up in a scrap, and wish you'd taken a Security Guard or two, and end up losing one or more of them. There is also a quick battle option should you wish to use it. The artwork has been completely revamped from the original book as well.\n\nYou still get the proper Fighting Fantasy experience. Dice rolling. An Adventure Sheet. Multiple bookmarks (for all you grubby cheaters!).\n\nStarship Traveller also supports Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, and Australian game developers. Good luck to them! Trying to make a game with all those great big, hairy, sweaty, meaty deadly spiders running around can't be easy.","March 11, 2015","true","21.2"," 100 of 112 people (89%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","89","100","112","23","0"

Much more polish than the competitors I've tried (and there are a flood of them on Steam).\n\nI won't spoil the story, but suffice to say that Commander Shepherd, Miranda, and Garrus have had several adventures, in the 3 or so hours I've played so far, and each time the outcome was different - just like the good old days when I read similar books as a kid (I don't recall seeing any Fighting Fantasy where I grew up).\n\nThe menus are nice, and the game is customizable, so if you like a different font, or want the text smaller or bigger, you can do that. It's nice, and I picked up Forest of Doom as well, and can't wait to get into that one (I'm more a fan of the fantasy setting, to be honest).","March 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","44","56","6","0"

Basically this is a good thing, but how did it work out?\n\n-The presentation is nicely done in a overall blue tone and provides a solid sci-fi feeling.\n-The difficulty checks and other rolls are well animated and create a bit of tension when you're hoping for a "good" result.\n-The writing is okay, but isn't of the best and during the second playthrough it becomes rather boring.\n-Each adventure starts out the same and that is a big negative thing. The planets and things you encounter are always at the same spot and there's no variation in this. That makes Starship Traveller a strong game during your first game and a very boring one as soon as you start a second or third game.\n\nWould I buy this game if I knew about this?\nWell, yes, because I'm just the kind of person who likes to read and always liked these kind of books.","March 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

While I have no prior experience with the IP, the ambience and story are vaguely reminiscent of Star Trek and the like in terms of audio and overall presentation.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game/novel is quite unique among its genre since most of the CYOA stories I've read are bereft of any graphical (i.e., artwork injected into the text) and/or musical representations. Having these additions is a nice change of pace and helps to establish the atmosphere the developer is trying to create. Furthermore, this also includes a visually appealing GUI along with some customization options, which is yet another treat in this genre.\n\nEDIT: The Star Trek references littered throughout this novel are kind of amusing. For example, you carry "phasers," "beam down" to planets, have warp drives, wear the same uniform colors as the classifications in TOS/TNG, and when you select your ground team, the choice is labeled, "Make it so!"\n\nWill update once I've finished my playthrough in its entirety.","March 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","0"

The writing's bad.  It's probably one of the worst written Tin Man games, but it's also true to the 1977 original choose your own adventure book it was based on.  It's a kid's book; don't expect character development or plot twists.  Things are mostly predictable.\n\nWhat it does well is being a very straightforward Star Trek TOS inspired romp through a few alien encounters.  The battle and stats system is pretty well balanced, although it definitely is on the 'easy' side.  There are only a few possible ship battles, and maybe a dozen possible phaser/fist fights.  You can win the game being a complete pacifist, but not as a pass-the-fists (two key encounters require diplomacy; the rest can be fought through if you want).\n\nThe big downside is it's fairly limited.  There's not a lot of meat on the bones.  A couple hours to beat the game, a couple hours more to see everything and unlock all the achievements if that's your thing.  For full price, I'd say it's not worth it.  But if you can get it in a bundle and know you're not getting a game with deluxe treatment, go for it.","November 28, 2015","true","4.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Most of this is due to luck though so sometimes your mission may go on for quite a while or ends very quickly. Overall the appearance is pretty good though but no flashing graphics and just one sound wave most of the time. Its a good alternative to other action packed games and a lot of love was spent in making this but due to having to repeat many stages in the game (visit the same planets etc knowing what may lie ahead) then I cant recomend this which is a shame.","March 21, 2015","false","2.1"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","0"
