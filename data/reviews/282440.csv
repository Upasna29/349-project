The grind is a way to keep people playing when they have no other reason to play. Quake doesn't need the grind because the progression happens with you instead of your gear: You need to actually practice to get better at this game. And that is a lot more fun than grinding to unlock the next gun in some gear tree.","September 19, 2014","true","32.5"," 2,634 of 2,803 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","634","2","12","78"

We need you blood; come and quench our thirst. Well, actually, the way Quake Live is made, chances are new players will get to play between themselves and mid-skilled players mostly so I guess I'll have to wait for you to escalate the skill cliff. But please do so!\n\nSo what is Quake Live? Some might say this is a Free To Play version of Quake 3 Arena. There is some truth to that and this is how QL was identified since its inception yet there is more to it. Q3A had mods, QL tries to incorporate them into the main game instead. Q3A had a large community running plenty of servers, QL has servers ran exclusively by id software with the option for subscribers to spawn their own customized using this infrastructure. Q3A had a one time payment, QL generates its revenues through a subscription system. It's worth noting that despite being Free To Play, QL is not Pay To Win (and it's a shame that both expressions have almost become synonymous today).\n\nYou might still wonder why you should play QL if you have Q3A. Well the main argument is kinda lame but I'm afraid it is true nonetheless : QL is overwhelmingly more populated than any other Quake at the moment. But there are reasons for that! For starters, it's easy to get into. You press the "install" button, you start the game, you create your account then you click on "Play Now" and you're set. You won't be told you don't have the right mod installed or you lack a specific version of a map. It's easy (but you can still spend some time tweaking your config if you want to). The same argument can be made about the default gameplay itself and this is where things get somewhat controversial. Purists say the recent changes made to make the game more welcoming to newcomers are a travesty. While I agree that the new default settings are inferior for us experienced players, I'm still open to the idea that new players will have it easier and have more fun that way. You can be sure I will still be there in the servers running the classic settings, waiting for the courageous survivors who defied the default ruleset and want some more. In any case, QL is still very unforgiving, given your opponents catch on your mistakes. The best thing we can hope for is a larger playerbase which will allow tighter skillmatching and a better experience overall for everyone.\n\nFor those who don't know Quake 3 Arena or Quake in general, the above paragraph is probably kinda meaningless. Let me list some important aspects of Q3A/QL which make it a good game :\n- Fast paced. Well, I guess if you like taking it slow and camping in bushes with your sniper riffle in other games it's cool for you, but you're missing out on something!\n- Simple rules. Anybody can understand the objectives very fast. You know you have to kill more than you die in a duel. It's nothing hard to conceptualize.\n- Diversity in the weapons. Yep. It's not all a thousand variations of machine-guns, handguns and rifles. Unreal Tournament is arguably superior to Quake in this field but it's still worth noting.\n- Vertical gameplay. It may sound kinda stupid but this axis is a lot more in the typical map design of an Arena Shooter like Quake and it's a lot more fun this way.\n- Great movement system. Easy to use (WASD), hard to master (and it's so satisfying to fly around the map at high speed).\n- Gameplay depth. This one doesn't necessarily apply to every gametype but it is the most important point in my opinion. The game is old yet there's still room to improve for EVERY player. If you think Quake is all about shooting down enemies without thinking, you couldn't be more wrong. Sure, aim is part of the game, but you need to deal twice as much damage as your enemy if he has twice your health/armor because he controls the map better...\n\ntl;dr It's a good game and with the recent changes everybody should be able to get some kills and fun. Let's just hope you can have fun without winning every match, because we can't all be winners and chances are against newbies in that field.","September 17, 2014","true","392.6"," 842 of 949 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","842","949","3","27"

Here are some facts:\n\n1) They have been telling us to switch to Steam for over a year. The people who already had the game on Steam didn't have to pay a single cent, even if they weren't subscribers. The subscribers who didn't switch even though they were told to do so can mail support and get the game for free.\n\n2) The friends lists weren't saved because the accounts no longer exist. Just find your friends in-game and send them a friend request. We can do that in-game now through the Admin menu, something we couldn't do before.\n\n3) The game works on Linux with Wine/playonlinux.\n\n4) We have user-owned private servers and LAN now, something the fanbase has been begging for since the private Beta.\n\n5) We still have stats. Just not the stats from before the switch, as again, the accounts no longer exist.\n\n6) We can switch names now.\n\n7) Delicious, delicious UTF-8 support finally lets us use Unicode letters in chat.\n\n8) People are working on a replacement for QLRanks.\n\n9) The one-time payment is about a 3rd of the price of a premium/pro account, and everyone can do everything the premium/pro users could.\n\n10) We now have Valve Anti-Cheat. Cheaters who get banned now have to pay money for a new account.\n\n11) The new UI and settings menu are far, far better than the old ones.\n\n12) Watching demos is no longer a pain without 3rd party tools. We can now view our demos by pressing "Replays", there is a list of timestamps for each frag that happened in the game, and the new demo viewer itself is all kinds of awesome.\n\n13) SyncError confirmed that we'll be getting gibs DLC.\n\nThe update was great. Stop whining.\n\n\nUPDATE: QLRanks is now replaced with QLStats, which uses Glicko instead of TrueSkill for team-games, though in-game it is still called Elo. The difference between Glicko and TrueSkill is that Glicko is based on score per minute instead of wins. Duel still uses plain old Elo.\n\nAlso, a bunch of old OSP/CPMA/RA3 content is being brought in via Steam Workshop, so you will see a number of old maps with letter/number combinations instead of names being voted on various servers.","November 4, 2015","true","126.7"," 1,020 of 1,244 people (82%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","82","020","1","50","60"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OAKu/recommended/282440/","OAKu","OAKu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OAKu/","247 products in account","Over the past 6 years I've spent more time playing QL than any other game which comes out to an absurd amount of hours in-game. I'll do my best to summarize the experience and why you should definitely consider getting into it.\n\nA few things you should know before you get into Quake:\n\n1) This game is the most difficult FPS you will ever play. The core mechanics are easy to understand and it's simple enough to grab a weapon and start shooting so the mantra "easy to learn, hard to master" applies, however, The skill ceiling is so high that no matter how many years you pour into it, you'll never hit it. This quality makes Quake very daunting for core FPS audiences. Many of the pro tricks take months of practice in order to pull off at just an elementary level.\n\n2) Even if you're really good, You're going to lose. A lot. Quake doesn't have an artificially level playing field like most modern games. Quick deaths and large spread fire hitscan weapons do not exist in the same fashion as Battlefield, COD, or just about any modern FPS series. If you are worse than the player you're up against you are going to lose. People who want undeserved wins or prefer the casual experience aren't going to feel comfortable in Quake Live. The people that play have stuck with it with aggressive loyalty because they have the mind-set of someone who enjoys learning something no matter how hard it is. You play because you can appreciate the skill that it takes to be good. In this way, losing in Quake is actually fun, in so far that you can appreciate the player's skill that you lost to.\n\n3) Even with the recent modernization update, the game lacks certain casual nicities that gamers have become accustomed to. A list of some mechanics QL is missing: Regenerating Health, Headshots, Ridiculous amounts of Ammo, Instant kills, Standing still to limit weapon spread, Low speed cap on player movement, Stamina, Loss of velocity while jumping. These mechanics have become coliquially synonymous with the "tactical" FPS. You'll find that the removal of these features actually promotes tactics a lot more than what you get from the Counter Strike or COD formula.\n\nWhat is Quake about?\n\nItem timing, Physics exploitation, Map control, Accuracy, Situational awareness, Reading your opponents, Setting traps, and Rockets everywhere.\n\nWho will enjoy Quake Live?\n\nGamers that are okay with losing and can respect the reasons that they lost. Gamers that find it enjoyable to learn how the physics engine in their game works and how to take advantage of it. Gamers that don't like frags being handed to them because of a lucky shot.\n\nIf you spend the time to get familiar with Quake you'll find that it's the most rewarding experience there is in the FPS genre. When you first pull off the Bridge to Rail jump in Campgrounds you'll shriek with delight. When you win your first duel you'll giddily tell people who could care less about games about it. The better you get the more accomplished you feel and there is no end to how good of a player you can be. The pros are bested all the time by some new blood with ungodly talent and dedication.\n\nIf you put in the hours you'll also find one of the most loyal and dedicated communities that there are in gaming. There's sure to be an influx of typical gamer culture trolls in the first few weeks but the people that have stuck it out with Quake, I'm sure you'll find, are some of the most level-headed and respectful people out there.\n\nGLHF.","September 17, 2014","true","266.2"," 385 of 448 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","385","448","2","16"

It's worth playing for free and if you like it, you can Subscribe to gain access to launch your own server in a specific location. These servers allow you to choose the gametype, maps and other misc settings such as timelimit, fraglimit, movement options and join password. Subscribers also receive extended stats, additional spectator features and the ability to create and join clans.\n\nAlongside the Steam release, loadouts were introduced into certain public gametypes to help cosey in new players. Quite simply, you can choose a primary and secondary weapon that you spawn with (rather than just the machine gun) and continue to play as you would before... picking up every other weapon, health and armor on the map whilst killing your opponent. Loadouts are fine to an extent, however the problem currently is that there's no easy transition for the new player into the Quake Live many competitive players want you to learn (there are some other differences such as weapon respawn times too). This is a non issue for Duel as the public gametype is the competitive gametype, it has remained unchanged. However for TDM or CTF you must have one player launch a gameserver via Subscription and enable the "Legacy Settings". This is a potential barrier as it requires free-to-play players be invited to such servers if they haven't yet subscribed. But please don't let this deter you as it's not a brick wall, easily overcome given the low cost per year if addicted. For new players to the franchise it should not matter, you'll find the grass can be greener and find your way into the competitive community and such servers in due time anyway.\n\nI played QL competitively under the TDM and CTF gametypes from 2009 to late 2011. I also competed for Team UK in numerous Nations Cups during this time. I may not play as much as i used too now but it's definitely worth picking up if you're new or returning to the franchise. It may miss some features present in the Quake III Arena modification CPMA (such as Clientside LAN Support and Multi POV Spectator), but it comes with ease of access and everything mentioned above. Tournament organisations can also contact the development team to obtain dedicated LAN servers for their offline events, this hasn't been an issue for ESL, DreamHack and others in the past.\n\nQuake Live is an extremely rewarding game on any skill level and is by far the best Arena Shooter on the market as of 2014. It's not perfect, but it does exactly what it says on the tin. With how easy it is to jump in and out of game you'll always find yourself going back. I could not recommend this game enough!","September 17, 2014","true","94.9"," 179 of 210 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","179","210","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcmy2k5/recommended/282440/","marcmy2k5","marcus82","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcmy2k5/","42 products in account","This game used to be great. I played Quake 3 competitively for many years and I considered it the greatest of all time multiplayer FPS. Quake Live kept the same formula and even made it even better in some ways. That is until recently. Just before launching on Steam, QL did a "major gameplay update", in which the game now has loadouts for all of its modes except for Duel. For some game modes it works, for others not so much. Let's take Free For All for example.\n\nYou used to start with just machinegun, which is a weak weapon that requires precision aiming to be effective. Most of the time it is going to be totally inferior to any other weapon depending on distance. This means you have to run away from enemies and find more powerful weapons on the map, and learn to use whichever weapons you do have to your advantage. So if you run into a weapon that isn't so easy to use, say Plasma Gun, you're forced to learn how to use it more effectively because there isn't another weapon around for you to fight with. This teaches players to be better overall and makes the game a lot more fun and more dynamic. On occasions where you can't run away and you need to use MG, your only hope is to have some damn good aim and good dodging skills. Once you've gotten yourself geared up, armored up, and powered up, you gotta keep what is known as map control, by timing items and preventing others from getting them.\n\nNow that you can just spawn with Rocket Launcher, Lightning Gun, Railgun, or Heavy Machinegun (which imo is overpowered as it does about as much dmg as LG but has unlimited range), you basically have newbies running around spamming powerful weapons without a care in the world. It gets boring REALLY fast, and I can only stand to play one game of this anymore before I have to quit for months at a time. The skill factor is gone, and thus the fun factor is gone.\n\nThe game has lost its competitive edge over other FPS games. I'd almost rather play CoD, but I don't fancy a game where you can kill other players just by looking at them for a split second.\n\nAnother thing, QL wasn't at this years DreamHack, I wonder why. All I have to say is it's a shame they've decided to try to cater to the masses, and in the process lose the one thing that made them special.\n\nEdit: I want to address some comments that say "loadouts are optional". Yes, you can play on classic servers, but there's so few of them depending on the game mode. Whenever I look at FFA, there's usually only public servers. That's where people are playing. So it's more accurate to say classic is optional, and it usually isn't an option.\n\nAnd to those saying the game isn't pay to win, doesn't have gear grinds, leveling, etc. I agree, it is still Quake in that regard. But loadouts isn't far off. Getting weapons and outmanuevering your opponent with skill is what Quake was all about. Humiliating someone with gauntlet when you ran out of ammo, killing someone with MG when they have RL because you can dodge and aim and they can't. That's Quake. That gave it depth and character. Now it's just a boring spamfest.","December 1, 2014","false","27.0"," 453 of 601 people (75%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","75","453","601","20","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/recommended/282440/","StarCraftZergling","StarCraftZerg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/","102 products in account","Because this is one of my favorite games of all time and this has single handedly started my childhood gaming, it's hard to say this game is entirely bad. I have grown up on games like Doom, Duke Nukem, Blood, and Quake and Quake Live is the definition of "Blast from the past." Online First Person Shooters will NEVER reach this level of originality and awesomeness. Quake has really set the bar high when it comes to online FPS games, and even to this day I feel that Quake can NOT be matched by any other online shooter. It's fast paced, skill based, heart raced, and nothing beats the haste! (I will never rhyme that bad in my life again.) But, I digress. Quake is a game that actually takes your brain to play. Not like Call of Duty where there is a marker on your screen telling you "Bad guy here, shoot him in the face... You got him! Way to go, here is a rank, a badge, a gun, an upgrade, and for $14.99, you can make your gun look like a snow-dog! That's a cocaine covered turd! And also, I forgot to mention, since you love this game, I bet you can't wait for next year to play the same ♥♥♥♥ing game again with a different title! We're just as excited! By the way, nice job on killing that bad guy rookie... ENEMY UAV IN MY COCKHOLE!!" No... That's the stuff in modern FPS that is redundent and is considered a desperate call for money. Quake, gives you the option of being a pro member. Pro members get certain perks in-game and are allowed to create matches and what not, but if you don't buy pro membership, you can still play most of the fun and exciting things that made Quake the game it is today! (Which honestly I must say Quake has made a turn for the worse and I will explain why right here.) Although not all gamemodes are affected by this change, Quake as implemented a Load out system for a few of it's game types. This is a MAJOR WTF moment... How could they do something this ridiculous? They made it Call of Quake! I know, I know... It's not EVERY gamemode and I should keep it cool, but seriously, the fact that they even decided to do something like that is beyond me. It's like a serial killer saying that he will kill his wife, son, daughter, and dog, but only kills the wife. He didn't kill everyone else, but the fact that he did that ♥♥♥♥ and even thought of doing it more was what landed him in jail and turned him into a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Again, I digress. The update was added to make noobs feel better and give them more of a fighting chance. To me, that's BS! The pros who are already good are now going to be able to slaughter the noobs from spawn to time limit even easier! It's not helping the noobs, it's catering to the CoD ♥♥♥♥♥s. Let the CoD kids, be CoD kids. I don't want an 8 year old kid coming into the game and writing #noscope for everytime he gets a rail kill... Or complain about how I'm lag switching and that my mom is tossed around like a joint at a Cheech and Chong concert, that ♥♥♥♥ needs to remain on CoD.\n\nNow, as for a final verdict: As I have said before, Quake is one of my all-time favorite games, so it's hard to say that it's bad to the point of no return, which it really isn't! It's just some little things that made the game "eww." OH and another thing, I liked the old announcer better. This new fruit cake isn't scary and threatening like the old one. This new guy sounds like he has something stuck in his butt hole and he's trying to remove it by squeezing his ♥♥♥ cheeks. I don't feel like a bad ♥♥♥ when I win anymore, because I have Richard Simmons telling me "Blue Team Wins..." Instead of Liam Neeson with a bad cold telling me "You Lose..." So I'm not motivated as much anymore. So, the rating I give to Quake Live is a 8/10. The microtransactions are minimum compared to modern FPS, and some things like the announcer and Loadout stuff needs to go. Other than that, the game is solid, fun, heart racing, fast-pased and enjoyable for noobs and pros alike. (Not if they are in the same game of course.)","September 19, 2014","true","46.5"," 138 of 182 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","138","182","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Actionpoohole/recommended/282440/","Actionpoohole","x69| BaRLS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Actionpoohole/","451 products in account","I love Quake but this is a Negative Review on the Overall Quakelive Experience coming from a Veteran player since release of the Quake Series.\n\nThe Engine and Game is primarily Quake 3 with some minor and major changes.\n\nThe minor changes are the structure of the game menu. No longer do you enter a full screen started menu for Quake. It is now a social window that allows you to browse for games, add and chat with friends, make and add people to clans and is basically just CHAT & Choose your game.\n\nGetting into game from this new design is easy and quick.\n\nThere are more modes now like Red Rover and Freeze tag as well as many others.\n\nSo it's basically a ramped up Quake 3 with More Modes and Team Arena Weapons are included. There is now a HMG too.\n\nThe game usually works smoothly and only the Veterans can sense small issues in weapon hit registration if there are any server hicups.\n\nThis game craps on noobs. It also puts lower players in servers that better players cannot join. This is fair enough bit it divides the already small community. And putting the noobs and vets together wouldn't work either due to the sheer high learning curve of the movement and weapon mechanics.\n\nIn one way, Quakelive was a step forward from Quake 3... In other ways it is a HUGE step back. No custom maps are allowed... Only the maps that Quakelive Choose to host. You don't actually host your own server, you're using their servers so people who aren't in perth or sydney or adelaide get the highest pings. Most people who connect from Australia to New Zealand get huge pings... But when they connect from New Zealand to Australia they get lower pings than what we get to their servers.\n\nYou cannot choose any custom maps and Quakelive are so slow at introducing maps... Especially the blatantly obviously missing maps from RA3 that they slowly feed to us with a drip.\n\nAfter a while quakelive stagnates and feels like groundhog day. It's bad enough the game being run on Quakelive Engine... But the engine causes FPS problems even with decent cards. You'll need to have a very good card to play even a basic game.\n\nMy GTX 770 ran it fine but my 9800GT won't run it smoothly on large maps or even some small maps with weird "lighting".  However I used even less than a 9800GT to play Quake 3 smoothly... Go Figure??\n\nHosting your own games is great... You can edit weapon variables in the Create Server Menu that allow you to change weapon firing rate, weapon damage, projectile speeds and even accelleration of rockets and plasma and even movement physics can be altered hugely. Add weapon vampirism and Headshots as well as a plethora of settings to allow you to create a game or mod that is completely unique. However, if you want to change small things you have to kill the server and then change the settings, restart the server again... These changes should be allowed to be modified while the server is running to allow for a more streamlined mod creation experience............\n\n...............That is when you run into the server not shutting down locking you out of re-creating the server.... Then no response from E-Mail support.... Read on about this:\n\nThe service provided by ID and/or Bethesda is absolutely shocking.\n\nGood luck getting an E-Mail response even if you pay for Pro subscription (Which provides you access to full E-Mail Support as well as creating servers and Clans)\n\nThey do not respond unless the question is deemed valid and/or easy to respond to.\n\nIt's like angry little children sour at the world moderate quakelive.\n\nSponge and SyncError have social interaction problems (2 WebMods/Moderators/Devs for ID who sit around in their IRC chat room and pretend like people don't exist even when they clearly are available to chat and who have the ability to moderate quakelive accounts and servers... It isn't their job to do that but if E-mail support doesn't respond... What do you do next? They are the next step and they are useless, rude and arrogant aswell as childish)\n\nSo the game is great hosted by a bunch of morons who don't give a crap about you.\n\nThe only reason I still play QuakeLive is because there is nothing better right now. I can see that changing in the following 1-4 Years as there are far better Arena shooters coming out.\n\nCHECK OUT: http://reflexfps.net/         <------------------ This is what I'm waiting for. It's available as Early Access on steam. It is incomplete as of 19/02/2015 (Today).\n\nI see promising things from this developer.\n\n\n\nQuakelive Gets a 4/10 and only for being easy to access and because it is essentially Quake 3, one of my fave ever games. Otherwise Customer Service gets a huge thumbs down with a 0/10.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is Quake 3 heavily modified for a "better experience". The game has close to Zero customer service. They don't reply on Steam. They don't reply to E-Mail. They don't respond on IRC Chat. You cannot use custom content such as weapons or maps. The menus for moderating your own servers basically doesn't exist. If you don't know your way around Quakelive already you'll be asking questions that the game itself should answer for you along the way but somehow it just expects new players to know things that Veteran players like myself have spent a long time figuring out. This game plays well at most times but expect nothing more than just a browser based modified Quake 3 experience. That is all this is and that is all you will get. Just forget about this title unless you're a Quake Veteran or don't mind spending the next 6-12 months getting even close to on par with the Vets. This game needs a fresh coat of paint but releasing it on steam changed nothing.\n\nI still play this game because habits die hard.","February 19, 2015","false","416.7"," 158 of 229 people (69%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","69","158","229","14","8"

It introduced me to a style of FPS gameplay that, unfortunately, is long lost today: A shooter that values tight, meticulously balanced arena gameplay over silly things like "leveling up" and "unlockables". The progression in this game happens not with ridiculous aesthetic-type items or extremely overpowered weapons becoming available, but with you yourself. You watch your own skill grow and grow at an ever-increasing rate, and gradually learn more about the underlying mechanics & how the game itself works, which is a MUCH more satisfying feeling than finally obtaining that "72ΘnΘ$¢Öp£l@dd£r$hºt¢ro$$themÅp" rifle.\n\nHowever, over time, it seems that you developers have tried to pander to the masses and "dumb down" your game in an attempt to attract more people to the game. I could easily complain about the far too easy-to-use Heavy Machinegun, which was an unnecessary addition in itself, but there has been another recent addition which I and many others find far more offensive: Loadouts. The very word strikes fear and rage into the hearts of Quake lovers, and for very good reason: It utterly destroys that which made the Quake games so lovable in the first place. Now, you don't have to fight for that hard-to-get rocket launcher anymore, because now EVERYBODY can start with one! Suddenly, studying the maps & learning important spawn locations isn't important anymore, because I can just immediately spawn with my Railgun and start kicking butt. Not only is it annoying for everyone on the map to simultaneously wield Rockets or Rail guns, but it takes a very large strategic layer away from the game. If I spawn with the exact weapons I want to start with, then there's no satisfaction when I earn a kill with them because hey, if I die, I can just spawn & try again!\n\nWhat's even more frustrating is that I have to pay to be able to find custom games with the "classic" system in place. Why make us pay for the mode that the majority of us prefer, and make it limited to custom games? I believe I speak for the majority of Quake Live players when I say that you'd be doing yourselves and us a favor by putting the old style of play back in place. The FPS genre has already witnessed enough of a dumbing down- we don't need one of our most beloved old-school games to have the same happen to it.","September 28, 2014","false","37.5"," 70 of 97 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","70","97","0","3"

Quake III was the first game that I purchased to play over the Internet with people.  It was released in 1999 and it is still around today as Quake Live, which proves that old can be better than new.  You might read many bad reviews, but please know that many of these were due to the changes from a stand-alone game to Steam.  Unfortuantely, many people do not like change, and this was a big one.  HOWEVER, the change was for the best in my opinion.  Quake Live has gained custom maps, voice chat, dedicated player servers, steam interaction, etc.  Quite honestly, this was the best thing for Quake Live as we now have a game that is in the most active PC platform.","October 26, 2015","true","698.6"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","1"

Just be aware that this is without a doubt the worst incantation of the game. I started initially with Quake Live back in 2009. The supply of duelers wasn't great, but skill levels were on an order of magnitude closer than what you'll get in just about any other title in the series. This makes for a great introduction to the intensity and fun of one on one combat, but the duel scene eventually subsided in NA and disappeared entirely over the course of two years. For the better part of three years this game has been dead in everything except Clan Arena which you'll quickly find players get very egotistical over what is essentially Quake with two thirds of the gameplay removed.\n\nThe pricing model for this game is one of the worst I've ever seen as you're essentially paying for basic things like voting in maps, playing classic modes, playing with mods, playing more maps, and playing different gametypes. These are all things which are basic in other FPS games which have been restricted to allow iD to suck as much money out of the community as possible. This money does not go to improving the game, as evidenced by the continued ignorance of community input about features and additions they'd like to see done to the game being ignored for years now by the largely incompetent development duo.\n\nIn effect this model also killed the duel scene as you could no longer enjoy the 8-10 maps tried and tested to be good for duels (the ones run in tournaments) and instead forcing you into the vast number of amateur and terrible maps which have no place in duel servers and not allowing you to vote for anything unless you pay.\n\nThe mod community is also non-existent due to having to subscribe to have your servers hosted at the horrible iD rented server farms and inability of adding any custom settings or maps beyond typical command line tweaking.\n\nI don't expect this game to hold a critical mass for much longer than a month or two, but if this game is fun for you I'd advise you to check out some of the free alternatives such as:\n\nWarsow\nXonotic\nQuakeWorld (Quake 1)\nCPMA (Quake 3)\n\nThese games all have low player counts and may require you to operate IRC, but they're still played today and well worth the effort to get into as they love teaching new players.\n\nIf these games are too old or dead for you, continue to play Quake Live for however long it has left and consider playing something like Reflex when it's released.","September 18, 2014","false","11.9"," 191 of 313 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","191","313","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/282440/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: The shift to a pay up-front model has currently got the community in a stir, but to those who haven't yet bought it, Quake Live is a direct update of one of the finest shooters of all time, and this $10 package gives you so much content that it's hard not to recommend to anyone.\nQuake III is a classic game. It's simplified the weapon roster from previous Quake games, and refined movement systems and map design, and it was an instant hit. Every weapon had its advantages and disadvantages, and it was easy enough to pick up and play without ruining the competitive scene too.\n\nQuake Live, when it first came out in 2009, basically took that and re-tweaked some of the damage output for the meta, changed the UI, and stuck the Quake Live logo in every level. The original Free-2-Play model worked well for it; several dozen maps were available for free, and anyone can play them, but for $4 a month, players can access nearly four times as many maps, have access to several game modes, and can have set up clan systems.\n\nA few things had changed before the big jump. Bethesda had bought Id in that time, and updates to Quake Live were on the weird side. The game originally was an in-browser game, and it had then been migrated to Steam, but still retaining the web UI on the main menu. Players could also join premium servers and play alongside pro players, but they couldn't host it themselves.\n\nOn the 27th of October 2015, Bethesda announced that the game had now completely migrated to Steam. The UI is much better, the game now uses Steam profiles directly, and has Valve Anti-Cheat incorporated. They also got rid of the premium model, so now everyone can do everything in the game. And finally, Steamworks integration now allows 16 years of map making history to be shared and developed easily across the community.\n\nEveryone is peeved though that Bethesda never mentioned anywhere that the game would now not be a Free-2-Play game. It now costs $10 to those who had never played it before. Yes, that is a bit of shoddy business practice, but it doesn't ruin the game in any way. In fact, I think it improves it. Rather than paying $4 a month, the $10 up front gets you full access to all the content all the time. And there's definitely more than 2 and a half months worth of content up for grabs. There's nearly 150 maps in deathmatch alone, and Steam Workshop support keeps upping that number with quality and interesting maps.\n\nThe rest of this review is more an evaluation of the game itself.\n\nQuake Live has about 15 weapons on offer, and all of them have their strengths and weaknesses. Like any classic Id game, they're designed to be superior in different map scenarios, and maps are designed in a way to showcase all of them. My favourites are the plasma gun which fires slower moving huge balls of plasma, dishing up massive damage per hit, but it's tricky damaging people from a distance. The rocket launcher is a classic weapon with its large-ish splash radius, and the ability to do rocket jumps everywhere.\n\nPlayers also move around very quickly, which encourages skillful aiming and finesse with timing weapon shots. There's a lot of emphasis on moving fast and trying to outsmart your opponent while landing hits of your own. Rocket jumps are easy to execute, and provide a risky outtage to any fight, encouraging learning map layouts, hotzones, and power-up locations.\n\nAnd it all comes together really nicely. Fight for a bit, try to restock on supplies, and then find another fight. Dying is a quick second break until you get thrown back in. Every game mode revolves around this simple draw the enemy concept. Maps aren't huge, so it's never difficult to find some action.\n\nQuake III is a bit of an old game, so the visuals are a little here and there. Particle and lighting effects are still quite well done, and new textures on maps keep a good amount of visual variety. The model detail is a little lacking in some cases, but the overall level of visual fidelity is quite low, which means you can run this game on almost any computer you own.\n\nSound design is also a bit here and there. The music shows its age a little bit, and isn't available on every map, which leaves a bit of an awkward silence. Weapons make some pretty characteristic sound effects though, and it's always satisfying to hear that little blip sound every time you deal damage to an enemy. The new main menu music they added in the recent update sounds exactly like the menu music from Doom 3 BFG, and it just seems out of place, especially since all demonic imagery from Quake 3 was removed.\n\nDon't be deterred if you see negative reviews or posts about this game though. It runs flawlessly on any hardware from the past ten years, it's fun, fast, frantic, and is ridiculously easy for both new and pro players to play together. With a bazillion maps and game modes on offer, a great community, and lots more free updates coming along, Quake Live is an excellent game that everyone should try out, even if you're not a big FPS fan.\n\nRATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.\n\n0 UPs        1 UPs        2 UPs        3 UPs                Not worth playing, skip it        Alright, play it if you're into the genre        Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying        One to go down in history, a must have for everyone\n0 DOWNs        1 DOWNs        2 DOWNs        3 DOWNs                Nothing detrimental in the game        A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it        Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it        Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do","October 28, 2015","true","28.0"," 105 of 173 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","105","173","6","0"

Quake 3(live) is a FPS game released originaly in 1999 by iD software, and it's one of the pioneers of the e-sports scene. This game is one of the most hardcore experiences ever, with a large arsenal of weapons and various other power ups, you find yourself battling across multiple arenas and in multiple game modes that are fun and just as intense. Quake live has so much to ofer in a generation of modern military coridor shooters, I don't even know where to start. Any game you start, be it a TDM, CTF or pure Deathmatch is such an adrenaline rush, it makes you think this game was made on cocaine. The sheer speed and precision needed in Quake is unmatched by any shooter out there. With fast respawn/kills, and a new upgraded loadout system, it makes a perfect blend between the Arena shooter and a fair and ballanced FPS game. Dedicated servers work just fine, tight responsive controls, this is a must try. And it's free also, so you have nothing to lose here. If you never tried Quake, you will find yourself in a easy to learn - hard to master game that will provide you with plenty of content to burn out hunders and hundreds of people and hours in this absolute classic. A must own/try .\n\nThe best:\nTight responsive controls\nProfessional shooter\nOne of the best shooters ever released\nKick-♥♥♥ weapons and maps\nBallanced gameplay mechanics\nEasy to learn - hard to master\nDedicated servers and great community (Quake players are mature people who grew up with hardcore shooters in the 90')\nFree to play, no paywalls, no "special items to buy"\nLoadout system ballances the ARENA metagame and makes respawning fair for everyone\nHundreds of maps, a couple of multiplayer mods to ensure hundreds of hours of content\nNo regenerating health, killstreaks, cover, nothing. Pure action.\n\nThe bad(ahahaha, really?)\nOutdated graphics (for some, for me it's just fine)\nNo ingame voice system\nNo ranking system, may be a bit too brutal for newcomers\n\nA personal 10/10","September 18, 2014","true","42.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","4"

Once a player has reached certain 'checkpoints' in development it becomes very hard, if not impossible, for a player of lower skill to beat this person. Progressing in Quake is a game of losses. Learning how to lose is key. This is of course difficult in a tournament setting, although certain thresholds will be quicker to be overcome as there is a tremendous amount of competitive pressure to do so. The low skilled devour the lower skilled.

It just feels better.\n\nIt's still Quake Live though, and while you get it for free if you've ever played it before on Steam, it's still a scumbag move to make a game from 1999 cost $10 when it has been available for free for quite many years now, and without notification.

Game was there for free with certain limitations that you could remove via paid subscription. I didn't expect game would be coming to Steam, and when it finally did, I've launched it, all anxious and eager to play. However...\n\nQuake Live via Steam is the first ever Pay-To-Free-To-Play game. The concept is pretty radical - you get a game for free, but for EVERYTHING ELSE you have to pay. I can pinch an idea: make key bindings customizable for 2,99 monthly subscription!\n\nWhile I can somehow understand the concept of Quake Live on its own website, releasing a product with so many limitations and asking for 35 bucks per year for decade+ old game just to unlock basic stuff such as  creating your own game is completely senseless. Steam is friends-based social network and gaming store and I could understand ZeniMax working to squezze some wallet juice by implementing new cosmetics or via totally, TOTALLY cheap DLC's, but this? This is outrageous and I'm basing this opinion of mine on the fact you can get Quake III Arena for 19 € or even with -75% discounts during sales. Regularly.\n\nPlus... silly and never before seen (for a good reason!) weapon loadouts, server caps for free players... it's downright arrogant.\n\nNow... who do you think gamers are? ♥♥♥♥ing idiots?

From the notes, there's no way I can't say ignore this game now and go back to cpma Q3.\n\nAfter trying out the standalone again though, I'm glad that CA and Duel have 95% been untouched.\n\nNew heavy machinegun : Completely replaces the standard MG.\nAuto hop : cg_autohop 0. You don't need this active, in fact it will mess up your stair timings and give you unwanted results. Also if you know how to strafe jump, this just slows you down.\nDamage number display : Helps me out in knowing how much my rockets are doing, however it does allow you to track through walls better as long as the number is still up. Personally I would like to see this go.\nNew VO (Voice Over) : It was an unneeded change but after a while you can block it out.\n\nNow for the worst of the worst...\nItem timings : There's no need to count out your powerups anymore, you go near the PU spawn and it will tell you when it's up.\nLast but not least, weapon loadout : No one, and I mean no one asked you to follow in activisions footsteps. I realize that you want to appeal to more gamers but quake was never meant to be easymode. To be waiting for an item spawn and only to have someone spawn right next to you and eat a rocket to the face or get railed isn't entirely what Q3/QL gameplay was supposed to be. You go build up your stack and then goto battle, you're not supposed to be babied.

Understandable.\nLet's first talk about that update.\nThere was alot of discussion about it.\nThe main topic is the new price, which is 10€. It was a bad move from Bethesda, just changing the price, thats for sure. But everybody who already had the game on Steam, keeps it in their library & can still play it. Also the Premium feature got removed, which makes nobody have advantages. The update also gave us a full Steam Support & making your own Server for you and your friends (which was a premium feature before). Also there was discussions about the removed Linux Support (Yeah, because so many people play on linux.). Im sorry about the people on Linux who can't play anymore.\n\nSo I personally think it's not that tragic and people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing too much and giving inappropriate ratings about the game, which itself is very good and funny, especially if youre playing together with your friends.\n\nI don't support the idea of making a game 10€, but in this case we got something else from that.\nAnd YES I recommend you buying this awesome game!","November 19, 2015","true","8.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

I have always heard of Quake for years and years, and this game is seriously one of the best if not THE best online first person shooter game I've ever played.\n\nGameplay (10/10): The players are hostile and competitive and the action is fast paced and quite different at first until you get the hang of it all. But easily the gameplay is what makes Quake Live what it is.\n\nGraphics (7/10): The reason why I say this is the fact that this game is an updated port of the 1999 Quake III Arena title. So while the graphics are very simplistic and not at all like the more known shooters of our time, the art and map design  are simply brillant so it makes up for it.\n\nControls (9/10): I love the controls. The game is very fast paced like I said, so the controls are kind of the same. Might not be for some people. But it comes over time.\n\nOverall this game is just a great FPS especially for the fact it's free to play. Also they are not scamming the players with a free to play system like the others. It does have a premium features but all it includes is additional maps and the ability to make private lobbies, which really isn't a big deal.. Honestly, I'd pay money for this title if it wasn't free quite honestly. The game is simplistic, bare-boned, and filled with no holds barred action.

Don't buy it, even heavily discounted, unless they fix UI/matchmaking/OpenGL rendering.\n\nWhile the game was partially on Steam, it was pretty much a great Quake2/3 "sequel", with small but dedicated community and nice way to play old maps on really good working engine. However, it's not anymore.\n\nSince the game went full Steamworks (and, by the way, from Free to Play into 10 euro product) - it wen't to crap, and i can't recommand it anymore. Even while i got to keep it for free, even while i can now host my own servers, it's just not worth your time (and money) anymore.\n\nFirst of all, for some idiotic reason Zenimax/iD decided to change something in graphics engine. It's either not openGL anymore, or they've just missed some setup, point is - while nobody played Quake Live for visual fidelity, i liked my anti-aliased, clean, neat and simple look of the game. Now it looks like ♥♥♥♥, and you can't even force FSAA from driver level.  Suddenly, from quite polished albeit oldschoold product, it changed into what looks now like some indie asset flipping Unity turd. Way to go, Zenimax!\n\nBut that's obviously not the main issue. The interface now is just bad. You want to just jump into quick match? Well, bad luck Kevin, now you need to browse through 100 empty servers manually. Because apparently automated matchmaking system was fine in F2P product, but it isn't in 10 euro product. Match browser got dumbed down from pretty cool filter based UI to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "one-search-form" tag system. And it's just inconvinent and sluggish. Way to go, Zenimax!\n\nDid i mentioned that all servers are now empty, since all players got their statistics/achievment reset? Personally, i don't give a crap. It's nice that i can now unlock Steam achievments. But in reality, it does matter. Becuase there is simply no players any more to get the achievments with. As a Q2/3 player, i often just jumped in Quake Live to play on The Edge (q2dm1) or Longest Yard (tltf) not giving crap about other/newer levels. Guess what? Nobody plays them anymore, and even now everyone can setup server - it just dilluted the server pool, effectively creating thousands of empty hosts. Way to go, Zenimax!\n\nI can imagine the game had problem keeping up in F2P model with host subcribers. But it's not problem with the price, or even with achievment/stat reset. It's problem with really, really bad patch, that messed up a lot of polished components of the game. Even such minor stuff like fonts are now wrong/glitched.\n\nAll you had to do was implement Steam achievments and put 10 euro pricetag on this game. Instead, as developers you decided to fix what wasn't broken, and broke the last quick paced online arena shooter. It's not Quake Live anymore. It's Quake Dead.\n\nDon't buy this game, go for old Quakes or Unreal Tournament alpha instead.\n\n","October 31, 2015","false","13.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

The game is based on the multiplayer-only classic QUAKE III ARENA (Dec'99). Because of that you'll meet an elite of gamers who are into that game over a decade!

There, problem solved for 90% of the complaints.\n\nHackers have been a problem because they have been able to continuously make free aliases without penalty for hacking.  With the introduction of VAC and buy-to-play, this lessens the problem.  Free-to-play and competitive shooters do not mix, ever.  This is a good change.\n\nQuake Live costs less than Q3A and has a greater population; those who are saying "just buy Q3A lol" are full of ♥♥♥♥.  There's no logic behind that, only saltiness.\n\nHowever, $10 for a game that is going to stop being developed?  Reflex is also at that price point with occasional sales, is in alpha and is basically Quake now in the hands of competent people who know what they're doing.  Reflex is probably a better future-proof purchase for new people.\n\nQuake is great, but I have to unrecommend QL to new people until they lower the price to something more realistic.\n\nTL;DR too much unjustified whining from ex-players, but $10 is too much for new players due to Reflex also being $10 and still offering the Quake experience and actively developed.","October 28, 2015","false","92.2"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","31","56","0","1"

Features such as "weapon loadouts", universal ammo packs and pip timers decrease the crucial aspect of weapon/item control (Quake's defining dynamic). On-screen damage numbers were introduced. A new weapon was introduced to fill the "assault rifle" niche, the one niche that is neither needed nor wanted... and the LG, a crucial core weapon, was nerfed to allow for the new weapon to exist.\n\nImprovements to infrastructure could have added value to their subscription model and help vanquish the image problem that plagues Quake. Instead the misguided, destructive and cynical approach is to dumb down the game and hide the "proper" game behind a paywall (a classic ruleset is available if you subscribe...).\n\nQuake is a strange game and always has been, and is very hard to make work in a large scale in the modern gaming environment - but this surely cannot be the way to do things.\n\n(I have not played the Steam version yet, but have played Quake in its various forms casually for over a decade and played the update that included most of these big changes.)","September 17, 2014","false","0.2"," 159 of 304 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","159","304","0","7"

The game should have cost a nominal fee to play and be free, with no tiers or subscription nonsense, from the beginning. You should have been able to play all maps, against bots, locally, since the beginning (or at least consistently, because they've waffled back and forth on that over the years). There should never have been a wonky, half-♥♥♥♥♥, web-based launcher at all.\n\nThis game, as it stands now, with the move to full Steam integration, in November 2015, is the game QL should always have been -- a worthy extension of Quake 3, the best damned deathmatch game ever.\n\nBut, no. They're charging too much, and although I don't give a damn about stats because the complete mishandling of this game I should have loved without reserve put me off from getting too involved years back, there's no freaking way they should have trashed the stats of people who've been playing it regularly for the last 5 years. The fact that they thought that would be OK just shows the utter contempt for (or total lack of understanding of) their player base that has seemingly informed nearly every decision along the road.\n\nIt's a bummer, because it's too late. Hardcore players who've been into Q3 for 16 years, or even hardcore QL players who've come to it in the last 5, are going to continue playing. But nobody's going to pay 10BUX for this game if they weren't already a fan.\n\nWhich makes no sense at all, yet again. They spend time fiddling with stuff to make it more accessible for 'modern players', but just alienating old-schoolers. Then they wipe everybody's stats and start charging ten bucks for a once-free game (with ludicrously dumb subscription tiers, now thankfully gone, at least) which will drive off casuals, but once again alienating old-schoolers who they've now made their primary potential purchasers.\n\nIt has been, at every step over the years, as if they actually didn't want anybody to play this. If that was the goal, they've done one heck of a job trying to achieve it.\n\nAll that said, though: I love this game. I recommend it. I think this version, as of November 2015, like I said, is what it should have been all along. I'm probably just going to use it to fire up localhost Nightmare bot matches, like I've done for a decade and half with Q3, just to relax, but that's all I ever really wanted. A modernish, better-looking, easier-to-launch version of Quake 3, with an easy way to find and add new maps when I feel the urge.\n\nAnd that's what we've got. I'd probably even pay TENBUX for it if I didn't own it already, but just barely, and it's been my favorite deathmatch game since Q3Test in 1999. Which means your average CALL OF DOODY player almost certainly... won't.","October 28, 2015","true","5.8"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","21","38","2","1"

Rockets actually appearing to fire thirty seconds behind actually firing, lightning guns that didn't hit, the players I was shooting being thirty seconds in the future. Latency problems aside, the game is Quake 3. Now, don't get me wrong, Quake 3 is awesome, but Live adds new features that have brought the rage and hatred of veterans.\n\nA change I didn't like was picking your starter weapon.\nNow, I cannot comprehend why they would do such a thing, as part of the fun in Quake 3 was scrambling to find a weapon more powerful than your starting maching gun, and for me, it was trying to find the rocket launcher before anyone else, but here, it just gives you a rocket launcher. Now, I both love and hate this, partially because new players can spawn with an instagib weapon immediately, and partially that I can spawn in with a rocket launcher, ready to confuse and juggle anyone with the poor judgement to enter my line of sight.\n\nSo, one thing to make Quake Live better is to have better matchmaking, taking location into account, so Australians and other people who live in countries far, far away from where the main servers are, can get into a decent game that doesn't cause a temporal anomaly, and maybe reduce the starter weapon pool to weaker versions of the guns.\n(i.e a mini-rocket launcher that has rockets do less damage, and have a smaller blast radius.)\n\nUntil then, however, this game is a no-go from me.","October 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","23","42","0","3"

We move on.\n\nThe game is a first-person shooter. EXTREMELY fast paced. If you're coming from a game such as Call of Duty, you WILL need time AND patience to get on your feet in this game. With that said, once you've found your ground, the satisfaction of shooting a rocket at an enemy while airbourne to bring them down, or finishing them off with a rail. None other compares.\nMany game types, so it ranges from a solo player to a team player, everyone is satisfied.\nThe game mechanics are a little weird in that movement is more inclusive from the player's side meaning that the player will have to become skilled at movement as they progress through the tiers. Remember, you're a hot knife going through butter, be that knife in battle and you'll do great things.\n\nHighly, highly recommend this game to others. If not for the sake of the history of Quake, then for the sake of the game Quake. You will NEVER play a game like this, I guarantee it.\n\nThere is a huge, diverse group of players from all over the world playing here, and many of them are skilled.\n\nPatience, determination, and enjoyment. Seriously, this is actually a great, fun game. You'll be fine, newbie. ♠\n","September 17, 2014","true","403.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

They sprung a price of $10 on the game and it's made a lot of people unhappy.\n\nI enjoy playing Quake Live. It's the most fun I've ever had playing a game, and the most I've ever played one specific game. It's easy to keep coming back to time and time again, because at the end of the day it's a pure Arena Shooter - every game starts on equal terms, and it's down to player skill how it goes. Loadout servers are the exception, but those servers are boring ;)\n\nSome people are arguing that now the game costs money they'll just play Quake 3 instead, but Q3 is still rediculously overpriced on Steam. Buy this instead, and you'll actually be abl to play with people. If you're sitting on the fence, wait for it to go on sale.\n\nThis game's had it's problems, but it's a classic everyone should try it.

Quake is one of the better end fast paced shooters out there, making for great gameplay for all players. My one problem is I use to play Quake live quite a lot in the past. When I came back to try it on steam, the client itself seemed to be extremely slow or laggy, even when I got in game on the lowest graphics possible it still seemed to be extremely choppy and laggy. I meet WAY past the minimum requirements to run this game yet I can't seem to run it. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the client but I've done my research and many other players seem to have this problem. While this doesn't matter to some of you crazed fast paced gunman already in game, it kinda blows it just to want to play the game and have it run like this. I can definitly recommend this game to anyone that likes fast paced competitive shooters, but just hope you don't get the same problem a lot of us are having. So in conclusion, good game, I recommend, just some problems.","January 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

If you dont like them and think they are too casual, dont play on those servers and stick to classic quake. Duel hasnt changed at all and CTF doesnt have loadouts in classic or default.

Does your son use Quake?\n\nQuake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school.\n\nIf your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school.\nHowever, this review is not about Quake. It is about Quack Live, where players run around like they're on quake crack. It's much better than that "CS Go Away" rubbish that everyone raves about. But not as good as UT. They made some stupid decisions like the loadouts and universal ammo features. Unlike UT though, people actually play this. And it's free. So play it. Or not. I don't really care.\nEdit: It's apparently not free anymore. But if you had played it on Steam before, you get it free anyway. Hey I mean if Toxikk advertises "No F2P" as a selling point, why not Quake?","September 25, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are unfamiliar with the Quake series then this game is a super fast-paced multiplayer FPS which combines skill and strategy to pit players against one another in a variety of different game modes and maps. Despite the pure brilliance of this game many sorry people still choose to write negative reviews on this game. Most of these people are either hard-core fans of the classic Quake games and would complain of any changes made to their much beloved Quake 3 Team Arena. The other people are just plain idiots.\n\nYes, just a few months ago at time of writing this game was 100% free-to-play on Steam. And now the game costs $9.99 ($1.99 Steam Sales), which I am honestly surprised Bethesda didn't charge for this brilliant game from the very beginning. These idiots who played the game before the paid update were constantly told to change to Steam for this game before it became paid to recieve a free copy like me. But for many that was obviously much to hard and depressing when the paid update came.\n\nSo new players are probably wondering why should I buy this brilliant game, perhaps cause you permanently recieve all the benfeits that some fools used to pay $40 a month to subscribe to before the update!!!\n\nThe update itself improves the game massively with a new much easier to navigate interface, lobby hosting and so much more which players had been requesting for years! The game itself is something you must commit to a few hours a week to become competent/competitive somewhat like csgo. Except csgo is not a thoroughly modern revamp of one of the best FPS games of all time! Bethesda has finally made good on all their promises for this game and Quake Live is more worth it now especially at Sale time than ever before. 10/10","February 1","true","170.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kos-mosu/recommended/282440/","Kos-mosu","Kos-Mos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kos-mosu/","96 products in account","TL;DR There wont ever be a Arena FPS on the same level as Quake, RIP Unreal Tournament & Arena Shooters in general.\n\nPut simply, the Ultimate Game of Skill.\n\nThere's no easy way around it, no arguements to settle... simply no reason to disprove the statement above; because no other game offers the same mechanics like Quake does, arena shooter or otherwise. We can't even compare its age old rival Unreal Tournament, since that game has been chopped and changed throughout the years... its really just a cheap knockoff. (Not taking out UT99's Facing Worlds... excellent map) Quake's formula remains unchanged since its original incarnation and has stood the test of time.\n\nAnd plus to compare any shooter to Quake is like comparing Apples to Oranges.\n\nQuake is set apart from other FPS or Arena shooters by having a near perfect engine for precise control and movement, very efficient netcode carried over from the excellent netcode of Quake 3 means that the game feels like a LAN-Party even with 50-100 ping... however I don't recommend playing games over 100.\n\nThe gameplay also differs from the fact there's no random variables, no luck based elements involved. The entire game is set about by "chance"... the chance that a rocket might hit... but that is all controlled by you the player, since every weapon has 100% accuracy and movement is considerably faster than any other FPS. There are no "headshots" or easy kills, it simply doesn't exist and therefore does not hold your hand in the chance you 'may' get a random headshot as such. If someone kills you repeatedly its just a sign they're a far better player than you are.\n\nThis system allows people to play with consistency that isn't often seen in other games, you never really lose the skills you had in Quake... more likely people just get better than you are, the engine is timeless. There's also Map Control to consider, don't want to pick up items? Expect to respawn very quickly. You simply can't play the traditional gametypes successfully without trying to get the items on the map, you don't start with power weapons (loadouts are now an option thank god) and thus you're at a tremendous disadvantage the moment you spawn.\n\nSo with no easy entrance for beginners why do I recommend this game? Quake is the only game that offers a true 100% skill based Competitive Experience, the fact there's no random variables should be plainly obvious. Games like CSGO do have an excellent competitive community (though salty D:) , but there is always going to be a random element in the game. The Quake Community is truly amazing, do poorly in a game vs a better player... they'll critique you, give you tips etc... you get the odd elitist but the reception overall is awesome. :3\n\nAlso the new update is great imho... sure its Pay 2 Play... but so was Quake Live Premium and that was BS. If you had Quake Live on Steam beforehand you got it free... so why all the commotion?\n\nStands the Test of Time. 10/10\n\n","January 9","true","103.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its free, its competitive and its fast paced.\n\nIts also worth noting that the new changes (like loadouts) arent mandatory and many players arent playing gametypes or on servers that have loadouts enabled. If you dont like them and think they are too casual, dont play on those servers and stick to classic quake. Duel hasnt changed at all and CTF doesnt have loadouts in classic or default. For everything else there are clasic servers.\n\nQuake is still Quake. Only you can now decide if you want to play the newcomers ruleset or the classic.","September 21, 2014","true","304.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rothko2/recommended/282440/","rothko2","ʀxthko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rothko2/","18 products in account","Quake Live is my favorite game. Why? It's fast-paced, takes skill, makes you laugh, and is pretty cussin' fun.\n\nQuake is often described as a game that's easy to learn but impossible to master. You can get set up quickly and a sense of why the movement, gameplay, sounds, and visuals (as old as they are) are intoxicating. And, yet, some people have been playing for years, are scary good, and it takes some time to learn the game to compete with them.\n\nIt's had many iterations and, like chess, is really well balanced. As I read in a post once, in Quake you don't wait to get better weapons or items to improve, when you get better, you realize it was your own hard work that got you there. And it’s totally gratifying when you can start to hang with folks who schooled you before.\n\nI can see how some people are critical of some of the changes (and I myself miss the Quake 2 Capture the Flag days). But to be honest, the addition of new maps with the Steam conversion has breathed new life into the game.\n\nA tip for the newcomers: learn to weather the curmudgeons. One of my favorite things about playing Quake Live is the community. If you play often you get to know people and joking around with them is half the fun. However, there are some sour grapes in the mix who will treat you poorly and might kick you off a server. So, a) you might need to learn to have a thick skin and b) consider starting with the Free For All games at first before joining some of the team games.\n\nBottom line: Quake rules. Join the party.","January 18","true","225.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Subscription model was the worst and added no benifits what so ever besides able the play the game THE RIGHT WAY. Locking majority of the good maps and modes for a fee a month is not right, and before you say "The Clan" stuff thats pointless as well to me.\n\nI played this back in 2009 when it was in beta first hand and was happy to see the graphics to be slightly updated, modern options. but hated the locked out maps, modes, and sometimes just seeing what other players skins where like at times. The removal of Gore and gibs Im fine with its minor compared to the core of the game of Q3A and TA.

Not showing any interest in its player base, clans. Neglecting the fact this community has put lots of effort and time into better organizing matches using external tools to balance skills on servers running team based modes such as TDM, CA and CTF. Neglecting the fact many of these players have been playing and supporting Quake since the nineties, organizing tournaments, writing mods to enhance and improve teamplay, etc. etc.\n\nWith this change to the Steam platform people have lost their playerstats, their clans, their lists of friends and most of all the desire to play the game any longer. The result is games where the good players disconnect out of frustration over the many unskilled players destroying any form of teamplay.\n\nQuake WAS a game for high skilled players and was at the cradle of e-sports when it first appeared.

Not showing any interest in its player base, clans. Neglecting the fact this community has put lots of effort and time into better organizing matches using external tools to balance skills on servers running team based modes such as TDM, CA and CTF. Neglecting the fact many of these players have been playing and supporting Quake since the nineties, organizing tournaments, writing mods to enhance and improve teamplay, etc. etc.\n\nWith this change to the Steam platform people have lost their playerstats, their clans, their lists of friends and most of all the desire to play the game any longer. The result is games where the good players disconnect out of frustration over the many unskilled players destroying any form of teamplay.\n\nQuake WAS a game for high skilled players and was at the cradle of e-sports when it first appeared. Now it has turned into a nubflooded waste of time.\n\nWell played Bethesda, you have finally managed to kill Quake.\n\nWe need the Barrysworld and Q3A times back.

I did enjoy the game when just about everything was fine. Now, it's almost devoid of players.\n\nWhen I played this game around the first week, it was fun. I played in servers that had healthy amount of players and the game modes were fun. This continued for a great time and I enjoyed hanging out with old and new friends alike.\n\nThen, for no reason, lag greatly increased (it has nothing to do with my internet connection whatsoever) and I believe since the issue was not fixed, it has hurt the community a lot. A lot of servers are empty and they all have a ping around 100 (the best I can find is 50), though sometimes, there may be only one server with a handful of people. This problem hasn't been fixed and most likely contributed to the decline of players.  If not, then the hype surrounding this game has gone away, due to the subscription plan and an update that had outraged dedicated fans.\n\nIf you still want to, you can download the game for free and play offline with bots. Other than that, I do not recommend to get a subscription plan for a dead game. As of now, I was glad to have played Quake Live before it withered away into oblivion.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2015/10/28/a-quake-live-steam-update-raises-the-games-price-from-0-to/\n\nJust recently, the developers now try to make money off of a dead game and literally f*cked the community over with no lube. GG. Thank goodness I quit the game long ago.\n\nIf it's too long, here's a summary: Developers these days. namely Overkill and whoever made Quake Live the utter dogsh!t it is now by charging $10 bucks, proves there is no care for the gaming community at all.","March 8, 2015","false","13.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","3"

I was a fan of Quake, Quake 2 and Quake 3. What I love about QuakeLIVE is they took a very difficult game to get involved in, because of; patches, mods, maps, servers, configurations, and the other details you might need to look into before you started playing. Now QuakeLIVE takes Quake 3, touches it up, makes it super simple to get playing, patches automatically and now even gives you the ability to have a membership that allows you to host private games.

If you rail people right, there is a man who tells you that you are IMRPESSIVE. The man has pretty low standards though because he thinks that just two rails is enough to be IMPRESSIVE. Nevertheless, there is no other game that even comes close to the quality of railings you can dish out (or recieve, if you are one of those queer folk).\n\nIf I ever have sons, I will use this game as a tool to teach them about railing at a young age. It is important for role models such as myself to instill proper enthusiasm for railing. Today's corrupt fem-positive society teaches boys from a young age that rails are wrong and they should not do it. As men, we have a duty to fight against government-funded brainwashing of our sons.

I could not really enjoy that mode, so eventually I quit.  Now it's back with a few modifications.\n\nThe biggest change is a positive one imo: you get to start out with 2 weapons of your choice with a little bit of ammo. This solves the problem of getting spawnkilled all the time because you only have the machine gun (and the gauntlet) and the enemy has a fully loaded rocket launcher, lightning gun and heavy armor. At least now you are able to defend yourself with your weapon of choice and it allows you to jump straight into the action.\n\nFinding a game is even easier than it was before: just pick form a category you want to play and it will find a game for you (a la Team Fortress). It seems all the game modes are now accessible for everyone (including Freeze Tag, yay!). There are some new game modes from Q3: Team Arena, such as Red Rover and Harvester.\n\nI guess the community will get quite an influx of newbs, but that is fine (more fragfood, heh), at least people are still playing Q3. This is just the uncomplicated multiplayer fun I was looking for. No unlockable weapons/perks, no hats, no (god forbid) pay-to-win; just the old-skool fragging.","September 21, 2014","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And let me say that Steam did it a good deal by taking it over, all together removing subscriptions for 'premium' which only gave maps. And only maps. As well as a private server. So by taking away a crippling payment system for the F2P on steam, they made it P2P for those who didn't switch and kept it for those who did, simply because it was in their library.  However, the only negative effect was on the Game Mode, making you pick up weapons instead of getting the full onslaught at spawn with one to pick from. But the updates brought VAC, Code Patches, and updated UI that didn't rely on web-pages, Unicode goods, and many more improvements by Valve which are overlooked for a measly 10$. And for what? Because a child can't ask ma for something?\nThings that are free aren't always going to remain that way, and I enjoyed this a lot, even with a few negatives, the positives outweigh them immensely.\n\nPlease, if you have the money for a quick-paced, kill or be killed, KILL EM ALL type shooter,\nGive this a shot.

A five+ year old game that was free now costs money? Thanks, Bethesda.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nI recommend this to everyone, but especially people who have never tried Quake or people that are looking for a good old game.\n\nGreat quake game, fast paced first person shooter. Very fair, everyone has the same capabilities and leveling up is not here.\n\nMy one problem: the menus are the worst menus out of literally any game I've played in my life. The menu is not built in: it is loaded from the internet EVERY time you click on something. So, if you want to play a game, it needs to reload the game selection screen, etc. and if it decides not to work you're out of luck. I couldn't change matches today because it didn't work. I couldn't even get back to the selection screen for different modes.","September 20, 2014","false","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It features a super tight community of players that basically end up as close friends giving each other ♥♥♥♥..

I will Reviewing this game after 10 hours  on 2/2/16.\n\nWhat to know!\nQuake Live is an online arena FPS, It is very fast paced especially compared to most modern FPS games and requires quite a bit of skill and alot of skill against experienced players, however Quake Compared to other games like it allows new players to easily learn the basics.\n\nQuake Live is very accessable but players will most definely need a mouse as a trackpad or controller is hard to control at high speeds. If you stop or hit a wall most of the time you might as well be dead, it is a veryyfun game to play against friends as it is easily runnable.\n\nMany people may ask:  "Why should I buy this game over Quake 3, as it only seems to remove gibs"?\nI would reccomend this over Quake 3 for the following reasons,\n\nThe Game is easier to access, the lack of gibs keeps a low age rating in most countries.\nGames are easier to find and it is easier to play with friends\nIt recives more updates keeping the game as optimized as possible.\nFinal thoughts!\nI think Quakelive is a great game even for those new to the series, It is fun very faced paced and even though it requires alot of skill it is easy enough to learn if you want to put the time in.\n\nI would say this game if well worth it's price tag and prefer the paid system to the old subscriber one\n\nI rate Quake Live ♫♫♫♫♪ out of ♫♫♫♫♫ (4.5/5)","February 2","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beef4104/recommended/282440/","Beef4104","Painbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beef4104/","61 products in account","The Quake series is classic. It's probably the most influential shooter when it comes to online arena/deathmatch  gameplay. If you haven't spent time playing it yet, you've missed out, and now is your chance to make up for that by testing out the waters with Quake Live.\n\nSo what exactly is Quake Live? Quake Live is basically a free game of the year edition remake for Quake III Arena. Same graphics engine, very similar gameplay, except it has significant patches to the netcode and functionality. But best of all, it's on now on Steam. Unlike modern shooters, Quake won't reward you for getting kills with airstrikes and UAVs or ammo drops. The only thing rewarding in Quake is your skill.\n\nQuake III Arena in particular had a lot of gothic art and influence, which hasn't been dropped out of Quake Live, although it seems a bit minimalized. Quake is probably the reason I turned out emo/goth/scene/indie. When I was a kid it exposed me to blood, gore, and gothic art. It's weird to say but Quake was my first FPS ever, and actually had a profound influence on how I turned out.\n\nIf you loved Quake or even if you still haven't played it, download Quake Live now and start fragging away.","September 26, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly we don't have constant Asian servers so I dropped it. Quake live is all I can ask for a fast-paced FPS. It has pretty much everything done right and is full of love. Only bad thing is no mod and (most importantly) private dedicated server support, which I suppose is because of the business model. It sucks but I don't necessarily hate that as it enables the F2P model. I'd choose to better expand the community than my personal needs everyday of the week, assuming ID do their jobs responsibly.\n\nThere's a lot of hate around the new face. I don't understand the mindset of those 'hardcore' players whining about loadouts and timers because the changes made it too easy and ruined the game. Yeah, how DARE they made the mechanic more accessible to new players so this dying genre could get a new chance. Not to mention organise all those tournaments, develop new engine and polished interface, set the basic game F2P(which is not restraining at all to ♥♥♥♥ING CASUALS) so the community may actually grow which of course means nothing to the hardcore esport. We need to pay for a full featured product? How dare ID suck money on the game they created in the first place. What a RIPOFF.\n\nTo clarify, they didn't change it entirely. Think of a Casual Mode (as in counter strike).\n\nAfter an update, Pro subscription is only useful to spawn a server (not hosted locally but 'rented' on the master servers). No gameplay features are limited afaik. I bought a 2-month and found it useless..","September 20, 2014","true","167.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commandroidstew/recommended/282440/","commandroidstew","The Wrongest Trousers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commandroidstew/","121 products in account","One of the most perfect Arena Shooters ever made. Still retains that speed you remember and it has a ton of listed gamemodes that I'm sure someone will find their home in. Freeze Tag, Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Duel, Domination, etc. And the connection feels pretty good, or at least I haven't noticed any strong connectivity issues or lag with the servers I've played on.\n\nQuake Live updates the original Quake III with some changes like adding loadouts, which consist of a 'primary' and 'secondary' starting weapon. You can still pick up the many various weapons throughout the maps or off dead players, like usual, it just gives people some more opportunities to get started without waiting for a Rocket Launcher or your favorite weapon to start blasting some fools. At first it seems really scary, but I think this change quickens the pace and I definitely see it as for the better.\n\nI can't comment too much on the new maps, if there are any? I assume there are. Because there are certainly maps I'm unfamiliar with. I dig most of 'em. A few kinda have a weird flow to it that I'm not really sure I find as fun as the others, but they're still pretty solid maps. I have not seen all of 'em.\n\nOther changes:\n-There's a new weapon, the Heavy Machine Gun. It's definitely stronger than that starting one. *shrug* I dunno seems alright, I don't use it at all.\n\n-Damage numbers. I don't think these were in the original. It's been so long. But it's definitely useful seeing how much damage the AoE of that rocket did.\n\n-The powerups have a visible cooldown so that everyone can more easily understand when Quad Damage is available or whatever. This definitely makes it easier for new players to understand when and where they are supposed to be. I totally dig this change, because I'd NEVER be familiar with the timing otherwise.\n\nA couple complaints...\n-You can't vote to change a map unless you pay for the ability to both vote and make your own server. I suppose I don't really see what else you could pay for so that they could get some cash off of this free-to-play version of Quake III Arena, but I'm not the biggest fan of the voting aspect.\n\n-The other big issue is that, at least when I play (mid-day or at night) there are a whole lot of empty servers. The community is seemingly tight and I wish there were more servers with people playing in them because this has been the only first person shooter I've ever not got frustrated with. Community seems to be pretty alright, the ones that are there.\n\nIn the end, I recommend giving this a go if you love arena shooters or loved Quake III at the time and wanna relive the days where everything you did felt so good. I also want you to give it a go because I need to see some new blood in here. Or old blood. Quake is old. You are old. Play this old game. It's everything I want in a shooter and I was a child-baby when this game came out originally.","February 24, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, gone are the nice fun people I remember staying up all night with. Now we have kids running the tiny scene who seem to be carbon copies of the kids running the CS scene.\n\nWith such a small community, you'd think people would want to welcome newbies/oldbies, but it seems the hubris of today's children doesn't have time for such little formalities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/282440/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Despite the lower playtime shown on Steam, I am an older player of Quake Live before the game went on Steam. I decided to just now convert my QL account to Steam since the external launcher will be discontinued, even though the Steam version of QL launched quite a while ago. I started my account on December 21, 2009 with a total of 3:04:18:51 Ranked time and 13:19 Unranked time. In addition I have amassed several Awards over the course of my QL playtime.\n\nQuake Live is basically the free to play version of Quake 3 Arena. That's all there really is to it. This is not a bad thing at all, because Q3A and by extension QL both have the one unique and strong point of the game: the gameplay. A true fast paced arena shooter, Quake Live lends itself to quality competitive gameplay relying not just on reflexes but also timing and positioning. Knowing how and when to use multiple weapons for the right situation along with mastery of movement options such as strafe jumping are key to high level play. Item timing is also crucial, leading to the necessary map knowledge across Quake's varied map designs. Most of the competitive play is set in Duel, but more casual modes such as Deathmatch and Capture the Flag also exist. A personal favorite is Clan Arena, granting all players all the weapons and full health and armor, perfect for practicing techniques in a team based gamemode. Whatever gamemode you pick, the gameplay is refined yet complex with many options available at your disposal.\n\nSince Quake Live is pretty much a reskinned Quake 3 Arena, it looks and sounds much like its predecessor too. The graphics have not been updated too much, looking like an early 2000s game. I find that the graphics aged well and that it's not terribly ugly, while still maintaining clean visual clarity for competitive situations. The sounds are still good quality, and it is important to know what is happening in the middle of a fight with unique sounds for everything. While music is not a very important thing in a competitive title, Quake 3 Arena's soundtrack is quite nice. It's a bit dated electronic music, but still holds up for a good listen outside of the game.\n\nQuake Live is one of the best competitive FPS games around. It is essentially a repackaging of Quake 3 Arena, but it has all the solid competitive gameplay that still plays great along with a strong community around it. The game overall has been more streamlined for a modern, smooth, and great experience. While the changes from the developers might scare some, they shouldn't since at its core, Quake Live has the unique gameplay that holds up strongly for a rewarding and competitive game.","October 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But I almost becoming more and more aware of it's issues.\nThe fact that "skill based match making" is more of a lie then a truth, is pretty disturbing. Why throw someone who's only played for 2 days in with people who get 40 kills on average per game? That's absolutely no fun for someone just trying to understand and comprehend the physics and actions of the game on a level where you can actually compete against other decent players. I want to play this game a lot, I want to spend a lot of time in it, but it's really just no fun having to play against the same 20-30 people that are on the servers in my area every single day. I feel like my review would be much more positive if there were simply more people playing this game on a daily basis. Someone who's played this game for 5+ years has a major advantage over someone who's only just starting, and it really ruins what appears to be a really great game. I can't say that many other games have had genuine "skill based match making" but this game seems to completely throw that option out of the window. Where are the servers full of new players? Where are the servers for veterans to duke it out? I feel like if this trend of dealing with large portions of highly skilled players with no alternatives but to play against them are my only options, I may just stop playing. I want to like it, but the lack of actual players in decent amounts kills my interest daily.","September 28, 2014","true","37.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I remember the game being really fun,  so I decided to go on ahead and download it and see if anything has changed...oh how my heart was broken.\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that I have over 100 hours into this game back when I played it on a daily basis. Then I bought CS:GO and that kinda absorbed my life, but I digress. The point is I have a lot of experience on this game. What really caught my eye is that you have to now pay to play the game. After playing it for an hour or so I didn't really see any differences between the old free version and the now paid version. Another thing that caught my eye is that it now doesn't play on Mac or Linux, which really confused me. After I downloaded it and ran it, the UI was completely different and confused me, but afer a few minutes of going through the menu, I got used to it. I then went to the servers to find that this game is a completely desolate. Almost all of the servers had no people in it and the ones that did were packed. So after a some time of me searching for a server that I can actually join with people on it, I joined one. Once I joined in a freeze tag, everything basically seemed normal. The gameplay was the same and nothing seemed different other than voice chat.\n\nIn all honesty, this doesnt feel like a Pay to Play game. I've read multiple articles on why it was no longer FTP, and the only reason I could find was that now all players had the same benifits as the now dead subscribers, which were "the map voting processes, having full access to customize their game to the same degree as others (which honestly I don't see the difference between customization then and now) and having the ability to run their own Listed Servers and configure their matches to their own liking." (Shaun Prescott on "Quake Live is no longer free-to-play") This doesn't feel like it's worth the 10 bucks and I strongly recommend you do not buy this game.","May 6","false","109.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, every change I mentioned below can be turned off/on by voting before match or by server owner. Most negative reviews are based on removing game from limited free-to-play model (with monthly/yearly subscription for full game) to fixed price for full game, without subscriptions.\n_______________________________________\n\nThe best adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced arena shooter. Basically, this is an updated version of famous Quake III Arena (released in 1999) which adds new game modes, maps and other content making the previous formula funnier then ever.\n\nIt is known that Q3A was hard to master, players needed a lot of practice in order to be competitive in online matches. Same thing is with QL, but this time, more attention has been paid to beginners:\n- some nice tutorials with video demonstrations on mechanics (strafe and rocket jumping) and practice arenas are added\n- online matches are a bit easier for beginners because different ammo clips for different weapons are replaced with universal ammo clips\n- timer for armor and powerups is added, so every player will know when exactly they reappears on map\n- starting loadout with one weapon (many negative reviews are based on this feature but I don't find it problematic).\n\nThese changes makes every player a more difficult opponent which wasn't a case with Q3A.\n\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth a try. Personaly, I learned my first FPS steps in Q3A and it helped me a lot in every FPS game I played.

Back in the older days this game was basically the same thing as Quake III Arena where you start off with the Machine gun and the gauntlet and then find all of the other weapons around the map. The game itself is still a lot of fun to this day, the combat gameplay is still the same as it was years ago, Just my only complaint goes to the loadout options where you can start off with an overpowered weapon and dominating all of the other opponents which makes the combat less of a challenge. My reason to that is back when you started off with the machine gun, the combat was more difficult when someone with the lightning gun would spawn kill you in the matter of seconds. With all of that being said, the game is still a whole lot of fun. I will recommend this game to the players who like free-for-all or CTF combat without the constant raging like in CoD(I'm not comparing this game to CoD). If you're a huge Quake fan like i am then you will be very confused at first with the game mechanics but the combat is still pretty much the same as in Quake III Arena.\n\nEdit: Feel free to add me, my username is tlp","May 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The subscription model that's been here before didn't "save" the game apparently, but at the same time, if you've been playing it, you've got no reason to complain. Why's that? You can still play the game if you ever had it installed on your Steam account. You didn't have to ever paid Bethesda for their shoddy subscription, but to have been here after QL was moved to Steam. And that's been already ages ago, so if you're here to write a one-liner "REVIEW" coming from a "QL pro", get out. It's still a barrier to new players, but the game's turned out to be too unprofitable to exist as a freebie, which is odd in a way, and mentioned again down further. Then, how many have actually still got this game? You might think in thousands, but it's in millions. Hypocrisy is easier than it seems.[steamspy.com] This isn't a proper review either however, I'm mostly rating the changes.\n\nWith all the removed features from when the game was still web-based, I can't recommend this at all. There's no skill tiers, which means you're joining players of a random skill level. Stats have been reset, though I'm pretty sure it was easy to import it with a bit of extra work that would be paid by newcomers, after the payment change. No server rentals either, you're hosting servers on your own PC now if you want to do it from the game's interface. And the weird thing is, what is actually justifying the payment? Bethesda doesn't even have to run any servers anymore, since there's always going to be some made by users - tho' I don't know if it's possible to get dedicated ones. It's gone the opposite of Team Fortress 2, and it's CUT OUT the features it used to distinguish itself with from other FPSs. Quake 3 and even the open-source derivatives are just better without all the gimmicks, but sticking to the premise of being an arena shooter.","November 2, 2015","false","4.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But now that they made it Pay to Play, I think that the playerbase is going to go down by a lot and it wouldn't even be worth your time to be buying. If they added some DLC content, I would not mind because that is what most free to play titles do, and I still enjoy them. But since they made it Pay to Play, the game is just going to die out. Also, this game is from 1999, you can get a newer version of it with better features for the same price. My advice, dont get this game, it is not worth your money, nor your time.","October 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

However, I didn't have to pay for it, and I never gave a rat's ♥♥♥ about the friends lists or stats (stats don't mean ♥♥♥♥ to me on any game besides being a milestone counter, and all my quake-playin friends can easily chat with me outside of Quake, so...) so this update didn't sting me nearly as hard as some of the other reviewers here.\n\nWhat you get for the price is a whole lot of game. You get basically everything Q3A had besides the "Campaign" mode, which was just a bunch of loosely-connected bot matches, which you can do on here anyway. You get it all basically for half the price Q3A goes for on here (which honestly, should've been $9.99 for a long time now anyway.) It's a good deal. The actual game itself is not trash-tier in any way, really.\n\nDark Times Ahead In This Industry\nHowever, I can clearly understand the anger anyone who DOES have to pay who already played this previously is feeling. Even people who didn't have to pay are angry. Bethesda is sullying their own reputation and it's making me anxious about buying Doom 4 at this point. Where does it end? If you pay them this $9.99 (or whatever the hell the equivalent amount is in your backwoods country), you're basically telling them it's okay to do s**t like this. Remember that recent Deus Ex scandal where they had some absurd pre-order "tier-list" to try to get more people to pre-order it? Remember how it backfired so badly that Squeenix/the devs totally canned it outright? Remember the outrage over SW Battlefront's stupidly-overpriced-and-completely-vaguely-defined $50 Season Pass? These publishers are sick in the head if they think they can get away with all of this.\n\n...Except they are. Because they keep doing it, and people keep giving them money. I hate Steam's review system. I can either say yes or no. The actual game you get is great, but the actual business decisions that were executed to make this a reality are scummy and non-transparent as hell. I wish there were a neutral option. So I'll hit "yes" if ONLY to recommend the game itself. The price could be much worse. But people who already slapped down the money for the PRO Subs are the ones who got it the worst. Their subs have been rendered completely invalidated and they don't get any refunds nor any sort of reparations for their plight.\n\nThis is what's going on in this industry today, people. This might sound melodramatic but it's the fu**in' truth. Don't ever pre-order a game again, regardless if you like it or you feel enthused by the bonuses. Don't ever trust mainstream non-independent reviews again. Don't buy into any of it. Most of these "reviewers" out there have no clue what they're even playing. They just give games high scores and ignore most of the glaring issues so they can continue receiving their fancy exclusive press kits and all-expenses-paid trips out to "press events". Hope you spineless integrity-lacking c*nts enjoy your fancy meals!

I still have it in my steam library for some reason so I guess I'm lucky but seriously what the hell?! The entire point of having this free to play was to have people be able to play a version of quake 3 without needing to pay money for it, that's it. Seriously instead of wasting money on this just wait until a steam sale happens or something and play the original Quake 3 (for some reason they're asking 20 dollars for that one, makes no damn sense). Oh by the way, the Steam Workshop is just another way for them to get to paid mods or something and try and keep the already dead game alive. The irony of this is that, as of now, I can be 99% sure that the Quake 3 Arena has more players playing on their servers than Quake Live.  You know how many empty servers I saw when I opened this up (out of luck that it was still in my library even though I didn't spend money on it)? Don't answer that. We both know there's usually only a few active servers these days. If you want mods, a good solid non-shill like multiplayer game that has the word Quake within its name, and a much more active community just try literally any of the other Quake games. Not only that, but they all have Linux and Mac support (Linux support was removed some time ago). Don't bother with this.

You may go, aw, this guy has only barely 2-3 hours so I can't trust him. In most other games, you'd be right, but not this one. Quake is a multiplayer only as far as I can tell game with multiple gamemodes and multiple looks. All these are nice, except for a few issues. The first is the community: It is extremely hard to get better without being told "aim bettur". When I ask for some help, I want a real honest answer, not troll answers. I just get told to stop playing COD and HALO. That brings me to the learning curve. The Learning curve is EXTREMELEY Steep. Your gonna get rolfstomped on a couple occassions. Since there aren't a lot of weapons, you only have 8, and experienced players have basically mastered them all. The spawns are also TERRIBLE. You thought COD was bad, you haven't seem Quake. Personally, I find it very cheap to spawn behind or DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the enemy. They can react much faster and kill me. You also (I tend to) spawn WHERE I DIED where the person is waiting for me, to kill me. That's annoying. Quake also has powerups, per say, scattered around. Most are good such as armor and such, but there is one called QUAD DAMAGE that makes the player deal 4x the damage. This is a 2 sided coin. For one, if a lower skill player gets it, they will do pretty good. If a expererienced player dominating the lobby get's it, well, your all gonna die. Thankfully it only runs for 25-30(?) seconds, so smart decision devs +1 for you. Quake does have its good points though. It's a small file for one (762 mb) it's COMPLETLEY free-to-play with absoluotley no money involved unless you want a subscription to host servers and get more maps. It's a small 35 dollar yearly fee. The game can be a load of fun at times when you have a decent match. The game has a good gametype choosing system which is helpful. It's a free-to-play, it can't hurt to try it.

It's not uncommon to win a deathmatch game with 50 frags and 2 or 3 deaths.  Finding players that are an actual challenge is extremely difficult.  It's no fun to just beat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all day.\n\nThe game itself is fun, but the other players and servers kill the fun.","September 24, 2014","false","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Clearly, they realised that every Quake game is Cracked and can be found on torrents so they made a free one which probably has some ,,Gold'' purchases to fill the company's pocket that are to come in the near future. The models are exacly the same from Quake 3 Arena, the optimisation is so bad that randomly you have a chance to get ,,Connection Errors'' although you are running 15-20 ping and you also have a chance to join a full game when chosing FFA. Not worth downloading.","September 27, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All you need is a couple of minutes to suit up and be ready for battle.\n\nSecond, the animation, no, the levels themselves, are surrealistic and amazing in style. Favorite level: Beyond Reality. Lots of thrills there.\n\nFinally, the game is just a remake of a good classic. What more could you want? This may be only intended for Hardcore players, but if you're a newbie in the world of Online Shooters, this game will be a treat.\n\n9.5/10","October 19, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
