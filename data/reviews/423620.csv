I will add a TL;DR at the end\n\nGameplay\nHero Defense is not an average tower defense game because instead of building towers in a set area for them to just stand and fire at approaching enemies you get 5 mobile towers/heroes to use. Each one of these heroes has a speciality, skill tree, and weapon rune slots to increase their power when defending. The fact you control where your heroes move and have to tactically place and manage them to successfully fend off wave after wave of enemies helps add to how much fun the game can be. Within maps you also have the option to use and build shrines which can boost specific stats, characters, or simply give you a nice boost.\n\nThe story is actually pretty stale, nothing new, nothing surprising. More like a large cliché but that isn’t really harmful to the game as a whole.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe graphics can be unappealing to some, but overall it’s a more dark 3D transilvania look which matches the game pretty nicely. The artwork and design of certain characters helps to match that theme and help add an appeal to the game.\n\nThe music is overall ok, but some of the character voices are simply horrible. The main character Jack along with some of the other heroes make me simply wish I could mute them specifically for the entire game.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Mobile towers/heroes\n+ Variation between heroes with strength and weaknesses\n+ Unlockable runes to boost heroes\n+ Skill trees\n+ Enjoyable levels and variation\n+ Requires tactical placement and preparation beforehand on heroes to beat later levels (require you to use your head)\n\nCons\n\n**Note since this is an Early Access title Cons and other parts of the review as well are viable to change as the game continues to develop**\n- Stale story\n- Grind to get runes and gold to be able to advance (this does not apply to everyone as I know some people like a good grind)\n- Some of the character voices are horrid\n- Graphics unappealing to some\n\nSuggestions\nSuggestions I feel would help the game\n\n- More enemy variations\n- Preset targeting for heroes (First, Last, Strongest, Weakest) because more than once my heroes ignored the guys at the front and ended up costing me the mission (and hard to remote target if it’s a giant horde and constantly click so they attack front)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA fun tower defense game for sure, love the micromanagement and the rune system. Skill trees are a nice touch along with reconstructing the town for different uses. I did not like the story, it was very predictable following cliché after cliché in its plot. As a tower defense game I love the system of having movable towers since it really is a pleasure to have to use an extra bit of thought to properly position your heroes. Even having to decide if you need to build a shrine or move a certain hero somewhere to be more effective and trying to match runes to help the character be better in different scenarios really made the game more enjoyable.\n\nTL;DR\nHero Defense - Haunted Island is a game for its gameplay with different shrines, runes, skill trees, and 5 different heroes to manage and defend against the undead with. A pleasure to see within the TD genre for its type of structure and overall offering a good amount of playtime potential if you like the game and its style.\n\n** Key was provided by developer for review purposes **\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 25","true","9.4"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","47","53","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/423620/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuite creative reinstallment on the Tower Defense games field. Hero Defense is performing just as you can expect from this type of gameplay... but the mechanics now is not about installing some "towers", but rather using some mighty Heroes, to stop waves of monsters from reaching the town's border. You can't really die in this struggle, as the monsters aren't attacking your heroes, it is one-way shooting. But the failure is quite possible, as the mobs are packing in hundreds and thousands, and your Heroes aren't really superpowered, so you need to think quite strategically to stand your ground and not let the Horde left you behind on their onslaught.\nSimply put, it is one of those games, where you can catch the drift quite easily, but after some time you'll meet a real challenge, which will be forcing you to restarting over and over, checking, which tactic will benefit you better.\n\nAnd while it is still in the early access, I have a really good aftertaste after I've finished the most part of it. Some other game would have stopped the development at this point, and already could have been called a complete project... But Hero Defense, while quite playable, with finished campaign mode, is still ungrading, and that's a big promise. For example, the multiplayer part with inverted gameplay is very intriguing, and promising... if you can find someone to play with - which is still a rare thing, sadly.\nThere are, of course, some downsides, which stopping me from overpraising the game. The gameplay is heavily based on grinding, and that error-and-trial path is certainly not the best thing, if we're talking about videogames in general. But, as a wised up tower defense game - Hero Defense is fine. I can only ask for more levels and challenges to play, the more adequate controlling at the afterbattle statistic screen, and more events, like that Easter thing. For example, for US Independence Day, there could be a little Aliens infestation of our beloved little town, or maybe evil Pokemons have some evil plans on this Summer (it's their 20th anniversary, btw). Well... to put it shortly, I've finished the singleplayer, beat almost all challenges (except for long-winded achievements like to finish 50K of undeads) - and I still want more!\n\nSome people who don't like grinding and cartoon visual style, as well as the flow of challenges the tower defence games usually proposing... might look away. The multiplayer part is a bit slow now, as it was just started this week, but the gameplay there looks quite intriguing. I think I'll lay the game down for a while, and maybe after Summer Sale there be more people to play with... But, if you're looking for single-play original TD game, look no further! The game is fine already, and the price is quite adequate, generally.\nMy mark 7.2/10 now, but I'll revise it later, once I'll get enough of multiplayer battles...","May 17","true","31.0"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","25","33","5","0"

I'm one such gamer, and that's precisely why my positive experience packs such a wicked punch.\n\nComing into the game, you're hit with striking characters and a fantastical world where supernatural creatures exist, and hunters are waiting in the wings to defeat them.\n\nUsing strictly mouse gameplay, you'll start off with Jack the ranger. Through gameplay progression, you quickly learn that by defeating a wave of creatures on a given map, you earn gold and skillpoints that can be used to upgrade Jake's weapon and upgrade or add skills to the character to make him a more deadly opponent. You can also rebuild the "town" by placing various building on the map that allow you to upgrade characters and weapons, and later to exchange gold coins for gems that are used for further upgrades.\n\nDuring gameplay, defeated monsters drop gold and items, such as runes that are used to advance your character, and orbs that are used to "charge" your character, granting one of many short-term advantages or "buffs." You'll also find during the process of completing waves and upgrading Jake that other characters become unlocked and available for placement on the maps. Furthermore, you'll be able to build shrines on certain maps that grant buffs, and ven placement of one character next to another can provide an advantage.\n\nAll of the characters will advance in the same way as Jake, though they all have different skills. Barrows, the occultist, is stronger against certain opponents, and Sam Hain, the firebug, is stronger against others. The same can be said for the rest of the crew.\n\nThere's a great deal of replayability here, as each map can be repeated more than once at a higher difficulty level, and beyond that, extra challenges can be added to the maps that place your crew at a disadvantage of sorts and result in higher rewards for you. There's a lot of room for game customization here, too. No two games are likely to be the same when you factor in all the different characters, map placements, shrines, and rune combinations.\n\nIt's classified as Early Access, but I have to say that this game plays like a finished product. Graphics are exquisitely clear, and the soundtrack enhances this supernatural environment. I felt like I was playing in an interactive urban fantasy. The developers seem to be not only talented but active, so I'm looking forward to more content in the future.\n\nThis game is very well done, and it can be played both in long sessions or short intervals. The instant gratification factor is definitely present, as well. Frequent loot drops and upgrades make for a beautiful give and take experience. This is certainly not a "grinder." You'll also find trading cards and challenging achievements to keep you entertained.\n\nI favor controller gameplay, and as I stated earlier, I'm not particularly a fan of tower defense games, so I would encourage any other gamers meeting those criteria to give this game a try. If you hop on board the Haunted Island tour during the Easter event, you'll find a lot more goodies waiting for you!\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","March 24","true","5.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

This allows for you to consider how each hero works with the others to give you a synergy in killing the attacking army because oh no! while you can hurt the enemy with all of the hero types, each hero has a specific type of enemy that they really excel at defeating and this can be seen by their colour coding for each wave meaning you need to plan ahead to make sure your hero is in the right place.  Thats right because this is where you again depart from the old tower defence format as your Hero characters are mobile around the map and can stand in many different places allowing you to take advantage of well placed shrines to boost your attack speed, range, or damage output.  But again watch out, only certain heroes can use some of these to your advantage.\n\nOver all this is a very fun game, a little easy on the lowest difficulties needed to progress the story but you can go back and re-do a map to gain more rewards and give you an extra challenge as you level up your Hero.\n\nAll in all I recommend this game and I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future","February 3","true","2.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/423620/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI’ve long been a fan of the tower defense genre. I especially love games within the genre that attempt to be innovative, those that attempt to tell a story rather than just spit out increasingly more difficult levels at you and those that possess a high presentation level with a lot of charm. All three do a good job of summarizing Happy Tuesday’s fantastic Steam debut in Hero Defense: Haunted Island. It’s the type of game that I know that I will not be able to get enough of and will find time to play throughout my reviewing and playing of future games for Steamified. It’s just that damn good. I am thoroughly enjoying to the point of loving what I have played thus far.\n\nOne of the great things about Happy Tuesday’s game is that they haven’t stopped working on it since launching it into the Steam Early Access program. There have already been six updates and patches to the game since it launched on January 26 (the morning of January 27 in Australia which is what date Steam provides me so if my dates are slightly off for some of you you’ll understand why). They’ve planned for a two month early access period so we’re coming up to just under two weeks from an estimated launch date.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt the game’s greatest strength is its customization. You can practically play the game, as the descriptor says, the way you want to play it. Of course, there will be those who are such avid players of the game that they will argue that there is one best way to play the game – maximizing all of a certain skill set combined with what they consider to be the best runes, etc. but those of us who are more willing to play the game without spending a lot of time looking at all of the statistics to prove one theory right or wrong have a lot of different avenues to play. I’m not suggesting for a moment that those who do choose to maximize the game are going about it the wrong way as that can achieve a deeper level of enjoyment from the game and I’m certain that Happy Tuesday are hoping that their game has such avid fans.\n\nAnother feature that I like is that you can move your heroes around the map to put them into the position that you believe is the most productive. This certainly has a massive impact on the employed strategies. If your enemies move too fast then positioning your heroes at the start of the map can be disastrous because by the time that you react it can be a case of too little too late. However, if your enemies are slow and strong positioning far from the beginning can have the opposite effect – you don’t kill them before they get to the end of their path.\n\nThere are five heroes in the game. You begin with Jack Sanders who is a vampire slayer and then you unlock Barrows who is a grisly old gravedigger who has lost his poor wife. Barrows is best against skeletons. The next hero that you’re introduced to is the charming Samantha “Sam” Hain whose a precious little pumpkin thrower and zombie killer extraordinaire. The fourth hero is Jane Doe whose brain was used to create a Frankenstein’s monster. The final unlockable hero is Wylde Halfblood who is half-man and half-wolf so your werewolf character which is pretty cool.\n\nAnother thing that I very much enjoyed was the fact that the next level isn’t just given to you upon completion of the last. You have to meet certain criteria to unlock many of the zones in the game. What this means is that you need to unlock a certain amount of stars before advancing. You gain stars by completing levels – one star per successful level completion. For example, the first time that you complete a level you will be awarded a single star for that level. The second time you complete the level you will receive a second star and so on and so forth. This is a very good way of level and area progression.\n\nSpeaking of progression each character progresses similarly to how they would in many RPGs. As each character levels up you unlock skill points which you can utilize on a skill tree. Each hero progresses individually and has a number of different arcs that can be upgraded. Thankfully if you feel that at any time your character isn’t performing the best that you think it can you are able to reclaim skill points and redistribute them into the skills that you believe will perform better. As I said previously the customization within the game is incredible.\n\nFrom a technical perspective I really cannot fault the presentation. The graphics are perfect to capture the feel and aesthetic of the game that the developers had in mind for the game. They allow you the freedom that you desire to navigate throughout each map and add just the right amount of character to the game. The soundtrack and the sound are spotless as well. They aide the game to establish the mood and the ambiance that you would imagine from a horror themed tower defense game. It’s simply a superb game no matter which way you look at it.\n\nFinally, there is an online multiplayer component to be added to the game which I am very much looking forward to. If anyone would like to play together then I am very much welcome to your invitation. There will be unique runes available to be won through the multiplayer mode. The multiplayer was not available at time of review but from the descriptor, below, it appears that it will be a combination of MOBA and tower defense. My only hope is that the game comes without latency issues as coming from Australia some online multiplayer games are impossible to play because of it.\n\nMy hope for this game is that when it is feature complete and released out of Early Access that the critics do not ignore the game. It deserves to have its time in the spotlight and I believe that many critics will be pleasantly surprised by how well-developed and polished this game actually is.\n\nAn easy recommendation to practically everyone. There is so much for everyone who likes playing video games to enjoy here even if you’re not traditionally a fan of tower defense games.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","true","4.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HonestPineapple/recommended/423620/","HonestPineapple","Honest Pineapple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HonestPineapple/","2 products in account","Product received for free\n\nPROS:✔ The graphics are truly amazing!\nHero defence was clearly designed by someone who knows their stuff! The choice of colour, and combination of fog with a cartoon environment simply looks awesome! But you can see that from the trailer!\n\n✔ The GUI is Beautiful!\nIt’s aesthetically pleasing, scales correctly, and just looks and feels great. It doesn’t need any explanation, you just know what everything does, the skill menu especially!\n\n✔ The sounds are immersive!\nEvery action has a different sound, and it’s very noticeable! No corners were cut with the sound design!\n\n✔ It offers a challenging experience!\nSome games start slowly and build up the difficulty, but not in hero defence. Right away, you’re thrown in the deep end, with one moment of concentration loss losing you the game.\n\n✔ A unique concept, with plenty to do!\nIt’s very interesting to play a tower defence where you can move your units!\n\n✔ Simple and effective multiplayer!\nThe multiplayer definitely has potential. In short, it’s an extended singleplayer. Instead of playing by yourself, your friend’s singleplayer map is put next to yours so you can see how they’re doing. It has to be said though, there isn’t much time to watch them! It throws you into the end levels regardless of how far through the singleplayer you are.\n\n✔ You can skip the tutorial!\nI definitely saw an option to skip it! It’s such a burden when games don’t offer this functionality!\n\n\n\n\nCONS:✖  It definitely gets repetitive.\nYou have to move your units back and forth a lot. Their range isn’t enough to kill everything from one spot, so you have to shift them along. Then, move them back to the spawn so there’s enough time to kill the next wave. Over and over again.\n\n✖  The controls seem unnatural.\nTo move a unit, you left click it, and then right click the location you want them to move to. It took me a while to get the hang of this. There are key binds, but no option to change mouse control, unfortunately!\n\n✖  You can’t select multiple units.\nFor the most part, you’ll want to move all your units together! But you can’t select multiple units, so you have to do it individually, which wastes a lot of precious time! Also, units push each other out the way to get past, but the unit that got pushed doesn’t move back after.\n\n✖  The “Main Menu” is confusing\nInstead of an option list, you’re presented with a burning city. However it’s not obvious as to what each building does. You just have to click them all until you find some gameplay! Floating text would be really helpful!\n\n✖  The storyline felt forced.\nThis isn’t a game you play for the storyline, but even so. All the characters lack empathy or personality, and it all just feels slapped together. The protagonist told a guy who literally just lost his wife to a fire to “mourn her later”.\n\n✖  Minor issues.\nEnemies don’t move smoothly around corners, they snap quickly, which is very noticeable. The rune inventory is set. It looks like a standard inventory slot system, except you can’t put stuff where you want, everything has a default place. The heroes crossbow arrows come from the hero rather than the bow. Just little details like this that need fixing!\n\n✖ One voice actor?\nAs awesome as some of the voices are, it honestly sounds like it was all recorded by one actor, using different inflections and pitch distortion software.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS:★ Collaboration multiplayer!\nI really would love to experience some more engagement between you and the other player! Maybe a mode where both you and player 2 can move all the units together. Or to prevent exploitation from strangers, maybe you take control of 3 heroes, and they take the other 2.\n\n★ More units!\nThe joy of tower defence is that you can build more and more units! But here you’ll always be stuck with the main characters. If you could rescue citizens for certain levels that you could also control, to help tackle each wave, that would definitely add some replayability!\n\n★ Streamline the skill upgrades!\nI enjoy doing things quickly. One major issue I had with the skill menu, is that you have to close each skill after upgrading it before selecting the next one. I’d love to be able to click the next skill immediately without needing to close the info!\n\n★ Make the tutorial GUI clearer\nThe tutorial mainly consists of clicking on what the arrows tell you to click. However sometimes, it’s easy to miss where the arrows are on screen! Make the rest of the screen darker or something, just to highlight where I’m supposed to be looking!","June 3","true","3.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I enjoyed this feature since it made for less resetting every time  something got past me. All the usual suspects are here: Pure DPS, Slow effect, AEO, Mellee spawns in the middle of the enemy path, each of the heroes fill a basic purpose within the game that would otherwise be filled by a tower. Beyond that though if you ever played a tower defense game ever you can fill in the blanks on what happens during the defense portions of the game.\n\nIn the overworld there's a town on the outside of the level map where you can spend the gold and a secondary currency you earn and level up your heroes like you'd upgrade towers. I have to admit I initially thoughth that the secondary currency was going to be something you wither had to pay for or farm for endless periods of time to get, but I was proven wrong when a few levels in you can construct a bank that becomes your primary means of getting the blue currency by exchanging it for excess gold.\n\nThe game runs smoothly and I only had one crash shortly after my first boot of the game. Other than that initial crash it easily stays at 60 frames per second and hardly ever fluxuates for any reason.\n\nIf you're willing to turn the audio down and miss out on some corny voice acting and storytelling this makes for an excellent podcast game or something do do while you're waiting for a large download.","February 22","true","1.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

The controls are spot on but I recommend to use the keyboard and learn the few shortcuts... this can save lives, especially in later levels.\nYou collect gold and runes in the game. Gold is needed to upgrade the buildings in the town in which you can level up your characters and weapons. You can also convert gold into diamonds in order to build so called hero shrines on the maps. Additionally you need diamonds to add rune slots to your weapons. In those weapon slots, you can place runes which are a lot of fun top experiment with. Each rune comes in 5 diferent tiers and there are 9 different runes per tier. In general, the metagame is very satisfying. You always enjoy to go back to the town and play around with your precious loot.\nGraphics are very polished with some nice effects like fog, lightning and bloom but I wouldnt regard the visuals as the game's strong point but they definitely are nice too look at.

At beggining you should complete a short tutorial, what explain the base of the game. After that when you complete it, you can start the campaign.\n\nYou will find here 5 different heroes, with different abilities and skill trees, but in the beggining you´ll have only one, the rest of them you will unlock them when in progress. So this 5 heroes you can use like a "Moving Tower" to eliminate waves of enemies.\n\nIn some maps you also can use shrines, they can boost some specific stats or giving boost. The movement of the characters is very important thing, because from this depend your success finishing the levels. Also in a gem you will find a multiplayer mode.\n\nThe graphics looks very good. The music is well fit to the game style, also characters have a good voices.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ addictive gameplay\n+ good mix of strategy, tower defense and RPG\n+ nice graphic\n+ good voices and music\n+ steam cards and achievements\n+ good tutorial\n+ multiplayer\n+ different characters with different abilities\n\n- a bit week story\n- a bit need grind\n\nWell if you like a tower defense games or want try out a something fresh variation of this, i think you totally should try out this one. Here you will find a interesting mix of strategy, RPG and tower defense. Also a game have good graphic, voices and multiplayer, what bring even bigger replay value to the game.\n","May 18","true","3.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","1"

Frankly, for the price, it's already polished enough to warrant purchase (something that is SOOOO not true for a lot of early access games...).\n\nIt's a decent take on tower defence. Make it hero-based, add in both unique skill trees and upgrades to weapons, and throw in a really nice graphical style that is somewhat reminiscent of Torchlight in my mind. It's fun, diverting and ripe for add ons in the future with new maps, extra heroes etc as well.\n\nYou could do worse than spend money on this game.

On the journey, our hunter Jack joins others to form the Fabulous Five - one being Sam whose voice files are unfortunately louder and pitched - so that they may rebuild the fallen town and slay the Count,\n\nYeah, a TD with plot. And voice acting! These devs know how to make me smile.\n\nGraphics are simple and charming. I have nothing bad to say about them. Effects are great, and the game runs at a steady 30 FPS for me... which is lovely because I run most games at 15 FPS or lower!\n\nSounds! The music is subtle and it never gets annoying. Let me remind you that Steam Overlay has several options to allow you to play music as well as that every sound in HD can be muted! My only issue is how loud Sam's voice is in comparison to everyone else.\n\nThe gameplay is very interesting. Had you any experiance with Warcraft 3 mods, you may have played a similar map to what this game presents... I know I did, and I love it just as much now as I did back then. Basically, you will micromanage five Heros ( movable towers ) to eliminate enemies by using the best of the terrain available and shrines ( buff stations ). Battles will net you coin which you can use to purchase a variety of things in Town - the most important being Gems from the Bank. With those Gems,  you can expand a Hero's Inventory. Doing this will allow you to equip them with more Runes ( stat boosts ). One can also upgrade several buildings around town which in turn provide additional buffs and stat boosts. Enjoy the grind!\n\nThis is not pay to win. Yes, the word 'gems' has knifed our hearts out because of every flip-phone app out there... but let me reassure you: this is not a pay to win game. Gems can only be bought with gold, the game's in-game currency given out after battles.\n\nNow, about Multiplayer... its play to win. It is very challenging to outperform a user who has endured more online matches than you. Not only would their Runes be better, but they would be more familiar to the maps. Try not to be frustrated if you get slammed hard in Multiplayer.\n\nAs of writing this - 6/3/16 - I hold the lowest Leaderboard position.\n\nHow do you avoid this? First of all, don't play against the same player over and over unless you're winning. Secondly, try to dedicate yourself to a Season of Multiplayer. Lastly, be mindful of the maps and how they synergize with Hero's and their runes. Don't be me on 6/3/16.\n\nRumor has it that co-op mode is coming! I truly hope to reach Top 3 this weekend because I would love to gift this game to my friends.\n\nI do not regret anything about my purchase. The game is solid, the devs are friendly, and every day is Halloween!\n\n","June 3","true","16.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This is a really well put together Tower Defense game with great graphics, good sound, some nice characteristation and good voice acting. So far I\'ve played the campaign for a couple of hours. The twist to the normal tower defense game is that you don\'t have towers you have movable heroes with different abilities. Obviously this sounds like moveable towers and to a degree it is but it does make you care about the \"towers\" more, they have personalities and you get to know them.\n\nThe game itself is one of those properly designed TDs where you have to think about where to place your forces rather than just place lots of \"tower type A\" because it is the best one. The hero upgrade paths are complex and add hugely to the overall enjoyment of the game and upgrades really do make a pretty obvious difference.\n\nOverall - Great!

By the time my characters would move into position, the wave was already halfway through the map, leaving no time to fully eliminate them in most cases.

It contains a lot of RPG elements such as, levelling Heroes, Skill/Talent Management, Gear management and mid-game decisions. It plays a little like a Warcraft 3 mode with a bit of extra polish, story mode and more persistent elements.\n\nThe game does have its flaws though. It’s very grindy as of the Early Access version; huge amounts of gold are needed and replaying of levels becomes mandatory if you want to keep up to date. A counters B which counters C style of balancing, it’s not just certain Heroes cleave or certain Heroes single target, just some people will deal little to no damage to certain mob types, think of Pokemon and trying to use Electricity on a Ground type. Lastly there are some pacing issues, it starts very slow and with all my time invested I still haven’t unlocked the last hero, which causes a dissatisfying experience at times when you don’t feel like you’re getting stronger.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game quite a bit, the issues I listed above can be addressed during Early Access.

This is a Horror/Comedy tower defense with RPG elements and a very simple storyline. The game overall isn’t too bad despite a few quality of life things they could add, such as a restart level feature, and mis-clicking/bombs seem to have problems, but other than that it is quite a great game!\n\nLets get on to the first part of my review:\n\nGameplay: The game itself is fun. I really love the horror-element to it and the fact that it is also a tower defense! There are a lot of good times to be had from the dialogue and very simple story. The game works out quite fine and you will enjoy leveling up your characters and seeing them progressively get stronger and stronger. This is absolutely crucial but the developers didn’t mention how important it is to convert gold to diamonds so you can level up your guys with them. Other than that, it is pretty solid! Good times will be had and it is not frustrating to play at all! So... 2.0/2.5\n\nControls: This is an easy criteria to get a high score for me. But.. This game has decent controls but not perfect. There are issues with bombs and they refuse to go off and you spam click and they for some reason will not blow up unless you put them in the perfect spot it seems. Also, there is no menu to seem to get out of the bomb screen that works properly. I got some damage done on myself because of this. Other than that the controls are not too bad. So for me... 1.5/2.5\n\nBugs/Glitches/Game-breaking stuff: Nothing too bad. Just issues with the bombs and the fact that you cannot click when they are equipped it seems. Also, sometimes the maps are awkwardly laid out and you have to run your crew into the corner of the map that is hard to click on. Not a whole lot of people complaining on the forums as well, so I would say they have success in this department! This gets a 2.0/2.5.\n\nValue: This to me is the most important criteria when it comes to buying a game. For others, this may not matter so much. But, the basic calculation I always do is can I get 1$ per hour out of this game? Well. I do think so! Or close enough! The game is still in early access and you can replay the maps on hard if you’d like. It is 13 bucks at the moment so it should be easy enough to reach 13 hours on this game. Also, new content will be coming out apparently including MP. So, if you want to get a decent tower defense game I would pick this one up! Value: 2.0/2.5\n\nOverall:  7.5/10.. Decent enough tower defense, but there is some shallowness to your defenses as you are only leveling up your heroes. Other tower defense games you do up your towers and witness them destroy the enemy. This one is not the case. Just heroes/their abilities and bombs. It is fun and you’ll have a good time, but don’t expect a perfect game! There is room for improvement but in order for that to happen I think a full re-haul on the whole game design would be fun. It is worth the 13 bucks for those of you who enjoy tower defenses.\n\nAlso, if you'd like to see the first hour or so of the game in action then come and take a look for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzwfrAMohRE","January 27","true","4.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Especially as the game tries to tell a story instead of give you a bunch of levels to play as they get increasingly difficult as you get through more levels.\n\nGameplayHero Defense - Haunted Island is a unique kind of tower defence, RPG game that tries to tell a story as you play through each of the levels of the game. As with all tower defence games, your goal is to build towers that you can control and a small amount of heroes in order to kill all the enemies before they get to whatever you are protecting. Each hero has their own strengths and weaknesses which balances the game out well, there are no heroes that are the strongest or the weakest. With the heroes that you aquire throughout the game, you will be able to send your hero to the enemies to fight them off if they got past your towered defences. This really makes the game more fun, which means less restarting if just one of the enemy gets past your towered defences. The overworld that you are in has a town on the outside of the map, here you can spend your gold and you are able to level up your heroes similar to how you would upgrade your defence towers that you have placed. Although you will have to spend a second kind of currency, which is a little harder to get than gold but doesn't turn into a microtransaction which is good. This is the RPG element to this game, that you can level up your heros and are able to move your heroes around and kill enemies if they get past your towered defences. The game also features some big bosses that you will have to defeat in order to win some of the levels that are in the game. Makes a nice change to have one massive boss rather than just more waves of enemies that get past your defences, which makes it rather nice and enjoyable to play. I would of liked to have the whole camera to be able to see the whole map, but for now you have to continously move the camera in order to see the map.\n\nThe graphics that accompany this game are very nicely presented and polished along with all the characters that are well presented and have nice animations when attacking enemies and such. There are some nice lighting effects of the game, and the shadows work well when your hero walks across the lighting. Its all very colourful and vibrant of colours that really make the game stand out from other games of the similar genre of game.\n\nPros+ Unique tower defence game with RPG elements\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Massive bosses\n+ Achievements & Trading cards\n\nCons- Cant get the whole map on the screen\n\nResult / Final thoughtsHero Defense - Haunted Island is a very fun and addictive Tower defence game with some RPG elements thrown in the mix as well. The game is well designed with it's level creation and the graphics and beautifully done. For a game that is in Early Access, it really seems to be holding well. The only thing that I didn't like was the camera, where you would have to continously move the camera to pick up items, and reposition your heroes. It would be nice to be able to get the whole map into one screen rather than moving around the camera all the time.\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.","March 24","true","4.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Not enough content for the current price.\n\n1. Orange runes are useless. It's like how Diablo 3 was in the begining with their legendaries which were not as good as yellow items that dropped. I stopped bothering with getting orange runes after the first two and felt ripped off getting an orange rune after beating the game.\n2. There is no real end game and no reason to grind beyond beating the game. It only took about six hours to finish it.\n3. My characters never felt fully built even after beating the game. I felt half done with all my builds.\n4. The damage runes, speed and multishot runes were the only really useful runes IMO.\n5. Terrible ending. It was obvious *POSSIBLE SPOILER* that Jane Doe was the old guys wife, but it never actually answers it and left it open for DLC I am sure.\n6. My town was not fully upgraded, but I never felt the need to even bother. I fully upgraded the skills building, but did not even come close to using the last few levels.\n7. A replay map option would be great since it seems the game wants you to grind for upcoming maps. It was tedious trying to find the map I want to find again EVERY time after farming it.\n8. The tutorial held my hand way too much at the start. It's like it thought I was ret-ard-ed.\n\nAnyway, in summary, it was a fun game, but short and a lot of game mechanics need tweeking. Especially the lack of end game. Hate to mention it again, but look at Diablo 3 for it's endgame. That kept me busy for around 150 hours before I finally got bored of it, but I felt I got my moneys worth.

I'm really tempted to call this game Spooky Island instead. Also, is this Hotel Transylvania? A tower defense game where instead up setting up turrets, you move a party of MOBA characters around a map and let them auto-attack or use abilities while you survey the spooky scary surroundings. The 3d cgi cartoon graphics look great and it isn't too tough on the graphics card or RAM, and the voice-acting is clean and funny; although I feel like Graves with a crossbow I mean Jack Sanders is narrating a trailer the entire time.

They're also mobile, and may even benefit from constant management, meaning this game is much more active than many TDs.\n\nSome clever level design. Some of the levels are a little bland, but others have multiple paths, sub-objectives, objects that block line of sight, and shrines that buff your characters.\n\nGood variety of difficulty. Map length ranges from a minute or two to half-hour grindfests. Challenges are available for each level and many are unique.\n\nAll in all, good little TD with some dedicated developers.

I'm having a good time playing this game.  It's a different spin on a tower defense game.  I know some don't like the story, but I think it's fine.  I've not encountered any bugs yet - have about 4 hours pf playtime into the game so far.","April 4","true","20.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/recommended/423620/","AgreedSA","AgreedSA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/","695 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReally enjoyable Tower Defense game with gameplay that is very intuitive if you've been playing TD games any time in the last ten years, with hero units instead of towers. They fill very "tower-like" roles and the gameplay is well-designed to be very much a true TD-genre title, but I personally really enjoy the mobility and quick (but measured) pace that having movable hero units gives you. It's still in early access, but it's quite polished already when it comes to gameplay, with only a few minor quibbles I personally have (e.g. I feel the lack of a grid while still having essentially grid-restricted placement leads to some confusion when you're not trying to have one hero displace another, just get close - that's my biggest gripe, honest, and you get used to it quickly).\n\nI understand they're still working on balance in some areas. Having played quite a bit now, I feel they're doing a stellar job here - the only hero that I feel could use some work is Jane Doe, but all of the others scale from decent to beastmode over the course of their upgrade paths. Jane Doe is still quite good, by the way, just a little less effective in my experience (still capable of beating levels solo, by the way).\n\nI do feel like the game's description of your likely chances of beating a level are pretty wonky, but that's a quick thing to figure out and the secret is just play more and get your heroes and town stronger. I imagine that might get a tuning pass later, but all it is is the game's guess whether you will succeed or not and how hard it'll be. Early on it overestimates your chances, and later on it seems to underestimate them somewhat.\n\nThe take-away from this review should be that I am having to really dig to find tiny quibbles! The main gameplay and everything is really well done. This is potentially a worth-full-price indie title, and that's not a common situation :)\n\nThis is gonna be a 10/10 title for a small studio, hop on now if you want to join in the fun early. This is the second-best early access experience I have ever had with a title, with top honors going to Crate for their Grim Dawn Early Access period... These guys are right up there, though. Excellent offering, great price, get it if you dig Towder Defense and are looking for some tweaks on the gameplay that'll freshen things up without tossing out your intuition and ability playing TD games. It might also be a lot of fun to get MOBA players into Tower Defense, but I imagine it'll find more of a home with true TD fans.","March 30","true","59.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Less room for strategy. The game felt a bit like style over substance and ergonomics.\n\nMost of the skill choices are just more damage, more speed, more range (which are duplicated in other progression systems in the game). Generally number tweaking rather than interesting interactions. The heroes are basically just towers: shoot, shoot, shoot; and you can only have one of each type. You don't have the ability to scale to demands that you would expect in a TD, or the ability to fire off spells in rapid succession that you would expect in RPGs. Instead all you can really do is chant "shoot harder" or "go over there".\n\nOf course, it's early access, but the current price seems steep to me.","March 20","false","1.8"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","16","32","2","0"

The game seems to be designed for mobile. The animation seems to be 2d frame based (for mobile performance?). A lot of weird controls. For example, you have to drag to move the camera instead of putting the mouse cursor at the edge of the view. You have to select hero and then click again to move them. It's also annoying that one hero can override another one on the same tile because you want to move 2 heroes at the same time but you want the correct one to stand on the shrine. Overall a decent game.","May 2","true","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Gaining new heroes, upgrading weapons, runes and town was fresh. Then things began to turn other side. Gold grinding, micro-management and position control of heroes on the battlefield. It's against tower defense spirit.\n\nThis game designed with reducing difficulty over time concept. If you stuck, just grind some gold, buy new runes and you will pass a level without difficulty. While I believe this is not bad by itself, grid spoiled it.\n\nAnother flaw for me is a concept of 1 heros for 1 mob type. It leads to lack of diversity. Each hero has huge bonuses to certain mob types. Hero talant tree looks shallow for me. Almost all skills affect dps in its own way and can easily be calculated.","June 3","false","4.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
