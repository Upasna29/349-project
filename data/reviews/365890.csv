Well, don't worry, Cat Rabbit adapted one of the best table flipping board games into a masterfully crafted "Computer Monitor out the window" Simulator. Trust me, even praying to Nuffle will not save you against the unforgiving dice gods of Heroes of Normandie. Semi-serious joking aside, this is a great board game adaptation that has beautifully crafted maps with simplistic yet effective animations to simulate the movements and attacks of your units. It's insanely satisfying to hit an enemy halftrack with a cannon and watch that little tile smash into a dozen pieces, yet it's equally disheartening to watch your tank crumble under the assault of a lucky roll of 6.  There is also a ton of content/scenarios to be found here, with head-to-head multiplayer included as well as a campaign mode that features several campaigns for the 3 factions featured in the game. You also see the humour of the boardgame translated perfectly into dialogue boxes throughout the various campaigns.\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar to the basics of the game, you are placed in timed (generally) scenarios with a select number of units and you're expected to accomplish both a Primary Objective and a Secondary Objective (2ndary being optional yet provides lootz and bonuses). As a board game, it is turn-based, with one player (whoever has initiative) picking which units he wants to give orders to. Essentially, you can have 6 units but you can only give orders to 3 with one unit being a bluff (your opponent has to guess which unit isn't actually going to move). This requires a lot of tactical thinking, should I move my tank and blast away his fire squad or should I move my greyhound away from his PShreck squad? Each unit also goes into battle with different weapons, and each weapon is good at a specific thing and has specific values as shown on the weapon card. Basically, a rifle is far less effective at bringing down a halftrack as a 76mm cannon on a sherman tank. Simple stuff.\n\nWith that said, the tutorial could be a little more... exploratory, I suppose is the word. Trust me, you learn more through trial and error and I imagine it was intended that way. The tutorial literally explains the bare-bones of how to play the game. This is mildly disappointing because the game is hard as nails and the AI does not go easy on you.\n\nAll in all, this game is actually really fun and has a ton of replayability. Personally, I hope the devs stick with it and provide additional content to elaborate on the already existing content. This most certainly gets my seal of approval.\n\nGameplay Footage and Terrible Walkthrough:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjOHpbQYSU","October 1, 2015","true","7.3"," 92 of 110 people (84%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","84","92","110","21","2"

You see large maps, with lots of units, lots of battle, and very cool units with complicated game mechanics.  And yeah, this game is pretty well programmed and pretty well put together, but that is NOT what this game is.\n\nThis game is a puzzle game.  The maps are small, you only have ~5 turns to complete the game, and you can only move 2-3 units per turn.  So, in total you normally can make 10 - 15 moves and then the game is over.  Did you complete the objective in 10 moves?  yay you win.  Go to the next game.\n\nAdditionally, each map is very carefully constructed (very well so) to fit perfectly with the deployed pieces.  There is ALWAYS a hedgerow perfectly positioned to cut off line-of-sight or to hide in.  There is ALWAYS a stretch of open area that is just barely too long to run accross in 1 turn.  While there is nothing wrong with this, it further pushes you toward the puzzle aspect.  There is a right way to solve each game.\n\nCombined with this is the dreaded dice rolls.  Have an 83% chance to hit.. nah you miss.  I swear that comes up way too often.  Enemy tank comes rolling up and runs over your men (which does no damage), then shoots at you point-blank range.  No worries.  They miss... wait, what?\n\nTypically each stage is played like this:  Start a game.  Play around while watching what the enemy does.  Restart.  Position your troops to counter the computer's move (because it almost always does the same thing).  Repeat for 3 rounds.  If you get unlucky with the dice, just repeat the exact same moves until you win.  And since each stage is so short, it doesn't take too long to do.\n\nAlso, not only is each stage short, the entire campaign (including all 3 factions) is short.  With luck, you could complete the entire game in a few hours.  But, since the dice are what they are, this gets artifically elongated to about 6ish hours.  Maybe multiplayer is much better, I didn't try it out.  But $30 for 6 hours of gameplay?  You should pass.\n\nThis game needs to be more expansive.  MUCH more so.  Larger maps, more units, unlimited turns.\n\nAlso make sure you get it on sale.  The devs did some good work, but it definitely is not worth the price they're asking.","October 3, 2015","false","10.3"," 185 of 264 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","185","264","13","14"

Still worthwhile.\nThe tutorial doesn't do a good job for those new to the game. It assumes you know the board game  and shows how those things are done in the computer version. The vagueness and oddities of the tutorial may be difficult for newcomers to grasp exactly what their choices really are in the game.\nFor those experienced with the board game, there are a few issues too. The great terrain graphic system which let you look at the map and know what the terrain effects are have been removed! Now you have to right click on terrain to see an explanation. Poor design decision. And some of the wording displayed is very odd ("Fire Move" in the Supply Phase?), has typos, or gives a feeling of lack of attention to detail.\nAlso, there are things missing. No cards in this version of the game. Cards are one of the things that really make the board game "like in the movies." And although units have all their board game symbols, some, like Transport on light vehicles, don't seem to actually be implemented so they're not explained nor do they work.\nI have also had the game crash on me once in the first hour during the third mission. It's also a bit counter-intuitive that after a unit has taken its turn, you have to click anywhere on the map in order to get the Proceed button to show up. Just lots of odds and ends that seem half done.\nI love Heroes of Normandie, but I get the feeling that this computer version was rushed or poorly developed and tested. It needs another 6-12 months and some updating before it will rival the beautiful board game.\nIn the mean time, it's still the only way to play this great game online. The fact that it allows asynchronous multiplayer, like Battle Academy, is great!","October 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekrux/recommended/365890/","Nekrux","Nekrux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekrux/","2422 products in account","This game is exactly what is advertised: A strategy games that use the boardgame metaphore; and a very precise one, that of Heroes Of Normandie, DevilPig masterpiece.\n\nFirst of all the game has 36 missions organized in three different campaigns. Every mission is carefully designed and balanced to provide both challenge and fun. Some feel like a puzzle, other feel like more like a show in which you have more freedom in creating your strategy.\nSo if you are into single player modes this is perfect as the campaigns introduce you slowly to the rules of the game and keep on  introducing new units and abilities.\n\nSecond you have skirmish. These seem to me more like a training center in which you can experiment with different armies in different scenarios.\n\nThird you have multiplayer. Here there are few maps, one of the few problems of the game, just 4 maps. Devs are saying they are providing more, let's hope they do.\n\nFourth: Rogue player. This is hard as nails. You have two small campaigns in which difficulty is incredibly high and you have to choose a persistent army that get carried over (and added with new units you can buy) on the following of the campaign.\n\nThe game is solid and I really don't understand all the fuss about the RNG. Devs are being attacked because people get bad rolls... But they say dice are not rigged. Why devs would weight dices against players??? Sometimes you get bad rolls some other times you get good ones. Man up and endure the bad luck! Guys that attack the devs for this are just sore losers that could not play a boardgame with other people, they would throw the table after a couple of ones!\n\nAlso others say (or even the same ones) that people could complete the game in few hours. Really? 36 missions plus 12 rogues and around other 12 for skirmish? And multiplayer added? Just gratuitous hate here too.\n\nLast note: if you really want to get into the forums and read the discussions there look at the devs answering. They are everywhere and seem to answer to everybody, listening a lot and getting patches out like crazy. These are the devs we need and all this hate and unjustified attacking (90% of which is on dice rolls!) could drive them off the industry... Which is very sad... :(\n\nMy hint: Watch a youtube video of this game and decide yourself if the game is something you may like, don't believe the haters here (they are few anyway).","October 4, 2015","true","12.7"," 52 of 70 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","52","70","5","0"

The reason being two major features completely absent from this version of the game; namely the scenario creator and the action cards.\n\nThe action cards were especially puzzling to not find in the game, because they offset the luck-factor from the dice. You can re-roll your own dice, force your enemy to re-roll theirs, cancel an attack or cause an attack to be lethal instead of just damaging. The cards are a crucial part of the game, so the absence of these simply broke the game for anyone wanting more than quick casual "fun" without any sort of depth.\n\nFor literally half a year, the cards remained absent, despite the promises of the devs to bring them in. Well, I'm glad to say they're finally released (and the scenario creator was released a few months ago), so now I no longer have any issue with recommending this really fun, relatively light tactical game that has a surprising amount of depth as well (with the newly implemented action cards that is).","May 4","true","1.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Being a boardgame adaptation, everything is quite transparent and clear, and the interface does a good job of explaining all the different modifiers and special rules.\n- Battles are quite quick, playing a scenario will take around 15 - 20 minutes. This is ideal for people who don't have much time to play.\n- The game relies a lot on dice rolling. Of course part of the fun is tipping the odds to your favor, but there is the occasional strike of good or bad luck. Anyway, good tactics almost always trump luck (don't listen to the whiners :D ).\n- Some board game mechanics have not been implemented the game. Cards are missing, and some unit special abilities, though still shown on the counters in the game, apparently are not implemented.\n- Content is plenty: 6 story campaigns (one is a tutorial), 2 hardcore-mode campaigns, skirmish scenarios, and multiplayer.\n\nTechnical aspects (3/5)\n- Technically speaking the game is not top notch, but the graphics and sound are pleasant.\n- I have had an occasional crash, and the interface is sometimes slightly glitchy.\n\nArt (3/5)\n- The art of the game is quite pretty, taken directly from the board game.\n- The atmosphere is slightly humorous, and doesn't take itself too seriously.\n- Sound and graphic effects are quite simple, but they do their job.\n- The music is a bit generic.\n\nConclusion\nIf you like light wargames and boardgames, definitely consider playing Heroes of Normandie.","October 3, 2015","true","13.4"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","28","40","2","0"

So....\nI bought it yesterday while on sale after they released the new action cards.\n\nI'm happy with it.  I've played board war games for years and even have many from "back in the day".  This is different in that you are not simulating a real battle but solving a tactical challenge.  Other reviews mention that and it helped me adjust to the game and enjoy it more.\n\nBased on the other reviews a LOT has changed.  I've monitored the forums for weeks and noticed the devs are responsive and receptive.  Players can be pretty demanding and impatient.  The devs seem to take it all in stride.\n\nMost recently action cards were added and they are a fun aspect to the game.  They give additional power, can distrupt the opponent, etc.   I really appreciate that the cards will have a green border when it is applicable to the phase or unit you are on at the moment.  THAT is very helpful.  Such details make the PC edition superior to the boardgame edition.\n\nThe game description above covers the concept and the images let you see the what you're getting so...\n\n--------------\n\nPros...\nGraphically impressive.  The artwork is true to the boardgame.  My PC is able to handle the "fantastic" graphic setting and it really looks nice.\n\nHumorous.  There are many tongue-in-cheek quips and subtle nods to cult favorites like Kelly's Heroes and The Dirty Dozen to name just a few.  I think that reinforces that it is not a hardcore simulation but a challenging puzzle.\n\nThe game is upfront about the play style.  You get a handful of units and a set time limit.  The player needs to determine how to manage those to achieve a win.  It's fairly quick to play - depending on how long you ponder your move.\n\nAdjustable difficulty.  I'm a fairly casual gamer so I usually play while doing something else.  Knowing I can dial it down or up is a nice element.\n\nTutorials get you going.  I finished them all in under one hour.  You are into the core game quickly.\n\nLots of hints on the screen.  You can turn them off but they do help clarify how the game is intended to be played.\n\nRestarts are easy.  If I get a bad roll and decide I want to start again it's just a couple clicks are I'm ready.   Same if I missed a key aspect of the setup and want to go back.  If you're not sure how something works just play and when it happens you can restart with the new knowledge.  I had a number of "Oh THAT'S how that works" moments.\n\nEditor is EASY and FAST.  I played only two hours on the campaigns before I was setting up my own battles.  I wanted some tank vs tank action and it was EASY to create.   I'm expecting the Sitherine forums have player created missions to share.\n\nYou can easily alt-tab out of the game and return without any issues.\n\nRuns great on Windows 8, Nvidia card, 1920 x 1080\n\n---------------\n\nCons...\nIt can be initially frustrating to determine how certain elements function.  The tutorials get you going but I still had questions and the e-manual didn't close the gap.  However, my solution has been to play, take the loss, and let that show me how the mechanics work.  I think it is less of a "con" if you know going in -- so I'm telling you now.\n\n--------------\n\nAt the moment it is 34% off and I'd recommend it if you seek an entertaining game that is also challenging.\n\n.","May 5","true","36.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

If your caught out in the open you will be a very easy kill depending on what has found its sights on you and the range of its weapons. Battlefield wreckage will also block field of view making it harder to hit a target but you can fire on the wreckage and if your dice roll does enough of damage you will have a clear path and view. Going up against vehicles and tanks can be rather tricky. I was quite surprised how maneuverable they were on such a small map giving them a sense of realism as they were anything but easy targets for my bazooka infantry and armor units.\n\nMovement and combat is done by giving orders to units which they will carry out when pressing the proceed button. During combat you can select individual weapons to fire depending if they are in range. Clicking on them will give you their strengths and what their main purpose in combat is such as suppression or just out right destroying the enemy.\n\nDuring the supply phase you can move units that were not previously given orders since you are limited to the amount of orders you can give each turn. These units cannot fire. You also have a Bluff order during the orders phase which is a fake move or lie.\n\nGraphics are amazing capturing the tabletop look perfectly with square chits covered in unit stats and great looking art work of the many different unit types. Terrain is displayed gorgeously and right clicking on it and units will bring up important information such as defensive bonuses. Infantry bleed a gushing red and tanks explode violently reminding me of those old mail order wargame ads in the back of comic books which came with tanks you could attach rubberbands to so they would explode in half on the plastic maps they also came with.\n\nThere are also plenty of comical visuals with commanders and officers cracking jokes during mission preps along with pleny of sexy female officers giving that inspiring spark to fight on! HEROES OF NORMANDIE definitely captures the brighter side of combat not done in most strategy games with its heroic imagery while still feeling like serious fun.\n\nSound effects and music come together as a explosive union of audio majesty as thundering tank fire from cannons shake the battlefield with shattering might and infantry rifle fire goes zigging across tree lines to hit their targets. The sound of tank treads can be heard crushing the ground leaving a trail of defiled landscapes. The rolling of dice fills the air with thrilling anticipation of a hit or miss.\n\nHEROES OF NORMANDIE the complete package of tabletop gaming glory! The only thing missing is the smell of napalm.\n\nThank you Slitherine and Cat Rabbit for this masterpiece and for the deep release discount :)","October 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Addictingly well.  Slitherine has added just enough tactical meat to the comic book meets classic Hollywood war flick mix to make it good grognard candy.  If you like fun, light thematic war games, HoN is all that.\n\nI can't say if it's as good, worse or better than the boardgame implementation, but it stands alone, as is.  If the promised content is added, I expect it to get better, and it might hit that sweet spot between depth and complexity that allows for a title to get attention from gamers who wouldn't look twice at a traditional hex and counter tactical game, even a fairly light one.\n\nThe mechanics are covered well enough, but not perfectly, by the tutorial.  Reading the manual would help the novice, for sure.  Those who've played Memoir 44 will be familiar with the approximate weight and scale of the game, although I'd say HoN is slightly more detailed than M44.\n\nInitiative changes each turn.  Each side gets orders to issue units, and you can lose orders if you lose commanders on the map.  I go, You go, units that didn't get activated can move but not fight.  Objectives vary from mission to mission, and there are canned campaigns, an auto generated campaign, skirmish mode, and a scenario editor, so there's a bit to do, even if you don't engage in the multiplayer mode.\n\nThe game looks and sounds good, in keeping with the theme...high eye and ear candy indeed for the old hex and counter crowd.  Special effects and destruction of units is gratifyingly cartoony and fun.  Cutscenes feature caricatures from the Hollywood war icons of my youth...Clint, Carrol and Donald, is that you guys in my game?  Maybe there will be DLC featuring the old Combat! gang.  Sgt Saunder and Kirby would be right at home here.\n\nThere's just enough of what we used to call "chrome" and enough choices presented to make things interesting for the history minded or the old wargamer.  Machine guns be deployed.  There's suppressive fire as a more likely to succeed option to killing fire, and there are immersive moments when applying sound tactical principles are rewarded.  Fire, suppress, assault.   There's hand grenades, mortars, smoke, rifle grenades, terrain considerations, some rudimentary nods to command and control.  It's got some good wargame elements.\n\nThere are also moments when you feel like you just ate a mushroom power up and got grenades, or an annoying Zundapp moves in your face, unloads a belt of MG fire on your sorry butt and backs away all  while you look on helplessly because it's not your turn.\n\nIt works in spite of that, or maybe because of it.  The theme, artwork and brilliant dialog of the characters in the skippable cutscenes all conspire to you taking the thing too seriously...but there are moments of tactical satisfaction aplenty, or at least striving for those moments while your dice betray you.\n\nIf Kelly's Heroes shacked up with the old AH game Squad leader, and then had a goofy love child, it's likely that the result would be HoN.  And yes, to me, that's a good thing.","December 31, 2015","true","63.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Take a look at the screenshots above and compare to the original tabletop game and you'll see that it's almost identical. It's a gateway wargame - it has many familiar wargame concepts, but it's simplified so almost anyone can quickly learn it. It's a beer-and-pretzels kinda thing, it's not meant to be a realistic simulation. The game is based on the war movie concept of WWII, not the actual historical event.\n\nThere are 3 single-player campaigns which will last at least a few hours (more if you want to get all the bonus objectives), and a skirmish mode, but IMO the real fun is multiplayer. The game is turn-based and PBEM (play-by-email) so you can keep several games going at a time and play your turns whenever you have a few minutes to spare. I've had as many as 5 simultaneous games going, taking turns in each throughout the day. A particularly fun thing is to setup the same scenario with different opponents and try radically different strategies in each game.\n\nThe boardgame has quite a few expansions, so I expect this game will be supported very well into the future. There's a map editor on the way, plus there's an iPad version coming next year which will have cross-platform play with the PC version, so the player base should remain robust for a while.\n\nCriticisms:\n- The boardgame has a card mechanic that this version is missing. The developers are planning on adding the cards in the future. But if you're looking for a perfect translation of the board game, this isn't it (yet).\n- If you hate random dice rolls, this is not be the game for you. You have to been willing to accept losing a scenario because of one unlucky roll. If that sounds frustrating, you should stay away. If you play smart you can increase your chances in every fight, but there's almost always going to be a roll that goes against you at the absolute worst time.\n\nEdit: Since I wrote this review a few days ago, the devs have already patched the game twice, fixing bugs and adding an option to reduce some of the randomness of the dice. You can turn this new option off if you want purely random dice, or leave it on to reduce bad luck streaks. I haven't tried the new mode, but it seems like a sensible compromise, especially for new players.\n\nBottom line - if you're new to wargames or even an old grognard, there's a lot to like about Heroes of Normandie. It's a quick, fun play with a great sense of humor and gorgeous board game design.","October 5, 2015","true","46.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

From reading the game manual, the goal of the game is to recreate the mechanics of the boardgame.\n\nThe reason I had to go to the manual was due to a faulty implementation. Sound in the tutorials does not work, all I get a buzzing sound. Certain user interface components overlap, making it impossible to access what lies under the top layer. Cards, an important component in the boardgame, are not yet implemented. There is no way to control graphics or sound through the use of a settings or options menu. [There is an options menu which gives two sliders that are not labeled. Message to the developers: this is rather useless.]  (I'm running on an Alienware machine that meets all of the requirements for this game.)\n\nAfter trying a different machine, I was able to try the tutorials and get through them. There are typos and some other minor issues, but overall, it plays reasonably well. However, the lack of cards is annoying.\n\nUpdate: I just tried the 1.06 patch and it's a big improvement. The game plays a lot better and the feedback from the game is a lot better. Since they are updating regularly, I'm going to assume the cards and other fixes are coming and I will change my overall review to "recommended".\n\nOverall, this game appears to have been shoved out the door a month or two before it was really ready. I have hopes that these issues will be addressed by the developers, however at this point I cannot recommend it.

The Simple fact is it relies too heavily on RNG and not enough on solid tactics. What is worse alot of the missions can be beaten by simply moving a unit across the map and grabbing the objective, does it matter that it's still guarded by two MG42 nests and a Panzer VI? nope your one hero unit in the centre of that mess simply means you've won. I'll give it props for the lovely artwork and the UI is solid. If you fancy a WW2 boardgame Memoir 44' is free on steam and gives a much better WW2 lite tactics experience.","October 3, 2015","false","1.8"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","1"

As a big fan of the board game, I was anticpating this game with high hopes. Unforutnately, everytime I play the PC version, I am hugely dissappointed. I try to play the game within the rules I know and come to find out that those particular rules are not implemented in the game, from card play to the use of transports. Even if you are unfamiliar with the tabletop version, you will be baffled by the rule icons on the unit tiles that are either not included in the game or poorly explained. I am happy to try a game that is ready for release. However, I stay far away from early access games because I am uninterested in an unfinished product. This game is certainly unfinished and should be labeled accordingly.","November 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

I think that Heroes of Normandie's rules feel too complicated for a game this fast and shallow, and other light war games like Axis & Allies Miniatures do the same thing better (and with cool figures instead of flat cardboard).\n\nThe game does such a terrible job of guiding you through its details that when you right-click on a tank (which has about a dozen different numbers to keep track of) for more info, all the numbers come up sideways on the game piece. Did no one think to rotate the damn thing 90 degrees? Really?!\n\nUsing cardboard chits for units made sense for the physical board game because of how much it would cost to include dozens of plastic figures. But in a computer game, it's just hideously ugly and makes it needlessly difficult to even tell your units from the enemy's. Even if switching to 3D models would have been too jarring for the fans of the physical version, the devs could have done much more to make the flat cardboard pieces visually interesting. For example, when a tank is destroyed, its piece is flipped over to its destroyed side which remains on the board as an obstacle. So how do you show that in an exciting way in a computer game? If it had been up to me, I would have shown the lethal shot causing an explosion in the tank that caused its piece to flip over.... but instead the devs show the tank crumbling into chunks before the flipped tank piece just appears. It looks bad!\n\nThe tutorial is AWFUL. It only really teaches you the absolute basics of how to order your units to move and shoot, without explaining crucial mechanics such as line of sight. You're dragged by the nose through the first few tutorial missions without having the system really explained, and then you're told to go blow up a bridge and maybe you should try using the Recon unit that has a special stealth ability... which is never explained to you. (For some reason, the mechanic isn't even explained in the digital version's manual, I had to look up the original physical version's manual to figure it out!)\n\nStay away from this unless you're a diehard fan of the original board game. If you're looking for a similar digital game, I recommend Panzer General on Xbox 360.","May 10","false","1.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Some units take one hit to destory. Some units take two hits to destroy. Combat is resovled by rolling a six sided die and needing a certain number to hit. Grenades, for example, miss on 1-3 and hit on 4-6, so a 50% chance to hit.  One hit equals death of a one-hit unit, reduction to one-hit side if a full-strength two-hit unit. So you have a full strangth an enemy unit is within firing range. If you use your guns, you'll hit on a 5 or 6. Your infantry can perform one action on their turn, and that assumes you have enough orders. You may have six units on the map but only able to issue orders to three of them. And if your unit having one of your orders dies before getting to perform its action, too bad. You've lost your order as well as your unit.\n\nSo suppose you have a two-hit infantry unit and a half-strength machine gun unit defending in woods. (Machine guns at full-strength can take only 1 hit before being destroyed.) So in the previous turn, two enemy infantry move to point-blank range of your units. Great, easy pickings, right? Nope.  Issue an order to your machine gun to take action first, then have your infantry unit perform an action. Oh, wait, the enemy fires first. So their unit staning in an open field at point blank range lobs a grenade at your machine gun, rolls a 5. Your machine gun is dead without being able to do a thing. The grenade also affects your infantry and they roll a 4 so it is reduced to its 1-hit side.  But your infantry can now fire. So you fire your rifles at the enemy, needing a 3, 4, 5, or 6 to hit. Oh, look, a 2. No effect. Then the other enemy unit throws a grenade at your infantry, rolls a 4 and your infantry is destroyed as well.\n\nSo your troops are dug in along a tree-line overlooking an open field. Enemy infantry fill the field in front of your units. Your machine gun just sits there watching this all happen as grenades rip them to pieces. Meanwhile, your infantry support, behind the shelter of the trees, can't inflict a single hit on the infantry standing around in the open field. What great fun.","October 3, 2015","false","11.3"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

I've tested it a bit in no scientific fashion, but repeatedly the AI gets exactly what it needs on rolls, and my dice consistently do not . . . far more than real dice do in the real world.  That is a bit of a deal breaker for me, I'm not saying it's too hard, or that you can't win with enough attempts, but overall I feel the AI had the dice stacked a little too much in its favor.","October 15, 2015","false","8.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","0"

The computer almost always hits and kills you every time it shoots and you maybe (on a good day) have a 1/3 chance of wounding them.  Example:  I have a Sherman tank going through the bocage.  There is a panzershrek unit literally next to me; I fire my main cannon and a .30 cal and the .50cal machineguns..........miss with everything.  The panzershrek fires once and obliterates my tank in one hit.  The computer forces start in prime firing positions; forcing you to rely on pure luck to survive the initial barrage of rockets, rifles and MG fire.  Guess what?  You won't survive.\n\nInstead of buying and playing this game; I recommend using a hammer on your genitals, it's much more enjoyable and you'll hit what you aim at!","October 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 21 of 49 people (43%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","43","21","49","16","6"

It'd be ok if it only happened once but this is EVERY game for me. Even when I change sides hoping things will change, nope same ole 1's for the player and 5's and 6's for the AI. Everygame I lose more units than the AI and there's no way in hell to kill all of them at this rate for the 270 victory points in Skirmish.\n\nThey said Halftracks get move and fire and move, well one turn I only got to move and fire and it stopped my halftrack out in the open and no I did not move the full allowance of movement points. Course you know the tank blew me to smithereens the next turn.\n\nAlso why in the hell can everybody see through woods? I mean you might as well not even have that glob of green in the middle of the map if everything can shoot through it.\n\nThe only thing I saw that WORKS is zone of control. If an enemy is next to you then you can't advanced past it without putting a tile between you..\n\nI got my money back and I'm glad I did. This would have been a WASTED $20 bucks.\n\nEDIT: I won't be a part of the upgrade but if Iain did what he said they were going to do then the game is probably improved over my original post. I won't buy the game again until all the features are in like cards etc.etc.\n\nThe only other feature I would have changed would be the orders limits. Have a feature that lets us play  with all the units in a mission and the ai as well. No orders just phases. I hope you increased the number of turns per mission as well cause 4 turns is just not enough or much fun. It's just a racehorse game to the finish. It's like going to a mile long run race and only quarter horse races are being allowed.","October 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 17 of 41 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","17","41","0","3"

Heroes is a BG that requires a deep knowledge of rules and icons so you need a dedicated opponent. Here you get the best of the Boardgame without any of the hassles.
