It's shallow, simplistic, your car controls like a goat on roller skates and the frame rate is an embarrassment.

Not just that, but genre mixing is quite popular as well, which opens up an even larger palette of possibilities when it comes to gameplay mechanics.\nBuild the road ahead one piece at a time\n\nSkyreach is not your typical racing game, but it‚Äôs not exactly a revelation in the genre either. In short, the main idea is that you are free to build the track as you go along, making it more of an exploration game than anything else. Unfortunately, it has a few flaws that make the experience a tad too annoying to be enjoyable, especially if you go in expecting speed and actual driving.\n\nTo begin with, the action takes place in some kind of great desert, although you are actually racing between floating islands. The fact that there‚Äôs no ground means that you have to place each piece of the track as you go, otherwise you fall to your death. If this sounds anticlimactic and slow, it‚Äôs because it is. Hence, you‚Äôre usually moving along at a snail‚Äôs place, partly because it‚Äôs difficult to maintain speed and build the track, and partly because the game takes forever to place the said track pieces anyway.\nOver-sensitive controls and decent graphics\n\nYou also have to deal with the poorly optimized controls, given the fact that the vehicle oversteers at the slightest touch, making it incredibly frustrating to negotiate corners at slightly higher speeds. Thankfully, at least you can use a controller to have a better grip on the situation, but that only makes it better than with a keyboard, not better in general. It shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that controls are important in a racing game.\n\nThings are much better in the graphics department, and it‚Äôs obvious that the designers put some soul into the environments and the game world in general. The desolate landscapes can be quite moody and engaging, even if you‚Äôll barely get the chance to admire them while you build the track. The graphics quality is decent as well, although there are some performance issues that shouldn‚Äôt be there.\nA great concept that needs a lot of work\n\nAll things considered, Skyreach is certainly something new, and it‚Äôs only natural that it didn‚Äôt come out perfect the first time around. However, something has to change as quickly as possible, because right now the game is not able to keep players happy for more than a few minutes.\n\nWith out a few updates this game is unplayable. As of now i cannot recommend the game in its current state at all. If you want a racing game look elsewhere cause you wont find it in Skyreach.\n","May 16","false","0.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","1"

Would be better if it wasn't about beating the clock, but rather focused on the exploration element. You should be able to build paths any which way and really explore the terrain. Bad control of car. Really bad frame rate lag. As a game I can't recommend. Good for a free demo.","May 1","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, its coming from a studio that is supposed to be professional by now.\nThe good original idea ( building the track you race on as you go ) does not make up for  the lack of good feedback,instateneous deaths, poor graphics ( is this really unity on fantastic mode ?) and frustrating level design.\nThis feels like a first playtest in a second year of school. Too bad, since it's an okay concept.","April 30","false","0.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Graphics are too processor heavy, resulting in fps loss.\n2. Reaction time for every action is significantly long.\n3. Curved tiles aren't as long as straight tiles. That makes some paths impossible, and thus takes away the freedom of building your own road. (Not necessarily a bad thing)\n","May 28","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
