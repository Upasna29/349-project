"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/recommended/314230/","Dpfl","sharktemplar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dpfl/","76 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the most creative and freeing space games I have seen in a while. It prioritizes its appeal with "open-world" exploration. I put that term in quotes because technically you are not even limited to a single world, but thousands upon thousands of separate bodies floating in space. This ranges from asteroids to planets, and no doubt with more to come in the future!\n\nRodina understands that if you give the player freedom, and let them discover and do on their own time and in their own way, the experience becomes more personal, more vibrant, and all-around more involving.\n\nWith what anyone would swear is a life-size solar system, with life-size planets, and not to mention the 3D arcade-style space-combat currently with a variety of enemy ship types as well as weapons to find and attach to your vessel, Rodina is truly something unique that breaks down the boundaries most games are restricted to in order to guarantee a profit.\n\nThis game was built with less bussiness, and more love and creativity in mind.\n\n\n\nI can very easily see Rodina being the next Minecraft if it can get the proper attention, as well as some very vital core elements implemented that it currently lacks, such as:\nMulti-player\nPlanet-dwelling life\nand Dynamic terrain manipulation (digging)\n\nBuy Rodina. It really needs a sit-down-and-play introduction before you really feel the freedom of this unique game engine. The potential truly is limtless for this project.","July 28, 2014","true","135.5"," 210 of 226 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","210","226","0","9"

Given the fact, it is developed by a single person makes it all that more impressive.  The story is extremely engrossing.  The developer even went so far as to add secret story arcs that without a bit of deciphering would never be found.  And, the environments really paint a feeling of bleak lonliness in space.  The combat is fast-paced, but balanced and requires a fair amount of skill.  The difficulty ramps at just the right rate and the enemies are fun to fight.  Ship layouts are fully customizable and have an accessable interface to do so.  The developer is actively involved in the community and frequently seeks player input on the direction of development.\n\nAll this being said, there seems to be a memory leak somewhere causing my game to have frequent crashes.  However, the auto-save feature is abundant and rarely have I felt my progress wasted.\n\nWith no non-hostile NPCs, yet, it does leave me wanting.  It contributes to a lack of things to do within the game.  However, the developer has recently begun work on making the first non-hostile NPCs.\n\nI would like to see more weapon options for the ship.  As well, I would like the option to eventually set up permanent bases on the planets.  Overall, I would like to see more to do.\n\nOf all the early-access titles I have purchased, I feel most justified in paying full price for this one.  I'm honestly excited about development of this game.\n\nEDIT 7/6/2015:  Thanks to help from the developer, I was able to quickly resolve my crashing issue.  The speed of the dev's response was very fast and requires serious commendation. I look forward to many more hours playing Rodina.","June 24, 2015","true","10.7"," 121 of 124 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","121","124","2","7"

A few games have tried this (mostly unsuccessfully), but right off the bat, Rodina pulls it off beautifully. Entering an atmosphere is intense, and you really get a sense of a given planet's scale as you're hurtling towards it as a fireball. Managed to land successfully on my first go, which says something for the intuitiveness of the controls!\n\nNot interested in being a meteorite? There's space combat! Yep, good old shooty fun, right in your own personal ship. Since movement/phsyics appear to be mostly Newtonian, it's less like flying a fighter plane, and a bit more like playing 3D Asteroids. I can tell you that's a lot more fun than it sounds in text: my usual tactic is to cruise-drive up to a group of enemies, spray them in the face, then zip off a few thousand meters in a random direction before their shots land. Tricky, yes. Possible to crash doing this? Oh yes. Very exhilarating!\n\nWhat's that? Don't like being stuck seeing the outside of the ship only? Then wander around in the inside of it! Check out the furniture, play with the knobs, pull the levers, all that good stuff. From start to finish, it's pretty immersive, especially for an early access game. Whether you're checking your radio, messing with your bed, or putting out a massive fire, first-person in the ship just feels right, not unlike seeing FTL from a personal perspective.\n\nFrom a development perspective, Rodina reminds me of how Minecraft was in 2011: loads of fun, and just waiting to be packed with new goodies over time. The upside to this, of course, is players will be able to say exactly what they hope to see, and good ideas might end up put in by Elliptic Games. Given the sheer number of games touting themselves as "early access", yet being little more than a proof-of-concept that makes little progress over a year or more, it's refreshing to see a game out there that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. Devs aren't calling it complete, but they also haven't put up the equivalent of a semi-interactive demo, like many other early access games do. There is quite a bit in here to keep you busy, and given the ambitious nature of the game, I expect we'll see much, much more.\n\ntldr: If you love space games, buy this. If you want to fly around and shoot things in space, buy this. If you want to see what is, to me, one of the more impressive space-to-atmosphere landing mechanics systems, buy this. Heck, if you like Kerbal Space Program, buy this!\n\n...oops, ship caught on fire while I was writing this, brb","July 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 139 of 149 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","139","149","0","0"

It's hard to describe the feeling, it's the realization of how ridiculously small you are in a star system, you just don't get that feeling with any other space game.

If you like FTL this is almost like FTL in first person aside from the fact that ther is no other crew on your ship (yet?), it is also like FTl in the sense that fires on your ship can very quickly have you over a barrel. Rodina however is better, obviously that's an opinion and they are apples and oranges but this is quite simplyu a better space-sim. the seamless transitions and real time combat scratch that starship itch that all healthily insane humans are burdened with not to mention the first time you activate hyperdrive you immediately go "♥♥♥♥in' eh how do I control this thing?" and for the first time really understand how much of a little snot Luke is being when he's bothering Chewie and Han in the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon.

Rodina made me feel like a child, playing video games for the first time, again. The basic premise of the game is exploration. You're told you are the last survivor of an alien attack on a starship on which you were traveling. Rodina, the capital ship from which you're told you hail send you an urgent message that you need to gear up and prepare for battle, because you alone are meant to destroy the enormous alien presence in the solar system you now inhabit. As you set off from the asteroid you start on, you immediately discover that this solar system is massive. That it is home to more asteroids than you could imagine. You suddenly feel like you're truly, actually in space, in an alien solar system, far, far away from your home. The immersion factor of the cockpit mode and holoscreens make you feel like the interior of your ship and the exterior of your ship aren't disjointed anymore, like they once were before cockpit mode was introduced. You can now set your ship to cruise, get out of your pilot seat, walk around your ship, and all the while, your ship will continue flying without input, while you monitor its progression through windows (holoscreens). The very thought of it makes me giddy with excitement. The planets you discover, one by one, are each unique. Jarillo, in particular, stood out to me, because of its immense mountains, which make you feel so small when you're on its surface, though in a few short seconds you could be miles and miles above its surface, laughing down at the planet. Its things like that that make the game so wonderful, and mysterious. Rodina manages to keep you suspenseful the entire ride if you decide the pursue the story. And what a wonderful story it is. Alecja and Tavi's personal story is a heartwrencher, and you really get a feel for the other characters you get to know, not only through the encrypted communications you must decrypt, but also through the datasticks you find at every other debris field.\n\nAll in all, Rodina is a game that deserves your support. If you're a fan of space games, this is certainly a must buy. If you're a fan of exploration, Rodina has more exploration than you could imagine. If you enjoy blasting aliens, Rodina has a hefty amount of combat as well. If you enjoy a story that you must uncover yourself, and feel rewarded for doing so, then this will be a masterpiece for you, as it was for me. I greatly enjoy Rodina, and I can't wait for it to be developed even more.","June 7, 2015","true","7.5"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","44","45","0","0"

Mercenary. Damocles. Mercenary III. Starglider 1 and especially 2. Great writing coupled with amazing visuals and such incredible SCOPE....Rodina is the first game to make me think those superlative early works of art weren't forgotten. Someone REMEMBERED.\n\nRodina is beautiful. Beautiful to play, to experience and to marvel at in the same way we marvel at paintings hanging in galleries. The simplicity of its controls, the fact you have a vast solar system as your playground, the simulated elements like fire and way I can actually get blown out of an airlock (first time that happened the REAL me nearly stopped breathing!). The way the simple aesthetic fuses every element together into a cohesive whole. this game is amazing fun to play, beautiful to look at, wonderfully constructed and just BEGGING to be expanded upon.\n\nFinding this game was like finding a lost Shakespearean sonnet. Welcome back, ghosts of all those game authors who dared to dream worlds.\n\n[UPDATE] If there's one caveat to the game it's this: the game isn't finished.

This game is beautiful in every possible way. I just got to what was originally the end of the story, however the developer is still adding to it. So let's go down the basics, starting from (in my opinion) the least important pieces, to the best part of this game.\n\n1. Graphics:\n\nQuite obviously, the least important part, but a part anyways. The graphics are a bit simplistic, but they get the job done and actually fit in nicely with the rest of the game.\n\n2. Bugs:\n\nNow, this game is only being worked on by one person, and if you keep up with their developer's updates, you'd know that they're going through quite a rough point in their lives right now. That being said, this game is practically bug free. It's amazing how polished this game is especially considering the developers current personal status. I've experienced a total of 2 bugs in this game, and one of them was a crash. Okay, to be fair, the game has crashed twice, but I didn't even lose any progress, thanks to this games marvelous autosave function. The other bug was a graphical bug. I found a strange wall in a ditch on one of the planets. I assume this was caused because of the textures being combined at the edge of the planet. It's like folding a flat blanket over a sphere, you can still see the seams. However, as soon as I was far enough, I couldn't even see the bug anymore.\n\n-Addition: I just tried edditing my ship to make a few changes, and in the entities catagory, no matter what I choose (Move, rotate, or delete), I can only rotate an entity. The statement above still apply, however.\n\n3. Sountrack:\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is gorgeous, and stunning. I love every bit of it. It fills you with exactly the same feeling that the rest of this game does: a feeling of being alone, but not upset, or sad, but joyful. It's hard to explain how you can be so lonely without feeling any sort of bleakness.\n\n4. Gameplay:\n\nThis subject will be split into multiple parts, as there's a lot to cover.\n\nI - On planet/asteroid travel:\nThis is the first part of the game that you experience, and the part that you get the least of. It's easy to understand, only using the standard WASD controls, F to activate things, G activates a flashlight, press space to jump, and press space again to activate a jetpack. You'll only really be in this mode for a few seconds when collecting this out of the ship, and to activate a few things inside the ship. Easy to understand, simple and easy, not overused, and a good addition to the game.\n\nII - Flight/solar system travel:\nThe most common part of the game. There are four different flight speeds, all of which you unlock within the first 30 minutes of playtime. It has a very responsive control system that's very satisfying to use. There are also scanners that you can place inside your ship. These act as a map to help guide you through the massive solar system.\n\nIII - Combat:\nThis can be really easy, or really hard depending mostly on one variable: the number of enemies. Though the combat is just a responsive as the flight system and very satisfying, the enemy A.I. is very limited and not very advanced. Taking on anything from one to six is a walk in the park, while seven and up will have you tearing your hair out. This is due to how the enemies attack. With no self preservation, they just come flying at you shooting the whole time. This, however, isn't that bad, considering that their top speed is the equivelant of your second speed, so in the event that you need to retreat, or go to the other side of all the enemies, it is easy to do so.\n\nIV - Ship customization:\nThis part was a lot of fun for me. It may depend on how much you like customization, but personally, I would not recommend using the default ship, so customization is almost a manditory part of the game. The game allows you to load up an empty map and go to town with every tool at your disposal. A tutorial for some, would be nice, but I found no problem with picking everything up. Customizing your ship adds value and care for it. It makes it feel like it's really your ship. I might not have liked this game nearly as much were it not for the ship customization.\n\n5. Story:\nThis part is what inspired me to write this. I will not say anything about it, except that you have to read the encrypted messages. The encrypted messages are the main story, everything else is just fluff. Quite nice fluff, but just fluff. If you have not had this game spoiled yet, you have to buy this game now. Do not look up the story. Go into it completely blind; you'll thank me later.\n\nThat concludes this review. If I had to rate this game, I would give it a 9.8/10. I have to take that .2 off because of the few and far between bugs, and slightly dodgy graphics, but I hardly noticed any of that. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone who will give me five seconds to talk.

For those who are not interested in reading on, I can tell you now that Rodina holds up as one of my best gaming experiences of 2014.\n\nTo begin with I'll address the topic of Early Access: Rodina stands out as one of the more robust offerings from the alpha pile currently on Steam. The major mechanics are all solid and the one or two bugs I have encountered have not upset my experience. Furthermore, Rodina offers a freeroaming play style for those of you who would prefer to save the story beats for a more feature complete version of the game.\n\nIn game, Rodina offers players a space exploration sim with jaw-dropping world design, customisable ship interiors, collectables, combat and an impeccable musical score. The almost seemless transition from planet surface to ship interior to piloting out of the atmosphere is key to the immersive experience and this will only be enhanced in subsequent updates with the inclusion of cockpit piloting mode.\n\nKeyboard controls are on the whole functional, however playing with an XBox 360 controller feels far more intuitive and the developer has eluded to this being the standard input for play-testing. Graphically Rodina looks very pretty, particularly when you dive down into the atmosphere of the vast planets, however this is countered by far more blocky animations as seen during ship fires or firing up the limnal drive. Strangely, this juxtaposition seems to work well for Rodina, although Elliptic has suggested that these graphics are merely place-holder at this time.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Rodina has a solar system which rewards exploration. At the hundreds (perhaps thousands) of 'sites of interest' dotted around planets and asteroids you will find weaponry top-ups as well as memory sticks which serve to flesh out the world around you. These breadcrumbs are welcome reward for stealthing or fighting your way past enemy vessels, the latter of which proves to be the most challenging aspect of the game.\n\nAll told, the current version of Rodina offers a beautiful world for players to delve into. While item collection and ship-to-ship combat present more traditional gameplay hooks, I have found myself enjoying this title more for it's zen-garden qualities. Watching the blazing red-sun rise over the ice-canyons on Morena while stood next to your personal space ship is superbly cool.\n\nThe developer, Brendan Anthony, is actively engaged with the community and has excellent calibre in his previous body of work. Impending updates will inevitably increase the variety and functionality to Rodina, however the game in it's current state is already well worth your time and money. Play now, thank me later.","December 7, 2014","true","12.5"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","32","36","3","0"

In my opinion, simply the most beautiful and breathtaking game I have ever played (In the graphically absrtact perspective). There are no loading screens, and I see why that is such a big deal for a massive game like this. I thought it was amazing when I started, but I had no idea what I was going to witness within the hour. Here is what made this game go from awesome to unbelievable:\n\nMy Start in Rodina (Spoilers)\nI started the game to the main menu and at the main menu I pressed start game, and went with normal mode. First of all, there wasn't even a loading screen to get in the game. Once you start the game from the menu, the menu goes away and you are just...playing. Just like that. Quickest startup ever.\n\nAnyway, so I started my journey accross the hills and small mountains of a planet that I started on. I saw a green circle icon in the distance, which is my ship. So I traveled there. I then flew it to another part of the planet where there was a plus sign icon. That means there are collectables. I found some empty crates and barrels to take, and some lost Archives to read. One of teh Archives was a small story that would be read later. The other was an upgrade that let me break the surface and head out into the vast, open, black abyss that is space. I went towards some white circles that turned out to be asteroids. It was a belt full of them. After going to several asteroids, getting near them and them appearing, landing and collecting, and leaving, I finally found one asteroid with something different, something I hadn't seen yet. It was a Diaconium Cyrstal. Now I could travel to another planet. I saw several question mark signs all around, those were the planets. This is where my mind was blown.\n\nI headed towards a planet at cruise speed (my first upgrade that allowed travel to other asteroids). Well that wouldn't work this time. No, planets are not at all the same as a puny ateroid. So I turn on my new upgrade from the crystal, which allowed faster than light travel. It only took several seconds to get to it. But once I reached the atmosphere, I had no idea how long it would take with cruise speed just to reach the surface. It took a while.  Constant acceleration downward. However I found out very quickly I could not use cruise speed, as that would burn up my ship with that speed combined with the planet's gravity. So I had to use the next fastest speed, combast speed. Steady, stable, easy to use if in a fight, but also good for quick getting around on a planet's surface.\n\nSo after reaching the surface and taking my first steps out, I was officially mind blown. The planet was actual size. Maybe close to Earth even. I don't know onehundred percent for sure, but it had to be the size of a small real planet. No loading screen, I had no performance issues, it was very smooth, but took a while to reach the surface due to its unbelievable size.\n\nReview Section (Less Spoilers)\nI will do pros and cons, because that is what I am good at.\n\nPROS:\n-The game presents a new definition of "Massive" refering to size. 11/10 (Yes, this one goes to 11)\n\n-Combat is very fun and really easy to control and you feel like a true space ship pilot. 10/10\n\n-Controls are very smooth and easy to get the hang of. 10/10\n\n-Graphics, they aren't like Battlefield graphics, but they are still pretty good. Nothing too fancy, but interesting. Things look more fun and colorful than realistic. However there aren't many textures other than terrain. But that doesn't matter so much. 9.8/10\n\n-The models for objects are pretty cool, kind of low poly but cool. The ship you fly is quite low in detail in the model though, except for the inside, but that doesn't matter very much either. 9.7/10\n\n-Travel Speed Balance, the balance of traveling speeds was done very well in my opinion. 10/10\n\n-The NPC ships are pretty cool. The enemy ships are pretty aggressive and do not hold back. Get ready to be defensive. 10/10\n\n-The soundtrack is great. 10/10\n\nCONS\n-I am an honest review writer and I am not lying when I say I can't think of any cons just yet. I will update if I find any.\n\nSummary/TL;DR\nSo overall this is an amazing game. As a game developer myself (I don't have anything released yet, but this is from my experiences in code and graphical design) I am truly impressed with this game. I would love to know how the developers did this the way they did. It is fun and has alot of action, but is also calm and peaceful. Also the soundtrack is awesome like I said above.\n\nTL;DR,\nThis game is a fun, explorative, massive scale space game with planets that I think are actual size and take time to get to the surface. It is peaceful but can be action packed and fast paced. So it is a very great game. One of the best I have ever seen.\n\nSo finally:\n\nDo I think it is worth the price? Of course!\nWould I recommend this to just about anyone? Yep!\nCan I predict that your mind will be blown too? Definitely.\n\nShould you buy this game? I would say absolutely!\n\nSo thank you for reading!","October 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","2"

The freeness to fly where I want, how I want to; the ability to become a burning pile of spacejunk upon entry into a planets atmo; walking inside my own spacecraft! This game has potential, but it is just that right now, potential. The game does not have enough content in it to be worth it yet. To reiterate my point, I'll tell you everything you can do in game as of now.\n\n1. Fly around\n2. Shoot at baddies\n3. Extinguish fires\n4. Customize the interior of your ship\n5. Walk around in your ship, or across the massive but barren terrain of planets and asteroids\n6. Scavenge ammunition and read short stories which are often located in the same place\n\nThat's just about it, the most intriguing part of the game is reading about the main story line in which you can not participate in at this point of development. I want this game to be good, perhaps even desperately, but it doesn't have much to offer yet. I can't upgrade my ship size or its weapons. There is no one to talk to, the most interaction you get is through short stories of people that you won't get a chance to meet. Entering atmosphere is exhilerating the first time, and it could be all the time if steep re-entry wasn't solely based on a set speed which can be maintained without even trying that hard, the direction the ship is facing doesn't even matter. There is no infantry combat yet, you can't board an enemy ship, you can't even see the enemy if they're not inside a spaceship. The one redeaming factor is the stories, there are plenty of them and it's always exciting to find the next part to it.\n\nI had fun with this game for a little while, not because of the unique space exploration style to the game, but through the story that is told, which by the way, isn't finished yet. Everything else got a tad bit dull without any other content to shake things up. I would say keep a close eye on this game, but I wouldn't recommend buying it yet.","August 22, 2014","false","5.7"," 128 of 199 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","128","199","5","23"

Maybe the game truly was "life altering?"\n\nSadly, no.  Even the developer himself says, "However, there isn't currently enough content or gameplay. That's what I'm working on right now!”\n\nHe couldn't be more correct.  It's semi neat to fly from one planet to the next, but this is becoming old hat in modern video games.  Other than that, there's really little to no gameplay at all right now.  Fly to a planet.  Find a + sign.  Land.  Collect empty crates, empty barrels (neither of which currently seem to do anything) some missiles and a couple of pink crystals.  One will let you continue the storyline in the form of encrypted e-mails which you read, and the other will give you a data entry of some passingly interesting letters collected from the previous inhabitants, which you read.  Fly to next + sign, shoot bad guys with the missiles, rinse repeat.\n\nI played the game for two hours with no change.  If there's anything new introduced later, then the game has pacing issues.  If not, it's just not enough content for a $15 game.  Perhaps in the future it will be, and at that point I'll revise this review.\n\nBut as it is, my rule of thumb is that I should get about $0.50 per hour play time out of a game.  (Thus if I pay $50 for a game, it should be roughly 100 hours of play time.)   As this game cost $15, and I got less than 2 hours out of it, I can't currently give it my recommendation.","October 30, 2015","false","1.9"," 107 of 168 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","107","168","5","4"

You can land on any asteroid or stand atop any mountain, if you don't burn up in the atmosphere on your way down. Everything is rendered to scale with completely seamless transitions. There are enemies, but you can take them; there are mysteries, but they are just another excuse to go exploring. This is all so ambitious and novel that the game engine was developed completely from scratch, not out of hubris but because maintaining immersion at such variable scale simply isn't possible in any mainstream game engine.\n\nIt can only get better from here.","June 9, 2015","true","25.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

At least, it has the potential to be.\n\nI just finished the storyline thus far in the game, and I must say it left me speechless. The story is thrilling from start to finish, although it does require some reading (trust me, it's worth it).\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, I found it challenging, but not frustrating. I enjoy games that teach the player and then test the player's knowledge and adaptability. This game executed this flawlessly. The enemy ships in Rodina start out small, like a couple of fast, low-firepower ships. As you progress through the game, you have to fight larger, more powerful ships, and usually a different strategy is required. I would describe the combat itself as a spacecraft dogfight. The main weapon is a machine gun-like weapon with an enormous spread. At first it seemed unappealing, but I grew to love it with use, and so will you. The game has four (so far) different secondary weapons, and the player may only select which secondary weapon to choose while inside the ship, using its operations computer. This forces the player to choose the secondary weapon outside of combat, which means you must plan your battles.\n\nI could go on and on about the gameplay and never get tired of talking about it. Rodina has many interesting features and challenges to keep the game interesting. For example, if your ship takes enough damage, you may have to leave the controls to fight a fire inside your ship with a fire extinguisher, or else slowly lose health until your ship explodes. Also, when entering a planet's atmosphere, the player must control the ships speed so that it doesn't differentiate into the atmosphere. Also, the controls become unstable during this, adding to the challenge.\n\nAnother fantastic feature of the game is that it is, of course, completely seamless. Even in hyperdrive mode, as you cross an entire galaxy, the only discomfort you will encounter is a tiny drop in fps.\n\nThis game is amazing. Sure, some things can be improved and added (most of the walking around, planet surface walking, player weapons like guns), but there is plenty of room for more features. Personally, I'm excited to see the next chapter of the Rodina story. Do yourself a favor and get the game, it's a great experience and you will follow the development of a fantastic game with a riveting story.","December 17, 2014","true","23.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

No other game has left me feeling so excited about the potential this game has. Already the basic mechanics are all there - intuitive flight, challenging combat, the amazing transition between exploring planets and asteroids on foot to slingshotting around the sun to get to your next objective. It just needs more content and more diversity.\n\nIf someday down the line I find myself working on creating my own settlement on the shores of a lush procedurally-generated garden world while defending it from the xeno threat in the skies above it will truly be a gem among games.","July 29, 2014","true","15.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Have that space exploration itch located in the most awkward spot? Well this is the closest thing you're going to find that can reach that itch.\n\nRodina is set in a single solar system Occupied by 4 life size planets, over 400 gigantic asteroids, and 15,000 tiny asteroids. All of them are teeming with loot, lore, and a hostile alien race. It is up to you to ensure that Humanity can colonize this new system safely before they arrive.\n\nIn Rodina, your ship, is YOUR ship! You can set the layout of your ship however you want and furnish them as you please. Make your bedroom, bathroom, engineer room, and your bridge. There's even a Tile set made entirly of Holoscreens, which project the outside area on the walls in 3D, making it perfect for cockpits and/ or observation decks, so that you may gaze upon the stars.\n\nSpace combat takes some getting used to, but very satisfying as you unleash hell on alien fighters and watch them hurl towards the surface of the planet in a fireball of glory!\n\nSpace exploration is a tad bare bones at this time. You find a marker, destroy any hostiles gaurding it, land, grab the Datasticks (lore), Encryption Keys (story progress), and any special weapons ammo, and repeat. Although you can exit your ship, and explore the surounding terrain, theirs not much to see other than some amazing vistas on mountain tops and HUGE canyons.

Many are usually more or less incomplete games, so Early Access, for many games, is essentially an excuse for Beta testing without having to pay anyone. However, there are some games that are a full, complete game even in early access, and provide new and interesting content untill the developers feel it's ready to fully release. Rodina is NOT one of these games. So the question is, why do I reccomend it so much?\n\nThe answer is simple: Rodina is a very open, very easty-to-play, and very fun game, and will one day be something amazing.\n\nAs it stands, the world is very baron and empty, with only a few game mechanics involved, which includes flying around, collecting things on the surface of planets and asteriods and flying. I wouldn't callt his a complete game at all. However, what is in there are plots with a dark sense of humour, as well as what is so far an interesting main narritive which, althought it can be hard to follow at times, keeps you wanting to find more things.\n\nBut easily the main reason i'd reccomend this game is atmospheare. This game has such an immense sense of scale, that coming right up to the sun and seeing its size actually made me feel ill it looked that big. And the flying mechanics are absolutely great too. And planets are planet-sized. You could fit the GTA5 map on the smallest plannet dozens of times over with ease. Each planet has a unique feel to it and all are worth exploreing, as long as you can get past the enemies.\n\nThis is where we reach the weakest part of the game: the combat. I am really dissapointed too, because this is finally a game that makes me feel like i'm flying around in 3-D space without having to learn too many complex controls and yet the combat system is so broken. Perhaps I am simply bad at the game, but the enemies take way too long to die, and the extra weapons you find on the ground are very limited and either don't add a whole lot or are pretty much required to stand even a chance at beating them.\n\nBut again, this is where I still want to keep reccomending the game. I know for a fact that the combat system is going to be improved eventually, and I am sure that it'll be better and more diverse. I have a lot of faith in this game and I would at least reccomend getting the free demo, to see if it's the sort of game you'd like.\n\nIn conclusion, while most Early Access games are a game which feels like a tech demo, this Early Access game is basically a tech demo which feels like a game. Pick it up now, because over time I feel that this game will start getting really good, and the price may go up.","January 18","true","10.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Oh boy this game.\nThere are so many things to love about this game. To get started, this game is a space exploration game in which you can Pilot a very deadly (If used right.) Spaceship. You can discover astroids and find abandoned treasure such as missile's and lost info, You can run into enemy ships and take them down. You can visit planets and conquor all the enemies lurking there, build your own massive spaceship, or just fly around space, on a massic scale.\n\n(Pros)\n+Easy to learn controls\n+A massive amount of things to discover, such as astroids or even planets.\n+The Soundtrack. It is AMAZING. OH MY GOD IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DYNAMIC ORCHESTRA SOUNDTRACK THAT I LOVE.\n+Runs smoothly on most windows\n+Combat is easy to learn and enjoyable\n+The sheer size of the galaxy. Astroids are small, have little treasures on them, but there are THOUSANDS on them. Seriously, you could count. While there being a small amount of planets, they are HUGE. GIGANTIC. Massive mountains to fly over, tons of treasure to discover, enemies to fight, and the scale of these planets could be considered THE SIZE OF EARTH. Not joking, yet not guranteed.\n+No loading screens.\n+The ability to fully customize and build your own ship.\n+Many more things I personally enjoy, like entering the atmosphere of planets, and the enjoyable feeling of the combat.\n\nI could go on about the pros, but lets not waste to much time.\n\n(Cons)\n-Limited space to build spaceships, you can't have them go on forever.\n-Missiles are unable to counter, which I can understand, this game is still in alpha, and will probably have alot more things added.\n-Enemies have extraordinary accuracy. While not dealing to much damage, they land almost every hit, but this could just be considered adding to the difficulty.\n\nYou could say I lack some cons only because I am trying to defend the game, but that's not true.

Even just racing through the massive, deep and extraordinary 'cracks' in the service of the ice planet is fun, but Rodina is not perfect.\n\nThe story is told through text, which may put some people off, but for me it seems to get the main story line across and some how create a immersive lore.\nOn the other hand, the story isn't really present in the gameplay. The story makes out that there is news stations and various interesting characters... when really you get to see none of them. In this sense the gameplay can seem quite removed from the story; The enemy you fight is faceless (they could be anything for all it tells you) and seem to be the part with very little lore apart from 'they are bad' (however this does create mystery).\n\nThe gameplay is very fun; it is the reason why i have put so many hours into Rodina and i will put in many more i am sure.\nThe ship flying is quite easy to grasp; there is 4 different speeds which your ship can fly at, each seeming to be a lot more faster than the one before. Finding these speeds and using them is rather a shock as they go so fast, but in a great way. The speed of the ship adds to the scale and it is mindblowing when you go down a speed on a planet and realise just how fast you are going and how big the planet is.\nYou can get out of your custom built ship to explore asteroids and planets; there are resources on these planets/asteroids that you can collect, which seems to be the main goal of the game. The character outside the spaceship seems to move very fast and sometimes it can be difficult to pick up resources. I feel there needs to be a way to make the character slower.\nThe combat is so very excellent and the weapons each different from the last, at the moment they do seem a bit limited but certainly do suffice to destroy the various enemy types and make me go "Wow! That is so awesome". There is many enemy types each with different weapons or a combination of weapons and the enemy's certainly put up a fight. Each can be fought with different tactics; the game leaves it up to the player entirely what weapons they wish to use and how they want to fight an enemy, or if they want to fight an enemy at all. One could argue that the later more stronger enemys may be 'bullet sponges', as the saying goes, and take alot of repetitive action and time to fight. For me the tension is kept high, however, as i know i am constantly under threat. For example, from fire or a sudden barrage of missiles i didn't see (which looks overwhelmingly wondrous by the way).\n\nI have not mentioned all the features, but overall i recommend Rodina to a extremly high extent. It is in continued development so even more featues will be added, but right now it is an exceptional game with incredible scale and many many awe inspiring moments.\n","October 13, 2014","true","46.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

[sae.edu.au]\n\nI myself am an avid player of immersive space simulators, and Rodina is a simple, yet brilliant addition to my much beloved genre. Rodina is already full of great features, and has excellent potential in terms of the endless possibilities for the modding side of it. Even though Rodina consists of only one system, it has the potential to habitat so much inside of it.\n\nThe flight and combat in the game is very enjoyable. The movement is all inertia based, and the weapons look and feel amazing. Shooting down enemies high and the atmosphere, and watching them fall out of view, knowing that you could fly all the way down there and find some wondrous mountain range where the ship crashes, makes the game feel extremely grand.\n\nIts story is basic at first, but I suspect it will later develop, which gives purpose to exploring and fighting the large amounts of enemies. The feeling of flying straight out of space and onto a planets surface, while dealing with the fear of burning up in the atmosphere build so much tension and requires focus, particularly on the higher difficulties. Once you are on the surface, and have fought off any enemies in the area, you can land and walk around your ship and the planet, you can even edit the layout of your ship. You can see some great sights exploring on the surface of planets, though, in its current state the surface of a planet/asteroid/planetoid gets a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nAs with most immersive space games, watching the day start, go by, and end on an alien planet is something that gets most immersive space game fans worked up (and anyone who enjoys something beautiful), what makes it even better is knowing that you can go do it all again on another planet.\n\nThis game is already a great experience, for a very low price, even if a short lived one. I am excited to see it as it progresses through development, and we get to see some more incredible sights from an alien system.","March 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

When you hover over planets and even minor asteroids for the first time, you don't understand what you're looking at. No really, because of the lack of any features on planets other than small textures, you won't comprehend that the hill you think you're looking at is a miles high mountain part of a mountain range that when viewed from space looks like a small blemish. That's where Rodina shines, when you get down to the surface of planets and strafe left and right until you realize that those mountains you were whizzing by in your shuttle aren't moving anymore. These are real planets when it comes to scale, in an also vast solar system. The planets themselves, mixed with asteroids of various shapes and sizes are fun to explore for a few hours, expecially coupled with the game's amazing, if not slightly repetitive soundtrack.\nThe story is interesting, considering it is told through Datasticks, and encryption keys you find throughout the various planets and asteroids. The main story unfolds through the Pilot Wave Radio on your ship. There is no exposition, or dialogue choices, so if you're not interested in reading I would recommend you simply play freeform mode (you can still pick up Datasticks). The story at the time of this review is unfinished and cuts off (you get an in game message telling you this). If the story hasn't been spoiled for you yet, play through the game and experience it yourself.\nThe combat is simple at this time. There are a few enemy types that you will encounter, from small scout fighters up to battleships. Your primary weapon is a fast shooting and unlimited laser. There are other weapons you unlock throughout the game by finding containers of their respective ammo. I usually stuck with the starting weapon. Some of the enemies can be simple with practice, while other enemies could use some tweaks.\nYour ship, an (as far as I know) unnamed "Gunship" is a modified human shuttle. It is the medium through which you experience Rodina. To reflect this, the interior of the ship is modular, meaning you can customize it with a generous amount of layouts, props, usable items, and decorations. I say generous as this game is far from complete and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of options we have at this time.\nOverall, Rodina is a great game, and will be even better with future updates.

In terms of gameplay it's somewhat simple - so far there's only fighting other ships, entering atmospheres and finding loot to occupy you, BUT it makes up for the lack of quantity with quality:\n-The dog-fighting is fun, and you can find ammo for new weapons as loot. Some of the enemies are incredibly strong compared to your little ship, so you have to learn to fight them which is something I love (and watching balls of flame fall to the planet surface after a battle in orbit is one of the most satisfying things I've seen in ANY game)\n-Flying in itself is actually a pretty fun experience too: you get different 'gears' that you shift between - basically different speeds. Super slow Docking, nippy Combat, speedy Cruising, and then the cross-the-solar-system-in-seconds Limnal Drive, the game's warp drive (also incredibly satisying to fly in)\n-Entering atmosphere is something you have to do to get to the best loot sites on the planets, and it's actually pretty realistic. Not too hard, and you can always make it easier in the settings\n\nOne of the nicest things in Rodina is the simplicity of the graphics - the pixelly fire and smoke of fallen foes is surprisingly nice looking, and the Limnal Drive warp too - and the basic models of the ships are fooling; they're pretty lethal, and it's one hell of an empowering experience to land next to a downed battleship and realise your petty gunship is basically a speck of dust in comparison. Trust me, the dev pulled off the ship designs really nicely\n\nAnd finally, the best part of the game in my opinion: story. In it's Early Access state it's wonderful already. The backstory is immense - the dev has clearly worked for hours just typing it all up, let alone creating it. At every loot site along with empty containers and ammo is a data-stick, each of which gives you a little article of backstory; things taken from books, reports, meetings, communications etc. which sheds a little light on the Rodina universe - the history, people's stories etc. It's so well thought up.\nAnd of course there's the actual story. I was skeptical at first, since this is an indie game and in my experience inde game stories are simple or odd. This is not the case. AT. ALL. The story is good, maybe not the greatest in the world but above average at the least. It actually got me with a plot twist, which was a refreshing change. The story is seriously just... it's worth getting Rodina just for the story.\n\nIn conclusion (tl;dr): Rodina is really good already. Short and slightly empty feeling, but what's already here is a really good quality, especially the story. I played the demo 4 times and and have finished the game thus far, and I seriously reccomend it.

Learning to fly and navigate has a moderate learning curve as does combat and working the ships devices, but the reward is worth it. I love the storyline! Its pace and depth is as good as any SF book. The Outside ship graphics seem a bit out of place, and the enemy ships seem a bit simple too, but to be honest, I really dont mind as the rest of the game is visually very satisfying.

I think what early access games really need is good communication between the dev and the supporters of the game who quite knowingly purchased the unfinished product and Rodina does this very well and quite interestingly. Up until time of my review depending on the amount you have donated towards the game you can have a say on what the dev should work on next, it’s interesting as it actually makes you feel like you’re a part of the development process and helping the dev to further complete it which in most early access games you will be left in the dark not knowing whether the game has been abandoned or not. I myself am not too fussed on the early access model as its used and abused by too many people, but not all and I think Rodina is one of the few that are actual using it to further progress the game rather than to extract as much money before legging it like so many others. But anyway moving on to the actually game itself is it worth the money?\n\nIn terms of gameplay and progression within the story there’s not much to it at the moment. In fact mainly it’s an exploration game with no real goal other than progressing the story by reading A LOT of text that you will find scattered about, but it is interesting if you stick with it. There is dog fighting combat which feels good however there’s not much to it; it’s very simplified at its present state. Randomly generated worlds are a plenty and some which are huge at that, but then there’s nothing really on these worlds either and soon you start to realise the actual limitations on what you can do right now. One of the more interesting aspects of the game is the ability to modify your spacecraft by creating and modifying the internal rooms with a built in editor. New features are being added, slowly at that but then it seems to be mainly one guy working on it so you can't expect weekly updates. The game is huge that’s a fact and no loading screens as advertised but then this isn't exactly something new or ground-breaking in gaming even on this scale, but it’s also small in that there’s not much to do or even to explore which is my main problem with worlds which are randomly generated that I believe has still yet to be solved. But you might as well make your own mind up about that as there is a demo you can download which you might as well check out first, which seems to be so rare these days so kudos to the dev for that. In terms of visuals it’s very pretty and has a unique art style but it’s nothing visually ground-breaking but it does the job to keep the immersion and that’s what matters,\n\nI'll be keeping a watch on this game, I hope it goes far.\n\n*edit (grammar)","January 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","6"

Locations are beautiful (though there needs to be more music for them) and the story ties in well with your own upgrades. Currently there's not too much  to do, but in a few months I'd say this is something you can't ignore.\n\nIf you think the current price is too much, you can purchase the current build for as little as $2 USD from the dev's website.

Doesnt make sense, considering this game is low graphics and I can run Crysis 3 at max. Unfortunately I have no means to prove this, and it happens so rarely that a quick save and reboot of the game fixes it (still kinda unweary about it though)\n\nSometimes the GUI disappears after combat/piloting ship in first person, quick save and restart fixes it.\n\nOverall:\nI had tried the demo, instantly got hooked and played until the timer went out, purchased the game the moment I could, and have no regrets. This game is a fantastic open-world (or should I say, Open f-ing solar system) game with some serious potention added to its already fantastic gameplay physics and immersive storyline.

The graphics appear to be very plain and flat from the screenshots, but the beautiful lighting and atmospheric effects combine to provide breathtaking scenery, underscored by an unexpectedly powerful soundtrack of orchestral and synth space music which makes simply orbiting at speed above a planet feel profoundly emotional.\n\nThe game is rather simple to play, and does a good job of leading you from quest to quest. The story presented so far at this stage of development is impressively thought-provoking and engaging, a legit science fiction epic inpsired by masters such as Azimov, Clarke and Kurzweil, with surprises for the player that deserve not to be spoiled.\n\nThe controls are direct and unencumbered by over-simulation, and allow you to pilot you ship with full 6 degrees of freedom and utilize your momentum to perform satisfying maneuvers. Usually control setup and familiarization is the biggest hurdle to getting into a 3D spaceflight game, however Rodina's controls and GUI are extremely accessible, arcade-like even.\n\nAn interesting feature is the various "gears" you can put your ship in to control speed: a slow speed for landing, a faster speed for combat, full cruising speed at which you cannot use weapons, and ultimately a giddy and scale-accurate lightspeed where the distance between objects in light-seconds is the precise amount of time it takes you to get there. Each speed setting is essentially an order of magnitude faster than the last. This system works very well to permit easy transition between the fine control needed for negotiating a landing and the coarse adjustments needed for interplanetary travel, as well as getting the hell outta Dodge when necessary.\n\nUnlilke many starfighter games, the ship does not pilot exactly like a fighter plane, but much more like the agile ship from the Descent games, and so combat can be approached with lateral strafing and reverse-thrust distancing against smaller, faster enemies, while larger, slower enemies are best circled and then rushed from the side. You can also switch to the fastest cruising speed momentarily to outrun missile locks and enemy aim, swing around and attack from the flank. The combat is solid, although more enemy ship types such as huge battleships would be nice down the line.\n\nCurrently there is only ship-to-ship battle, although it appears that personal combat and invasion of enemy ships and bases is the next significant addition slated, which will certainly add new depth.\nThere are several weapons you can acquire to fill out your ship's arsenal, from fire-and-forget missiles and bullet swarms to slow, heavy-hitting cannons. Nothing terribly incredible but a quite adequate variety to handle the 4 or 5 enemy types I've found, from light to heavy armor, each specializing in equivalent weapons to those you obtain.\n\nThe story is rather short currently, I completed the main questline in a day in which I found myself incrementally engrossed in the adventure with each upgrade and story log, but I was completely satisfied with what I was able to play, and am eagerly looking forward to the additional content laid out in the development roadmap.\nThere are many things that Rodina is not, at least currently. It is not a space trading game, or survival game, or simulation game, or a relentless high-action shooter. It is a very relaxing exploration adventure that lets you tackle the mystery of the Zorica star system at your own pace and contains all the necessary elements to make it worth the trip.","May 16","true","16.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Now Rodina's gameplay is stellar - don't get me wrong - but nobody seemed to point out the story in Rodina. You might not have even known it had one. That's why I'm here.\n\nThe story in Rodina is set up a little differently than most other games, being that instead of playing through a chronological chain of events, you discover pieces of it at a time. The pieces you collect are written, and I have to say, the people behind Rodina are certainly no strangers to writing. The remnants and transmissions you obtain detailing Rodina's story succeed in inducing a strange twinge of awe inside you, along with the bizarre growing apprehension of the larger scheme of things at work.\n\nThere are two kinds of story elements I suppose: the Encrypted Transmissions, and the Archive Remnants (just what I've chosen to call them). The Transmissions are unlocked procedurally, and give you more and more info on the situation the Rodina's 'Vanguard' faced (roughly) years ago. They are witty, somewhat humorous, and make for great reading. The Archive Remnants are other 'Datasticks' you collect and add to your Archive, which describe various scenarios or bits of culture pertaining to the world and life on the Rodina. Some are single pages, while others are in pieces of four or five, and the latter usually tells its own mini story as well.\n\nFinally getting that last encryption and discovering the truth behind the Rodina and the Vanguard made something click in my head; you could say it confirmed my suspicions. To put it modestly, it felt wierd. Really wierd. The writing, and the way the story is told, coupled with the expansive solar system and seamless world Rodina had created gave me goosebumps. And let me tell you something.\n\nI live in Minnesota.\nI don't get goosebumps easily.\n\n\n[EDIT] Quick developer note: Turns out the writing is done by Andrew Schurr, a friend of the Brendan Anthony (the developer)! It's worth pointing out since I want to give credit to all who deserve it. If you're still reading this, what are you doing, and why haven't you bought the game yet? If you're not sold to the story, check out some of the gameplay reviews.

It allows seamless space travel between different planets in a star system. Not only that, but the soundtrack is procedural depending on the different actions you do.

Another thing: the realistic physics play a very important part in this game's playability. You don't just fly from Point A to Point B. You actually have to use your thrusters in different stages to prevent burning in the atmosphere, crashing into the planet, and being blown up by enemies. Not only that, but your hull can get damaged, causing fires, leaking oxygen, and worse. This game is especially useful for it's compatibility.

The game mixes amzing exploration with a brilliant, and kinda sad, story which, as someone who usually doesn't read anyhting in games, excited me and challenged me to put the pieces together. This is definitely worth buying if the idea of loadingscreen-less exploration, life sized planets, awesome story telling, and sci-fi themed games excite you. If not buy it anyways as it's quite fun to spam missiles at a group of enemy ships and watch them explode and burn.\n\nOther good things about this:\n-Retro mode! Over the age of ten? Miss retro video games? Gotta ♥♥♥♥ pc? Fear not, with retro mode you can increase the pixel size to whatever you want (within the range of 2 to 8)  which is pretty great if you use a potato as your pc.\n-The dev. Yeah, it's odd but he seems to be one of the best devs ever. Just look at the comments on the negative reviews. So if you buy it and you decide it's pretty crap but you can't get a refund of Steam, it seems the dev is happy to help. Also the things he's planning sound great, so keep up the good work.\n-The emergency open all doors button. In the middle of space? Have the burning desire to be thrown out your ship? This button's for you. Just plonk down a control panel and go on the ship tab, have fun!\n-The fix player button. It's a nice little touch if you don't roleplay and you can't find your ship. Also stops you from having to load an earlier save, which can get a bit annoying in some games.\n-The modify ship layout option. You can customize your ship to be whatever you want. Want every tile a holoscreen? Choose from 6 different tile types, including bathroom! Want a ♥♥♥♥ ton of barrels? Place items where ever you want and have as little or as much as you want. Scared of fires (and you should be)? You can put down a lotta fire extinguishers in a lotta places.\n-The demo. Yeah before I sure wether or not to buy this I played the demo a lot. Also use the demo to test wether or not it will run on your pc. It was a pretty great demo and you can continue your game in the full version from where you left of in the demo.\n-You can leave the controls whilst the ship moves. Wanna have a walk around your ship whilst on a long journey. Just press tab whilst steering your ship for it to continue on.\n-First and third person mode. Wanna see what your pilot would see? Just hit f to switch to first person mode.\n-The clutch controls are fun and they work well.\n-Great soundtrack. Really fits the feel of the game.\n\nSo yeah 9/10. Go and buy it (but test it with the demo first, just incase it won't run for you). Looking forward to future updates!","August 3, 2015","true","13.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The combat system can be rather tricky, but overall it's very fun.\n\nThere's also a system in place that allows you to set the speed of your own ship. You have a choice between "Docking Speed", "Combat Speed", and "Cruising Speed". There's another speed modifier you can find via exploration called "Limnal Speed" which allows you to travel at, what else? Light speed!\n\nThere's tons to do in this game as well. Including landing on planets/asteroids! When you're near a planet (with an atmosphere) you will begin atmospheric re-entry. This is a little 'minigame' in which you attempt to keep your ship at a proper angle and speed to avoid it being damaged by the heat. This heat can also spark fires in your ship, but don't worry! There's a handy fire extinguisher for you just in case.\n\nOnce you land on a planet, exiting it is very simple. Simply point up and out. However be wary of the enemies that surround the planets in this game. They're far more common on the planets themselves instead of asteroids and WILL hunt you down!\n\nThere's already tons of things to do in this game, and it's not even finished yet! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a laid-back space exploration game. There's plenty of sandbox to go around. Just steer clear of the star.","October 15, 2015","true","6.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This conception was here long before that was a thought. This game has been on my wish list for a long time and finally bought it (at full price like a crazy gamer shouldn't do for early access games). The devs have been active on the forums (and with updates) and the concept of being able to move about my ship and on the planet is an amazing concept. Any Star Trek, Star Wars or space fan will enjoy this game. Although quite limited in it's early stages, the dev has a huge plan to implement possible one of the best space games ever[elliptic-games.com].\n\nRodina is this Star Trek's fan biggest dream game. I have played Star Trek Bridge Commander (and thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay, storyline and graphics) and yearned to walk around the ship. Rodina brings this fantasy to reality with it's concept. The devs are really specific in saying that this is a seamless space game, meaning there are no loading screens. The player can walk around their ship, pilot their ship, get off their ship, get off the planet and onto the ship without any loading processes. The absolute first feature players will notice is that they are able to walk anywhere around their ship. There is only one ship at the moment but there is a small modding community that offer different ship designs. These mods are not flawless and some may need special attention to get working properly (in-game and out of game). The player may design and change the inside of the ship at any time. If you would like a bigger bridge, bigger room, bigger hallways, that can be done with a few simple clicks. The design menu isn't super friendly but does provide the player with basics to design what they want. What is a neat feature is that the player may remotely control the ship from certain panels. For example, say you don't want to walk to the cockpit every time you would like to pilot the ship. There is a panel located by the air-lock located on the back of the ship for the players convenience. That by itself showed me there was some serious thought put into the game.\n\nThe player may fly the ship in almost any direction and can pilot/interact with panels by pressing "F". WASD allows the player to move as well as steer the ship. Spacebar allows the player to jump while allowing the ship to move upwards on the z axis. There is no crouching ability (I'm assuming yet) but CTRL will move the ship downwards on the z-axis. The controls/sensitivity can be modified for your preference. Some secondary weapons can be picked up on stray planets or asteroids and can be equipped by pressing R. There is no first person mode to shoot as of yet but there may be plans in the future. The devs haven't singled out many suggestions but are keeping to their road map and are focusing on a campaign. Tab will allow the player to switch between first person and third person view. This is only possible while piloting the ship. Left button will fire the ships weapons while the right mouse button acts as the clutch (in which the player will need to press up or down to switch between drive systems). Some drives will need to be picked up by the player by exploring. Currently, I have experienced four drives in which the fourth will let you travel at light speed. Piloting and landing have been made relatively easy to do. The ship will approach a planet/asteroid and slowly start adjusting itself as you attempt to adjust yourself to the horizon. Leaving the planet to travel is also equally as easy but entering will require some skill as the atmosphere may burn you and your ship up! Quick! Grab the fire extinguisher!\n\nThere are no significant or diverse NPC's at the moment but this is on the agenda. There are a few enemies you will encounter upon traveling the stars. The campaign as of now consists of the player starting on a barren rock, finding their ship then collecting some materials (such as crates, weapons - limited, diary logs and technology) then traveling to the next planet. The player then may choose where they wish to go next. Most planets will have enemies defending it as well as cargo on it (be it logs, weapons or empty crates). There is a minor story line that the player can follow but will require them to decipher certain messages while other messages can be simply read. Graphics remind me of minecraft but there is an HD mod out there to help improve the visuals. I personally hope there will be a significant upgrade in this realm. Sounds are basic at the moment and do not vary much. All the fundamentals are there though!\n\nOverall, the game seems promising although limited at the moment. Hardcore space fans will find hours of fun in this early access while regular gamers may be waiting for a full release to come out. Early access is a tricky gamble but I've bought the game in hopes that this will become a great game. I will give it a recommendation but will advise players that they should really do their homework before buying.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.7/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\n\nView from the cockpit\n\nA mod in action\n\nPlanet discovery\n\nDon't jump into an atmosphere quickly.","May 17","true","6.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Few games feature the ability to travel to other planetary bodies and explore said bodies on foot, for example.  Most of my time was spent blundering from one asteroid to the next and unfortunately, I have yet to find other planets that feature various biomes.  Either I simply haven't found them yet or they're not present in the game's current build.  The former could entirely be the case, as there's no tutorial that guides me on where to go/what to do next.  I would say the game is worth it for the potential alone, though folks on a tight budget may want to wait for more content before dropping the cash.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr5iiQykFKQ","April 10, 2015","true","2.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I like what the dev's goals are and it's got good ratings.  14.99$?  Sure I'll give it a shot."\n\n6 hours later at 2am.... sleep finally won over and I quit the game for today.  I'll pick it right back up tomorrow morning.  This is honestly one of the best Indy games I have ever played.  And by far THE best sandbox/simulator game I've played.  I must say don't worry about the "Early access" if you read the dev's notes the game is stable and completely playable with a freaken amazing and unique storyline.\n\nMy only issue with it was the look of the ship/ships in the game.  But I understand why it was done that way and it's easly fixed if you have the computer to handle it.  This is a new game but there's already an active modding community and through that it's easy to make the ships look much better.\n\nThere are other aspects of the game that make you realize the dev has so much more planned for it.  So many things to interact with that at the moment don't have a use but I'm sure will before long.  I am seriously looking forward to where this game is going and it is honestly the best 15$ I have spent in a long time!\n\nIn short.... buy this game!  Please buy this game?  Please?  I want this dev to get the support they need to reach the goals they have in mind for this game.

It's clear about events yet cryptic how you fit in.  It goes at your own pace and you don't know who to trust, and is topped off with a plot twist I didn't see coming.\n\nThe story is presented to you in such a way that you feel like an observer looking in, if it weren't for the fact that the game tells you you're involved, but not how.  The story isn't forced upon you, either.  You can discover it at your own pace, along with side stories, some funny, some intriguing, some dark, and some all at once.\n\nCombat never gets old.  You're flying around super fast to catch and satisfyingly shoot down aliens while avoiding their fire and defensively blasting their missiles, making you feel like a space ninja.\n\nThe game has many small but really neat details.  Defeated alien ships will crash land into any nearby planet.  Entering the atmosphere will jostle the camera and surround your ship with flames until you've finally entered the atmosphere, accompanied with the perfect sound effect while fully revealing the beauty of the new world.  You can customize the interior of your ship.  You can pilot it in first or third person.  You can leave it running and walk around in your ship, and even jump out of it or open the airlock to quench flames in emergencies when your extinguishers aren't enough.\n\nThere's more to this early access game, but I'm not gonna spoil any more.

Rodina is a space exploration game, with enimies that you can shoot down to take over a planet. There are 4 planets (Hopefully there will be more in the future) that you can visit and land on. Although in the spaceship that you fly around in makes everything seem small, YOU'RE SO WRONG. SO SO SO WRONG. The sense of scale in this game is far past anygame that I've ever seen. Infact, the spaceship itself is about the size of a house. The mountains are gigantic, in the sense it takes 30 minutes+ to climb some of the tallest ones. You have a jetpack that lets you fly around as well, which is very fun. The game has three main modes, Normal, Freeform, and Peaceful. Normal is more or less the main story of the game, in which you can easily die. Freeform is basically the creative mode, although you can still die in it. And I haven't played peaceful, so I'm not sure what that is about. The games graphics are kind of polished-pixelated. They look amazing but can run on most computers, even if you have a potato. And you may think the "No loading screens" in the game description is false, IT'S NOT. The only loading screen I've ever seen in this game is the one that you get once you boot up the game, which, loads very very quickly. So, it's a very nice game, it's a little bit limited on the planets, but hopefully more will be added. This game is wroth $15. If you like Space Engineers, Space Engine, Universe Sandbox 2, or Sol 0, get this game!","February 24","true","4.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

It really blends the experience of space nicely. You really feel how desolate some of these places are. Actually quite cool to fly into the atmosphere making sure you dont burn up on entry. Needs a ton of content yet, but boy this sure has promise. I hate that word in gaming now, "promise". I tend to go the other way when I hear that word but in this case it is actually promising. Nice blend of space and first person experience. A little concerned about direction of the title, the dev himself doesnt know which worries me a tad. Typically with something this epic you do need some sort of plan. He's done quite well for a one man team. I just hope he expands with more people should funding provide for it.

The story is great, reminding me a bit of homeworld.  This game has you taking place as a lone fighter pilot in an attempt to surive in a solar system full of alien ships that are trying to hunt you down and any other survivors of a massive ship crash. Coming with that means you must find ammo, scavenge for upgrades and weapons to your ship. You must also pick your fights and be wise about engagements, even on low difficulties, the enemies can travel in groups from 2-6 as you see in the video. Combat takes skill and you must save up your ammunition types for big enemies like the missile firing blimps. Fighting those things are hard as hell but when you destroy it listening to an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, you will feel pretty happy of your new accomplishment. Rodina's soundtrack ranges from calming exploration music, to the exact right tone of combat music for fighting and is done so well. I kept imagining my pilot looking at the viewscreen, sweating and shaking with fear, with a fire indicator going off as he keeps his hand clenched around the joystick, pulling the trigger in a bitter battle against the aliens in a fight for survival while listening to the soundtrack. If music can put detailed images like this did in my head, I would consider it a great work of art. The graphics on the ships are dated, but you will get past this as you start exploring, fighting, and finding bits and pieces on the planets. The planets are HUGE and they arnt kidding when they mean full-scale. The solar system and planets are absolutely vast places. PLanets have an atmosphere, which means re-entry. Good luck not burning your ship to bits in your first time re-entering an atmosphere :). Planets also have a day-night cycle, i never thought that sunset and dawn would look so cool on a planet. Basically, planets feel like actual planets, however they are very desolate at this time in development with not a lot of stuff on them besides differing natural features. The Ice planet Morena has deep cuts in its crust just like Europa in our solar system. Veles has a highly hot and an acidic atmosphere just like Venus. Jarilo is the temperate and desert planet in the solar system just right for life to exist on it so it is comparable to Earth (besides the desert part). I cant give a comparison for Perun yet. People also complain that this game has no updates. This is completely false and here is my proof from https://elliptic-games.com/ Cockpit Mode on Beta Branch!\n\nMarch 22, 2015\n\n\n\nCockpitMode\n\n\nCockpit mode is now available on the beta branch on Steam! To try it out:\n\n* Switch to the beta (or dev) branch\n* Either start a new game, or load the new default interior so that you get some Holoscreens in your cockpit. You can also add Holoscreens, or the new Holoscreen tileset, if you want to keep your current interior.\n* Sit in the Pilot’s Chair by just walking into it\n* While flying the ship, press “F” (for “Activate”) to bring up the pilot menu, and choose “Toggle 1st/3rd Person”\n\nNow you’re flying in 1st person mode!\n\nWarning!\n\nCockpit mode is for Rodina experts only. You think atmospheric entry and combat were hard before? Now they are even tougher!\n\nAlso:\n\nThis is build 1.1.6 and it comes with some caveats: this particular build is not going to come out of beta! There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* Cockpit mode introduces some pretty big performance issues. It may not be playable on your machine!\n* MSAA anti-aliasing is still turned off\n\nI’m going to be out of town for a little over a week, but after I get back I’ll fix any bugs you guys find, and start on an optimization pass and put anti-aliasing back in, before fully releasing this build!\n\nAt the time of this review, that was 7 days ago, the developer is working as hard as he can on one thing at a time. He spent the entire month of March during this year to make the first person fighter mode (which i will add looks amazing). He also wants to add ship boarding, interactive NPC's, More Robots, and so much more. And the icing on this cake is finally the ability to mod this game. People are literally able to make their own planets and i have seen them before. Spend a little time on the game's discussion page. Some person has made his ship look like a damn X-Wing from Star Wars. You can make your ship look absolutely any way you want to with the help of a modding tool. Because this game has so much potential and this one passionate developer is hardworking and trustworthy, i put out $15 to support this game. The product I was presented with in my opinion was spectacular and fun. If you arnt going to buy this, i highly suggest that you observe this game and watch the development process. For people that arnt buying it now, you should buy it later when all these features are added. If you are going to buy it, what can i say, Have fun!!!!!

Going through atmosphere's can be fun also.  However the planet landscape is where it kind of kills it for me.  For the most part its pretty much the same landscapes just different colours.\nSame with the suns.\n\nMoons around a planet would be great.  First and foremost.  Presently, its like there's thousands of asteroids (all which so far have got enemies around every one which is quite unrealistic) - but surely some planets would have at least pulled some of these asteroids in and have them orbit to make moons.\n\nNo Gas Giants.  However, realistically, Gas Giants also have moons around them.  They're not a waste of universe space.  If Jupiter or Saturn were not around we'd be having a ton more comets and things hitting us if it wasn't for their gravitational pull keeping those sort of things away from us.\n\nI basically went to four planets and 11 asteroids in my two hours of play.  the four planets (can't recall the names) -\n\nOne I started on.   One that had an acidic atmosphere and I couldn't stay on it longer than under 2 minutes because it burnt through the hull of my ship.\nOne That was Icy that basically did the same damage type to my ship by freezing it out.  I couldn't stay on it longer than under 2 minutes.\nThe last one - Peren - all purple, green sun... totally featureless landscape.  I also couldn't find a thing on it although I did see markers for crates and so forth but never found em on my short stay on the planet.\n\nI have no doubt that this game will go quite some way as long as the developer considers the ideas from the community but as its an Alpha game, I checked it out.  Its not for me quite yet - but down the track I could be interested.  Maybe when its on sale later.\n\n","May 13","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There is sparse story through message logs and no story yet implemented to drive the game. The ship interior is customisable allowing the player to edit the interior aesthetic however they like, although this serves little purpose.\n\nSo is it good?\nRodina is enjoyable, it allows you to wander around dogfighting and exploring as much as you wish, but the sandbox has to little in it to make it interesting. The ship mechanics whilst not true to life with the star-trek jargon 'Liminal drive' is still interesting and makes space flight much easier than it would be in a sim (eg Kerbal Space Program). Planetary landing is a nice feature with atmospheric descent threatanigh to blow up your sh*t ship through re-entry heat.\n\nIs it bad?\nAs with many early acces titles this game is a good basis for a larger game that has more depth to it, so whilst Rodian may be a good game with (what I can tell by other reviews is) a good dev, Rodina's early access left me underwhelmed. Updates are a bit sporadic so it's hard to know when you will see a full release after 2 years in early access.\n\nFor £11 Rodina is a somewhat justifiable purchase","May 18","true","5.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I don't concider being limited to a single solar system as much of a problem since scale has in only rare instances improved a game. It's more about how many places to visit and how difficult are they to reach; Change a starmap to a sectormap and a solar system to a spacestation and there really is no difference in most games...\n\nWould like more freedom in design and possibly have the exterior adjust around that design. That shouldn't be too much of a problem with the exterior (hardly) textured as it stands right now. I would also like to see some windows and working atmospherics, pumps, valves, electrical grid and stuff like that in there; Things that determine the efficiency of ones ship. Add to that fuel limitations and such and you've really got something I think.\n\nI'm looking forward for future updates.","August 6, 2014","true","8.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butterflyhome/recommended/314230/","Butterflyhome","Grandma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Butterflyhome/","375 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRodian is a very well crafted exloration game. It bring new ideas and interesting concepts to the adventure game genre. This game feels verry lifeless but i mean that in the best possible way, because it is ment to feel like that it has a HUGE array of different planets, asteroids and a massive sun that will set in flames the second you get close to it. Another thing that this game has above others is that it has a exelent soundtrack that really helps push the game and make it that much better. As of right now the game is a little short on content but the one-man development team is working on it and pushing it in the right direction by making the game all about exploring. Combat in the game is basic but done well, you have your usual machine gun and missiles. The enemy AI is good, but all they consist of is big ships and little ships, but the dev plans on making these enemy ships boardable. One last thing I'd like to discuss is somthing wich I find quite interesting and preaty cool, the Dev descibe it as ongoing development, wich mean that he does not plan to stop making the game until he dicides not to work on it anymore, witch means that he does not know when it will be finished and how long it wil take. Rodina is one of the few games that is worth the price even if eliptic games stop developing it right now. Thoes are my reasons why it would recomend Rodina to anyone who loves exploration games or adventure games.","October 7, 2014","true","8.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I love that the ship has a proper interior that you can customise, although I would've liked the exterior to reflect that or otherwise allow for custom hull shapes. Also the interior feels kind of "ghostly" atm, because there are beds, toilets, blank screens/consoles but no real purpose to them. Again this could be an early access issue and I'd expect that in time, the screens on the workstations will reflect their actual content and we might even see NPCs or other human players roaming the corridoors.\n\nHowever, at this early stage I'm not sure I could recommend it unless you just want to be on board for the final thing and help the dev out (which is totally fine). From an actual gaming standpoint though, it's a little hard to get into right now. The planetoids are barren, and every one seems to have an enemy on it which I seem unable to fight seeing how I have 2 missiles. Doesn't seem to be any scope for exploration really. Maybe I was doing something wrong.\n\nI also experienced some really inconsistent frame rates and a lot of lag when approaching planetoids/asteroids. Again, early access I know.\n\nAnyway I'll definitely check in on this game in a year or so. Potentially I can see how it could grow into something amazing but it's super early days right now.","October 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

As a freform space exploration game Rodina doesn't really hold your hand or tell you what to do, and if you need that in a game you'll feel yourself wanting here.  However if this just your thing then you won't be disappointed.\n\nRodina strives not to be a sterile simulation and does have a neat underlying story that is worth the discovery and it really tries to immerse you into it.  On top of that being able to walk about your ship and look around and if landed go outside onto whatever terrestrial body you happen to be on simply adds to the immersion.  Granted the terrestrial bodies are pretty barren the scale of it can be bit breathtaking at times.  Look and feel asside you feel as though you have been dropped into the midst of some mysterious event and are compelled to find out what happened while at the same time trying to simply survive.\n\nPersonally I think it is the little things that make the difference and make for interesting events as you play like getting into a fire fight and the alarm going off stating that there is a fire aboard your ship as the enemy hits you just right.  I found myself having to evade the enemy first and jump away to safety before I even get up and deal with the fire on an already damaged ship.  Scrambling about trying to remember where the fire extinguishers were and then frantically spraying the fires while watching the health of my ship deteriorate with me in it makes for a tense moments as you finally put out the last of the flames and your ships health is down to 8% (Maybe someday we'll get the option to vent the atmosphere in the ship with consequences in and of itself instead of just extinguishers or other upgrades like a fire surpression system)\n\nI digress I recommend this game to anyone whom likes to drift about in space, and explore a solar system, while getting into the occasional firefight and maybe become part of an interesting story and make up stories of your own.","August 16, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes\nMight this game never get that feature or take years to get that feature? Yes\n\nIs this game worth $15 despite it possibly never advancing beyond what it already is? Definitly.\n\nYes I know everything I started off with was negitives and potenial negitives, I wanted to make sure that people knew what they where getting into before I started with what I do like about the game.  Though the ship customization right now is very much just a build what you want and no need to gather materials so really you just build your ship how you like right at the start and thats it, nothing to add or do to it later in the games current state, its still a really nice feature to use, while I would like to see more of a starting off with basic items and gathering more as you explore atleast even if that doesn't happen it lets you make your ship (on the inside not outside) loook and feel how you want. The dogfighting is really enjoyable even if simplistic because it is definitly anything but easy. Exploring planets and astriods may feel a bit barren but its still beautiful and gives a real sense of scale, and the first time you get to enter a planets atmosphere really shows how much detail the developer wants to put into the game.\n\nWhile its definitly a game in alpha and not a finished product, and while it may end up being years before anything that makes it feel more like a game then just a tech demo, I would definitly say the sence of scale, the amazing beauty while exploring and the dog fighting make it well worth the asking price.","August 18, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I never thought I would say that about a game with such a minimalistic art style.\n\nThe exploration, the combat, the beautiful story... Try the one hour demo and see if you'll like it.  You may end up like me and buying it with 10 minutes remaining in the demo!\n\nIt reminds me of Evochron Mercenary, but focusing more on the exploration aspect of space sims.

The planets and asteroids seem small and undetailed, until you land on them and see how freaking huge some of them can be.  Then you can take off and land somewhere where the landscape is completely different.\n\nThe biggest selling point, however, is exploring the star system and finding more lore about the universe.

The player can explore anywhere, anytime, on any astroid, on any planet, or in any part of space whenever he or she chooses. The solor system in Rodina is vast, and very fun to travel through. The logs you're able to find are extermly well-written (with the acception of a few typos), the spaceship controls are very fluid and easy to work with, and the combat feels great. I get so much satasfiction from seeing a defeated enemy ship drift off as flaming scrape into the vacume of space or crash into the near by astroid or part of a planet I engaged them on in the first place. My only real complaint would be that the planets and astroids are very bearen, but I'm sure the developers are working on ways to liven them up, it is an early access game (at the moment) after all. Other then that, I whole-heartedly cannot wait for more features to be implemented.

The soundtrack is amazing, the flight and combat are newtonian physics and are pretty challenging. Great thing is that modding is supported and encouraged by the dev. Even in the game's early access state there's already mods being made - and apparently the game's pretty easy to mod so expect more and more content to come from other players as features are added.

Without spoiling too much, I will explain why.\nThe game itself looks amazing. It has a simple art style that makes distant land look like it is a bitmap background and isn't real. This is a good point for the game because it makes it look a lot better than when you first look at it.\nThe drive of the game comes from the data sticks and encrypted messages that you find on each of the different planets. These are written fantastically and caused me to spend an entire day (about 7.5 hours straight) trying to find them all. The all draw you into the universe that you are from and make it feel as if there is life back home and that it isn't just empty. It makes you feel as if you have a home and a reason for being there.\nThen there are the encrypted messages, the best part of the game.... It made me want to find them all to find out about the small forward scouts that came to the system to see what it was like so that the Rodina (mother ship) can colonise the system.\n\n*Potential spoiler skip if you don't want to know too much*\n\nThe last encrypted message leaves the story on a cliff hanger. I was left feeling as though I wanted more and wanted to strangle the writers for stopping such a fantastic story the way that they did.\n\n*end of spoilery bit*\n\nOverall, if you love space exploration games then why do you not already own this???? If you love to have a brilliant story to read about, why do you not already own this???? So giving this game a recommendation is an understatement.\n\nBuy it, now!!!","January 31, 2015","true","21.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But during my time in the demo and for a short while recently after i finally bought this wonderful game, there was one thing that seemed to be constant:\nNothing happened.\nAll i did was fly around a planet, looking for upgrades and more things to find about the lore of this game to keep myself intriguiged.\nThen I found a reason to truly enjoy this game.\nThis was what happened that made me love this game not long ago before posting this review\n\n---\n\nDoing buisness as usual, looking around for upgrades and such, just trying to find the indicator to appear to bring me in so i can dock and pick it up.\nFinally, i see something and fly over to it and try to dock.\nMiserably fail, and my ship takes critical damage because it hit the ground too hard, leaving it with under 20% hull integrity, with a fire starting.\nQuickly, I land the ship, grab the fire extinguisher and take care of the fire.\nSomething wasn't right though, the ship wasn't repairing itself.\nCurious, i make my way back to the captain's chair to pilot the ship.\nRight before i start to pilot, a Red warning began to flash infront of me: "WARNING: MISSILE LOCK"\nOh ♥♥♥♥.\nPanicking like ♥♥♥♥ now, and boosting away as quickly as possible, and then turning around to see what I'm up against.\nFour enemy ships, the first time ive been up against more than 1.\nUnder 20% health, outnumbered, and most likely outgunned, Chances were most likely not in my favor.\nStill, i give it my best shot, boosting back towards one enemy ship, slowing down before blasting it to pieces, and then boosting off as another missile lock appears.\nAs i repeat the same process with each ship, in the end I emerged victorious, and quite proud with myself, with four burning ships litter the ground.\nTime to see what was in store for me.\nAs it turns out, one of the things i was trying to pick up before i was rudely interrupted, was the upgrade i was looking for, a heating upgrade so i could go explore the ice planet. Exactly what i needed to progress.\n\nAgain, for a time when i reach the ice planet there was period of time where not much happened.\nFound three areas with data sticks that uncover more of the backstory, but only signals of enemies that were too far out.\nThen, my opportunity comes, after hunting down another upgrade, i find a site where one might be located, as i approach, enemy contacts appear, a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of ships converge ontop the site.\nIts that time again.\nWanting another fight like i did not too long ago, i rush to the enemies, as i get close, they do exactly what I imagined they would; scatter and then swarm me.\nGood thing the primary weapon in this game spreads like crazy. Even though there were much more ships than last time, I make short work of them while sustaining a fair amount of damage, as it appears they lacked the ability to use missiles, unlike the ones before. But even after winning the fight, the battle music is still playing and my hull isn't repairing, Naturally, i looked up to figure out why. A new group was coming in.\nKnowing if i tried to fight them directly, i wouldn't stand a chance, i run off a little, and then come back to destroy a few of the ships, this hit and run tactic was for the most part, effective.\nAfter a few, quick hit and runs I'm once again, victorous, and with a lot of burning ships on the frozen ground.\nOnce more, the music did not stop. Just a little above my position, a third group was coming in, thinking this would be the same as before, I made the same attempt to fight them, one thing was off however, these ships could use missiles. And one ship in particular looked different, and hell had a different trail than the other ships, the others had green trails, this one had a pink trail. It didn't take long to realize this ship could be special when i saw a barrage of missiles come flying at me, and then quickly kill me.\nIt was time to get creative, and then die. A lot.\nAnd that I did.\nAfter dying multiple times, i get the idea that if im always behind this special ship, it cant pummel me with its own missiles. So, i try it.\nAnd it worked, after this thing was finally destroyed, I turned my attention to the other ships that were with it, and made short work of them.\nThe battle music finally ends, and my ships starts to repair.\nIt had finally ended.\nAnd it was well worth it.\n\n---\n\nThats pretty much my experience with this game so far, and has quickly become a space sim game i truly enjoy.\nIf you have the money to do so, i'd say go buy this game. If you dont, try the demo. You might just like it, and maybe you'll have a similar experience to what I had, and you'll know what im talking about.","April 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But during my time in the demo and for a short while recently after i finally bought this wonderful game, there was one thing that seemed to be constant:\nNothing happened.\nAll i did was fly around a planet, looking for upgrades and more things to find about the lore of this game to keep myself intriguiged.\nThen I found a reason to truly enjoy this game.\nThis was what happened that made me love this game not long ago before posting this review\n\n---\n\nDoing buisness as usual, looking around for upgrades and such, just trying to find the indicator to appear to bring me in so i can dock and pick it up.\nFinally, i see something and fly over to it and try to dock.\nMiserably fail, and my ship takes critical damage because it hit the ground too hard, leaving it with under 20% hull integrity, with a fire starting.\nQuickly, I land the ship, grab the fire extinguisher and take care of the fire.\nSomething wasn't right though, the ship wasn't repairing itself.\nCurious, i make my way back to the captain's chair to pilot the ship.\nRight before i start to pilot, a Red warning began to flash infront of me: "WARNING: MISSILE LOCK"\nOh ♥♥♥♥.\nPanicking like ♥♥♥♥ now, and boosting away as quickly as possible, and then turning around to see what I'm up against.\nFour enemy ships, the first time ive been up against more than 1.\nUnder 20% health, outnumbered, and most likely outgunned, Chances were most likely not in my favor.\nStill, i give it my best shot, boosting back towards one enemy ship, slowing down before blasting it to pieces, and then boosting off as another missile lock appears.\nAs i repeat the same process with each ship, in the end I emerged victorious, and quite proud with myself, with four burning ships litter the ground.\nTime to see what was in store for me.\nAs it turns out, one of the things i was trying to pick up before i was rudely interrupted, was the upgrade i was looking for, a heating upgrade so i could go explore the ice planet. Exactly what i needed to progress.\n\nAgain, for a time when i reach the ice planet there was period of time where not much happened.\nFound three areas with data sticks that uncover more of the backstory, but only signals of enemies that were too far out.\nThen, my opportunity comes, after hunting down another upgrade, i find a site where one might be located, as i approach, enemy contacts appear, a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of ships converge ontop the site.\nIts that time again.\nWanting another fight like i did not too long ago, i rush to the enemies, as i get close, they do exactly what I imagined they would; scatter and then swarm me.\nGood thing the primary weapon in this game spreads like crazy. Even though there were much more ships than last time, I make short work of them while sustaining a fair amount of damage, as it appears they lacked the ability to use missiles, unlike the ones before. But even after winning the fight, the battle music is still playing and my hull isn't repairing, Naturally, i looked up to figure out why. A new group was coming in.\nKnowing if i tried to fight them directly, i wouldn't stand a chance, i run off a little, and then come back to destroy a few of the ships, this hit and run tactic was for the most part, effective.\nAfter a few, quick hit and runs I'm once again, victorous, and with a lot of burning ships on the frozen ground.\nOnce more, the music did not stop. Just a little above my position, a third group was coming in, thinking this would be the same as before, I made the same attempt to fight them, one thing was off however, these ships could use missiles. And one ship in particular looked different, and hell had a different trail than the other ships, the others had green trails, this one had a pink trail. It didn't take long to realize this ship could be special when i saw a barrage of missiles come flying at me, and then quickly kill me.\nIt was time to get creative, and then die. A lot.\nAnd that I did.\nAfter dying multiple times, i get the idea that if im always behind this special ship, it cant pummel me with its own missiles. So, i try it.\nAnd it worked, after this thing was finally destroyed, I turned my attention to the other ships that were with it, and made short work of them.\nThe battle music finally ends, and my ships starts to repair.\nIt had finally ended.\nAnd it was well worth it.\n\n---\n\nThats pretty much my experience with this game so far, and has quickly become a space sim game i truly enjoy.\nIf you have the money to do so, i'd say go buy this game. If you dont, try the demo. You might just like it, and maybe you'll have a similar experience to what I had, and you'll know what im talking about.","April 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The map is massive and you can feel it, in anything other than the top speed you will barely feel the movement, giving a clear impression os the sheer size of this game world.\n\nYou can also customize the interior of your ship into almost anything you want, but there are size limits so it can fit into the exterior, which really supports your immersion into the game.\n\nThere could be improvements to the navigation and combats systems in the game, as there is very little to tell you where you are in the solar system outside of looking for where the sun is, and there is very little in the way of a HUD, meaning there is no way of knowing how much damage enemy ships have taken, or what kind of ship they are, which would make the combat much more friendly for players","July 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The "reading about the best parts at home" and "actually going to space" sides are equally interesting. Rodina makes space realistically boring in this fashion. You can see mountains the size of continents, but they still look like piles of red dirt once you get over their size. You can see canyons miles deep that circle entire planets, but they're mostly the same westward as eastward. You can see 10,000 large space rocks but they're all more or less pointless unless you find the one that's only the size of Connecticut. You can see purple skies and a green sun just as easily as yellow skies and a blue sun, and both look equally routine after spending enough time under both. Warp into the sun accidentally, and you'll get a quick laugh. Warp into someplace that isn't the sun and wonder what you'll find. Hit planetside without dieing and your reward is an endless desert, as not-really-picturesque as the REAL Saharan Desert, as it stretches on samily for all of the miles. Maybe you can find some fun rocks, but you have to sift through a billion tons of rainbow dirt to find it. Shooting aliens gets normal after you figure out how to start shooting at max range and backpedaling. The game is boring, but rightfully so because if it was always interesting then it'd be unrealistic. Just remember: Lotta dirt to look through to find that rock in that one episode of Star Trek that bill and Ted parodied.\n\n\n\nSeriously though warping into the sun never gets old.","November 22, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After i purchased it and played for a day, i was left wanting more, all there is in elite is space combat really, a bit of trading, but thats just flying through space, which gets very boring on its own. then i was cruising some reddit forms and stumbled onto rodina. it had just released on steam and didnt have a big following yet, but those who were behind it knew how special it was and there was mods popping up and the developer was super intouch with his audience, like hes making the game for himself as much as us. I wish i could go back, save the 70+ dollars i spent on elite and just have rodina. its so good, scratches all my space game itches, and still has so much potential. and its one of these perfect games for this generation of gamers, with all the mods, and forums. If you are at all interested in these game, buy it. it wont cost an arm and a leg, you help a great guy make a great game, and you will be getting plenty more then your paying for down the road. plus getting early access games like this, that really are early access, give you something to look forward to each month, checking out the new updates.

The graphics are a bit primitive at this stage, but I've been waiting too long for a space RPG where you can fly from one world to another, get out and take in the view, and perhaps fight a few aliens along the way.  The exploration aspect is what I've been waiting for.  I'm a huge fan of Orbiter and Kerbal Space Program, so I like more realistic space sims than the overwhelming majority of space games that consist of a few three dimensional sectors with an atmospheric-style arcade flight model.  My dream game would be the Orbiter flight model set in a Space Engine-like procedural universe (along with SE's graphics) with a first-person MMU mode and no FTL.  Instead, I would favor a game that uses a futuristic energy source like antimatter or a black hole reactor to accelerate at 1 G until Lorentz factors are great enough that the on-board passenger could make it to the destination in a timely manner (due to time dilation on board, hundreds of years could pass outside the ship but only a few years inside the ship - in addition, space ahead of the ship would contract).  In-game time acceleration or a hibernation mode could skip much of the travel at these great speeds for the player.  I realize that for the majority of players, this would be extremely boring, but Rodina is a good step in the direction I prefer.  The flight model isn't as realistic as Orbiter, but because it is completely open I feel that it is a nice compromise between the requirements of a fun game and the immersion I require to feel I'm exploring space.  What I feel would really make my 'dream game' described above fun, despite its disadvantages, is a great story.  And, wow, Rodina has an amazing story.  I can't wait to play it through to the final conclusion.  The current form of the game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, but what an amazing twist at the end!  I hope future editions of the game allow the player explore another star system.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is fantastic.  Can't wait to see the completed masterpiece.  Beyond being a fun game, it's just a really good science fiction story.","April 2, 2015","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All distances and sizes are accurate, including 4 Earth-sized planets, hundreds of major asteroids, and tens of thousands of minor asteroids.\n\nLanding on planets is very well done. You have to enter the atmosphere at a shallow angle to avoid burning up. The first time I tried this I overheated, causing a hull damage and an onboard fire. I had to leave the pilot seat, grab an extinguisher and run throughout my custom-built ship interior battling fires while the ship free-fell through the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the fire was out I ran back to the cockpit and looked out the window to see the very impressive landscape of the planet, the music change upon entering the atmosphere was also very ... "atmospheric".\n\nThe geography of the planets is impressive, even if they are largely lacking in content. It's quite a sight to step out of your ship and get a sense of the awesome mountain ranges, dune seas, gulleys, canyons etc. Very majestic.\n\nUnfortunately all planets are currently lacking things like vegetation, oceans, inhabitants, creatures. Although all of that is planned for the future.\n\nShip customization is also pretty cool. You can build your floor layout any way you like. Currently however, the ship operates the same regardless of what you put on your ship. It's all asthetic. Apparently a lot more depth is planned there too, including multiple decks, and buying/trading ship parts.\n\nAs it is, this game is a fun ship builder / space explorer, with the first full-scale solar system I've ever seen.\n\nMy positive review however is based largely on what is promised. I look forward to seeing what this developer can come up with.\n\nWhat I hope to see in the future\n\n- More content on planets. Life, vegetation, oceans, settlements, caves... etc.\n- The same with asteroids/moons\n- More customization/ ship exteriors, floors, and more depth with ship systems.\n- NPC's, crewmates, droids etc.\n- Space stations\n- Factions\n- Some type of mining/crafting/construction tool. There is so much potential with these nearly empty earth-sized planets. Too big for the developers to fill with interesting stuff, I think it's a great opportunity for players to have a blank canvas with. Players could build a habitable colony on an in-hospitable world. This also leaves the possibility of great cooperative multiplayer down the road.","November 19, 2015","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then you can simply hop into your ship aim it at the sky (perhaps at that intersting point of light you spied in the night sky) and fly into space with the backdoor open to watch those mammoth peaks retreat into the background of the planet's surface.\n\nEqually satisfying is the inertia based space flight and combat - a highlight for me was strolling around on the ground when I noticed a meteor shower landing close to me...only to realise it was the incoming fire from some dive bombing fighters, after a tense sprint back to the ship, and even tenser dogfight, watching the wreckage of the enemy ships dwindle to tiny points of flame on the vast terrain below was both oddly satisfying and reminds you of the scale of this experience you're sitting in.\n\nFinally it's worth mentioning this all occurs against a background of great music (makes me feel like I'm part of 2001 Space Odyssey) and a really excellently written (if currently background) story that you can discover as you explore.\n\nI really recommend buying this game, enjoying it and then keeping your eye on it - the developer has big goals and if you buy this now you'll not only be in for a treat but be investing in an even greater one on the horizon.","March 4, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What Rodina lacks in visual polish and superficial content, it more than makes up for with a flawlessly seamless harmony between interstellar, planetary, and ship-based gameplay. Ever wanted the ability to fight hull fires in your custom made ship as it plummeted rapidly through the atmosphere of an undiscovered planet? That I know of, Rodina is the only space simulator currently with that capacity.\n\nGood - You'll get a space flight sim experienced that you've only been able to fantasize. This is what Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous hope to be some day.\n\nBad - The game is still in tentative development, and as such, lacks many secondary and tertiary features that ought to populate a gamespace as open and as unhindering as Rodina's. Rest assured, however, that the developer is working on truly solid foundations, and given time, Rodina will be soaked with features.","August 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

There isn't much to do other than scavenge and fight enemies, but that part is well made.  Personally I enjoyed the space combat, and the holosticks you find around the solar system are very interesting.  Also I would like to add that the physics in this game are very realsitic, and the visuals are stunning, watching the sun rise on the side of a planetis beautiful, especially morena.  While there are no quests, the developer (yes there is only one) has big plans, and is active in the community.  He responds to a lot of the comments people have, and has already begun implementing some npcs in the game.  The game is very fun to load up every few days and fly around a alien solar.  It also has full controller support, and isn't broken in any way.  Some people have expierienced bugs, but I haven't.

I just finished the storyline as far as it goes at the moment, and I'm just sitting here in awe. Forget any other purchases you were going to make, buy this game right now. You will not regret it.\n\n\nFor a more in-depth review:\n\nRodina is a retro-style space sim done in an open-world style, meaning that you can fly about an entire actual size solar system with no loading screens. It's a bit thin on features at the moment, but it's still Early Access, and in my experience has been incredibly stable for an Early Access title.\n\nGraphics/SFX: 8/10\nGraphics are kind of retro-styled, but still look quite good, with terrain textures being fairly detailed, ship interiors looking AWESOME, and sound effects being perfect for this type of game. However, the exterior of your ship is somewhat bland (the ship design can apparently be edited in 3D modeling programs, so if you would like, I believe this can be changed), and planet terrain mostly consists of cliffs, hills, and mountains, with no vegetation or anything to make them feel more "real". This is perfectly acceptable in an Early Access game imo, but it's worth noting.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nGET THE SOUNDTRACK, TOO. I'm serious. The Rodina OST is one of the most beautiful pieces of work I've ever heard, perfectly meshing with the gameplay. Flying between asteroids? The music is nice and peaceful, capturing the awe of just staring at the beauty of the universe. Moving into combat? The music shifts to adrenaline-inducing battle music. It's a masterpiece equaled in only a handful of other games I've played. My top three game soundtracks are (in no particular order): FTL, Risk of Rain, and Rodina.\n\nGameplay/Story: 9/10\nWords cannot describe it, because it's so freaking AWESOME. The only reason that it misses out on a perfect score is the fact that it's currently unfinished. The combination of listening to the awesome soundtrack while reading the incredibly emotional dialogue in the encrypted communications...beautiful.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nA beautiful work by a very talented developer, missing out on a perfect score only due to the unfinished nature of the game. This is the only game I've ever bought at list price, and I have zero regrets. The developer seems committed to further progress on the game, and I'm confident in wholeheartedly recommending this game.

I won't say it is the best space game full stop, but it is the best at the exploration part. If you are the type of person who likes to float gently through thousands (literally) of asteroids or the type of person who likes exiting space battles and planet entries, or the type of person who likes wandering sheets of (randomly generated) ice or rock for eternity, this is the game for you. All the planets are to scale, meaning it would literally take you a year to go around one on foot, if not far more time. It has a compelling plot, countless amounts of writing pieces (I couldn't read though them all if I had a year). Rodina has an amazing dynamic sound track that changes with your enviroment. Not to mention the very receptive dev of the game (raptormeat) who listens to any and all suggestions and implements them at a reasonable pace.  I fell in love wih this game the moment I played it, and I don't even particularly like space games. Certainly worth buying, weather you like space games or not, you will find something to like in this game.","September 14, 2015","true","23.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From what i saw it looked like it could be fun once it was finished that was that was august. so i was bored thought i would give it a quick 10 minutes before going to sleep. well 2 hours later i realised it was 5am. there is not much in terms of content but i spent two hours just flying about enjoying terrain the planets and asteroid as well as landing and just going for a walk. walking around my ship looking at the different rooms. planet entry was very entertaining as i nearly ended up being a ball of flames one to many times. This very early alpha game is already one of the most enjoyable space sims out there and there is almost nothing in it in terms of features. It's just awesome to go where ever you like.\nThis was my 2 hours:\ni found what was to be my space ship on a desert planet, maybe a asteroid i wasn't quite sure. i entered the airlock wandered round my newly discovered ship. Apon wandering round ,i finally discovered the bridge and the pilots seat jumped in took off. i never looked back. i blew up an attacking enemy ship by a asteroid, discovered a planet. i landed on the planet after nearly turned into a ball of flames apon atmosphere entry, went for a walk discovered someones carelessly hidden missles stole them, went and shot those missles at some more enemy ships, laughing like a crazy person as they blew up into a ball of flames and then discovered a purple planet :-)","October 4, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Flying to planets, entering, fighting, it's all pretty cool, but my biggest complaint is there is jack ♥♥♥♥ to do otherwise. Combat is pretty simple and repetetive, the planets are identical except for what ship parts you need to go there, and once you find a beacon all it does is throw irrelevant dialogue in your face with no purpose. The plot is so thin it's almost non-existent. The game is very bad at telling you what happened and where to go, which is fine in games like Dark Souls where there is actual stuff to explore, but there isn't anything to find in Rodina except for more dialogue, maybe 1% of it is actually useful and the rest being essentially newspaper clippings from cooking magazines or something.\n\nGreat potential but for right now there is nothing to do.

There were soooo many enemies, but quickly I learnt that I don't have to clear the whole planet just to land there, and kept on scavanging.\n\nOh, I didn't mention the story yet, did I?

It had everthing I could think to put in it (a really cool looking and over-designed bridge), so I decided it was time to go fight some alien with it. I put at least one fire extinguisher in every room, so I thought I could handle a fire okay. Nope! My ship caught fire and by the time I finished fighting the aliens I had to resort to ejecting all of my oxygen to starve the fire. Well I got sucked out into space, which is one of the scariest things that could happen to any astronaut. I waited just outside the airlock until all the air was gone and I could enter safely. I closed the airlock and all was well.

One is that the game is desolate as all hell. There's almost nothing to explore except for astroids, which have no variety, and planets. The planets have very small mountains and some stuff to pick up which is a billion miles apart from each other. Very boring game. There are things to fight though that gets old after the first couple of games. If you think that this game will satisfy for No Man's Sky, it won't.

Obviously the game has very little to offer in terms of content at this point - the whole fun being in taking off and entering a planet's atmosphere to grab resources. You will mostly fight if you engage enemies yourself, but at this point enemies aren't influential or dependant on the game's content.\n\nHere are some suggestions to the developer to *improve this demo specifically* (I'm sure you have a lot of ideas for the final game, but you should get this jewel to a point where hype builds up faster) - He has done a great job so far with this, but I juust want to provide my humble ideas to help market this game faster, because I know it can become great.  If you just improve this demo 20% more,  people will experience more out of the game and they'll share the joy more (as well as download it more).\n\n\na) Radio signals / story: WAY too much to read. While I'm sure the story can be insteresting, you should provide smaller (yet more frequent) pieces of information - especially for the purpose of this demo, so the playing can last longer. I would also suggest dropping the colors in text and removing the "computer OS' entries, I felt it kept me away from wanting to read. The first text I actually read was towards the end (the wife and husband part).\n\nb) I would suggest equipping the ship with a resource scanner (beeps faster as you move closer), then letting the player find the packages him/herself instead of the crossmarks.\n\nc) Picking up encrypted pieces of data: Add more. Maybe let the player "piece together" encrypted data on one same planet to construct the final message?\n\nd) Empty crates: Kinda useless, remove - replace with encrypted data (see above)\n\ne) Enemies: Destroyed enemies should jettison cargo, missiles or other elements that the player ship can "scoop" manually by exiting the ship while in space. Makes for some stressful action :)\n\nf) Enemies: Maybe some enemies should hunt down the player entering a planet's atmosphere to make for more space combat. Right now they're kinda pointless.\n\ng) Music: Nice job overall - maybe music on Veles is a bit aggressive while nothing is going on.\n\n\nI have a lot more ideas, but I guess that's it for now. Please support this game so it gets better before No Man's Sky comes out ;)\n\n\n\n\n","March 22, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is pleasant and the writing is well done (the interview with Malcolm McCreedy is my personal favorite).  The single quest line will likely take you a couple of hours to complete, unless you rush through it.  The interior of your space craft is fully customizable within the game.  The exterior of the ship may be 'modded' with third-party tools, and a number of modded ships are available from fan sites.\n\nCombat is unrewarding, beyond a personal satisfaction.  There are no 'experience points' to earn, and destroyed enemies drop no loot.  Combat is practically optional, as groups of enemies are easy to navigate around.  This allows you to decide if your gaming experience will be "guns blazing" or exploration.\n\nThe game is a work in progress, and the developer is very active in the game's community.  Based on his forum posts and his own description of the game, the developer clearly has big plans for Rodina.  In its current state, you may expect to "run out of things to do" after a day or two of game play.  Once you have completed the quest line and discovered all of the data modules, all that's left is combat and sight seeing.\n\nI recommend this game because I sincerely enjoy playing it.  I find myself smiling as I travel from planet to planet, and I found the short stories entertaining and diverse.

This is the best indie game I. have. ever. played. I'm in love with this game and it's incredible lore. The gameplay is just so much fun and the ability to mod the game makes it even better. Rodina is very cleverly made with a lot of love and soul put into it. The developer actively listens to it's community. There's not much I can say about the story except for: "Good lord, this is so good"... I want a whole book dedicated to this game. Seriously. The writing is spectacular and it keeps me immersed in the game. Normaly I wait for the game to be released after ealry access, but if you're reading this, PLEASE buy this game. I'm not begging, i'm just telling you that It's totally worth the money, and your time. I want this game to become as popular as it actually deserves to be because the team is not on a very big budget and I can see some great, big and amazing things to come in the future.\n\nFor some this game may seem that it lacks features, but I think it's a masterpiece in the making.\n\nThank you Elliptic Gaming for this charming bowl of awesomeness you've brought to the table of gaming. I will be following this game from now on until it's end. THATS how good Rodina is.\n\n10/10\n\n\nPS: Hey you! Yes you, the developer! I'm Russian.

Totally negating any difficulty.\n\nPROS:\n>Beta game with exiting potential\n>Fully customizable ship interior\n>Progressivly rendered universe resulting in no loading screens\n>Well programmed physics\n>Immersive and vast\n\nCONS:\n(Please note that this game is still in early beta, and the cons listed are VERY likely to be fixed)\n>Lack of much story (Though you can go to planets and collect data logs (journals), hinting the game will because story rich in the future.\n>Only one player-controllable ship at this time\n>Cannot enter enemy ships (I`m pretty sure there are plans to fix this though).\n>No friendly NPCs, making the game feel lonely.\n\nTHINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE:\n>Different types of player controllable ships\n>Space stations and planitary space ports (can be used for repair, trade and autopilot navigation)\n>More story, and of course, NPCs\n>Upgradeable ships\n>More options for customization, ie more things to put inside the ship (Space Engineers is an excellent reference)\n\nThere is more, but I`m sure most of it will happen eventually anyways. This game is Absolutely worth every penny.\n\n10/10\n","June 18, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right now in it's alpha state i would have to say that the 17 dollars i spent on it was worth every penny because of the amount of content that is already in it. The main feature of this game is that the scale of all the planets and astroids are insane because they are practically the size of real life astroids and planets and you can walk on the planets and astroids unlike elite dingus.\n\nThis game has huge potential and it would be a good idea to support an awsome, original concept like this. If you are still unsure you should try the demo because the demo is the main game without saves. That basically means you have no content restrictions in the demo but you still cannot save so it is worth it to buy the full game. The official website offers a pay-what-you-want sytem where you pay what you want for the initial game but each new update requires you to chip in a bit more money. This is also nice because it means that if you are short on money you can still play the game the way it was meant to be instead of maybe having to pirate it because you dont have 17 bucks.\n\nTL:DR Gud game","July 17, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you aren't interested in actively following the evolution of Rodina, then you probably shouldn't buy this.. yet.\n\nWhat exists gameplay wise is a bit repetative. Go from place to place and pick up stuff. I feel as though I exausted the gameplay with my time spent as of this writing. (4.7hr) Story wise there is a lot I have not read, but what I did read was of real good quality and had charm.\n\nThe seamlessness combined with the vastness of the game area is pretty darn cool and has a lot of potential, as quite a few others have said. However, I don't feel like there is much of a reason to explore in this game, which is a big shame. It shouldn't be that hard or time consuming for the developer to throw in some easter eggs or collectibles here and there. (Cosmetic stuff to put in your ship?) Maybe some damage upgrades or something, or at the very least, add some variety for what is already there.\nHaving everything of interest "marked" for you really defeats the exploration aspect, although due to the vastness of the game space I see why this was chosen. I feel there should be a better solution somehow.\n\nThe biggest feature I'd like to see is Multiplayer support, that and/or the ability to build bases on asteroids or planets.\n\nAlso... the sun wont let you warp to escape if you get too close.. The game saves once you start taking damage from radiation... TENOTTADEN","July 17, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can you make it so we have a little something to fend off the pesky aliens at the start of the game? That would be nice.

I can see having hours and hours of fun with this game because I absolutely adore space exploration. It's just that my computer is having problems and it's not like it used to be. It has had a recent performance drop and it was mediocre in the first place. I would have to ignore the games beauty and make the settings the lowest possible to even get a few more frames than normal. This game has a wonderful team, design, and potential but I can't run it without turning everything down to the lowest possible and I still get around 20 fps. Perhaps when I get a beefier PC then I can run it, but I can't see myself having much fun with this game until then. But if anyone wants to buy this then go ahead. I love the art style, the music is gorgeous, and I love the expansiveness to bits. This, if you like exploring a detailed, peaceful, absolutely heavenly landscape.

I've played Elite: Dangerous and spent the first hour going in and out of the options screen.  I spent the first hour of Rodina exploring asteroids and planets and engaging Xenos in combat.\n\nThat's the best part here -- no lengthy tutorials, no flight schools, just jump into your ship and go.\n\nThe physics model is good, the stellar system is huge, and so far, it's a lot of fun to explore.  I can't wait to see what the developers will add, and add they must, because there's not much to do right now.\n\nI would like to see less inertia in the physics model.  I like flying sideways and backwards, especially in combat, and I've noticed that downshifting from cruise mode to combat mode slows the ship down.  I would love it if the developers would implement zero gravity onboard the ship, but I don't expect that to happen.  Of all of science fiction, artificial gravity seems to be extremely commonplace, yet it is probably the most fictional element present.\n\nFinally, what I'd really like to see is facilities that spawn NPCs, good and bad, and the ability for NPCs to expand operations by building more facilities.  If you want to wipe out the NPCs, you've got to wipe out the facilities that spawn them.  I recall playing Freelancer and Privateer and wondering how busy the shipyards must be as I cut my bloody path through space.\n\nThe bottom line, it's a great game, easy to play and lots of fun.

Sure its not as graphically advanced as say X3 but the gameplay is where this game shines. It not only gave you a ship but the ability to walk around inside it before blasting off on your adventures.

Keep a small side scenario where I can play the lone wanderer in a vast space with no choice but to do the seemingly impossible.\n\nThank you for a great experience.

If I had to describe it, I'd say that this game is - poor mans "Elite: dangerous" (not in a bad way).\n\nWhat I like:\n-Customize your ship(make it big and run around putting out fire)\n-Small package(I think at this moment the game is about 460 mb)\n-Huge open world(Or should I say solar system?)\n-Adwanced enemies(at least the dont run into you)\n-A lot of gameplay(doesnt seem that way to be honest)\n\nThings I do not like:\n-Your ship looks like literal Sh**(not kidding, its a big, brown blob)\n\nThings I would like to see:\n-PreMade ships\n-Multiplayer(might be fun) or at least co-op\n-Space stations(where you can buy new stuff, like guns)\n-Enemies on the surface of planets(to make planet explouration more interesting)\n\nTo summ up, I think its a grate game, would recomend for all ages.\n9,8/10","January 30","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you start building your ship's interior you start to come up with new ideas for rooms, like once I made a prison cell using the engine room tileset and a hospital using the bathroom tileset.

There are lots of planets and other celestial bodies to explore for these artifacts and a couple of interesting storylines buried in there to back it all up. I have only logged a few hours into this game and can already tell this game is easily worth the price. Devs seem to be devoted to making this game better and as of this writing have added an altimeter to make entry through thick atmospheres more easy to track.

Thanks to a rich score, beautiful  starry sky, and simple machanics, you can loose yourself in this game. The premise is that you are the only human from the   large inter-galactic mothership called "Rodina" (hence the name) in the system and it is your mission to rid the the area of Xeno's (Alien creatures). Now, you can complete the main mission as your sole objective, but the game is all about exploring and flight. The game is still fairly new, and the developer (Yes one developer) is slowly updating and adding new features to make it better. But what it lacks in content, it makes up for in detail and scale (Each planet and asteroid in game is full size). I recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing adventure and who loves to explore.\n\nPROS: Music\nLooks\nFULLY customizable ship interior\nReal scale solar system(Planets, asteroids, ect.)\nThe abillity to get sucked out into space\nWall-E fire extinguisher that lets you move through space\nNo loading screens\n\nCONS: the guy (or gal) runs too damn fast, so sometimes you fall off your boarding ramp(SHIFT: fixes this =P)\n\n","May 17","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I have a few gripes about it, the low price tag and the consisten communication from the devs are huge selling points\n\nFirst off, let's list some pros:\nEnormous open world\nFantastic score\nShip combat is a challenge at first but is fun once you get the hang of it\nUnique weapons for the ship\nAtmosphere entering system is also pretty fun\nArt style fits the game theme\nFlying the ship (especially in first person) is pretty great\nNo loading screens\n\nand some cons:\nWorld seems empty, I didn't get the impression of a living world\nStory is short and repetitive (fetch quests)\nNot much to do after the story is complete\n\nOverall, I like this game. The devs seem to be pushing out updates every so often, and are fairl active compared to the devs of some other indie titles (Starforge, I'm looking at you) so I'm excited to see where the devs go from here. If you can meet the $15 pricetag, this game is worth your time and money. And if you're looking for something to sate you until No Man's Sky, this is your best bet (although they will end up being totally different games in the future).","May 15","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
