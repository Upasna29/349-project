It works!\nProblem: Nurse being chased by an angry heart?\nSolution: Spawn a gun and kill it!\nProblem: Want to contact a manager at the other side of a wall?\nSolution: Spawn a grenade launcher!\nProblem: Frozen people encased in ice?\nSolution: Spawn a flamethrower! Bonus: Watch their life points diminish as you melt/burn away!\nThe thing that bugged me the most and made me sad is the cruelty towards animals.

Then some evil quest-giving person wanted me to kill them for a pest-control inspection, the nerve! And for a starlite fragment I had to kill my newly made bug friends?!

If you can think of any food, animal, household item, weapon, mythological creature, or vehicle, chances are you can make it appear. We're talking tens of thousands of possibilities. A few surprises can also be summoned, such as a variety of internet memes and special objects, if you can think of them.\n\nYou can summon objects, or add adjectives to existing objects, to solve puzzles and make all the townspeople happy. Or, you could just screw around for hours summoning gods and beasts and riding them across the world as your epic mounts, or watching them run loose and terrorize the villagers.\n\nThe puzzles are all ridiculously easy, but difficulty is obviously not the point. Personally, my favorite way to play this game is to think of the most obnoxiously ridiculous solutions to every puzzle. Most puzzles will have a bluntly obvious solution, but you can make hilarity ensue if you can think of something creative. For instance, a guy wanted something to help carve his ice sculpture. I gave him a toenail clipper. Hansel and Gretel needed something to make a trail with through the forest. I gave them thumbtacks. A buzzard wanted something to eat. I gave it a dead baby. A tracking dog needed something that smelled like Santa so he could search for Santa. I summoned Santa.\n\nIt's an excellent game packed with great humor and content, and it's miles ahead of the Nintendo DS games it was based on. My only complaint is that it got a bit boring after the first few hours, but I fixed that just by taking some breaks and not playing it all on one sitting. But I never once stopped appreciating how wonderful the game is. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to rediscover their inner child, complete with borderline politically incorrect humor, in a way that very few games can provide.\n\n(Achievement hunters: getting 100% is very tedious, as you will need to solve over a hundred riddles to acquire the remaining bonus pieces. Usually you will solve some of them on accident throughout normal gameplay if you try to use creative solutions. However, if you ever get bored, you can just look at a FAQ to fully complete the game effortlessly.)","April 3, 2015","true","13.6"," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","83","88","11","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rabbidking/recommended/218680/","Rabbidking","Rabbidking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rabbidking/","1933 products in account",""Write anything, solve everything." This has been the mantra for Scribblenauts since its creation in 2009, and each new installment comes closer and closer to realising this goal. Scribblenauts Unlimited on Steam has taken the "write anything" part to heart, but falters a bit of the "solve everything" side of the equation.\n\nThe Steam Workshop support for this game is quite huge. If you can think of an object that the game doesn't recognise (mostly copyrighted content), then it's possible that someone has either created it for you, or some toying around with the game's impressive object editor will make your dreams a reality. Even better, you can upload your creations for all Steam users to enjoy.\n\nAs awesome as this is, the gameplay is a tad disappointing. At least, we finally have an explanation for Maxwell's endless search for Starites (the game's MacGuffin). The story acts as a prequel to the series, as Maxwell struggles to retrieve the errant Starites to rescue his sister, Lilly (one of literally dozens of his relatives, all of whom are playable characters), from being turned into stone. This story is quickly forgotten once you start summoning vuvuzuela-playing pink jaguars to fight a winged preposterous black knight riding atop a cowardly telekinetic cybernetic T-rex, with only the occasional interlude reminding you of your main objective.\n\nTo retrieve the Starites, Maxwell must help people around the game's expansive world with various problems, from helping an up-and-coming rock band gain a fanbase, to helping patients in a hospital with their various ailments. While its nice to have a large amount of different areas to explore, many of which feel alive with various characters mulling about, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just playing nicer-looking versions of the DS games' title screens. Worse yet, many of the main challenges don't encourage your imagination as often as you think they would.\n\nDespite these problems, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the series before. The visuals are crisp, the sheer amount of objects that can be generated is mind boggling (not counting the extensive Workshop creations), and it's still fun to see how each object and adjective interacts with each object in the world.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n\n+ Graphics look amazing, even on low-powered laptops\n+ Amazing object editor\n+ "Write anything": only limited to your imagination\n+ Always fun to see object/adjective interactions\n+ Nice origin story for Maxwell...\n\nCons:\n\n- ...but is quickly forgotten while goofing off\n- Worlds feel like glorified title screens from the DS games\n- Many challenges limit/stifle creativity","January 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","67","72","0","2"

It is like mad libs come to life. You wander around what is basically a 2D open world mad libbing people's issues. Issues like I need something to scare away crows.... well just spawn a zombie or a scarecrow, or an angry hunter, or a gun to do it yourself! There's a lot of unintentional yet intentional fun here. Spawning a zombie to solve one puzzle might chase away other NPCs. Unless you add the adjective, friendly zombie. Its really the interactivity with the world that makes the game such silly fun. Did your zombie make a fire? Well have a firefighter put out that fire. Its a silly fun game that I can imagine would be great for kids. Simple controls that really thrive with a keyboard when you're typing things like 'pretty pink princess.'  There are good area settings too, everywhere from standard city areas like hospitals and a fire station, to more creative areas like Jurassic Park, a haunted house and a castle. Overall, the game is pretty easy. Easy enough that anyone can see it through to the end.","November 13, 2013","true","4.7"," 85 of 101 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","85","101","0","0"

This is a wonderful game, for children and adults alike. For children, however, there is the added benefit of improving spelling and vocabulary as the child plays through the game. I know this, because my own child's vocabulary and spelling improved during the 140+ hours it took her to complete the game. It is relatively non-violent, that encourages the player to solve problems in creative and imaginative ways. There are often more ways than one to complete a challenge. Message to the developer: please make more follow-ups to this game! I'm aware of Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that game has much more fighting content in it than this one, so less violent solutions are not as viable. If the original dev won't make any more, I encourage anyone with the proper skill set to make more games like this; it's a winning formula that should not be abandoned.","April 30","true","145.8"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","38","38","0","1"

It's fun and I laugh a lot while I play it. Do you really need anything else from anything?\n\nIt's not a difficult game by any stretch as a simple story game of collecting stars to help save somethign from something with a lot of cool/cute art and object making. It lets you use your imagination to create an enormous amount of objects to just drop into the world and play with. Want a monkey? How about a GIANT monkey? You can make one and then ride it. Hilarious notebook? Sure. It will make every NPC that it passes by laugh. Create a Living Garden Gnome riding on a Tiny Goat. You can even create NPCs that will fight with one another, or even jsut play nice. Using adjectives in front of objects makes them even more interesting than they already are.\n\nYou can save objects you create in your backpack for easy access, you can get objects created by other Steam users in the Workshop with simple in-game menus and a couple clicks. Tons of user created stuff is amazing and hilarious so make sure to spend a good amount of time in the Steam Workshop for this game.\n\nThis is a Family Friendly game that anyone with a soul should play and enjoy. If you are a ginger, well we know you have no soul, but even YOU would probably be able to find some joy here.\n\nIt's an easy 100% Achievements game and they just take the time of finishing all the stars mostly and making objects they tell you to. Trading cards as well of course.\n\nFun and hilarious casual game for all ages!\n\nNOTE: If you look at the credits and use the Developer's names to create in-game characters they will all appear in the game with some sort of special attribute. One dev NPC has the ability to turn every hat you put on them to spawn wings that you can take and fly with for example. There are a ton of these and it is fun to mess around with. You can view the credits at any time so write down some developer names and experiment in the game. :)","September 30, 2014","true","6.8"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","42","50","5","4"

Scribblenauts unlimited attempts to build on this formula by addding the feature of editing items already in the game world through adding modifiers. Unlimited also adds the ability to store items in your backpack for later use. All nice features, but altogether clunky as the game loses its charm without the use of a stylus. Having to mouse entirely across the screen to spawn in an item seems like a hassle when the first time around it took hardly any effort to access the notebook. It's still good ol' Scribblenauts, and while I'd take the old level select systems over this "open world" approach, Sribblenauts Unlimited is fun play and a creative pastime. 8/10","November 5, 2014","true","0.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

Focusing on completing the game tasks can become boring, and a fair amount of objectives feel like padding. Completionists will be annoyed by the amount of chores needed to 100% the game.\n\nThis may sound like the game is bad, and that could be argued. Approached as a series of tasks to save Lily, the game can feel a bit slow. However, sometimes you need to forget the quests and just mess around. Arm shotguns with shotguns, then hand them to a musical afro. Build a tower of dirty jesters, riding a hated jester on the bottom. Give a dog-fearing man a dog whistle and watch him panic. Play around, and you can really see the pure fun of this game. I've spent at least an hour catching my breath after hilarious events, most of which I didn't expect or plan. That alone is worth the time and money, in this era of pretentious art games and multiplayer communities that make you hate humanity.\n\nDo you want to laugh, preferably without vulgarity? Can you come up with some silly ideas to see what happens? I'd recommend Scribblenauts Unlimited.  I don't have much idea about the Unmasked version, doesn't seem to change much beyond the missions, and I figure the Unlimited Workshop community is stronger.

What's more, an alarming number of the problems can literally be solved just by typing the word "gone", which takes another level of fun out of it.\n\nEverything else about this game is great, and I think it'd be fantastic for teaching kids about spelling and problem solving, but how unbelievably easy it is just ruins it completely for me.

You control a boy who can turn anything to life by writing it on his notebook. Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with "Destroyer", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a "Flamethrower Soldier", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type "Sleepy" or "Sleeping" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game.

My seven-year-old neighbor begs me to let him play some Scribblenauts all of the time, and I definitely love this game as much as him. It takes the already entertaining concept of the original mobile game and takes it way farther, with a sizable campaign which took awhile to beat, and was fun all the way through. Just like the original, the puzzles involve solving problems by creating helpful items, and it doesn't get old!\n\nI was skeptical about this game at first, since I got it for $4.99 in the recent Warner Bros.

For those who play it, everything seems like a simple logic problem that must be solved with a bunch of creativity. The fact the game has a simple and at the same time full of imaginative possibilities mechanic, which matches with the clean artwork and graphics, drives the player to this very wished psychological place of not worrying or not having to follow any kinds of protocols, by fullfiling complex and hard-to-understand objectives; but yet being driven and carried on by such direct and fundamental moral themes: making other people a little happier with the powers we have and struggling to undo an "evil" caused by our own acts. With the nowadays tendence of creating very human like heroes and villains, with a spectrum of mixed moral values and affections, Scribblenauts makes us all remeber a little what is like to have possibilities of believing and making things look and feel better without the need of titanic actions and moves. I have a 10 here, but that's likely because I really like to hang around with the kiddo side of myself!","January 18","true","6.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Now, instead of using this book to give yourself a flying rainbow llama, you use it to help people in need. This is Scribblenauts Unlimited, the third game in the Scribblenauts series.\n\nYou play as Maxwell, a young boy who has been given the gift of a magic notebook from his parents. Maxwell then uses the notebook to give a rotten apple to a hungry man, and angers him. The man puts a curse on Lily, his sister, who now slowly turns to stone. To stop this, Maxwell has to make up for his trickery by collecting Starites from people, to free his sister from the curse.\n\nThe gameplay in Scribblenauts Unlimited is basic, but it is obtained and used well. I was never confused by the controls or wandered around pressing buttons. The notebook feature is easy to use, and writing something with multiple meanings (say, 'bat') will bring up a menu to select which type of object you would like. There is also a backpack feature that allows you to save your favourite creations for easier access later, but I rarely used this feature as I created new and different things all of the time.\n\nWhile Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple, its charming art style is colourful, playful and different to a lot of other games that I am used to. Playing the first two games on the Nintendo DS, Scribblenauts Unlimited combines the series-defining mechanics of the first game with the creativity and art style of Super Scribblenauts, building a game that is definitely one of the best puzzle games available on PC. While this game is definitely directed towards a younger audience, I couldn't help but pick up the third instalment of this amazing franchise.\n\nThere are no borders in Scribblenauts Unlimited. Unlike the first two games, Scribblenauts Unlimited is set it over 20 different locations, which when unlocked are accessible all the time, creating an open world to explore and invent wonderful contraptions and experiments. Never in any other game have I seen so much creative freedom.\n\nTo conclude, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a flawless addition to the series, and definitely a game that will consume a fair amount of play time.\n\n9.8/10","October 7, 2014","true","16.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","3"

As Maxwell, save your sister Lily from a curse by creating happiness around the world with the use of your magical notepad that can create anything you can write.\n\nPros: The game has an astonishing amount of potential content. Almost any word and adjective you can think of, you can create by typing it. There is a lot of different method to resolve any situation, and the fun comes in finding new and unexpected ways to do so. You will find yourself attempting different solutions again and again even after you already succeeded just to see if you can find an easter egg or game secret. Usable created objects also add game elements to work with, and combining people or objects with one or more adjectives increases the possibilities tenfold.\n\nCons: The game is short, you can breeze through it, getting the Starites you need to win the game within a few hours. Many of the puzzles are easy, half of which can usually be resolved with the same few objects. There are multiple passageways to move around a level, but they are often useless as it won't take time for you to always make sure you have a jet-pack or pair of wings to move around. Unless you want to explore the possibilities, you won't find much replayability as resolving a puzzle in different ways still ends up with the exact same result.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nIf you're looking for an exciting story, grand adventure or mind-bending puzzles, turn away. But if you're looking for an entertaining time trying to push the limit of the game, and exploring just how far you can go, it's a great one. The Steam Workshop makes it easier than ever to add dozens, if not hundreds of new objects and options, assuming you don't use the object creator to add your own. Furthermore, the game is great for all ages, maybe even more so for younger gamers. Of course, if you didn't like previous Scribblenauts games, you're unlikely to enjoy this one. But if you did, Scribblenauts Unlimited will go where previous ones never went before!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","March 7, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game company has made a few games that can really inspire creativity, such as Drawn To Life and Scribblenauts, though of course inspire creativity  in different ways.\n\nScribblenauts is a game that encourages you to come up with ways to solve moderatly easy puzzles, where there is no one solution. Because there is no one solution, it has high replay value, with you figuring out what else works, and different ways to do the same thing. At first you might start out summoning a sponge to clean a wall, later you will be using aardvarks for everything.\n\nThis game has changed a lot since it's start on the Nintendo DS, and you can even MAKE new things with parts of things from the game, and even script their behaviour! Or if you are no good at making things, you can download some from the Steam Workshop!\n\nThere are very few flaws in this game, as no game is perfect. One flaw I find is not really a flaw, but can be seen as one, you have way too much freedom in this game. Limits really work well in certain games, and with games with too much freedom you can get bored, or you see no challenge. If you get bored, there are heaps of achievements to get and there are little challenges in-game for you to solve. But if you have done everything, you can always clear the game data and start anew, and maybe even have a challenge of your own, like, for example, only using aardvarks, which is something I find myself doing a lot.\n\nThis game doesn't just stop at the limitless freedom, it also has a very heartwarming story, that premotes kindness. Which is a very nice touch on top of the rest of the game. These types of games are very hard to come across, they are very different from most games, and because they are different and very special, they are games that you must have, even if you are a gamer who plays zombie games, or plays a lot of indie games (a lot of the time they overlap) you must have this, as it is not just another generic game, it is Scribblenauts Unlimited.","January 14","true","71.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/recommended/218680/","coaldust-numbers","Coaldust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/","235 products in account","This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I often play it whenever I need cheering up.\n\nIt has lackluster reviews, and I've noticed almost everyone that rates it mediocre or bad plays it differently than I do.  You could consider this both a review and a guide to having fun with the game.  Don't worry, there won't be spoilers.\n\nIf you're out of elementary school, and play the game in the most straightforward way, it will be too easy.  It amounts to a graphical adventure where you can access almost every item in the game by typing the name, letting you bypass anything resembling a puzzle.  While this might be viewed as a problem by teenagers and adults playing the game, it's actually a good thing for children, who can use it as a fun way to exercise their vocabulary skills.\n\nTeenagers and adults playing the game should use their creativity.  The game is usually surprisingly flexible in how you can achieve a goal.  The only restrictions it normally has are: you can't use real people's names, or anything involving drugs, prejudice, or sex, and you often can't kill anybody.\n\nSuggestions to get you started:\nBe indirect.  Creating things people ask for and sticking adjectives on the problem is boring.  Create other beings and complex Rube Goldberg contraptions made of multiple objects to solve problems.  Watch the chaos as unexpected interactions ensue!  When your solutions cause more problems, add more elements to try to fix those, rather than changing or removing anything.\nBe lazy.  See how little you can create while still solving a problem indirectly.  This usually involves heavy use of side effects.  You may be able to solve multiple problems on the same level with one action.\nBe impractical.  Pick a role and stubbornly stick to it.  The best roles are those least suited to a hero (e.g. cook, janitor, tailor…).  Dress the part and give yourself appropriate adjectives.  Try to solve all problems using only things that are in theme.  MacGyver would be proud.\nDo no harm.  When dealing with a problematic creature or object, try to create and use some other creatures or objects that harmlessly neutralize it, rather than fighting or destroying it.\nProvide unhelpful help.  Be an evil genie.  Do what someone asked you to do, but make sure it has side effects they won't like, or doesn't achieve their goal.\nConsider what would happen if…  For example, what would happen if a prince, turned into a frog, was given a werewolf princess to kiss?\nPlayed this way it should have you laughing your head off.  You may lose the level (usually due to an accidental death), but have so much fun you won't care.\n\nThe game does have some flaws.\n\nIt doesn't recognize every correctly spelled word.  That would have been impossible to program and create art for.\n\nSome goals are too restrictive to allow creativity.  Sometimes there is only one solution.  There should be at least three significantly different solutions.  Better playtesting could have caught this.\n\nThere are “fetch quests”.  They involve going to some part of the map, which is usually unobstructed, picking up a item, and carrying it back to the person that asked for it.  You can't use your magical notebook to do this, and it's unhumorous, uncreative, and unchallenging.  Hopefully the authors will stop including these in the future.\n\nWhile I love what the object editor can do, I hate how it does it.  The primary pain-point is how difficult it is to “draw” a new object.  You have to do it by lumping together existing art assets.  The second worst pain-point is how difficult it is to get the behavior you want.  You can only create new behaviors by tuning settings on existing ones.  While you can argue this is “creative problem solving”, it fits poorly with the design of the rest of the game.  Making a item in game is as easy as typing the name.  Making items in the object editor should be similarly painless.

You can spawn an evil version of yourself that randomly creates things to see how advanced it is, you'll see things like "noctophilic haystack" or "serendipitous pho." They use lots of playtesters to see what solutions people would come up with so that combined with lots of items fitting into similar categories means that most puzzles have an incredible amount of solutions. Spawn a pregnant man and a midwife and you'll get a thin man and a baby man, for example. I don't know how that helps solve puzzles, but there's a lot of dynamic events that pop up. It's worth a look and you can buy it, get a feel for it and return it within 2 hours if you don't like it. That's more than enough time to see what the game is like and whether you want to keep playing, after the opening cutscene and tutorial, you're essentially thrown into the game and have all your abilities. The only downside is the Steam Workshop, which is really cool. Lots of... interesting things there but the only way I've found it to work is that you have to subscribe to things from the game itself, that's the only way it would load what you want. I would've also liked to be able to use downloaded models for the character selector but I suppose the detailed character creator is a more configurable tool. Still, it's nigh impossible to pick Jango Fett or Samus as your character unless you know what you're doing.","May 2","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/recommended/218680/","Freeze_25","Ice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/","427 products in account","Scribblenauts is great. Its even better if you play by your own rules and have an audience.\nIf you don't know the basic idea is there are people who need the help of your godlike notebook that can create anything you can imagine and write down into it. So this knight needs a weapon to fight off a giant dragon, why not give him a diamond chainsaw? This girl wants to win a race, why not make her a super hero with super speed? Want to ride around on a golden dinosaur or a flying magical cat? Well in Scribblenauts you can.\n\nIts a little easy to get tired of the game though. Its fun and all but the overall difficulty can basically be summed up in "this mouse wants cheese, click notebook write cheese, give cheese to mouse. This football team can't play football without a football.. click on notebook write football, give football to team." ..its absurd how easy the game is. Every once in a while I got totally stuck on something because its a childrens rhyme or a kids logic thing that I am obviously no longer in the loop for but that can be solved with a good audience.\n\nThe real fun though comes from messing with the game. So the mouse wants cheese right? Why not give him a cat made out of cheese then watch the hilarity of a mouse eating a live cheese cat. That poor guy needs a doctor, why not give him a zombie doctor? Make it fun and it becomes fun.. let it be boring and it can really tire you out.\n\nOverall its a great game and its easy to 100% (though you'll probably want a walkthrough for the random object challenges). I think it would be great to play with others more than alone and children maybe more than adults.. but its a great game for all ages.","January 21, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've waited for this to come out for a while and while it's actually really fun that wears off after a while. While every new are you go to is interesting and uniwue in it's own right they all follow the same rules - you have different characters with problems and you have to come up with an item or a person that will solve that. This is really fun at first but it can get repetitive after a while and getting all the starites in the game (you get starites or shards for every problem you solve) is very tedious.\n\nBottom line play it in small doses and it will stay fun...try to complete it all at once and it will get pretty boring. Also it's fun to screw the goals of the game and just do whatever - make a pink cthulhu with a rainbow colored afro fight a robot elephant with gatling guns. If you can think it you can pretty much make it in this game..and then set it on fire and launch it in space.","January 13, 2014","true","15.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's also on the Wii U/3DS but you should actually get it on steam because workshop compatibility. It's not truly unlimited, but it certainly reaches far into it's possibilities. Also has the most powerful character in every game.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is all the epick maymay references, but you may do, who am I to judge you. Also keep in mind this is an E rated game so no, you won't be able to spawn a beer or something, unless you create it on the object creator.\n\nNow, If you're looking for a real challenging puzzle, Scribblenauts will not deliver. It's puzzles may go from no brainer "give me an X" to something like a riddle, but overall not an actual puzzle game. If you want a puzzle scribblenauts, I'd suggest the original one for the DS, this one is more of a creator based scribblenaut, rather than a puzzle based one. If you want to purchase scribblenautss unlimited for the creativity factor and the adventure and other stuff that isn't puzzles, go ahead.","February 12, 2014","true","40.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can literally think of anything, and I mean anything; A rocket powered lemon riding Goat? Sure! A flying Hippo with blue toenails, HELL YEAH! Also, for the stuff you can't create can easily be downloaded as the game has Steam Workshop Support. Irresponsible Dad from Happy Wheels? Yup. Dubstep Guns from Saint's Row, YES! :D\n\nI'll admit, the storyline is a bit childish but the amount of things you can do is crazy and damn hilarious!

This is how your childhood imagination looked in your head.","March 14, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite being extremely repetitive, the satisfaction that encompasses the success in passing certain objectives is not to be ignored as some combinations are just hilarious, or even confusing. For the fans of the series, this game should satisfy the needs of them, whilst for people who are new to the series, may be a tedious and difficult experience to complete. 6/10","December 3, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I read that it was a sort of puzzle game, a genre I love, I gave it a try. First session playing it and I couldn't stop playing. There is a story but it's not obtrusive, so you get to start playing very quick, and the story although simple is not bad. I obviously haven't played a Scribblenauts before, so I don't really know what's new and what's not, but I found the game to be super creative, original and very funny. The gameplay is weird but it's very clever and fun and let's you be creative, although sometimes I couldn't create what I wanted. The music is also cool but can get repetitive. So overall, while I can't say I highly recommend this game, because I got it super cheap, it is a very fun game and if you find it at a low price then I do think you should go for it.","February 26, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It gives you some good moral lessons and helps expand your vocabulary, sometimes i had to look into a dictionary to find a really good word to solve some puzzles. Anyways let's get down to gameplay, you play a character named Maxwell and you have to help your sister from turning into stone that was casted by a mysterious stranger and in order to turn her back to normal you have to collect these stars called starrites. In order to get starrites you have to solve peoples problems the more problems you solve the more starrites you get. You write in a notebook to solve problems so anything you write in there becomes a reality, what i mean by this is that anything you write in the book rather it be person,place,or thing appears right in front of you. You can pretty much write anything in there except vulgarity,copyright material, or if you can help it not write the same words over and over again.\nAfter playing this game for 9 hours i would recommend this to anyone who is creative with words.","September 21, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice quick and short game(about 10 hours game-play at most.) and basically, you type an object, it appears. Thing that frustrates me about this game most is that some objects don't work that should, and other objects that shouldn't work, do. It's also toned more towards little kids(not surprised on that one.) it's fun to play around with the different random things you can create. Would be interesting to see an adaptation that allows you to do like a multiplayer mayhem with random objects, animals, etc, that you can spawn to fight against others or just random mini-games. As it stands, it's not.. a bad game, but the story-line is kinda weak and it's basically you go around helping people. I want to be the villain more often. This.. doesn't give you that chance, unless you spawn a bunch of random chaotic things. Which.. in turn, can be fun. hahah. But yeah, get it at $5 or below.

I think there should be more relaxed, casual games like this.\n\nI'd say the main are Scribblenauts Unlimted falls down is language. The only language option in this game is English.

It encourages many ways to go about the challenges, or just wreak havoc on your fellow man, while still promoting creativity, and even if you are not that savvy about correct spelling, you might even learn something with this. Even if you try to be witty at first, it may be a while until you find something that is not in the game's vocabulary, apart from obscenities and copyrighted materials of course.

Since some reviews are lacking structure, I will try to get some sort of scheme into mine:\n\nPros:\n\n-It is suitable for every age (although some parts are tough to get)\n-It is super neat (graphics, sounds, story and characters)\n-It is ridiculous how much stuff you can create (you can spawn a Cthulu, ride it and go ape-♥♥♥♥)\n-It is captivating since some riddles are quite challenging and you kind of want to proof to yourself that you are not    completely dumb\n\nCons:\n\n-It is somehow repetetive\n-Some riddles and their way to solve them are illogical\n-It should cost less I think (but I bought with the WB Bundle on Humble Bundle so I was okay with the price)\n\n\n","December 3, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

New to the game is the object editor, a very easy to use and creative way of making your own interactive objects.  You can change sizes, colors, and shapes, but the one thing that made me upset was that you can't DRAW your own objects.  This limits you to using only pre-made things in the game, forcing you to combine them if you want something unique.\n\nAlso new to Scribblenauts is its vast world.  From the city, to a desert, and even to space, you can take Maxwell (or one of his many brothers) on missions around the virtual globe.  Each level has challenges awaiting you that can be very simple or complex.  On the other hand, many missions have simple solutions.  For example, if a boy is unhappy, you can make a clown, video game, etc.  The possibilities are endless, but the entertainment level with some obstacles is limited.\n\nAll in all, I still like playing the game.  Even after you finish all the side-missions and campaign, you can still make your own objects and re-create your favorite characters and scenes from movies, video games, and books.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to share their ideas with others and explore Maxwell's world.","December 25, 2013","true","171.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a few hours of story in it, plus the added bonus of the sandbox mode, which is essentially integrated into the story. It's jam-packed full of recognizable references includingNyan Cat, Lord of the Rings, Super Mario, Indiana Jones and Half Life. It also has something called the Object Editor which allows you to create your own items to use in the game and even upload to the Steam Workshop.

In order to get starrites you have to solve peoples problems the more problems you solve the more starrites you get. You write in a notebook to solve problems so anything you write in there becomes a reality, what i mean by this is that anything you write in the book rather it be person,place,or thing appears right in front of you.

Although you can now edit your object and creations more than ever before, as well as get new and incredible creations from the steam commuity workshop and upload your own fairly easily, the most glaring flaw is that the game is also easier than ever before because the "challenges" are not as intricate and put together as they used to be. In fact most of the shard "challenges" are one-word-one-step solutions. So, although I fully recomend this game with its incredible library of possible creations, adjectives, and small challenges, this is also to say that it is not as great as it could be. If you can, i would fully recomend first buying SUPER scribblenauts on a different system (it's not on steam sadly) where you can experience the more developed gameplay. This said, it seems that by making the game easier and more user friendly, they are aiming at a younger audience, so if you wish, buy it for a child to enjoy, they likely won't notice the flaws or problems mentioned above. I hope you like the game as much as i do, even with these problems, i am happy i bought the game.\n\nAlso, on a side note, for those of you whom wish to try and get all those achievements on your game, this game is pretty nice. While it may take a bit of work past the end of the storyline to get all the achievements, they are all pretty straightforward and accessable, meaning you can very likely 100% the game if you put in the time. I would say it takes about 6-12 hours to do this depending on how familiar and witty you are at quickly and correctly  guessing	 creating the wanted items. You'll need 60 starites to "finish" the storyline and 107 to get all the achievements.\nEnjoy!","January 14","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astarav/recommended/218680/","astarav","Sinaea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astarav/","667 products in account","The basic gameplay of Scribblenauts is solving little puzzles by creating objects that you can then use to manipulate the world. Most of the puzzles are very straightforward, and allow the player to come up with many different solutions, but every now and then I would get stuck on something. Usually it was because the answer the game was looking for was something completely different than I was thinking, so it was unable to interpret how the objects I created were supposed to be a solution. So while the game is pretty smart considering you can input thousands of words, sometimes it just balks and has no idea what you're trying to do.\n\nThat said, it's still amazingly fun. There is a map where you can select different levels, each of which you can explore. Each zone has a funny theme, named with a funny grammar pun. The characters that you have to help are often silly and almost always endearing.\n\nSteam achievements: Half of them are completed by being a completionist and making sure you finish every detail in every level. But then the other half of the achievements... don't seem to be listed anywhere. I had to go online to figure out what "find all the object shards" entailed. It was basically a list of special word combinations, and if you spawned them together, or made the items interact with each other, then it counted toward the total score. For instance, one required you to make a marionette with the adjective "alive" to get the "Pinocchio" object shard. How in the world are you supposed to figure that out on your own? I needed a guide to figure out what I was looking for, but I didn't want to just run down a cheat sheet, so I searched for a guide that was simply a list of the object shards without the solutions. That was extremely helpful to get the achievements without feeling like a complete cheater. I looked and could not find a list like this anywhere within the game itself. If there is one in the game, it was pretty darn hidden, which is frustrating.\n\n(Also, the game says you cannot type in proper nouns. However, one of the object shards requires you to create "William Shakespeare". The last time I checked, that was a proper noun. What? Okay, whatever.)\n\nObject editor: So much fun! I didn't do much editing myself, what with my limited artistic skills. But when I found an avatar with 3D glasses, I dyed all of his clothes brown (except for the shoes, of course) and ran around the game, going, "Woooo, I'm the Doctor!"\n\nYou can also search for and download other objects that people have created. I downloaded a bunch of Doctor Who objects. I was amazed at the amount of customization people were able to put into the objects, from a piece of celery inside of the TARDIS, to a banana in 9's hand, to the combatitiveness of a dalek. I had a great amount of fun playing with these items that other people had created with the object editor.","March 3, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/recommended/218680/","mistersneak","mistersneak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/","667 products in account","This is a game I played the whole way through with my daughters. I manned the keyboard and mouse, but they solved all the puzzles. Simple childlike solutions are a valid approach to just about all the game's problems, and really the fun for an adult comes from doing things creatively in silly roundabout ways, and seeing if the game likes your style, as the challenge is just about nil.\n\nThe premise is, the game presents you with loads of challenges in a globe full of different climates etc. Generally, people have a problem that needs to be solved. You are armed with a magic notepad that will create anything you write into it, and you can also use this to add adjectives to most objects or even in-game characters. So, you write in: "Polka-dotted yellow cryptozoologist," and suddenly a spotted marigold gentleman in a jacket and hat will appear that has a keen interest in monsters. Then you can create "Bigfoot" and he will appear, and the former will walk over to investigate the latter.\n\nThe game's problems occasionally require a bit more knowledge than a six year old can muster, including awareness of mythology, pop-culture or some complex relationships. However this can turn into a really great teachable moment as you can guide the kids through deciphering the answer, or take them through the process of learning the answer by quickly opening up a browser window and doing some research. In the cuddly context of the game, the knowledge feels useful and they seem to absorb it really well, and it's usually at least referential of practical info.\n\nAdditionally, Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in the franchise that allows the player to make their own objects that they can later create with the notebook. While the amount of nouns the game recognizes is staggering, it's still quite amazing, considering there's loads of copyrighted or rated-E objects the game won't let you make, or just wacky stuff that isn't real or too specific for the game creators to have included. These objects are built on templates of objects that already exist, but they can be modified in every way visually with a simple layering / coloring system, and you can then further modify them by defining their relationships with other items, audio, etc. etc. I've used this to make stuff like Mike & Sully from Monsters Inc. (Cryptozoologists find them fascinating, by the way, check out my Workshop items if you want'em!)\n\nThe only part of the game we haven't finished is an extra portion where there are loads of various interactions the designers want you to uncover.

Maxwell's notepad features have improved since the last iterations of the game. The notepad itself spawns in almost anything. Want something that's not in the notepad? Browse on the workshop. Couldn't find it there either? Make it yourself with the object editor. Customizable avatars, too? Yes, please!  This alone makes the game a 8/10 in my book, but then it has an entire massive story mode. Full of awesomeness, brain-scrambling, and challenging at times. With games like these I'd rather mess with features like the object editor and etc., but the story mode is so welcoming that I find myself going back to it often. All in all, the game is just about perfect. 10/10, the only game that seems to go against it in my opinion is Starbound.","January 6, 2014","true","29.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/recommended/218680/","senshado","Homework Chavez - 70% finished","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senshado/","187 products in account","Scribblenauts Unlimited is a title in its own genre: to the general public there is no game quite like it (and to this day I have not found any alternatives myself either). While the gameplay should be known to most of my readers, for the sake of completion I will elaborate on the game's objectives and means to succeed in them.\n\nThe protagonist is Maxwell, a kid that gets his hands on a notebook with a magical power, being that everything written down in the notebook will magically appear. As ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and malicious little children are, he seized the opportunity to make the lives of others miserable, that is until a magician curses his sister and she is slowly consumed and converted into rock. The only way to stop this from happening is for him to make people, as well as animals and sometimes even inanimate objects, happy again. The player is presented with a sidescrolling 2D level including Maxwell, the aforementioned entities, and loads of hints that should indicate the player what to spawn for those in need. Some of these entities initiate a small storyline, while others are as simple as spawning a glass of water for someone that claims to be thirsty.\n\nThere has obviously been a lot of work put into the levels as to not make them linear, and while this succeeded, the overall premise of the game makes it that it will still appear linear to the player. After all, your mission is to spawn the things you're asked for. The sandbox aspect of the game has some potential as far as humor is concerned (have you ever worn a pants that's armed with a sword and is fighting your t-shirt?), but to some this will be entertaining for a shorter period of time than it is to others. The music and sound complements the visuals and while these aspects aren't exactly extraordinary, they are good enough.\n\nIn general I'd spend €10,- to €15,- if I was less cynical of a person. The reason I wouldn't scoop out that small amount from my budget is that I easily got bored with the sandbox aspect, but you'll have to keep in mind that I'm one of few uncommon gamers that is unable to enjoy the sandbox aspect of many other games like GTA1/4, Saints Row III and Just Cause 2, so I'm sure this will still appeal to a lot of folks out there.","November 4, 2013","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was particularly impressed by the crap loads of words that the game had to offer. You have a notebook where you type in words that turn into objects. Or you can add a adjective to the object. There are missions where you help people or you can just mess around spawning stuff.

I manned the keyboard and mouse, but they solved all the puzzles. Simple childlike solutions are a valid approach to just about all the game's problems, and really the fun for an adult comes from doing things creatively in silly roundabout ways, and seeing if the game likes your style, as the challenge is just about nil.\n\nThe premise is, the game presents you with loads of challenges in a globe full of different climates etc. Generally, people have a problem that needs to be solved. You are armed with a magic notepad that will create anything you write into it, and you can also use this to add adjectives to most objects or even in-game characters. So, you write in: "Polka-dotted yellow cryptozoologist," and suddenly a spotted marigold gentleman in a jacket and hat will appear that has a keen interest in monsters. Then you can create "Bigfoot" and he will appear, and the former will walk over to investigate the latter.\n\nThe game's problems occasionally require a bit more knowledge than a six year old can muster, including awareness of mythology, pop-culture or some complex relationships. However this can turn into a really great teachable moment as you can guide the kids through deciphering the answer, or take them through the process of learning the answer by quickly opening up a browser window and doing some research. In the cuddly context of the game, the knowledge feels useful and they seem to absorb it really well, and it's usually at least referential of practical info.\n\nAdditionally, Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in the franchise that allows the player to make their own objects that they can later create with the notebook. While the amount of nouns the game recognizes is staggering, it's still quite amazing, considering there's loads of copyrighted or rated-E objects the game won't let you make, or just wacky stuff that isn't real or too specific for the game creators to have included. These objects are built on templates of objects that already exist, but they can be modified in every way visually with a simple layering / coloring system, and you can then further modify them by defining their relationships with other items, audio, etc. etc. I've used this to make stuff like Mike & Sully from Monsters Inc. (Cryptozoologists find them fascinating, by the way, check out my Workshop items if you want'em!)\n\nThe only part of the game we haven't finished is an extra portion where there are loads of various interactions the designers want you to uncover. These are like achievements and are called things like "Liar Liar Pants on Fire," so if you create a Criminal and a Lawyer in the same location (or otherwise anybody that pop-culture deems to be known liars), the influx of localized liars will automatically create a pair of pants that happens to be ablaze. There are literally hundreds of these things, ranging from the amusing to the obscure to the complicated, but at the very least they illustrate all the fun special cases that the designers went through the trouble to make happen.

You can mess around in your environment and ... well, just by adding adjectives or nouns you can change the game.\n\nOhh, don't get too cocky though, you can get killed in this game too. And using the same words over and over again won't get you a high-score in the game. You can also create your own stuff. Well if you wish that is.\n\nIt is a game in which the player can get creative, in a most verbose way, giving live to your own ideas to solve quests and riddles. And with each starite you get closer to the ultimate goal of the game.\n\nThe game is captivating, because it has a lot of quite comedic capabilities.

Is Lily really the only sister of the family? I think little girls would like female characters to play as too. Still, you can give the guys dresses and wigs to wear, so if you really wish to express your feminine side, get creative!\n\nYou can also spawn gigantic beasts that attack people.

You can enjoy the entire world map and the main story without getting any object shards... little word-play puzzles based on how seperate objects interact. And this is what I did. I finished the whole game, unaware that I hadn't done everything I could.\n\nThen, when I noticed all those achievements I hadn't gotten, I opened the menu, looked at the "shards" and immediately became twice as entertained. That's right: I became twice as entertained once I'd _finished_ the game.\n\nA beauty queen is tired of being pretty. Make her a "lycanthropic beauty queen" and spawn a full moon, and you get a shard. That's what an object shard is. And it's amazing.\n\nI'm plowing through all those now, but suffice to say, this game is creative and fun and it makes me happy. Avoid the temptation to look any of the answers up; The puzzles are fairly simple and you'll get it on one or two tries, and there's nothing more gratifying than figuring out a solution like lycanthropic beauty queen.\n\nBuy.","August 13, 2013","true","18.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You're faced with a myriad of problems throughout the game and have to solve them by conjuring items from a magic notebook. The number of items you can conjure is impressive. Everything from the Kraken, to God, to microbes and dark matter can be summoned to solve challenges. You can spend ages figuring out the most ingenious way to solve a puzzle, and seeing your solution finally work is satisfying. Unfortunately, there's little incentive to solve puzzles this way when more obvious methods are just as effective. Some items cannot be summoned at all, even if they seem obvious (blood comes to mind). Nevertheless, Scribblenauts is a charming puzzler which can be fun for adults as well as the kids.","December 7, 2013","true","17.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While it did not have the option to customize objects or use adjectives, most levels were both fun and challenging, forcing you to push your creativity's limits in order to reach the starite. Scribblenauts Unlimited allows much more depth with creating items, but the levels/puzzles do not reach beyond simply creating a category of object when prompted. There are no action levels in Scribblenauts Unlimited and as a result none of the levels are really challenging and there is no satisfaction in completing them. The object editor also allows you to create overpowered objects as well, decreasing what little challenge there is. It is fun to fool around with the object editor, but Scribblenauts Unlimited does not offer much depth beyond customizing your own objects.","August 2, 2014","false","7.8"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","26","51","0","0"

Being on PC and having access to things like the keyboard and the Steam Workshop greatly improve the game. It is somewhat annoying to have to figure out what the game wants you to say, as its understanding of words can be limited at time. For instance, one puzzle needs you to evaluate a piece of art and typing "art expert" doesn't work, but "expert" by itself does. A mechanic can't repair a robot because a mechanic repairs cars, but a scientist can because science. Little things like that.

The puzzles are pretty easy, as they usually ask for something from a broad category to solve the tasks; there are one or two situations where the answer is ridiculously specific, but these are far and few between. Additionally, you can just sit in an area and spawn whatever you want to mess around, or you can use the game's object editor to create new objects and upload them to the Steam Workshop, or download other people's creations. If you're someone who just wants to beat a game, you can do it in an evening or two, but people who like sandboxes or games that give you the ability to just goof off and use your imagination will probably get the most out of this game.","January 7, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Of course you can help the pirate by giving him more cannonballs to shoot out of his cannon, but why not try giving him tiny pink chickens and see what happens.

The flexibility and variety of available words mean you can conjure up just about anything you can imagine.

I suspected that I would enjoy it, as I'm a fan of puzzle games and word problems. But what really caught me off guard was how charming it is. It's obviously a game for kids, however there's a very basic pleasure in seeing the choices you make come to life. Even though simple, it is fun. Kinda like solving a crossword, mixed with a mild-mannered saturday morning cartoon.\n\nThere's not a lot to say other than that. The story is very simple, and it's really just a fun word puzzle game.

Fun is not as much in finding a solution to the puzzle (as most of them will be rather obvious) but rather finding the most wacky solution you can think of and make it work. Of course you can help the pirate by giving him more cannonballs to shoot out of his cannon, but why not try giving him tiny pink chickens and see what happens.

I did not do the mini-puzzles in the book but I did every level.\n\nI enjoyed the game quite a bit, but almost the entire game was too easy and the puzzles were funny but not hard.\n\nThe basic idea is that you can use a book to spell out any item or change a description of an item to solve puzzles. You can be very creative and specific or you can be simple and generic.... both will generally solve the puzzles.\n\nThere was no combat missions, or create a situation level... so after I played every level, I decided to goof around and make "massive epic mega ultra portal" and have giant monsters do battle, but quickly found that playing outside of puzzles isn't as fun as i wanted.\n\nCool game, worth it but only for the casual who is creative.","February 16, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's easy to just play for just as long as you like and is good for those who don't want to get a deep story with complicated controls. This makes this game fitted even for the younger players, as long as you know the difference between adjectives and nouns. The game is family friendly and can sometimes seem to "childish", but I do appriciate the creativity and imagniation required. Both the artsyle and music makes the game "light" and upbeat.\n\nThe storyline is pretty simple and straightfoward, but all the miniquests makes the game interesting and you don't get bored. It is fun, simple and very creative and I think most players will get a couple of hours of fun out of it.","December 29, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fun is not as much in finding a solution to the puzzle (as most of them will be rather obvious) but rather finding the most wacky solution you can think of and make it work. Of course you can help the pirate by giving him more cannonballs to shoot out of his cannon, but why not try giving him tiny pink chickens and see what happens. The world around changes with your every action and creating one small innocent zombie may result in having a horde of undead-everything few minutes after.\nSo let your imagination go wild!","January 18, 2014","true","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Do I recommend this game to adults? No.\n\nThis game is simply not challenging enough for an adult to play. The starite sequences are easy to complete, and the shard hints are easy to figure out. When it comes down to it, the most gameplay you'll be engaging in is pressing "Enter" and typing. True, you can do some goofy things like making people blind and making animals fly, turn colors, or force school children to eat cats, but when that is said and done, the game doesn't get much more entertaining.\n\nThe achievements are rather easy to unlock aswell. All of the shards are available to unlock without any prerequisites, and the starites are achieved through normal gameplay. The most backtrackingI had to do was resetting a level maybe three times. It's nearly impossible to fail at this game unless you accidentally get Maxwell killed. There are no timed levels and the game eventually tells you what to spawn if you take too long to complete a task during a starite mission.\n\nMy five year old loved this game. He enjoyed the themed levels, the ability to spawn almost anything, and how he could interact with almost all of the objects. We would often play together and the game motivated him to learn how to spell.  He would ask me how to spell certain words and I believe the game made learning a little bit more enjoyable for him. He played this game for a long time before moving on to Scribblenauts: Unmasked.","December 28, 2015","true","14.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

You were tasked with solving a simple puzzle – get a starite (the game’s star-shaped macguffin), and to do so you could conjure up just about any item you could think of, from the commonplace like cars and ladders, to more outside-the-box things like arsonists and marimbas.  I was always surprised such an excellent game was made by 5th Cell, a game company that was, up to that point, a veritable mediocrity factory.  Was 5th Cell secretly a team of amazing game designers?\n\nScribblenauts Unlimited answers this question with a resounding “No.”\n\nUnlimited introduces some new features that should make this game a hit – like an item editor that allows you to create your own stuff.  And, as much as I appreciate a game that allows me to make a bazooka that shoots newborn infants, the new mission-style of the game itself is what ruins it.  Doing a simple task like “get a starite” was rewarding because the solution was open to your imagination.  There was any number of solutions you could use and solving a level made you feel smart and accomplished.  When someone gives you a mission in Unlimited by saying “Boy, I’m hungry.” I don’t care if you say pizza, artichokes, or quinoa, thinking of a kind of food will never feel like an accomplishment.  Also, people who give their missions out to you exist in such a cramped space, sometimes you accidentally solve other peoples’ missions without intending to.","November 25, 2013","false","15.5"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","23","47","0","1"

If something isn't in the game already you can easily go find it on the Steam Workshop or create it yourself.\n\nTo the game itself, it is very fun.  Puzzles can be solved in a wide variety of different ways, giving you room to be creative.  A few of the puzzles are very obtuse which is an annoyance when you run into them, but it's not game breaking.\n\nI'm not sure what else there is to say.  Go buy this game!","February 17, 2013","true","15.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Whether you're getting this for yourself, your grandma or your young nephew, this game is great. It's really kid friendly and great for all ages. It definitely has it's drawbacks, but I'd say this game is on the positive side.\n\nScribblenauts is a game where you can create objects by simply typing in their name and they will poof into existence. Now this is limited to objects that have already been created in the engine and as hard as much as you may want to summon some naked gurls, you can't make anything lewd which is fine honestly.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to collect stars, kind of like Mario 64 and other games, to save your sister or whatever. To get stars you summon objects and things to solve problems. This can be done with lots of different items which you will need to be somewhat creative with, but at the same time you can always just summoner a hover tank and make yourself fly to do most things.\n\nOverall the game is solid and just simple fun. Worth around 15 to 25 bucks based on how you value your time.","August 11, 2013","true","19.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well I have. You can too if you get this game of PURE FUN.\n\nDon't let the cartoony style fool you into thinking this is a game for kids, this is easily one of the most f*cked up games I've ever played to date. In just 20 minutes of play I've helped a chef at his restaurant cook up random things that his customers wanted, one guy wanted pizza so I gave the chef human body parts for his pizza ingredients that made a lovely human pizza afterwards, the dude totally ate the whole thing without a clue, ha ha dummy. The next person wanted a motorcycle... okay, wrong place n' all but whatever I'll just throw some part together and make a bike for you no problem, EXCEPT! once the kickin' rad bike was done the chef decided to take it for himself and drove off with it leaving a crying customer for me to deal. Wasn't my restaurant though so not my problem, I then bailed to some school.\n\nFirst thing I noticed here was this bully forcing some nerd into a locker, I helped this nerd by summoning Mutha Fu**in' NITO, yes NITO from Dark Souls, who then bullied the crap out of this bully, after soaking in all this glorious irony I then moved onto the cafeteria to help with school lunch, this was a no brainer for me, I fed them a ♥♥♥♥♥ (not that kind :/), unfortunately the kids all died from eating it, not sure why when China eats cats n' stuff, but whatever it didn't matter at that point because I already got my star. I then just flew off on a flying pregnant baby going at supersonic speeds with Solaire from Dark Souls where we praised the Sun for the rest of that play session. This all in just 20 minutes.\n\nSeriously get this game, you should play this now. Never mind the fact that little Maxwell is an idiot that almost got his sister killed, all that matters is with this Notebook YOU ARE AN ALL POWERFUL GOD AND SHOULD GIVE ZERO F*CKS.","October 14, 2013","true","13.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Requires you go around and alter things to make people and htings happy.  This entails editing items or making items to do just that.  WHich is part of hte complexity.  It starts off easy enough, but then as you go along the complexity keeps increasing and increasing.  To a point that I personaly was not sure how to do what needed to be done.  The reaosn for this was that things i tried to make to do didnt seam to do anything.  Like for example an illegally parked car.  I spent an hour trying to makew the area a free parking area.  WHihc i could not do...nothing i did worked...i tried making a parking meter...etc etc.  What the game wanted was somehting entirely different.  Whihc i find to be th eonly drawback to this game.  There seams to be only specific ways to accomplish goals...and as such it can become a trial and error fest of trying to figure it out.  For a simplistic game....the fact you have to do trial and error is annoying.  My niece got bored after only 15 minutes of this game....which says alot.  I sit with her and play with her....but if i and she have run out of ideas.....wow thats not a good thing.  The illegal parked car was just an example....as such i find this game interesting....but if you are looking for something that you want to be able to win with out having to look up answers   then i dont recommend this game.  If you like just messing around and making things...then sure this will work out as well.   But trying to play it to pass the levels and such....its annoyance factor places it into the list of games I personaly wont play.","November 27, 2013","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Tons of interesting, unique, and colorful levels. The story is good. You run around helping people for starites(I won't say why because spoilers!!). You really have to be creative with this game. This can get repetitive though. The graphics are great. The HD added with the color is beautiful and since it is 2D it should be easy for all computers. As for content there's lots to do. Even when your done the game you still have tons to do as anything you right will appear. How they put all this in? No clue! When you think you have seen it all there's more. It has something called object editor  . With this you can make anything you want (It is not to complicated either), you can then post your creation on steam workshop. With Steam Workshop you can see and use other peoples creations, this adds a new level to the game. Overall its a fun game for a casual gamer but if you were expecting it to be all sirius and precis, you came to the wrong place.

Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, Like Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.\nNow, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, in MY opinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring! Awww... The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had? FORTY FREAKING TWO. Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. "Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple. No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one! The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good. DANG! That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review. GRAPHICS! This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up, MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to. GAMEPLAY! Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles! DOWNSIDE! Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit.. Simplifed... And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know, YOU KNOW It has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go.","May 17, 2014","true","26.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is fun but when it comes to creating things out of words it cant be compared to the NDS or IOS port. Simply because it doesnt recognize half the words you put together. For example in the first city there is gaffiti drawn on the wall and you have to get rid of it, So you may be thinking lets get creative with the words so you type Paint Eraser, or Paint Thinner and the game asks you did you mean this, and it gives you 5 pages of words you possibly dont know to replace the words you typed. Its like they took the worst part of gooogle search from the year 2005 by saying did you mean this, and made it into a game.\n\nThe game is really fun once you get past the flaw of being creative with words and you can even make your own creations and replace other creations with your own in a level such as a ant with your own design by clicking on it and recreating it. But with the 1 flaw thats holding it back it feels like its not the same scribblenauts from the NDS or IOS and was simply made poorly as if the game was made by a different company.\n\nThe game is a defininate buy but if your a fan of the Original games on NDS or IOS then prepare for extreme ammounts of being angry because the game wont let you make paint thinner for paint but somehow an eraser can get rid of the paint which has no creativity at all when you are trying to get crazy creative with word creations.","January 4, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can type pretty much ANYTHING in your awesome notebook and it just comes to life!  It also has a good story to follow along on.  It has a feature where you can make your own creations.  Just type nearly any noun, and you can edit it for your own.  Another feature is having a magical globe throughout the game and you can teleport to any place in the world of Scribblenauts.  Its got just so many puzzles, and they are all throughout the world.  It's a very fun and funny game.
