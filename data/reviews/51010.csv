"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowSimbaCatGOD/recommended/51010/","YellowSimbaCatGOD","-hg- Simba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowSimbaCatGOD/","50 products in account","So far over almost 60hrs of game play and i luv the game.  Unlike some players who play it u can pause the game and everything will stop running while your gone.  when you play the game there are settings u can choose to slow down game play or leave it on med pace or fast pace.  those different settings mean how fast your tribe ppl age in the game.  when ever i been playing i'm almost about to get all trophies only 2 left.  an i must say its been a challange.  i recommend that if your going to play this do understand it does take time. an when your say playing for a few hrs and u choose to stop say because u dont want to play for a few days.  Then enter the settings page an pause your game so none of the workers keep working while your gone.  if u leave the game and leave it running your tribe will continue to age while your gone.  Now all i can say is fun game good for those that enjoy a long game of waiting u must pay attention and spend up to nearlly 80hrs to 150hrs to get all the trophies i could be wrong but the hardest one so far to get is make a person live for over 969 yrs or something around that.  Thx god for fountain water, golden relic and mushrooms. use on a person over age 65 or 66 to give them youth to age 36 again.  anyways i luv the game and cant wait till i get the remaining trophies.","March 12, 2014","true","116.9"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","27","31","4","1"

I loved making my tribe grow and naming everyone. I looked forward to coming home every day and checking on my cute little tribe. Did they finish that house? Ooooo I wonder if they got more science points! It's a very enjoyable and cute game. It takes time but it is very addicting. You grow to love your little creations and work hard to make your little island prosper. I would recommend this to anyone, no matter how old.","March 27, 2015","true","16.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LushieBee/recommended/51010/","LushieBee","Lushie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LushieBee/","12 products in account","This game is all but a very watered down version of The Sims with much fewer customization options. Taking care of and growing your tribe is fun and addicting at first, but eventually most of the game is idle while you wait for villagers to rack up Science Points to unlock new clothing styles, building projects, farming, and possibilities with Potion brewing.\n\nOnce all of those are unlocked, building the large projects takes quite a bit of time and it's easy for your villagers to run out of fire for cooking food while you're not playing. SInce you must manually check trees for harvest, they may all starve to death to lack of fire despite there being tons of trees to chop down. It makes it difficult to go to sleep or keep busy with your real life for the fear your tribe may have run out of wood while constructing. Solving the 9 mysteries is fun, but the rewards are variable. You can gain berries for making hair color changing potions, access to orange flowers for decoration, which aren't very exciting. You can get access to making youth potions though, which is essential for two of the trophies.\n\nThe trophy system is fun up until you get to the time consuming ones, one of which requires you to keep a villager alive for nearly an entire month- in real life. It'll keep you busy for a few weeks, but by then you've done pretty much everything possible. Overall, it's a fun little game if you're fond of games like The Sims.","June 5, 2015","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I had a thriving island with lots of lovely settlers. This game can also be sad and cruel. I left a new island for a few days and the people ALL DIED. (i crie evrytime) Depends on how much you play it.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and for whoever want to take their time off on a intense RTS game. (Starcraft II for me)\n","January 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
