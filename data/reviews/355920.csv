They had done many bug fixing patches but I encountered one they missed. I asked them to please look into it and see if another patch was needed. That very same day, they released another patch just to fix the issue I had found. So they not only keep track of the discussion board on a regular basis, but they also listen to us and fix things promptly.\n\nI've always enjoyed their jigsaw puzzle games and Space is just as fun as the rest. While you're playing, there are little mechanical cylinders floating all around (in the same floaty space as your puzzle pieces). There are 3 little spacecrafts at the bottom of the screen and you can place a cylinder in one of them to get a hint. Since there are so many cylinders, you can use many hints, if need be. The first little rocket will show you the picture again for a few seconds so you can make a game plan. (hit the letter G to launch it). The second little rocket will show you where in the puzzle the piece you're holding goes - so pick up a piece and hit the space bar. The last little rocket rotates your puzzle piece to the correct angle. So pick up a piece and hit ctrl. (I think I got that right). Also, I believe there is an option to set all the pieces to the correct angle to begin with if you dislike rotating them. So... after you put a cylinder into a little rocket and hit the correct key to gain that hint, the rocket will blast up and off your screen - but will reappear again right away so you can use that hint again.\n\nNow for the fun part. If you don't use a single cylinder for any hints, you can build the BIG rocket, all the way to the left of the screen. It requires every single cylinder to complete - thus why you can't use hints. If you're not planning on using any hints or you find you're almost done with the puzzle and haven't used any cylinders, then build that huge rocket (with each cylinder added, you can see it take shape) and it will blast off when completed. Okay, it's very cool looking but why are we doing this exactly? Because when you finish your puzzle, a shuttle will come down and land perfectly straight - which gives you a "launch puzzle" achievement along with the "complete puzzle" achievement. Two achievements for the price of one. As long as you don't use any hints.\n\nLastly, if you're feeling morbid and twisted, you can grab onto the spaceman jumping around, drag him all the way to the top of the screen, and drop him. He will splat and you'll have a nice little bloody mess to stare at while you're working away on your puzzle. I did it once to see what it was like but it was just a little too ooky for me. I mean, I was trying to relax with a cool puzzle and nifty space music - so killing the poor spaceman and then getting to stare at my handywork kinda broke the mood I was going for. :p\n\nIn closing: This is a very enjoyable jigsaw puzzle game made by developers who care and listen to us. I recommend this game wholeheartedly.","March 1","true","15.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/355920/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","After visiting Japan, fighting undeads, observing birds and watching anime, you're going to space! Pixel Puzzles: Space is a jigsaw game, based on the universe, planets, astronauts and everything that can go to space.\n\nYou have to build pictures by assembling pieces that are floating in space, which is the core of the game. However, now, you can choose any puzzle instead of waiting to unlock them: meaning that you can begin by the 350 pieces one and finish by the easier ones of 60 pieces.\n\nTo make your job a little easier, you can use bonus: see the whole picture for a few minutes, rotate the piece or show the right place. But how to unlock them? Floating with the pieces, you'll find parts of a rocket. Put one of them on the bonus you want to use and launch it. However, using the bonus will prevent you to launch a bigger rocket and to unlock the puzzle launch achievement. In other words, if you're an achievement hunter and using bonus in every puzzle, you'll have to do them twice. At least one of them will have to be done that way as achievements for launching the bonus are also included.\n\nWhile the feature above is the main novelty of the game, with the freedom of choosing any puzzle, I have to speak about the little astronaut bouncing around. He's not annoying (he doesn't speak) but some people are bored to see him - contrary to me that managed to forget him at each puzzle. You can take him and make him bounce from an higher height, until you hear him scream and crash on the ground, dead.\n\nMy only little problem is that while trying to place a piece and rotating it too quickly is sending it back to the floating sky. Besides, for the pieces that are doing the outline, they're also often send back to it. While they're placed correctly, you can see them move a little during the process. If you try to place them at that exact place, it's like the game is considering that place as the floating sky. It's annoying after a while as the best way to begin the puzzle is to find a maximum of the outline pieces.\n\nI loved the pictures in it: they're really varied - planets (Earth or not), deep space, astronauts, shuttles launching, satellites, anything that is related to space and that can make a beautiful view. The soundtrack itself is very faithful to the theme.\n\nHowever, I noticed that on my laptop, the game was lagging a lot while on my desktop, it worked perfectly fine. I don't know why however and I will not try to find the answer as I finished the game on the desktop.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Space had an hard launch because of the bugs tied to the launch achievements and to puzzles not resetting. However, these are fixed. I waited for that to make a review (and to finish the game). Else I was ready to post a positive review about it.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Space is easily one of my favorites in the series, with Japan. Developers did a nice job. If you have any patience and loves jigsaw games, you can buy this one without problems. You have 25 nice pictures with the ultimate challenge of not using any bonus (that's the first game where I didn't rely on the bonus, apart for the achievements related to them).","March 14","true","20.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

There are rocket parts floating around. You decide to put them together to build a rocket, or use them to get hints about orientation or position of a puzzle piece.\n\nI really like, that it had achievements for solving every puzzle without using the rocket pieces to get hints. They were not too hard to solve, the biggest with 350 pieces took me around 3 hours. The smaller one with 60 pieces only 10-15 minutes.\n\nI didn't like a bug at puzzles with 220+ pieces, where pieces at the edge of the puzzle board dropped below the board, if they were not in the correct spot. Often you either had to pick them up instantly, or you have to shuffle the floating pieces by pressing the 'S'-key, because they were stuck under the board.\n\nI was glad to not have a similar minigame as we had it with the Undead-Puzzle.\n\n8/10, recommended for every jigsaw fan","May 8","true","22.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This makes the game a bit too easy as you can just rotate pieces until they fit without actually taking the time to see if it matches up. Sometimes I'd just get lucky and randomly find spots for pieces just because it auto-snaped into place.\n-  It was hard to tell what the power-up / hints actually did or how to activate them. I only figured out how to do one.\n\nOverall it's a great Jigsaw Puzzle Simulator and is a nice relaxing game that anyone can play.","February 21","true","8.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikiya/recommended/355920/","Mikiya","Waverly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikiya/","284 products in account","There are a couple of variations compared to how I lay classical puzzles that it kills the whole idea for me\n\n- No fusing segments together, so you can't make the big things off the board and drag it as a whole to where it should roughly fit.\n- Auto-fitting and not being able to pick the pieces up anymore if they're in the correct spot. Auto-fit on everything even if it's not correct and allowing you to pick them up again would be much nicer, or just make it tighter so it doesn't autofit nearly as fast.\nNote that this is also prone to going trial-and-error through the puzzle. I'd really like to be able to disable that so that I don't accidentally complete pieces I didn't intend to or had settled on yet","February 25","false","1.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"
