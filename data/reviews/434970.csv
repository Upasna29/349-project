I thought it looked really cool, and like the visuals, and find no disappointment there. There's some good challenge to the gameplay, it's set up to be difficult. Think 'Super Meat Boy' type gameplay but more colorful...and even with some hair-pulling moments thus far, there's really nothing unfair or overly-frustrating, plus you have PLENTY of choice for difficulty. I think the trailer gives a good idea of what to expect from the game. I'm pretty sure I got the gyst of 'That Dam Level Redux', and at very least can already recommend it!","April 3","true","0.6"," 19 of 65 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","19","65","5","8"
