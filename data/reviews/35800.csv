It's a game where you zoom through a tunnel at speed, grab glyphs and avoid anything that's likely to kill you (that's pretty much everything that isn't a glyph, really).\n\nAnd doesn't it sound so terminally dull when you put it like that? (YES, IT DOES)\n\nIs it terminally dull? Nope. it is so very far from terminally dull! Rejoice.\n\nThere's a couple of things that really make Brainpipe special. One is the graphics which, y'know, aren't quite up to the full Minter they're certainly not far off. It's like flying through someone's fevered attempt at a 70's Doctor Who title sequence or what might happen if someone sat down and said "Mr Trumbull, could you make us a videogame please" or something.\n\nThe other is the sound. Oh man, the sound. This is the stuff of headphones on, turn it up, sit back and enjoy. Or just turn it up really loud if you can't manage that. Parts of the soundtrack wibble in and out of focus, sounds zip around you ear to ear, it's one long Any Colour You Like ride but a little bit more strange.\n\nIt's essentially the full audio/visual woooah there. Which is just fine. I love it to bits. I love it for its simplicity, I love it for its graphics and I love it for its sound but I love it most of all because it's so very pure and unfiltered. It's slightly weirdy, slightly askew and all the woah there. I couldn't ask for much more.","September 28, 2014","true","0.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xatu_png/recommended/35800/","Xatu_png","Xayn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xatu_png/","445 products in account","Okay, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\nIt's the kind of game you play once every few weeks, but for the rest of your life. Great if you randomly feel like immersing yourself in a richly aurally-textured half-axon half-multiverse tunnel with a pace ranging from narcoleptic to highly spasmodic.\n\nThe actual goal is collecting glyphes embodying tiered concepts, with a final one marking a progression we'll get back to; all while avoiding obstacles as your speed slowly increases with each level.\nFor instance, level 1 is the nasal ganglia, with concepts such as "peculiar insight" or "nervous laugh" and the final glyph being Awareness.\nThe gameplay also involves the ability to, holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, SLOW DOWN TIME. The game really has a particular relation to time in general, as you slow down the sound environment as well and pausing temporally stucks you in one audio piece. Said pieces otherwise naturally flow with the game.\n\nWhile all golden glyphes make you "progress", and the general goal is to collect everything, the game has one and only one condition for winning : collecting the very final glyph, Unhumanity. Completing a playthrough rewards you with the ability to choose an in-game avatar from a variety of monsters. As for what happens when you miss the glyph... I'll let you see for yourself.\n\nSo in short, exceedingly fun, love the overall feel of the game, EXTREMELY underrated on steam. It's one of those little games that have a special place in my heart. Maybe literally given the environment.","January 4, 2014","true","10.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_mack/recommended/35800/","mr_mack","Mr. Mack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_mack/","276 products in account","This game consists entirely of dodging obstacles while flying through the opening to Doctor Who. Along the way you'll pick up various hydrocarbon chains, most of which are butane, but 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane does make an appearance (for all you 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane fans out there or "1,1-dimethylcyclopropane-iacs").\n\nThe options menu allows adjustment of music and sound effects and nothing else. So if you l find the controls too sensitive, as I did, then too bad.\n\nSo far I've only gotten to level nine. Doing so took 20 minutes. I'd be surprised if this game is longer than an hour. Without any evidence to the contrary, I'm forced to assume that the game's brevity is to make sure it doesn't get repetitive.\n\nIf flying through an abstract something-or-another while dodging stuff sounds fun, then buy "1... 2... 3... Kick It!"\nIf you feel that you must buy this game, then wait for it to go on sale first, it isn't long enough for $10.

A bland game experience, and it doesn't add much to the genre. If you really want a runner and don't wanna spend more than US$2 on it, then maybe, just maybe, you could get this. (I wouldn't, since I only had fun for the first 5 minutes of the 15 I managed to play.) Otherwise, stay away.\n\nPros:\nWeird graphics in a nice way\nCould be fun as a casual game for the right player\nYou may start a new game from any stage you want\nIf you like the game, it has replay value, since levels are randomly generated\nCons:\nControls are not very smooth and don't add much to gameplay\nWeird background... music? No, definitely not music, more like organized noises\nWhen it gets too fast, it's almost certain that when you hit an object you'll hit a lot more and die\nHealth system is kind of weird--when you take a hit, everything shakes and red flashes everywhere, but you can't really know exactly how's your health\nBought on / for: I actually only played BRAINPIPE because I got it as a giveaway. Even for free, I wouldn't get it if I'd known.

There's 10 runes per level that you have to collect in order to gain a master rune ( I guess). Collecting all 10 runes plus the master rune at the end will elevate you to the next stage of being.\n\nThe pipeline does change color and sometimes you hear voices or other audio effects but its all background noise. The music isnt harsh on the ears but I'm not sure I would pop it into the player for hours on end though.  Said pipes are also home to diverse perils, such as green spines sticking out from the side walls, or spinning purple-pink plasma disks, There's also a cage type feature that you have to pass through as well. If you hit any of these obstacles, your display ( if you can call it that) flashes red and you hear a buzzing-warning-klaxon type sound. (very short though)\n\nYou do speed up as the levels progress so quick reflexes are good to have.  I have not beaten this game yet so I do not know how it ends. But, if odd pipeline-tunnel travel games are your thing, by all means, jump into the pipe and enjoy.","August 13, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That word sums up the feeling, the experience, the game...and though it may not be for everyone, I have the feeling of 'where have you been all my life', when enjoying Brainpipe. The premise is simple enough...go through ths first-person-perpective obstacle course, avoid all objects other than these heiroglyph symbols...yet it is challenging, and each playthrough feels different. The thing, though, is the visuals and the audio, as it is almost psychotropic, and even when you screw up you can feel the huge grin on your face, because the experience itself is like nothing I've seen(or heard, for that matter). I generally like runners or casual obstacle games, like 'The Collider' which is newer than this, or the runners like Race the Sun, TEC 3001 or FOTONICA, which are also newer. and all of those have somewhat 'trippy' visuals to add to the visceral feel in the games, but this has to be the king of trippy...sights and sounds dazzle you as you try to get through level 10 here and grab that heiroglyph if you can...and it certainly works for me. It probably is the kind of game to play in short spurts, as it can overwhelm the senses after a while, yet I find myself craving this game on occasion, and would caution against epileptics or folks seizure-prone playing this game. If ever there's a Brainpipe 2, however, count me in...and for two bucks you can find more potential thrills, huge grins and giddy laughter from the sensation, and reasons to play again, than for many top-dollar titles out there.","January 8, 2015","true","49.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't really say it's worth buying, especially for $10, but it certainly has it's merits.\nThe gameplay itself is... kind of standard, basically an extended Mario Party game, or maybe a flash game, although it's really difficult in the latter half of the game, being pretty hectic.\nThe graphics are pretty good, basically bacteria blob-looking things surrouding the tube you're going through, and bright vector (like the Vectrex, or Geometry Wars) graphics for the obstacles. They go pretty well with the atmosphere of the game and there aren't any problems like obstacles being hard to see. There isn't much to really say about them.\nThe music and sound effects create an excellent atmosphere, and I would definitely reccomend headphones if you're going to play it. There's a lot of speech in there as the game goes, and miscellaneous sound effects, which makes the levels slightly unsettling.","October 8, 2012","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are very well done, as is the ambient accompanying music.  The developers also included native controller support which is welcome for any game that requires fast reflexes.  Ultimately the goal of the game is to pick up all the powerups you can and survive for 10 levels at which point you get to choose which alien form you take.  I have not made it this far into the game but I am intrigued enough to continue giving the game a try.  I would suggest that this is a solid purchase for anyone interest in indie arcade games.
