For that alone, I can recommend the game, its worth the price, but looking deeper into the game, its a shallow, bare bones arcade experience that is only one step above classic Atari age retro arcade games.\n\nThe game has two modes, arcade that gives you three lives and tempest which is just a boss rush with one life. Each mode forces you to select tweaks to the mode. One of the tweaks is a duo mode where with one controller, you can fly as two ships using the left stick and trigger for one and the right stick and trigger for the other. To the game's credit there is full 360 controller support as well as keyboard support.\n\nYou can also select music, backgrounds and graphics between old school and new. I prefer old school, because I can see the pixel graphics versus the new sprites that look muddy, dark and blurry because they're stretched. In fact the entire game looks a bit blurry because of how stretched out the game is in full screen mode. Options also let you turn off the side bars with control information.\n\nWhat seems to get me every time to make this a bad game is how imprecise it is. A simple tap of the analog stick or directional pad and your ship will be given a short throw rather than a nuanced or subtle movement. So I feel when flying between bullets and I need to move a bit to one direction, the controller will throw me into a bullet rather than between them. That could be the fault of the ship speed power up, but it seems to happen a lot.\n\nThere seem to be no bullet patterns or logic to the enemies. They just get shoved onto screen and you're expected to destroy them all. The screen fills with enemies and bullets rather than carefully constructed patterns. If you get stuck in a dire situation, you have bombs that will clear everything off the screen.\n\nOther than bombs, you can collect upgrades to increase your firepower and you'll need it. Several of the enemies that stay at the top of the screen take a lot of shots and spray a lot of bullets. You collect stars that drop from enemies to fill up a power meter. Once the meter is full, use the power and you'll have a super weapon to plow through enemies and pull in stars rather than having to fly into them to collect them.\n\nAt the end of five or so waves, you'll fight a boss that's slightly larger than the bigger enemies of the game. It just feels so lackluster. Hey at least there are bosses. I will admit the game is good at preventing a boss's weakness. Such as the second boss will dive in firing missiles which would leave it open to fly behind, but the boss is smart enough to fire projectiles above it.\n\nSo the enemy design is good and I can tell the enemy logic apart from one another, but its the level design that is the problem. A giant cluster of enemies for every wave make it a game that's tough right off the bat. There is more challenge than fun.\n\nOn top of everything, the game is just ugly. The enemy projectiles are all dark green on a black background. They become difficult to see especially if you're playing in a bright room. The enemies themselves are dark on a black background too. The only bright things in the game are the player and the collectible stars. I swear that its possible for the bullets to get behind the stars so when I'm collecting a star, I run the risk of collecting a bullet with one hit death.\n\nPester keeps track of your high score, but there's no way to enter your name, nor any online leader boards. Its missing frills that have become a given with other games of the genre. Even arcade games in the early 80s let you enter your name as a form of glory and reward for doing such an excellent job.\n\nThere are awards rather than true Steam achievements. These awards seem to unlock new backgrounds. I'd love if the game had a random background or random music rather than being forced to chose them.\n\nSo after its all said, the choice is yours. Its worth a dollar of quarters. Otherwise, the game is unfair, jerky, imprecise, but hey its only a dollar. In an era where people buy Steam games for the cards, the price makes the game an instant hot seller, no matter how much I feel this project was rushed out the door.","January 16","false","0.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

You can change to other resolutions (though there are only 3 options), but getting to 1080p is impossible. I personally love this game, and love seeing it again for such a great price, and I will be recommending it, but please keep this in mind. ---\n\nI am a fan of bullet hell games, and this gives a goold old style feel considering its of course a newer game. Techno-grumble style music makes it feel like an arcade game, and for $0.99 this is a huge deal and a fun time passer.\n\nI would love to recommend this game with all of my heart, however there are crashing issues on launch, not to the point of unplayability, but trying to get into the levels can be a bit taxing.","August 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","2"

It's an old-school shmup that would've fit well in an 80s or 90s arcade--but with a bullet hell twist. Overwhelming waves of projectiles and wonderfully weird enemies fly toward you, and you have to blast everything in sight. The result's brutally difficult and quite a bit of fun. If you're masochistic enough to collect all of the in-game trophies (there are no proper achievements, sadly), you'll have to become an ace at timing your bombs and hyper mode. Unlike in Flump Studios' underrated Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection, there are no auto-bombs or continues here: it's pure finesse all the way.\n\nFor me, the game's one real downside is its lack of online leaderboards. Pester's a very well-balanced shooter--projectiles never unfairly trap you, it's always possible to recover after a death and every boss can be beaten without dying. It's perfectly suited to competitive scoring. Still, it's hard to complain given the $1 price point. Not many games on Steam offer this much game for so little money. I'd recommend it to anyone nostalgic for arcade cabinets, or to any fan of oddball shmups that don't just rehash the Touhou paradigm.\n\nFinally, if you've played Pester on Desura, there's good reason to revisit it here. Among other things, the Steam release is faster and its new visuals by Rail Slave Games are absolutely bonkers. The difficulty is higher, but a lot of the annoying stuff from the Desura release (like enemies that kill you from off-screen) has been removed--so it's harder but fairer. I was one of those rare people who enjoyed Desura Pester. This version is massively better.\n\nFull disclosure: I received a key from the developer during beta. On the other hand, I just bought two copies with my own money to give to friends. Is my review biased? You tell me.","August 21, 2015","true","12.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","11","17","3","1"

The C64 sported these amazing specs:\n\n1 MHz CPU!\n64 kB of RAM!\n320x200 pixel 16-color monitor!\n\nIt was such an incredible machine back then, and just as incredible now, but for different reasons.\n\nI got the retro feel I was looking for.  It's a good remake, in the sense of improving the graphics.  If anything, they should not be so good, if they were to really emulate the look of a C64 game.  Do an image search.  Top of the line gaming fun back then.  It's also hard and fast, like the arcade games which followed.\n\n1920x1080 resolution works just fine on my PC, in both full screen and windowed mode (Core 2 Duo, 8 GB RAM, AMD HD 5750, Win 7).\n\nPester is fun shmup throwback experience that falls somewhere between simple early game consoles and rage-quit hard arcade games.
