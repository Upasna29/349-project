The mouse is needed when going through the menu and starting each round.\nThere are framerate issues and they get worse on some areas of each map, even on low graphics settings. Lowering the resolution also does not help the problem.\n\nI was also sad to see Garfield Kart's description says Single Player. Yup, not even local multiplayer. :/ Seriously?, even Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Racing has Co-op and Local Co-op, and that game is worse than this. >.>\n\nAlso, there are no achievements and no cards drops.\n\nEach characters speech is very limited and Garfield's favorite words seem to be "Whoo hoo!", since that's all he seems to say throughout each round.\n\nOn the positive side, the detail of the game looks good. There are plenty of characters, karts, helmets, spoiler parts and boosters to unlock and choose from. On the tracks you will find shortcut paths, speed boosts and awesome power-ups and weapons to collect and stack.\n\nThis game has the potential to be so much better but it's a shame the devs were lazy with the PC port.\nIf not for the problems mentioned above, I would have given Garfield Kart a positive review because it really could be fun.\n\nIf you are a fan of Garfield, save your money and follow this game to hopefully get a notice of an update that fixes Garfield Kart's current problems.","October 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 144 of 182 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","144","182","23","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/362930/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Garfield Kart is a racing game developed by Gravity Europe releasing on PC in November 2013. The game has also been released on Nintendo 3DS previously as well.\n\nWe have all come to know what to expect from kart racing games from the likes of Mario Kart in the past. Most kart games that have come out to try and rival Mario Kart have often fallen flat on their face. Prior to playing Garfield, I had played another kart racing game on Steam, Coffin Dodgers and sadly that didn’t live up to the mark. Garfield Kart is almost an identical game to that of Coffin Dodgers.\n\nGameplay is going to be simple when it comes to kart racing, simply beat your opponents in the race around a circuit. There are 16 different courses to race around with 8 different powerups to collect around the circuits too. The game’s tutorial is back to front when it comes to explaining the controls; whether they did it with a different controller in mind I am not sure, but the controls on an Xbox controller were the complete opposite to shown on the screen. Garfield Kart has three different game modes to play, Grand Prix, Single Race and Time Trial. Grand Prix is the more structured part of the game, where you take part in 4 or 5 races at a time in a league, depending on where you finish in the races will determine how many points you get. Single Race is more like the “free mode”, whilst you can gain money from competing in races here; there aren’t any huge rewards for winning. Time Trial is what you would expect from a Kart Racing game; nothing too exciting and certainly the least interesting of the three modes.\n\nThere is one final game mode which is where Garfield does something a little different to the rest of the Kart Games on Steam. A daily challenge mode is included, complete the set task and you will get a reward at the end of it. This is a really easy way to gather better upgrades for your car without having the need to grind out money by replaying previous tournaments.\n\nGraphically, Garfield Karts looks really nice. It looks like one of the cartoons, with some really nice modelling, textures and animations on show. The game’s environments are all very nicely designed as well. The sound effects do let the game down a little bit; it can sometimes seem too quiet at times. Your engine noise can almost seem too quiet for it to seem realistic which something which felt really odd when playing is. The sound track is really catchy though.\n\nGarfield Kart has three levels of difficulties. Whilst you are not able to choose the difficulties per race, you choose which bracket of difficulty race to take part in; 50cc, 100cc and 150cc.  Obviously the higher the number the more powerful the rest of your opponents cars will be. In order to even be competitive in the 100cc and 150cc bracket, you will have to completely upgrade your car using the upgrade system; you are able to purchase items for your car which will improve three criteria of performance, speed, handling and power. You will also be able to choose from a selection of helmets which will also grant you a specific bonus for individual power ups which you can collect. Whilst I really liked the upgrade system, it does feel very much like a grind to unlock items as you have to replay previously won competitions in order to get anywhere close to being able to buy anything. I would have personally liked to have seen a reduction in the price set on the items so you aren’t forced to replay already played content if you don’t want to.  The daily challenge mode helps with this, but only if you play the game in small doses.\n\nI have been playing for over an hour so far and I have just completed the first bracket of races whilst also taking part in the daily challenge and a couple of time trials. There is easily another 3 or 4 hours of content from this game. Sadly the game will have very little staying power and I will more than likely not play the game again after completing the three stages of difficulty. With the lack of any multiplayer mode, the developers have really shot themselves in the foot of making game out of a genre which is so perfectly crafted for any type of multiplayer action.\n\nAs the Steam page says for this game, there is only partial controller support for this game. The gameplay itself works well with a control, however you have to navigate menus with your mouse, making a bit awkward to play on a couch setup.  There is a wide selection of resolutions to play on, right the way up to 4k, with minimal graphic options to change.\n\nTo sum up, Garfield Kart is purely an OK game. There aren’t any glaringly obvious negative points; it’s just not going to blow your socks off with exciting game play moments and hilarious local multiplayer. The only thing that resembles Garfield in this game is the character models; there is no story, no voice acting, and nothing else that makes this game any different to a generic kart racer. Luckily the game is priced low at £5, 59, and for that price you will get some enjoyment out of it, just don’t go into it expecting all the bells and whistles of Mario Kart.  I’ve marked it down as a 3 on my scale, it’s not the best game, but it certainly isn’t a bad game either. If you can get it less than the sale price, you will want to consider checking it out for an hour or two of action.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Allow me to give you a little backstory of myself: When I was 14 years old, I was a massive Garfield fan. Often times, I would sit about and do nothing but read the classic comic strips. They are hilarious! Garfield hating mondays and loving lasania, that was my childhood. I began to feel really depressed and worthless at about 15, and I often times wanted to end my life. My family lived in a tough part of compton, and I got beat up a lot by the tougher black kids of the community. When I was 17 years old, I attempted to end my life. I tied a rope around my ceiling fan, stuck my head through the loop at the other end and jumped off my bed. Ultimatley, my obesity problem stopped me from certain death, and the ceiling fan was ripped down off the ceiling and collasped on top of me on the floor.  My parents where unable to pay my hospital bills, and they were so angry with me that they disowned me, leaving me to fend for myself on the streets. I met a few other young men who spent there lives in poverty, and I joined them to attempt to make some money. We sold cocaine on the tough streets, but my curiousity got the better of me and I took some home and tried it myself. IT WAS AMAZING! I kept doing it, because it was the best feeling of my life, and I was quickly addicted to it. When I was 19 years old, I nearly overdosed and died, but I barley survived. I noticed something both times I was rushed to the E.R.: The only thing going through my head while I was dying in the back of that ambulance was Garfield. After spending 9 months in a goverment funded rehab, I decided to dedicate my life to Garfield. When I first discoved this game, my life was eterinally changed. Instead of getting high on cocaine, I'm getting high on Garfield Kart. I love this game so much, it encouraged me to go out and get a job at a go kart track. Sometimes, when the little kids go around the track in the karts, I like to pretend that the kids are garfield characters. Unfortunatly, my imagination got a little too vivid, and I imagined one of the little girls was the sexy Chadore', the hottest cat in all of the garfield universe, beckoning me to ♥♥♥♥ her hard. I'm still in court over that one. Anyway, this game is life changing, and I deeply encourage you to indulge yourselves.","December 13, 2015","true","684.6"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","84","53","63","54","3"

Then it got its own movie starring Bill Murray in a catsuit, which was funny because Bill played Pete from the Ghostbusters. Then when the Ghostbusters had a cartoon show, the voice of Garfield's cartoon show was also the voice of Pete. No one liked the movie, not even with Jennifer Love Hewitt in it and she can sell icecream to a dying man in the arctic who has no mouth or hands and he's trapped in a block of ice.\n\nSo with Heathfield's popularity it was only a matter of time before he got his own video game. Sure he had other video games, but this one would be good. The one to compete against the greatest kart racing game in existence, Crash Team Racing on the PS1. The men that forged this game would need the ultimate engine to play the game on that would power the game across several different platforms such as mobile devices, the 3DS and the PC itself. That game engine is Unity 3D, the engine used by other popular games like Walden and the Werewolf!\n\nOnce they had their game, they filled it with food items. Candy for weapons that consist of pies, lasagna and pillows. We've all had that dream where we're eating a really big marsh mellow and when we wake up there's no pillow on the bed and we burp feathers. This will be that game. A game so thrilling that the pillow will put all the other drivers to sleep, letting us slip by unnoticed. Lasagna will be made of nuclear energy that will let us boost ahead.\n\nI say let us this and let us that meaning you. The buyer of this game. You will be that us, because there's no multiplayer in this game coop or otherwise. I mean online or local. That's what I mean.\n\nGarfield Kart will be a great game for kids. All children love Garfield and they have since he was invented way back in 1910. A game so great for kids that powersliding becomes a tough as nails art to master and necessary for survival in 100 CC races because 50 CC is so dull and slow I found myself dozing with every turn before someone hit me with a diamond. I'm looking at you Odie...\n\nEight characters have been shoveled into this masterpiece that I put now with my wallet photo of Mona Lisa. Classics like Jen, who is someone's girlfriend. I assume played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who becomes the most overpowered character in the game as ever man, woman and cat stares her way as she drives by using perfume and lust as a weapon, jumping over bridges, rolling over hills, slamming down on the dirt roads that you will drive over again and again on your way to victory over those that compete for Jen's love.\n\nThis game is great because it incorporates two control schemes people love at the same time. There is a mouse control scheme for the menu and a 360 controls for the driving, but not 360 controls for the menu or mouse controls for the driving. This lets me get my third hand playing the game as well. The game has the controls backward when displaying the tutorial. The left trigger goes backward, the right trigger goes forward. Its all part of the challenge the game brings. There are two buttons for forward attacking and behind attacking too, but there's only one button for hopping when it could have been hopping left or hopping right like Super Mario Kart had twenty years ago.\n\nThe sixteen tracks are all fun and interesting. Four of them take place at the airport. Another few take place in egypt, some are in the snow with snowmen and pine trees. Others take place on a farm where cows live, but there are no cows, because Garfield loves to eat things. That is why there are no cows. Garfield and other characters have eaten so much that they are the same size and height as Jon who is a human, but Garfield is Bill Murray. Odie is played by Rhea Pearlman (great aunt of Ron Pearlman and Danny DiVito's wife) and Sheldon (Cooper?) in this game and it must have cost a lot of money to get the celebrity voice acting. I'm just kidding there isn't celebrity voice acting, just bad voice acting that you get to hear a lot.\n\nBefore each race you get to buy what cheats you want to use. These cheats cost money, but not micropayments. Instead you need to grind for the cash you need to buy stuff. Playing the same races over and over before you can buy that chick magnet car you always wanted, but Nermal drives. Cheats really help you compete in the 155 CC races so you can finish in 6th and final place a few seconds less than you would normally.\n\nThis game comes with a stop watch, because during the races, they don't keep time for you. You need to do that yourself. With a stop watch. I then write down my best times for the grand prix mode so I have them always. There is a time trial, but why would I ever use that to keep track of time when I'm only racing against a UFO? That's right Garfield Kart has UFOs and so many of them that they should be identified by now. You race against one in the time trial, which makes it more of a race with an actual time instead of the real races with no time. Then you also find them in the real races as a way to crash the first place racer, so its always best to be in second place until the end, where winning matters. You play to win.\n\nI will recommend it to all my friends no matter what their age. We all know and love Garfield. He is the best cat and Felix would end up in 6th place if he raced Garfield, because Garfield can drive a truck in this game but Felix can just sack race. Garfield is a great game and will continue to be the standard bearer for Bill Murray and Jennifer Love Hewitt games. Someone should make a sequel with Alvin & the Chipmunks.","January 3","true","2.4"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","88","42","48","27","0"

When you think of Garfield, you may think of a lazy cat lounging next to some of that sweet, sweet lasagna and otherwise not caring about a single thing that doesn't involve naptime. However, what you believed Garfield to be will be crushed in this harrowing tale of smashing our limiters and truly becoming who we are behind the mask that society gives us to live by, Garfield Kart.\n\nIn Garfield Kart, you play as any one of the Garfield cast in thrilling and chaotic go-kart rides through insane and strategically-involved tracks everywhere from Egypt to industrial Zimbabwe. After racing you can customize your racer with special items such as hats, spoilers and new karts. The items you buy effect your driver performance, and some item sets are made specifically for a certain driver. Stacking a full set of driver-specific items onto the driver they were meant for makes you very powerful, and in the world of Garfield Kart, you either get good or die hard.\n\nDuring your gameplay you may wonder why some characters act out of place according to the setting of the original comics they come from. The nurse (Liz) turns from helpful hand of medicine into a competitive matriarch who crushes the enemy beneath her iron go-kart, and even Garfield himself acts out of his usual lazy character. All of the people in Garfield Kart seem to be only alike to their comic counterparts only in appearance (and even that is questionable once the hats start rolling in). How could this be? You may wonder to yourself how these characters could be so unlike their original bases, until you realize one day that they are not different at all.\n\nGarfield Kart isn't just a tale of a friendly competition between some friends (and also that stupid grey cat who keeps hitting me with aliens RIGHT BEFORE I FINISH THE FINAL LAP IN FIRST NERMAL I WILL END YOU), but the tale of self-actualization and the breaking of societal norms through sport. Garfield himself abandons the mask so forced upon him by society to become his true self. The character customization store is just another way to self actualize, with every set of items for each character representing who they really are in the dark. When you finish a set of items for a character, you successfuly break society's pre-determined path for this character and allow them to be themselves once more. This is also why the completed sets make your characters much more powerful.\n\nGarfield Kart is a triumph of the gaming industry, and is more akin to a work of art that focuses on the trials and tribulations the people of today go through to become their true selves. I think we can all take a page out of Garfield Kart's book, and strive not only to be the best we can be, but to also become who we know we are deep inside.\n\nThank you.","January 6","true","5.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","24","25","13","0"

This is on a GTX970. For a mobile port, this is inexcusable.\nControls aren't great\nMobile port aspect shines though in everything:\nBesides selecting characters, cars, hats, and spoilers, you can also use the ingame currency to buy "boosts" - one-time use items that will give you an edge in the next race - for example, starting off at higher speed. If you don't get any of these, there's a yes/no prompt if you're sure you didn't mean to buy a boost. Then, on the screen before the race starts, it says "No boosts? Shame!". These were obviously meant to get people to purchase ingame currency on mobile.\nMenus were made for touchscreens and it shows. You have to click-drag the lists of characters, cars, customization items, etc. There's no indicator for controllers where your menu selection is, if it even exists (in some menus pressing A does something, in some it doesn't)\nGeometry is very simple (though this doesn't clash badly with the cartoon aesthetic)You always lose collisions. The AI isn't bothered by these, but the player is always slowed down by bumping into other cars, even if the other car bumps into you from the back.\nHazards have larger hitboxes than you'd expect, leading you to get dicked over by stuff you were sure you'd avoided.\nThe classic Mario Kart frustration of getting hit by everything just before you finish in 1st place is back with a vengeance.\nGame balance seems a bit hard for a kid's game, but this might be to stimulate just buying your way through it for the mobile version.\nTL;DR: This game sucks, Garfield sucks, Artefact Studios sucks, Microids sucks, go do something useful with your time rather than reading reviews for (or playing) absolute garbage games.","January 1","false","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","10"

No matter what graphical preset I selected or resolution, this game would drop to sub 30 FPS on a consistent basis. Some tracks would see single digit FPS drops in places. And it's not just the low FPS, it's the insane dips and spikes. If you have a good PC, in the span of 15 seconds you will go from 100+ FPS down to 10 FPS. The framerate is all over the place, making the karts impossible to control at times. And the specs given are completely off base with the games actual demands. My PC slaughters the recommended specs. I have an 8 core CPU Overclocked to 4.5 ghz, an R9 270X with 2gbs VRAM and 16 gbs of Ram. I can run nearly every high end modern game at 1080p 60fps on High/Ultra settings. I can't even maintain a solid 30 on the lowest graphical preset with Garfield Kart, so the idea that a dual core 2ghz CPU, and 256 mbs of VRAM could run this thing, is laughable. So unless you have an insane PC with a Free-sync or G-Sync monitor to negate the massive dips and spikes, you might want to steer clear of this one. It's a shame that the port is unplayable, because the actual game was pretty good.\n\nUpdate\n\nI forgot to mention the fact that in Grand Prix mode, you cannot advance races in fullscreen, you are forced to play windowed.\n\nHere is my full in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV0zSafgs9w","October 19, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"

Garfield Kart follows the titular character 'Garfield' and his crew of ragtag mercenaries as they continue their search for the buried treasure of the legendary pirate captain Orion Baskerville. This particular game takes place on the arid desert planet of Boralia, and see's our heroes utilising vehicles to cross the massive landscapes. The driving controls are tight and responsive, and the ground combat, a mix of Batman Arkham melee and Gears of War-esque gunplay, works well, with the bosses spiking difficulty later in the game. The story is enjoyable and kept me interested for its 20+ hour duration. Plenty of sidequests and diversions in the game world to keep players interested long after completing the campaign.\n\nThe sound design is absoloutely top-notch, from the report of gun, rev of an engine or blood curdling squeal of an undead aboriginal pirate. Guest voice actors include Michael Rosen, Johan Hegg and Alexis Texas.\n\nThe game runs perfectly at 24+ FPS on Virtual Machine running Windows 95 with 64mb RAM and 1.2Mgz processor.\n\nMy only criticism is that the controller support is a bit dodgy, the only button prompts i could get to show up on screen appeared to be from a Neo-Geo pocket X.\n\nOverall, 9.75/10 would definetly play for 104 hours  again","February 20","true","104.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The problems begin when you try to configure your own keys (or controller) since the assignations are not intuitive; for instance, this are the first options you can choose from when setting up your keyboard:\n\n- Turn right (Digital) (+)\n- Turn right (Digital) (-)\n- Turn left (Digital) (+)\n- Turn left (Digital) (-)\n- Turn right (Analog)\n- Turn left (Analog)\n\n...and so on.\n\nThe options for the graphical configuration are merely "Screen resolution" and "Graphics quality", which you can change from "Very low" to "Very high" with five steps, but I don't have any complains in those since this is a pretty basic game and that will suffice, I bet this can even be played on any recent iGPU.\n\nThen, after you're done with te settings window, you'll find out that no matter what keys you entered in the config, the game will act completely different: in my case, after setting up the keys, I have to press Left in order for the cart to go Right, I have to press Down for the cart to accelerate, etc.\n\nI think the only "positive" point of the game, is that it looks nice, it's only visually attractive, no more. You'll have to deal with key mapping problems, config issues and even, maybe, optimisation issues since the game suffers from frame dropping even with its simple and undemanding graphics.\n\nThe only reason I'm keeping the game it's because of the cat and because it will be an extra number in my Steam library, but I'm sure I will never install it nor "play" it again.","March 25","false","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

First thing is the usual progression system that i'm not fully sure if you have to pay for stuff like candy crush (the boosters) or for the characters but i only had Garfield and Jon and 1 track to select, also there was this big "Microtransctions" sign in the menu, no customisation options, no directimput or ximput support and the frames... the race started at 60 fps and i think that was the last time, god the anwful framerates of this game, every turn was like a jump in time, for a port of a 3ds game so WHY? thing is i'm deleting it and never playing it again.

With no motivation to play and beat other players I'm probably going to set it aside and play it once or twice a year if that. I got this game in a bundle and thought it would be fun. For the $.50 (if that much) that went towards this game, I was right. It's entertaining if you've got nothing else going on and don't want to take a game too seriously but the lack of multi player really takes away from what this game could be. For the $8 normal price tag or the $2 sale price, I would say this game isn't worth the buy. If you get it in a bundle it's worth it as long as you don't buy the bundle for this game. I wouldn't spend the money to buy this game at all because of the lack of key features that are supposed to be with games like these.","February 7","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is an extremely poorly optimized port of a mobile game; my system has an i5 4690K, 8 gigs of RAM, and an r9 390, and the game hardly ever goes above 30 fps, even dropping to 10. When I started the game, I set up my controller to play, and when I started I had to use the mouse to select the options, and the game ws already asking for me to buy things! Once I got into the race, my controls were very different, "B" was set to "brake" is now used for "shoot behind," for example. Turning is nonexistant, and you have to completely rely on drifting, but drifting only worked the first time I used it in any race, so I consistantly lost because I couldn't turn at all. If you want to make better use of your time, make your own Kart racing game, even if you just roll your head on the keyboard to program it it'd probably turn out better.

The port is pretty decent. You can get 24-54 FPS with a GTX 770 and a i5 4570, so I think you cant moan. The graphics are top notch. In some situations the game looks even better than Witcher 3. Of courede there are some small issues like constantly not loading backgrounds or textures, but that's not to bad I guess. The gameplay is very easy to learn, but hard to master. There are currently 35 maps with infinite ways to solve them. The puzzles are unique,  challengin and very creative. The story about an italian cat searching for his princess seems a bit ripped off, but it is very well executed and even brought some tears to my eyes. Definitely worth the 10$.","January 6","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Jump and slide for boost and collect weapons to use during the race. Same ase mario kart just the drivers, cars, weapons, and levels are different. I have played with both a keyboard and a steam controller and I do have to say once you set up you controller, thats the way to play the game. Charchters were done really well and so were the levels. Not the most detailed work but its for a cartoon game so the graphic quality is quite nice. Just dont get irritated like I did when it seems like every other car is faster. Its because they are and you need to utilize your boosts and weapons to come out on top in the end. I give this game a 7 out of 10 because they sould have made this game with FULL controller support.","February 13","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Look no further than Garfield Kart! If you're a fan of a certain lasagna-loving, Monday-hating tubby fella (and who isn't!) then you owe it to yourself to check this little under-the-radar gem out. Sure, the production value isn't quite up to par with that of another well-known kart racer that, let's be honest, is becoming a little long in the tooth, but the sheer amount of enthusiasm the developers have for our favorite feline franchise is evident in every nook and cranny of this lovingly crafted title. Beautiful 1080p graphics and a whimsical color pallete bring Garfield's world to fluid, 60-fps life and it's a truly sublime experience to finally race through the environments that Jim Davis let us escape to for so many years. The power up items are all clever nods to the comic - Garfield's favorite pasta dish (if you're a true fan, enough said on what this could be!) allows him and his friends to perform heart-pounding, tooth gritting boosts to the karts - as well as to the player's heart rate as the adrenaline starts to surge! The famous (or infamous?...) spring is also present, enabling players to finally re-enact all of their favorite spring-related antics from the comic strip. Character and kart customization options allow for endless replayablility, plus playing dress-up with our furry friends is a joy in and of itself (ever wish you could just slap a chef's hat on Odie? Wish no more, your prayers have been answered!).\n\nI could go on, but hopefully if you've read this far I've already convinced you to give this game a shot. If you have even the slightest interest in Garfield, Kart racing, or video games in general then don't let this one pass you by!","October 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","46","12","26","16","0"

The patch helped a lot, I can log in without any problems and can play the game. OMG I had to wait 1 day and imagine that, the world didnt end.\nI played a bit and I like what I see. There is a lot to improve, but that is early access for you.
