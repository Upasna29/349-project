You find the exact same limitations in demos as the 'free version' of this game places on you.\nTo put it bluntly, you are not going to get more time out of this product than you are from a demo of any other game UNLESS you start buying boosters.\n\nThe question then comes, of course, is it worth it to buy boosters?\nFor me, looking at prices and taking my experiences while trying out the mislabeled DEMO, the answer became a resounding NO.\n\nDoing the story missions (which I did to get every unlock possible in the demo) was somewhat ok. A bit repetitve at times, due to the limitations of the game, but at least the battles were somewhat balanced.\n\nAbility to get cards for free seemed limited to the few you got in the limited amount of solo-play missions available. The only currency in the game is hard cash, and it's not something you can 'earn' by playing (not in any games I tried at least), but purely something you pay to get boosters.\n\nMost of the time when I queued up for online battles against other players, it told me that nobody was available to play against. So I had to alt-tab and do random stuff in a web-browser while trying to even GET games going online against other players.\n\nAny of the battles I tried against other players were horribly horribly mismatched. There was no way the deck I was supplied with as a 'freebie'(or demo player) would compete with the decks of people I met (every one of the ones I met seemed to have paid and played for a while, given their levels and cards).\n\nRandomization also have a huge effect on battles, meaning what initially looked like a balanced battle (as the ones I encountered in the solo missions) can turn onesided very quickly by a combination of cards gotten and mana orb placement. Battles that are already onesided can become extremely pointless beyond hope because of this too (like where my level 3 drake was put up against a level 30 drake by the matchmaking).\n\nUnless you are planning to spend ALOT of money over a period of time to buy boosters as time goes by, steer clear of this one. The variety also seemed close to non-existent in the games I played, despite meeting levels and drakes of different types.\n\nThe poor balance, non-varietyof battles, lack of ability to progress without paying for it (coupled with the prices per time you actually consider if you should purchase something) ultimately turned me off from the game once I found out that I had exhausted the demo of its potential in a matter of 4 hours...\n\nSome cute ideas, but ultimately flawed in execution on how they go about trying to handle the 'distribution model'.","October 12, 2014","false","4.9"," 118 of 121 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","118","121","2","4"

However, the game is poorly translated from French, is kinda buggy under its clean interface, and the card text isn't easy readable at higher resolutions. The unskippable and insulting tutorial tried to break on me twice, and the game itself crashed once for no apparent reason. The option to buy physical cards and combine them with a web cam for augmented reality is interesting, but given the above problems I really can't advise anyone to give it a try.","November 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","52","55","0","0"

The actual gemplay revolves around using your creature to battle the other player, using a mixture of physical attacks and spell cards. In many ways, you can think of it as using cards to fight with pokemon.\nBe warned that the game is, in essence, pay to win due to the CCG nature of the game. Furthermore, since you are drawing from a deck, you are hit a little bit by RNG as well.\nOn the negative sides, I find the English translation to be lackluster and the developers really need to spend the money to fix that before it would be accepted by an English speaking country. Furthermore, there are a lot of bugs in the game as well, but seeing how this IS an open beta version of the game, then I'm fine with that at THIS time.\nOverall, I found myself rather impressed by the game and I am currently considering putting some money up for it on kickstarter.","May 20, 2014","true","5.2"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","0"

For TCG's its deck types. We connect with a type of most or style and make it our own. In RPG's we like to place ourselves in the role of character going on adventures. This game ( be it very little at the moment) dose both. You create a deck to your play style and pick a monster that fits you, but then the game takes it a step further and allows to to alter that creatures apearance. This may seem a small thing but to those of us who watch animes like Digimon or Dragon Drive where you have one monster and thats all you get. This little step allows the player to connect to their "Drako" making it yours. As of right now there are only 6 Drakos in the game but every part from wings, to wing color, to claws, to horns can be changed. This game is only starting out and there are issues with translations but I for one am going to see it through and hope this game can pick itself up and stand tall with the big name TCG's.","June 12, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There are a few bugs that prevented me from trying out the daily tournaments. The game is pay to win, this is a fact. You get to pick a creature that you want to play with and they give you another 2 free to play creatures to play around with. You get the free to play card pack and it works pretty well if you can wisely use your mana and get good card draws. In order to get other creatures and other cards you have to buy the packs though, otherwise you won't get very far in the story mode or when versing other people online.There is no other way to get new cards, so the "free to play" aspect only goes so far. If they gave players a way to actually earn cards it might be a great game.","May 26, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When it came to language I noticed some words were not translted yet, but most of it is in english and if there are any words still in french (I think thats the language) its not too hard to understand what it means, or what the button does unless its a name. The game works GREAT.\n\nDrakerz is definitly a NEW type of card game, not just because it can be played in augmented realty (which is optional), but also because the machanics of the game are something never before seen (Or at least that I have have seen) in a card game and trust me I have played a lot of TCGs. Its all about your one Drako, your monster, your pet, your friend who you try to keep alive in battle. Theres no giant clutter of monsters on the feild that you have to keep track of, just one. The way you play is by moving your Drako across the battle feild, where you have to think very tacticaly on positioning and keeping your resource (Mana) in check to use special move against your enemy.\n\nNow remember this game is still pretty new and it was made in a different country so of course there are going to be some issues, but that dosent mean you should walk away from the game. The team working on this game are actually doing their best to improve the game for others and are always answering questions so dont be afraid to ask too if you get a weird problem accuring.\n\nDrakerz is definitly a game worthy of looking at if you like card games, or even stratagy games and even if you dont it might have some aspects or simplisty that any gamer would like. The best part is that you can play for free with the virtual starter pack and three free drako they give you, even if you go against people who have bought cards you still have a chance to beat them like I have. The cards you get are actually really good and the other cards you can get from the campaign mode only make your deck better. GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE and if you already left it, GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE. I cannot even properly describe how much fun this game can be. Its totally worth it.","June 8, 2014","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It built up from Pokemon, to YGO, to MTG but that was many years ago. This game caught my attention like PS3's Eye of Judgement (which unfortunately I can't find many people to play it, though it may be problems on my end) and feels like it has a bit more strategy to the game. I do like the idea that you are not only able to play the game online with digital or paperback cards, but you can even play with others locally without the computer (though you don't get all that interesting visuals).\n\nI haven't received my physical cards yet, but to what I've seen and heard the artwork has been done very beautifully. I do hope that this game will continue to expand and become the next MTG or at least a worldwide game that will live a long time. I know it's just beginning, but I am hoping to see some interesting new creatures and strategy works for it.\n\nMy final rating: 7/10\nThough the game is great, I feel that there can (and will) be more improvements.  One of the things I would like to see is the game feeling more lively when you're doing combat and going through the phases. And as people do say on the forums, there are still some things needing translating but other than that I think it's off to a decent start. I haven't run into the problem of the launcher not working so I can't say any of my frustrations about that, but I will give this a 9/10 when the game is fully released with all that fixed :)","July 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have to name your "Drako," but it gives no indication in-game or on the site as to if it will be ALL your "Drakos," or just the one. It also doesn't say whether or not you can choose another at any time. So I gave the name I wanted for another one to the one I had.\nEven when choosing a Drako, it says that you have a premium starter... this is false. You don't have anything, so ignore it. You can choose one of the first three, even though none of them seem to be any "better" than the rest.\nBut, forgiving the in-game French (even French error messages on account creation), the only thing I can't stand as far as I've been willing to play, is the end-of-match hissing. The Meleon (their names are awful, by the way) hisses, growls and stomps in an infinite loop on a two-second intereval. It's the same sound, and it repeats until you're totally done reading all the post-match text and move on.","June 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You can play the first newbie tournament, use 3 dragons but obviously without the real cards that you must purchase, there is nothing else for you to do. It is like playing a demo of a game but without the chance to test their AR features without purchasing. It is not a Free to Play, just a demo. Overall I enjoyed playing it until I beat the newbie campaign but nothing else. It has potential but its niche is restricted to the tabletop cards to squeeze it fully. Graphics are OK, sound is glitchy as hell and too repetitive, gameplay is enthralling but nothing else beyond that. Purchase the cards and enjoy the tournaments and unlocked potential you can't enjoy for free.","February 1, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's be honest, this game is not really a free to play.\n\nHowever, I really like it ! I follow the game since his very beginning and I always had fun and a real challenge playing it, even with my basic cards.\n\nYes you may have to pay if you want to unlock the full story mode (doesn't interest me) or having cards a bit faster and I agree with people complaining about that, it's a kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part.\n\nBUT what if I told you there is an other way to win cards ? The playable story parts give you cards when winning, 1 for each completion and actually only like 10 free but it's a good start.\nThen practice against people and take part of an online tournaent, 1 each hours and saturday's tournaments winner earns a virtual booster.\n\nThis game is not totally free-to-play, the way to have more cards is either money, either skill, I personally do have the second one and I'm waiting for some challengers.\n\nPS: the game freaking need an active community, lobbies are empty as hell :/","January 27, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
