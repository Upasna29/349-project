Originally released back in 1992, I played this to death for over 2 years virtually every day for hours at  a time. IMO it's still one of the best  and very underrated RPG's ever released, with a depth that most RPG's never attain.  With three levels of game play, a traditional text based adventure, a map based movement system and a Gauntlet/Baldurs  like  battle system.  With the whole of  15th century  Germany which included  Poland and other outlying  present day coutries you've got a massive area to explore (over the  period I played it, I still hadn't visited every city and  at least  50% of the missions were left unexplored.\n\nI never thought  Darklands would  end up in Steams library considering the games age.   It  was one of the first RPG's I ever played that I throughly enjoyed and is one of those games   that's almost impossible to complete if you like exploring every point on  the main map, so this is more of a discussion rather than a review of a completed game.  It may appear that I've only played this  game for a few hours, but that's just my Steam version.\n\nThe game was originally released back in 1992.   With three levels of game play, including a text based system for making basic choices for example going to the cathedral to learn about a new saint or going to  the alchemist   to learn about  a new potion or to buy rare  chemicals, or to find   new quests from the local branch of the Hansiatic Leage or the Templars,  There was also  a map for movement  around Europe.  you could choose to go  to some cities directly from the ports if the  city was located on a large river or coastal region, otherwise you'd have to brave the   routes on the map. you could of course  stray from the  known routes, but you were more likely to  be attacked by  unsavory outlaws, robber knights, withces etc.  The third   and most interesting part of the game was the  Gauntlet/Baldurs  like battle system. When this was released it was a breath of fresh air compared to the games I was playing at the time.  I spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours creating characters and exploring the large map that covered most of medieval Europe. It had one of the most complex character customisation schemes I've ever found in a game that to my knowledge has never been surpassed by any game. All the weapons, armour, magic and saints were heavily researched by the developers and most of the content was based on true accounts of life  back in Medieval Europe.   The magic system was largly alchemical in nature and used  the chemicals of the time such as Oil of Vitriol (Sulphuric Acid) Aqua Regia (nitric and hydrochloric acids), plumbago (graphite) and saltpeter (Potassium Nitrate) as well as many more.  These were mixed in various  combinations to create potions   that  could heal yourself and/or your team whereas others could hinder  or harm  your enemies.  The effectivness of these potions also  depended  on  your alchemical  abilities, which could be improved by either practicing alchemy or  paying for knowledge from a local alchemists. I f your Alchemy was low (all attributes had a range of 1 to 100 apart from the main ones such as Strength, Agility, Stamina,  Intelligence), you stood a good chance of  failing to make the potions you were  trying to create and you could even  lose health  if the concotion exploded.  The game also leaned heavily on the lore and superstitions of the time the game was set in, with witches, werewolves,  the Hansiatic League, Templars, robber knights and  other denizens of the dark ages. It's a brilliant game that  I never expected to see  on Steam (It's also available as a drm free copy via GOG).\n\nWith the whole of  15th century  Germany which encompassed  Poland and other outlying  present day coutries you've got a massive area to explore (over the  period I played it, I still hadn't visited every city and  at least  50% of the missions were left unexplored).\n\nThere's   the usual character customisation, though there are a lot more attributes to consider as well as  character improvement and  the actual battles against witches, robber barons, magical beasts, werewolves, and  encounters with less violent, but still demanding  characters such as bishops who demand tolls to pass their path.   You'll  pick up loot from your fallen victims as well as gold, which is then used to buy items from the various outlets.  Upgrading your armour or  buying more effective weapons from the armouries, or buying much needed  ingredients to craft  more healing potions, or other useful  alchemical  concotions, or getting blessed by various saints in the monstries and cathedrals, or  being trained in  various crafts of the time.  All of which cost  money;  using  the monetary system of the period i.e.  pfenniges, groschen and florins.  You can  pick up missions via  text based  meetings in the local hostelry, or  from  meetings with various  guilds and religious places. Each  having different mission types.\n\nThis game despite its age can still enthrall a dedicated RPG player  especially if you love  real history as this game is heavily steeped in the lore and beliefs of the time.  The selection of weapons is immense, the  ability to craft  different potions whether for healing or for battle are massive, but they aren't easy to  attain right away.   You'll need to spend many hours playing the game and  improving your characters abilities to be able to  create  some of the  alchemical formula that  are required to  progress  through some of the many missions available in this game. Each town you visit you can purchase the ingredient to craft your potions, or visit an alchemist to gain  more skill so as to create better and more effective potions or to visit  the local churches, monasteries or cathedrals to  train in the religious beliefs of the time and  thereby  gain more saintly help (these include healing prayers, and  temporary  skill improvements during battle).  There's a list of saints as long as  your arm that you can choose from, each one having their own distinct characteristics.  You won't find all of the saints in each town either.  You'll need to visit virtually every holy place in  Germany to  be able to usitilise them all.\n\nThere's so much more to this game.  Don't let the very dated  graphics put you off this game; once you've got  several missions under your belt and have improved your  groups skills to the point where you can   be effective, the game starts to become a lot deeper.\n\nAlso the Steam version includes  a copy of the original 107 page manual, which is one of the most in depth manuals  from that era that you could possibly wish for; with descriptions of all of the weapons, armor,   ingredients,  potion recipes  and prayers that are available in game as well as historical background and tips on how to get the most out of this game.  Every aspect of the game is detailed in those pages.   They have scanned the original and added it to  a pdf document, which is accessible from the right hand menu under links on the games library page,\n\nYou can see some Darklands game play HERE, HERE and HERE","October 17, 2014","true","3.5"," 305 of 323 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","305","323","3","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/327930/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Darklands is one of the most unique, deep and innovative RPGs of all time. One of the first games to feature an open world, it is also notable for its setting - a mostly accurate depiction of the 15th c. Holy Roman Empire. I say mostly, because within this game, creatures of medieval myth and Germanic folklore are depicted as being real, so the woods are full of monsters, witches pose a grave threat, and dragons (who are, of course, servants of Satan) ravage the land from time to time, requiring that a band of brave heroes lock them back up to await the Second Coming, or, more likely, die in the attempt. For the most part, though, gameplay involves travelling across the world, fighting monsters, bandits and robber barons while doing the odd job for a village schulz or Medici banker.\n\nGameplay consists of three distinct components - travelling across the world on the overworld map, choose-your-own-adventure style events within towns and dungeons, and combat encounters/dungeons that take place on a smaller scale tactical map. The dungeons can be a pain to navigate at first, as the characters move painfully slowly and the pathfinding is about as good as you'd expect for a game from 1992.\n\nThe game mechanics are quite complex and involved, and though they might seem a bit impenetrable at first glance, everything feels quite good once you understand how it works. As suits the setting, the player characters (as decent servants of Christ) have no access to traditional RPG magic - instead, your supernatural abilities involve dabbling in alchemy to produce potions with spectacular effects and praying to Catholic Saints for intervention. Improving these abilities involves tracking down new formulae and getting lessons in hagiography at the local cloister, respectively. These are quite easily the game's most obtuse mechanics, and I'd say that there's no shame in looking up a guide for information on which of the game's seemingly endless number of saints do what exactly, and what the stat requirements are to call upon their aid, or how alchemy even works in the first place.\n\nLike any good RPG, as well, this game offers plenty of opportunities for roleplaying, as well as the ability to make choices, moral and otherwise. However, the right answer most often isn't what's the most sensible to you, the player, but what would be most sensible to a medieval German Catholic. As a consequence, you can really get into the Deus Vult mindset in this game, slaughtering whole villages for disrespecting the mass and playing toady to the Church hierarchy. There is a storyline to complete as well, involving Satan, the Knights Templar, the Wild Hunt and the witches' black Sabbath, though that's something that's likely to emerge only after you've proceeded rather far along in the sandbox.\n\nIf you're the sort of person that can enjoy hardcore, old-school RPGs, I would recommend this game with every fibre of my being.","July 28, 2015","true","37.5"," 80 of 82 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","80","82","5","2"

I like it so much, I bought it the second I saw it on Steam, even though I still have a working original copy. This is not your usual fantasy RPG. It takes place in a painstakingly detailed medieval Germany (which, in terms of RPGs, actually comes off as far more exotic than the dozens of Tolkien/D&D inspired worlds we've seen over the years.) Younger players will probably be a bit lost at first, as the game lacks the kind of comprehensive interface you see in more modern titles. It's the kind of game you played with the map taped to the wall & a notebook at your desk. It would benefit hugely from a remake, in my opinion, like the one they did with Sid Meier's Pirates several years ago. At any rate, I'd say it's worth picking up if you have some patience & want to experience a classic.","December 4, 2014","true","47.3"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/recommended/327930/","thewizardkiller","The Chosen One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/","115 products in account","An RPG from Microprose that, to my knowledge, was the only RPG Micropose ever released. And you know what? It may not have aged well, as in at all, but oh, how it puts some games to shame! Basically, one of the earliest examples, if not *the* earliest example, of an open-ended Role-Playing Game, you have everything you could want just about in this one package!\n\nCharacter creation: Whoo, boy! This game has a very complex, but very fun and interesting, character creation system. While you only have so much to choose from for your character's sprite, the real fun comes from choosing which skills you want each party member to have. For example, want to have a well-balanced party like the game manual suggests? Go right ahead. Want a party full of big strong warriors who are dumb as a bucket of rocks but can wear all armor and wield heavy weapons without breaking a sweat? You can do that. Maybe you want to have just one character to be an alchemist and have the rest be what would be considered in many modern RPGs as a "paladin," nothing is going to stop you. Now, having said that, there is no "traditional class" system, it all depends on your characters attributes and skills, and you can alter them (within reason) to your liking. There is no "true" right-or-wrong party here.\n\nOpen-ended Sandbox: When this game, and anyone else who's played it says "Wide open-ended sandbox gameplay", they aren't kidding. To give you some small idea, your whole party always meets at the inn of some random city in the game, and their main goal in life is to bring honor and glory to their names, and to avoid evil and do good. After you've spent some time in your party's starting city killing bandits and building up their reputation and skills, you're ready to head out into the wide-open world... of Midieval Germany (which isn't really a world, it's just a country) and pick any random direction and begin travelling, fighting bandits, raubritters (robber knights) and witches and devils left, right, and center, with hardly any story, and you have this game pretty much. Trust me on this, though; it's much more fun than it sounds.\n\nMusic: For music, there's not that much, but for what there IS, you can almost immediately tell by how the music sounds in a particular situation what is about to happen. For example, if you're near a dragon's lair, the music becomes creepy, ominous. In towns, the music gives off a sense of peace. If you get attacked by bandits, the music sounds like something's about to jump out and attack you which, more often than not, will.\n\nI don't know if there's too much else to say about the game, other than it mixes RPG elements with Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books, and with the beautiful hand-drawn artwork, could you blame them? Now, yes, the game DOES have it's shortcomings, like being slow, and the game sometimes being rigged against the player, and the copy-protection kicking you out of the game if you should choose the wrong answer, but other than that, it's a game that if you really needed something to do, then I honestly can't recommend it enough. But if you're coming to this game looking for character-development and a good story, as much as I'm ashamed to say, you won't find it here.\n\nI'll leave with this: Darklands was, basically, the Midieval German Elder Scrolls version of Ultima III: Exodus. If you like either of those games, then I feel certain that you'll like this one, as well\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","169.7"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","28","28","2","2"

Darklands set my personal standard of character development, opportunities to explore, battles, and survival.\n\nOverall (TL;DR): It is worth buying for $10 (USD) or less.\n\nCharacter Development: You have one real goal in the game, build a legacy.  Yes, there are quests and missions that ulitmately are important, but they are only the means by which you build your reputation.  The game doesn't end with completing the final storyline quest.  The character build provides variety for experimentation. (Other reviews provide indepth reviews of the begining build system.)\n\nExplore and Battle:  You are in medieval Germany wandering the towns, villages, countryside. You encounter pilgrims, nobles, bandits, robber barons, heretics, witches, wolves, fey folk, and more; helping or harming as you decide. I recommend staying in your initial town until you build up a respectable reputation 0by the local population before wandering elsewhere. Magic is in the form of Religion through prayer to various saints that may not answer your prayers to the use of Alchemy to create potions.\n\nSurvival: Death is normal and expected in Darklands. The intial crew you build may not be the crew you finish with. The fights are not scaled to the characters. If you just started the game and attack a robber baron, I am glad you remebered to save your game. Wait, you didn't? Oh, well. Enjoy building more characters. In fact, your people get older with time and can retire or die of old age.\n\nDownsides: It is an old MS-DOS game which means it is not the fastest, most spectacular thing created. It takes time to develop and build the characters, no instant levels to awesome.\n\n","August 20, 2015","true","6.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

However, there is a quickstart guide in it. Also, At the time of writing, there is one user-made guide on steam and I recommend you read that too. The game can be hard sometimes and character creation takes a lot of time and some characters can die easily.\nThe graphics are as basic as they gan get and the font is hard to read (unless you play minecraft and you're used to it). Still, the images at text-menu's are amazing.\n\nThe game consists mainly of text-based gameplay, but the combat is semi turn based.\nOne of the most interesting things of darklands is its character creation system. You get to choose their name, their nickname, gender, in what family they were born in and what jobs they had in their life. What jobs you choose for them will increase certain skills and how many skill points you can add to those skills.\nIf a character dies or you want to get rid of him, you can visit an inn and let a party member retire or make a new one.\n\nIn games like command and conquer you usely end up building an army of tanks and roll them into the enemy camp.\nBut now you only have 4 characters, So you need to be carefull with making decisions\nYou can control each character individually in combat.\nyou can make them flee, use a certain attack strategy (parry,berserk) Make them throw a potion or make them surrender.\n\nDarklands does have a lot of features and encounters\nWhen traveling you can encounter bandits, or maybe some merchants you can trade with and a ton of other things\nIn a City you can sleep in an Inn, But if you're low on money you can also sleep in a park or an abadoned house.\nMerchants can give you information about hidden treasures and you can find people who can help you raise some of your characters skills.\nThe world-map is huge, With a lot of historical towns and city's. Each city has his own unique places and quests.\n\nThe only thing i dislike about it is that it is hard to get in to.\nCharacter creation takes a long time, and there's a good change your party gets turned into dogfood by a group of local thugs if your party isn't optimized. Also, you can't overwrite save's you made earlier, so you need to delete some old save's at some point to prevent the list from flooding.\n(tLike i said at the beginning, there is a guide at steam which can help you with the difficult character creation)\n\nIf you like RPG's with a lot of detail and don't mind old graphics, this game is for you.\n\n(update) The game runs slow, but you can fix this by simple pressing ctrl + f12 a bunch of times and it will run faster.\n\n\n(Sorry for my bad english)","October 31, 2014","true","25.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

And it might just be nostalgia talking, but one of the best RPGs ever put out. It does not have classes, you simply make a character and add to attributes & skills, choosing to age them for more life experience (Careers)  at the cost of all the troubles that come with age. The only complaint I ever had about the game was the font used, it can be hard to read at times. I figured this would be somewhat different than running the game in DOSBox when I got it on Steam but it seems to run it in DOSBox anyway.  Combat is similar to Baldur's Gate with the exception of the magic element being alchemy, so you create and throw potions.\n\nThis game is not fast paced, so those with ADD should probably skip it but for those who love a great genuine RPG, this one if definitely worth a try.\n\nSo here is hoping they add more great oldies on Steam (Master of Magic & Heretic anyone?).","October 19, 2014","true","0.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I love the setting of 15th century Germany, something you don't see modern RPGs doing, due to weird modern ideas of what an RPG has to be.   There are no wizards, but rather alchemists.  The creatures you run into are all creatures that people at the time would have believed in.  There is no Story, but rather a quest to gain fame and fortune, kind of like Mount & Blade.  I must admit, I loved traveling the land to destroy the servants of evil, including demons, witches, and other monsters.  Compared to most games from the time, the game is fairly accessable, I figured out what to do, and how things worked within the first few hours of play.  The character creation is rather interesting, allowing you to choose your stats and background through intervals of 5 years of the character's life.   The older the character, the weaker he will be, and he may even die, so you will have to choose between a wise, old character with a bunch of skills, or a young adventurer with less skills, who will probably have better attributes.  This is more of a sandbox than a traditional RPG, and I have had tons of fun with it.\n\nNow, onto the few negatives.   If you have a problem with older graphics, this may not be for you, but most of the time you navigate the world through text screens with lovely backdrops.  This game does expect you to think, and you may want to read the manual(or at least skim for the controls).  As a matter of fact, you will have to go into the Steam directory for the game at least once, due to an old anti-piracy mechanic.  You have to answer a question about alchemical symbols that can be found on random pages.  In my experience, I have only had to do it once.  The game also starts off quite slow, which does not bother me personally.  Sometimes, you may gain negative reputation for something silly, like constantly pestering the lord of a city, but you generally figure out the way you should behave in this society.  If you want constant action and combat, and don't enjoy the roleplay aspect of games, you may want to pass on this game.","October 28, 2014","true","19.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Darklands is the result of such geniuses trying their hand at an RPG.\n\nFeatures:\n\nA massive open world, in medieval Germany, with historically accurate towns, names, geography, economy, and so on. Everything is simulated in an extremely complex way, the world is very alive. The game was so complex, it actually required 5000 hours of testing, and even after that several patches were needed. The version on Steam is the latest and best one, of course.\n\nThe game comes with a 100 page manual, edited with painstaking detail, to get the player into a medieval German mood, and teach a thing or two about history. And another 100 page Clue Book, which explains the highly complex mechanics of the game, besides adding even more to the mood.\n\nVery interesting classless, XPless character system. Creating a good party is by far the most complex and fun activity, compared to other RPGs (yes, even Wizardry). The characters are alive and the game always has something in the bag, to make them feel even more so and provide them with fun ways, to show off their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA subtle and mysterious story, which requires the party to pay attention to small details, investigate, intrigue and fight their way through. Completing the game requires around 100 hours, but the player is allowed to take their time and progress at their own pace, so it can offer way more than that. New players will probably restart several times, once they're more familiar with the very unorthodox RPG system and world of the game, to create a more capable party of adventurers.\n\n\nDarklands is not an easy game to get into, due to its complexity, but dedicated RPG players, especially historically inclined ones, will find a true gem, and a fun adventure, which can be replayed every few years.","August 13, 2015","true","41.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It was actually a very enjoyable process, however. Still, I think I have a pretty good idea of the basic gameplay and will adjust my review as I progress through the game.\n\nLikes:\n-Historical accuracy, with a bit of folklore mixed in. Decisions and choices can be made based on your knowledge of the period. If you don't have knowledge in this period of time, check out the last half of the 50MB manual, which can be accessed from your library or from a .pdf in the game directory.... it will tell you most of what you need to know.\n-Depth. There are a ton of places to go, and numerous quests and activitys to perform.\n-No hand holding. There is no such thing a quest marker or any type of quest tracking available in the vanilla game. As such you have to read carefully and ensure you record important information manually.\n-Original game rules.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are dated.\n-The combat, in my personal opinion, is one part of the game that it is difficult to adjust to. Not only does it look more dated than the rest, but it feels dated. This is the one part of the game that i have not enjoyed thus far, we will see if this improves as I get further into the game.\n-The default party is not very well built. This means that to get the most out of your characters you pretty much have to spend an hour or so building a party before you can play the game. I found it fun, many won't. There is a fantastic guide on steam that will help with this though.\n-The lack of a quest marker is fantastic, but the lack of a quest book can be tough to adjust to.\n\nOf note:\n-I find that the game runs very poorly in both Dosbox and Dosbox DAUM, very poor response times when clicking on buttons. To combat this, I found that running the game in a smaller window in Dosbox DAUM improved the response time of various actions by a considerable margin. I am using a 1920x1080 display.\n\n-The games graphics can be improved by following some simple guides in the forums. Don't expect too much, but it does help.\n\n-When you create a new party, it does not auto equip there equipment like it does with the default party. I thought this was a bug at first, but you have to manually equip equipment for newly created characters. Use 'a' to equip from the equipment menu in your inventory.\n\nThats about it! Pretty bummed out I missed this game in my younger years. (Edit Spelling)","December 13, 2014","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Explore medieval Germany. Magic is not common, and the world is portrayed as believable and historic, with supernatural elements being more of a part of the traditional lore (witches, hell-hounds, forest spirits etc.).\n\nInstead of real magic, your party uses alchemy with similar effect (throw fireball potions, throw gas potions etc.).\nIf you have a religious person in your group, they can call upon a prayer that helps out (Calm animals, solve threats peacefully, increase your awareness of things in text dialogue etc.)\n\nCombat is the predecessor of Baldurs Gate "Pause & Play" system. Works pretty well when you think this was made in 1992. You should use keyboard shortcuts however. Also, don't give your guys orders to move to locations that are too far away -> the pathfinding is really bad.\n\nOverall, if you like pen & paper RPG, and you can bear with the oldschool interface and graphics, this is still a great game.\n\n\nSome tips for the start:\n\n-Move back and forth between locations in your starting city at night. This will trigger bandit encounters, that help you get some money and level up some weapon skills.\n\n-Start with the default party, then remove all their equipment and give it one person. Create your own 3 characters, take the equipment and redistribute. Then drop the 4th premade character and swap it for your 4th custom character. Makes the start of the game much easier (which I find a bit too harsh).\n\n-Write down any offers you accepted, like quests / tasks. There is no quest log.\n\n-Set the party leader according to the situation: If you are bartering in a shop, set your best speaker as party leader (=best prices). If you are exploring on the world map, set your best scout as leader, so you get informed ahead of possible encounters.\n\n-Save OFTEN. There is no real leveling system that matches you against fair opponents. You might run into real hard enemies, especially at the start of the game. Like encountering a pack of hell-hounds that slaughter you without mercy.","May 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The problem with Darklands is actually learning what it going on, the writing is so pixelated that you can barely read any of it. From the sentences that i could make out, I learnt that it is a choose your own adventure story which I love, a classic game with a choose your own adventure story, brilliant I'm going to love this......but you cant because you cant read anything. You try and try to read the words listed on the notice board but you cant read anything, I hope that someone come's along and decides to update this old diamond in a rough because it seems amazing.......if only you could actually play the game.\n\nIm sorry from the 18 minutes i played it was somewhat fun, but you cant really play the game, because you cant read anything:( I wanted to love it, please update with a more readable font and then i will come back and say how great it is because it feels amazing, but you just cant play the game:(","September 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"
