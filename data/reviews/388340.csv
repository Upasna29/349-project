Here's a list of pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n-Simple and Fun game\n-Good level structure\n-A bit of challenge\n\nCons:\n-Some of the white blocks blend in with the back ground which makes it hard to see where to land or go.\n-Some of the parts of some levels take a longer time and get quite frustrating.\n\nOther wise, this is a cheap and a fun game. Definitely worth your 50¢!\n\n-Note to author\n\nCongrats on your first game! It's great to see that a simple game like this that actually fun. I'd rather play this than some very buggy and broken game. Keep up with your good work!","July 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 85 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","85","111","9","6"

It's an addictive little game but by God the amounts of unholy rage brought forth by playing this game will leave you broken and beat. After about 40 minutes of straight playing it i decided to take a little rest, because i was about to walk outside and punch the first person i see even if it was a little old lady in the 80's or a toddler just playing about in the street after about. After an hour i decided to have  another go at this level only to my surprise my progress was not saved then i found out there was no way to save...this drove me insane. After bringing myself to play a little more i got stuck on one of the simple levels to complete this was the end for me. But all that aside cool little rage game to make you want to punch toddlers 10/10","July 28, 2015","true","1.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","86","18","21","18","0"

I am colorblind, and I was consistently confused with the textures in the game. This resulted in many deaths.\n\nNot only that, but the terrible music which just loops every 30 seconds is very dull. Mute the game and listen to some YouTube video featuring any of Beethoven's music and you'll get the same thing.\n\nLastly, the platforming and gameplay is very dull. I found the gravity to be very uncomfortable.","November 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
