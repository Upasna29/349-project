The animated video is a bit choppy, the gameplay is not smooth, overall it looks a bit fuzzy due to the low resolution of the graphics, and the conversation flow is a clunky.  Just be prepared for all that.\n\nOn the good side, it is a fairly enjoyable puzzler.  The makers mixed in some real history and rituals into the game, so that is an added bonus.\n\nIf you can get it on a sale, I think it would be worth picking up.","June 30, 2014","true","6.4"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

The puzzles may seem easy to someone who plays adventure games a lot, and do lack that element of obtuse adventure-game-developer-logic, but a few puzzles do require some actual knowledge of Egyptian mythology on the player's part. The ending does seem a little abrupt, and at 5 hours it may seem a little stumpy, but it keeps up a nice pace and doesn't wear out its welcome.\n\nThe game doesn't look horrible for its age, and though the voice acting threw me a little at the beginning, you get used to it fairly easily. It's also nice to see that effort was made with name pronounciations, unlike most games that handle any names other than English.\n\nDefinitely try it out if you're into Egypt-themed stuff; maybe if you're on the fence about adventure games, too.\nAlso if you're looking for a game with some decent female characters - it's refreshing to play a game with a female protagonist, in which her gender isn't an issue.","October 24, 2014","true","5.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

This game is surprizingly accurate in many respects! It got the mythology right, which you do sometimes tend to see in games set in Egypt ... but more importantly it got the "everyday life" aspect right (which you NEVER see). The devs really did their research on this game, and it's highly appreciated!!  The houses are laid out properly, the material culture is right down to the feathers on the floor and the pottery styles. Even the spells you cast are taken from ancient stories. This makes it one of the only entertainment pieces (games, movies, etc) set in ancient Egypt that has kept me entirely immersed. And I admit I'm hard to please in that aspect - my friends tend to think of me a "spoil sport" when movies or games "get things wrong".\n\nAside from that, the game is simply a lot of fun. It's challenging WITHOUT PIXEL HUNTING (because, amazingly, I guess people realized that this was possible), but it never had me so stumped that I was pulling my hair out.\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game if you're in to either point and click or puzzles. And if you're not but you like this time era, pick it up anyway. $5 is very worth it. $2 even more so if you get it on sale!\n\nP.S. Also in answer to one of the previous reviews - I don't get seizures, but I do get very frequent migraines. While blurring in other games (and Vsync - I hate Vsync so much, it causes so much ppaaaaiinnnn) do cause issues.... I didn't actually have a problem or notice the blurring in the cut scenes. In terms of migraine sufferers, it should be fine :)\n\nP.P.S. If you're like me and played Egypt 1156 b.c. Tomb of the Pharaoh as a kid ... just buy this and try it out. The nostalgia is intoxicating. :D","February 5","true","31.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Many puzzles that not too easy to solve are main part of a game and there are beautiful concept arts though this game is quite old.

Surprisngly, it also has a mini-encyclopedia in-game that covers various topics on Egyptian culture/history. Overall, the game turned out to be better than expected.\n\nTo access the interface in-game, right click your mouse, and the gold button with the x-mark will bring you to the main menu where you can save.

Despite reading some bad comments about it here, since I love this type of games of "point and click" adventures, I decided to give it a try.

This type of game is not created very often these days, so I really have to turn to the older ones... Some of the puzzles are really cool (if you like Egyptian history, you will like the details), and I didn't find any of them particularly hard (maybe because I'm used to these games).

The game provides history and game notes in the menus, and after reading it all of the religiousy stuff made more sense. And there were a lot of religiousy stuff. Priests, Gods, Magic, Rituals, Potions, etc. I'm not an Egyptologist, so I don't know how much of it was fictionalized, however, the cities, gods, and historical figures seemed to be real.\n\nThe graphics were decent for 2004 and the cutscenes were above average. The voice acting was hit or miss. I thought the female characters' voices were excellent.\n\nThe "find stuff" parts of the game was frustrating. I cheated a few times by Googling where item 'x' was located, because I felt stupid wasting so much time traveling from room-to-room while hovering the mouse cursor over every object to see if it was interactive.\n\nMost of the puzzles were on the easy side except for a couple of brain teasers.\n\nThe last boss battle was the hardest part. That's because the rules to the mini-game weren't completely explained.\n\nIf the above sounds like your cup of tea, wait for a Steam sale. That's how I bought it. At the low price, expectations were low, and the "pleasant surprise" was high.","April 13, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was really not as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, the graphics are dated and the voice-acting not really top-notch, but I enjoyed the Egyptian theme and atmosphere it had going.\n\nYou play an Egyptian priestess in first person trying to save the Pharaoh by stopping a curse. You gain spells throughout the game to help you on your way.\nThe movement took a short while to get used to, the 'hitbox' of moving to next place was not intuitive and the arrow was smaller than expected, but when you get used to it, it should be no problem.\n\nIt's pure point&click game, and it has a lot of backstory. If you're into mythology/Egypt you should enjoy it. The game gives you a lot of info about the theme on files you can read if you so wish. I don't think any non-usable items were clickable and the game is almost too 'clean' so it's rare to get lost or stuck.\n\nNot the best p&c ever, but not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. I encountered no bugs and only had to look up a couple of things on a guide to get me through.\nNot sure if it was a bug, but using 'clairvoyance' on some people makes Maya say "I see... a donkey" which was overly amusing to me.\n\nWorth buying as part of a bundle with some better games or on high discount sale.","May 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, I do enjoy point and click games, just not this one as much as others. Maybe if the voice overs sounded less American it would of been better to listen to. And even better if it was all spoken in an unknown Egyptian language which forced the user to read subtitles. I am picky, I know. Oh well, what do you expect from a 2004 game.

Got it on a coupon, and saw that it didn't have a whole lot of positive reviews. It was enough to keep me from playing it for several months. After finishing it, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis is an obscure, weird little game. Rather than put most of its focus on narrative, like most point-and-click titles, this seems balanced in all aspects, though the story is still quite fine. It's a mystery that manages to stay exciting by avoiding realism as often as possible. The main points are easy to follow due to the fact that the game drives them into the ground like it's a Dragon Ball Z episode. The story is supported by decent voice acting and most of the puzzles are not so easy as to be boring, but not so hard as to warrant breaking out a guide. The music is smooth and fitting of the theme.\n\nThe environments are open and only have a few locations in which there is nothing to do. Every spot the player can stand in allows a full 360 degree rotation to observe your surroundings, which often lack detail but don't waste time with a lot of pointless clutter. It is usually easy to have a sense of where to go, and I found the direction-based click controls to not be very misleading. I wish I could say that the characters looked fine too, but they look like a bunch of PS1 cutscene models. The prerendered cutscenes here look a little better than the actual game.\n\nAside from the game,this also has a bit of info about Egyptian mythology and legends, if you're into that sort of thing, which might be why you decided to take a look in the first place. Overall, it manages to just be an average point and click that knows how to play to the strong points of its genre.","March 27, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
