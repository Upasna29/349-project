You won't regret it.***\n\nAs a long time fan of the Stronghold series, this game was such a let down.  Yes, it is *technically* a Stronghold game, and it technically is the sequel to Crusader, but overall it is not even close to being on par with the rest of the series.\n\n--First, the Good--\n\nAt its core, the concept of Stronghold is still the same here.  You'll start off building a settlement, gathering resources via a supply chain, ultimately crafting weapons to arm a force of soldiers.\n\nThere are familiar units: Archers, Macemen, Crossbowmen (Crusader).  Horse Archers, Slaves, Assassins(Arabic)..as well as some new ones, including the Healer and many other Arabic mercenaries not previously seen. You can build walls, towers, siege weapons and all sorts of defense mechanisms for keeping the black knight at bay.On top of that, many familiar faces return, such as The Rat, Richard the Lionheart and more.\n\nThe game is, of course, a 3d Model game, bringing the Crusader series at least one generation ahead.\n\nAnd...that's about it.  Honestly.  If you were a fan of the original series, it may warm your heart to actually have some new Stronghold content to play with, but there really isn't anything new and exciting here.\n\n--Now, the Bad...where do I begin?--\n\nFirst of all, the game is somewhat broken.  There are plenty of times where characters models won't animate, and it's not uncommon for characters to simply float across the map in the standard model "christ pose" without any animation.  Even the oxen who carry the stone in the game would freeze when moving on an angle.  Stone walls are another mess.  Too often, staircases would end up with a wall piece right in the middle of them, creating a strange unrealistic graphical error.  These are only some of the visual phenomenen that occur while playing.\n\nThat brings me to another issue...wall building.  Not only do walls cost way too much in this game, but there is pretty much no room for creativity when building your castle.  In the original/Crusader 1, you had so much control over every little aspect of your wall design.  You could build walls of all different heights, staircase pieces, granulated walls all down to the very last square.  This gave us castle builders so much of a blank canvas that virtually anything was possible if we knew how to use those pieces the right way.\n\nIn Crusader 2, 90% of the wall building is done for you when clicking.  A wall piece is pre-built for you to include parapits on one side, a wall space, and parapits on the opposite side.  You can no longer just build a simple piece of stone wall, the basic building block (almost literally) of the original series' castle building element.  Sure, you can add towers and all kinds of siege weaponry, but the fun and joy of really creative a keep down to the last detail is completely lost here.\n\nThe cost of walls adds to another huge gripe with this game...balance.  It's my understanding that a patch has re-balanced some of the economy issues, but the game is still WAY too unbalanced when trying to get your city up and running.  Too often I find myself running out of resources right at the beginning of a match, even when set to give myself a huge advantage over my AI counterparts.  For example, a windmill in this game costs 200 wood.  In the original? 20.  So it costs literally 10 times as much here.  That would be fine, except woodcutters don't harvest 10 times as much wood here.  They harvest roughly the same amount as before.\n\nThis leads to a TON of waiting around to gather resources right from the git-go of any match.  Sure, there was always that element in the original (as with any RTS), but there is a considerable difference here.  I feel like I'm not getting anywhere, even though I have what would otherwise be the basics of a civilization in place.\n\nAh, civilization...a thriving, breathing melting pot of people going about their daily lives, each contributing to their society in their own way, all while maintaining their own unique personality...yeah, Stronghold Crusader 1 was a fantastic game.  Say goodbye to that here.\n\nI mean, sure...you get to see the workers doing what they do in 3D, but it's not the same.  Peasants say NOTHING when you click on them.  No Monty Python-esque man impersonating a woman "morning your lordship!" or "no taxes is good taxes, that's my motto!", just silence.  No adding flowers, maypoles, dancing bears, gauntlets, guillotines, stretching racks...good/bad popularity control is just gone.\n\nSpeaking of voices (ha), this might be one of the most dissapointing aspects of Crusader 2, and I honestly didn't see it coming.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is TERRIBLE.  I mean that in every sense of the word.  I have friends who can do cooky voices that would have been better candidates.\n\nA great example is the men-at-arms.  Remember the way they sounded in Stronghold 2?  They were dopey lummixes, and rightfully so given their rank.  Or how about their original counterpart, the spearmen?  They were rough, working class fighters ready to stick a spear in whatever you tell them to.\n\nHere's what I want you to do:  We're gonna do a test.  I want you to read the next sentence I say in quotes out loud.  Don't use any exciting voice, or cooky impersonation, or anything.  Use your normal speaking voice.  Ready?  Okay, say this out loud:\n\n"Man at arms, ready.  Close ranks."\n\nCongratulations!  You've just landed a gig providing voice over work for a video game!\n\nThe level of enthusiasm in these vocal takes can only be described as the bare minimum.  Without trying to be funny, I've found myself honestly wondering if they simply had one of the programmers provide voices.  As annoying as he was, we all have to admit that at least The Rat had a memorable personality.  His voice has now been replaced with some Joe Everyguy off the street.  You'll forget him as soon as you end the game.\n\nTo be fair, I need to point something else out, though, about the voice over work, and that's that there are a lot of recycled vocal takes from previous games.  Archers still sound like archers, crossbowmen like crossbowmen, etc.  However, it's about 50/50 as far as which characters use the classic voices, and which use Joe Everyguy.\n\nIt might sound petty to be so bitter about this, but as (I'm assuming, since you've read this far) you are a die-hard Stronghold fan, then you KNOW how important the voices are to this series.  They are the character, the personality and the life of the game!  They're what make you feel like you are controlling living, breathing people of all different sorts, whose lives hang at your fingertips!\n\nThe original games did all of that in spades, and they weren't even 3D rendered!\n\n--The Bottom Line--\n\nI haven't played much of this game, but I'm fairly confident that won't change.  I could go on forever about the other issues that are impossible to ignore (such as the buildings and terrain feeling like they're from two different games), but I feel I've beaten my own horse to death here.\n\nFrom what I gather, a team of less than 10 people programmed this game.  I don't mean this review as offense to them specifically.  They created a game, like they said they would.  They accomplished something that I, of course, haven't...but it's almost like giving credit to Nickelback.  I may hate their music, but at the end of the day they're creating albums and I'm sitting behind my keyboard judging people.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't mean that I have to LIKE Nickelback.\n\nThat was a bad way to end this review. Sorry to take a punch at an easy target.\n\nJudge me all you want for that, just please don't buy this game.  It's something you can't take back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 10, 2015","false","9.0"," 2,421 of 2,606 people (93%) found this review helpful 332 people found this review funny","93","421","2","332","53"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TraceofHatred/recommended/232890/","TraceofHatred","TraceofHatred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TraceofHatred/","52 products in account","Please read on before simply accepting this as another "Yes" review, because this a very mixed opinion. First, I would like to clarify this is from the Point of view of someone who has been playing Stronghold since the first game came out, and has consistently played every single installment to near completion - Aside from Kingdoms, which is mediocre imho. Maybe you'll agree, maybe you won't - Anywho, this is how I felt.\n\nThe Good:\n- Solid skirmish mode, much like older renditions of the game.\n- Very old school Crusader vibe/feeling to it. Remake successful.\n- All of the new units are interesting, aside from the slave driver - Which I don't care for.\n- New Unit special abilities are cool and add depth without overpowering or ruining units.\n- New Siege engines that are also interesting and for the most part useful.\n- Resource caches, Lion Dens, Outposts are all neat additions to the old crusader formula.\n- Varied AI characters like the original and a promise of DLC Lords in the future.\n- Really like the "curtain walls." I was skeptical of them until I used them in a trail mission.\n- Took the good things from SH3 while leaving out most of the bad things.\n- Neutral territory reminds me of the old territory system of SHC.\n- The new buildings (like the wooden barricades for example) are interesting.\n- Genuinely enjoyable game with as much replay value as the original.\n- New ally system where allies mood affects how willing they are to do your bidding.\n- Departure of Free form SH3 buidlings. Return of efficient, grid-based building system.\n- Better physics, especially in regards to arrows - which bounce off and break on walls.\n- More realism, such as troops pulling out pick axes and tools to smash walls down.\n- Beautiful destruction physics. I've gotten into trouble from watching castles go down.\n- Unit costs fixed or improved (Assassins especially brought back to reasonable price!)\n- Much simpler Editor than SH3, albeit still with as many options.\n- Able to play as other lords, and even choose what your lord looks like in skirmish.\n- Buildings change when playing Arabic or Crusader Lords.\n- Genuinely enjoyable game. Can't even lie, I will put 100 hours or more into this, easily.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Stone is completely unbalanced. Walls cost 7 stone just for 1 square\n- So, 100+ to make 15 Tiles of wall! WTF? So even a basic castle is 500 to 1000's of stone.\n- Furthermore, walls also break much quicker - Causing lots of problems in the heat of battle.\n- Buildings have ridiculous costs, which is ridiculously high (200 wood for a Market? Seriously?)\n- Bare, boring, pathetic campaigns - So much for paying $10 extra for "additional campaigns."\n- No campaign is longer than 4 Stages, and the mini campaigns are Only 2 stages long!\n- Cavalry units cannot attack buildings anymore, making them significantly less useful.\n- All of the Special Edition Features (cost an additional 10 dollars) were pathetic at best.\n- Half of the artbook is on the official site for free, and it's only about 20-30 pages.\n- The two mini campaigns take 10 minutes, and the 10 shields speak for itself in lame-ness.\n- Only redeeming thing was the soundtrack. basically you paid 10 dollars for an old OST.\n- Missing the things introduced in SH2 that were memorable, like feasting, honour, etc.\n- While many did not like those features, I feel like the economy is really bare without them.\n- Mediocre Maps. Crusader only had 3 or 4 maps I didn't like, this one has 3 or 4 I do like.\n- Many maps don't have any resources available, or are too unbalanced to enjoy.\n- Pretty much need the Map Editor if you want to have truly good maps.\n- some glitches and crashes, though this is to be expected.\n- pathetic sized unit caps and building caps.\n- At 1 v 1 it's perfectly fine, but even 4 player matches feel very tiny.\n- Bland building selection, needs more towers, bastions, etc. SH3 had so many options!\n- Overpriced with the promise of even more (paid) DLC in the future.\n\nAll in all, I feel like the game as a whole is really good - But I feel like it is horribly overpriced. 50 Dollars is too much. I felt like none of the features I got in my "special Edition" were all that special, and were not worth 10 dollars more. I feel like this game would've been much more fair to be sold at around 20-30 dollars instead (Crusader was 19.99 when I got it on release). Do yourself a favor and try and get it on sale, or at discount - it is a very fun game and I will keep playing, but it is incredibly over priced - Especially the "special edition" which was anything but special.","September 27, 2014","true","107.8"," 582 of 661 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","582","661","15","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/recommended/232890/","razinghel","Dekay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/","734 products in account","Stronghold Crusader 2 is the successor to the successful RTS castle simulation game of the same name from 2002, With a full skirmish mode supporting up to eight total players (including fan beloved AI bots) and all new castle co-op skirmish mode, Crusader 2 is your ticket to castle simulation paradise.\n\nFor new Stronghold players:\nStronghold Crusader 2 is a real time strategy game set during the crusades, it has a stronger focus on combat as the ingame economy has been streamlined from the other Stronghold games. You are charged to provide food and entertainment for your workers who, in turn, form the backbone of your economy. Mine Stone, extract pitch, farm wheat, or chop wood. Once your stockpile has a steady flow of raw goods you are ready to refine them into weapons, drink, or processed food types. A strong economy is mandatory to support an ever growing military.\n\nOn the militant side of the game you have one of the hallmarks of the Stronghold franchise, entirely modular defense system. The map has a grid superimposed upon it which is used to align and place structures. Each wall is placed piece by piece, every tower and gatehouse where you want them. Lay traps such as killing pits and pitch ditches for your enemies and garrison your archers atop your great towers. There are many defensive and offensive tactics to experiment with, sally forth and meet your enemy in the field or bring the fight to your castle and employ traps and tower mounted siege engines to your advantage.\n\nIn skirmish mode the base objective is to kill all enemy lords, although multiplayer games have a greater range of victory conditions. The single player campaign has custom objectives and scripted invasions/events. When Steam Workshop becomes available for Stronghold Crusader 2 players will be able to create and share their own skirmish maps and custom missions.\n\nFor existing Stronghold Crusader HD players:\nThe biggest difference players coming from Crusader HD will notice is the transition to a full 3D game engine. Many of the same units feature in both games but I'll make a note of where they differentiate. Crusader HD fans will also notice a simpler overall economy with many previously gimmicky mechanics streamlined or just removed.\n\nMaps:\n\nThe following times were recorded using the time it took an archer to traverse a flat terrain map and are done on the diagonal (corners: top left to bottom right). Stronghold Crusader 2 has an additional map size and all map sizes for Crusader HD use numbers to represent size (eg 200x200).\n\nStronghold Crusader HDStronghold Crusader 2Map SizeTime in secondsMap SizeTime in secondsTiny20160x16046Small60200x20058Medium100300x30088Large140400x400118Extra Large220\nBuildings:\n\n-Changed! Faith - churches now operate similar to the Granary and needs candles to operate which are built in the chandler's workshop.\n-Changed! Inns have remained largely unchanged but you only need to place one inn now to cover your entire populace.\n-Changed! The Stockpile, Granary, and Armory now have unlimited storage capacity meaning you only need to place one.\n-Changed! Iron Mines now require an Ox Tether much like Stone Quarries\n-Changed! The Market can now be set to auto sell goods when they reach a preset threshold.\n-Changed! each weapon type requires it's own unique workshop.\n-Changed! Tower mounted siege engines can not be placed on stone towers, they incorporate their own wooden tower.\n-Removed! Hunter's Hut, replaced with Pig Farm\n-Removed! Fear Factor has been removed, troops will no longer receive a malus or a boost based on your economy.\n-Removed! While not exactly a building, moats do not feature in the game.\n\nUnits:\n\n-New! Slave Driver - whips nearby slaves into a frenzy\n-New! Healer - units within range slowly regenerate HP\n-New! Whirling Dervish - a poorly armored melee unit with a strong first contact attack\n-New! Sassanid Knight - light knight with special charge attack\n-New! Ranger - proficient with both sword and bow but has poor range\n-New! Sergeant-at-Arms - units within range receive a HP boost\n-New! Conscript - basic weak units, no weapons required to recruit\n-New! Hussite War Wagon - can station units inside, provides protection and mobility\n-New! War Wolf - super catapult\n-New! Burning Cart - creates fire on impact, triggers traps\n-Changed! Spearman now called Man-at-Arms and can throw his spear\n-Changed! Maceman only requires a mace to recruit now\n-Changed! Knight now called Templar Knight and can fight mounted or on foot\n-Changed! Fire Thrower renamed to Oil Pot Thrower\n-Changed! Battering Ram - Can now only destroy Gatehouses\n-Changed! Catapult - can no longer throw diseased animals\n-Changed! Portable Shield renamed to Mantlet\n-Removed! Slinger\n-Removed! Ladderman\n-Removed! Siege Tower\n-Removed! Tunneller\n\nEngineers are no longer recruited but automatically provided if required when recruiting siege engines. Also, due to the 3D engine many of the map tricks previously used to create eye candy are impossible but there are a fair selection of set pieces to add some much welcomed variety.\n\nNote: for those wondering how to access the map editor, go to your steam library dropdown menu and elect to filter your library by Tools. The map editor should show up on the list of utilities as 'Stronghold Crusader 2 Map Editor'. After a small 2MB install you are ready to start map making.\n\nCheck out TotalBiscuit's review of the game on YouTube: http://youtu.be/1lORmgVXOFQ","September 22, 2014","true","73.5"," 662 of 827 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","662","827","4","34"

This changes gameplay massively, as it used to take time to get decent wall defences, because you had to first build the engineers workshop, produce engineers, and build a big enough tower, then build a ballista/mangonel etc on it, and then put your engineers in them for them to function. Now i just buy a bloody ballista tower as soon as the game starts and it begins shooting longrange hail marys from the get go.\nWhat about PIMPING my castle... **** in 2002 i could put flags and the likes around, not in this remake.\nNo EVIL / NICE system in the castle. Gone are the days of building dungeons and setting out heads on spikes to scare your populace ****less so you can tax them etc... this also kills gameplay in a big way, that was so much of the fun!\nHave to agree with most of the other comments.. The WALLS come down like polysterene blocks, so effortlessly and quickly.\nMaps are tiny, one of the only flaws in original also. but its 2014 youd think they could have fixed that!!! Makes it annoyingly irritating to have resources far from castle so you can NEVER fully have your castle emcompass everything. You are always rebuilding or defending your resource buildings out in the middle of nowhere.\nNo more leather armour\nNo info when you scroll over buildings etc\nNo more peasants saying provocative gestures when u click em\nNo tunneling men?? that ive seen\nThe AI keep repeating the same tripe over n over again, its 2014 ! get a heap of new sayings in there not just 1 or 2 !!!\nAI is not improved, they do the same **** over n over again from what ive experienced.\nEconomy is broken. Just build candlestick maker buildings and sell them at market and basically dont have to build any other resource buildings cause you can buy goods at market from candlestick profits!\n\nAhh the list is endless.\n\nTHIS GAME HAS BEEN DUMBED DOWN !!!\n\nIT HAS LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL !!!\n\nGameplay is not even as fun as original !!!!! :(\nIt starts to freeze up on any settings medium or higher... on ultra it sucks as soon as you have over 2 ai one one map.\nNot my pc, i built a high specd rig with 4.8 eight core an 3g graphics card etc... poorly designed game. i run all other games on ultra no probs.\n\nOk, rant over.\n\nGraphics not good, just ok. until it starts to freeze up.\nOnly cool thing was haybale launcher thingy.\nSo if your into firey haybales then fork over all your dough, otherwise DONT BUY !\nI hope they fix this game but i highly doubt it !!!","September 25, 2014","false","5.2"," 1,049 of 1,340 people (78%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","78","049","1","28","56"

Not only that but they took a concept that was really successful and tweaked it just enough to make it suck.  After Stronghold 2 came out I had high hopes.  I really don’t see how the franchise can continue with this big ugly pile of Sh#t staring them in the eye.  I mean, this game is so bad that if I was in a room with Hitler and a copy of this game and they gave me two bullets I would shoot the game twice in the hopes that no fragment of its existence could further taint the outside world.  Who ever made this game I just want you to know…..the day you made this a box of puppies died.  I own all but one of the Stronghold games but I am afraid this will be the last.  I have completely lost faith in them after this.  Here is why…\n\n1. Building a castle is just not possible.  The block segments just don’t want to line up and sometimes when you build  gatehouse it just simply deletes wall segments that would connect it to the wall.  If there is any kind of incline or attitude to the building surface the game cannot compensate and the wall won't close up.\n\n2.  The economics in the game are so F&*%ed they could double as a Call Girl in Bangkok. They tried to make everything more realistic by increasing prices but failed to adjust for it properly.  With a zero growth population one min you have 400 food and the next it is all gone.  Stone, Iron, Wood, and food gather rates all fluctuate or no reason!\n\n3.  Unkillable units.  Sometimes there will be a unit on a wall and it will be in such a position that it will not be visible to archers and your units can't reach it. This means that they can fire at you but you cannot get to them.  I have played the game for 11 hours and already lost 2 assaults in this fashion because the units get confused between two targets and just go back and forth.\n\n4. DLC….so wait, you want me to buy more of your crap after I see this broken POS? I have two words, Get F$%#ed! This is such a pathetic tactic.  If you are a game that is as good as AOE or The Total War Series then yes, you can hold content hostage because the game is good enough!  YOUR GAME ISNT EVEN CLOSE!\n\n\nI got this game on sale for 1/5th the retail price and I STILL regret buying it.  If you are thinking about buying this game, do not.  Take the money, wipe you’re a#$ with it and toss it in the toilet because that would be of more use and you would likely receive more satisfaction from that.\n\n","December 6, 2015","false","13.5"," 282 of 346 people (82%) found this review helpful 157 people found this review funny","82","282","346","157","4"

I really did. After only three in-game hours, I can honestly say that THIS is not a Stronghold game. I've tried looking at it from all angles; seeing it as not a continuation to a series that was plagued by Stronghold 3, but as a sequel to the Stronghold game that stole my heart - Stronghold: Crusaders.\nEven as such, this game fails to deliver. Nothing was built upon - nothing - and if I were to be honest, I would even go as far as to say features were removed. Good features. Important features. What you've been left with feels like the Civilisation game released on the Xbox marketplace; it's cute, but not a full fledged Stronghold game.\nWhere are my Engineers? Laddermen? Tunnelers? Moats? Why is building my castle so... generic?\nI wouldn't have minded a re-skin of Stronghold 2. Nor a remake of the original Crusaders. Given this as the alternative, I would've honestly rather pay an additional $54.99 (CAD) for Firefly to just add Skirmish to Stronghold 3, not release a half-game riding the coattails of previous successes.\nWill I continue to play? Yes. I refuse not to. This game may lack... everything... but damn it, if I want simplicity and don't feel like an RTS like the AoE series, I'll play this.\nWill I recommend this to friends? No. Friends, fellow fans, I've played scapegoat. I've lost this round. Continue reading if you're interested, I'll try to go more in-depth.\n\nMore InformationPros:\nLooks Pretty (Despite a few weirder texture maps...)\nDifferent Style Maps (stone in one corner, iron in another)\nCommunity (whether angry fans or not, it's got a living community)Cons:\nNo Laddermen\nNo Moats\nSlower Resource Gathering (resulting in longer, uneventful games)\nNo actual Engineers (I guess peasents just magically know how to man ballistae, trebuchets, and so-on)\nPoor enemy selection (The new enemies already feel generic)\nMany Stretched Textures (it may look pretty, but not as pretty as it could)\nWeird in-game stuttering and freezes (Before anyone explodes on me, blaming my rig, I have no issues running Shadow of Mordor on high at 1080p (60fps avg.), or Endless Legend, or Stronghold 2 or 3, or Tomb Raider)\nAll-in-all, this game is not done. At least, it better not be.\nVisuals: 8/10\nCombat: 6/10\nCastle/Town Management: 4/10\nUI: 8/10\nUnit Differences: 3/10\nEnemy AI: 5/10\nGameplay Feel: 4/10\n\nDo what you will with this, buy it if you want, Hell, you might even like it. But I cannot recommend this as an honest Stronghold game.\n\nGamers may have changed, Firefly. Choosing to buy into industrious brands like "Call of Duty" and the like, but your audience has not.

I also purchased and played every part except stronghold 3, and I reeeeeeaaaally wanted this one not to suck.\n\nNow i spent some time with it and i will tell you what i think are the positives and negatives.\n\npositive:\n-New physics system\n-3d and its grid based, so it placing walls works without problems\n-the game overall looks quite cool\n-setting, music, atmosphere\n-its a stronghold game, wooooo\n-you can play coop on the same castle, which is a cool feature\n-new mercenary troops, like healer, flame pot thrower, slavedriver...\nand now the negative stuff:\n\n1) enjoyable competitive play is impossible because of the following:\n-super stupid troop maneuvering:\nlets say you have fast bowmen, slow mantlets (movable shields), and you want to attack a castle.\nit is not possible to make those troops move at the same speed, so your bowmen will approach faster than the mantlets, which gives you two possibilities: bowmen dying from enemy fire before the mantlets have moved to the destination, or babysitting your stupid troops without being able to do anything else.\nthis was already done way better in stronghold legends, why did they fail at that in this game?\n\n-no build-up time for walls/buildings: when you want to build something, you click it and its there, boom. same goes for removing buildings. oh you attack my castle? well i better build another f*cking wall behind the wall you are attacking.\noh you set my building on fire? i better just remove it so the fire doesnt spread. oh you destroyed my building with a trebuchet? i just place another one there for 50 wood.\nyou cant build things near enemy troops, sure, but if you want to besiege a castle from afar the enemy just doesnt really care. he can stall you until your troops are dead.\n\n-no laddermen, no siege towers: well, focus on resources and build a 200m thick wall. im extaggerating here, but you get the idea. also, why arent they in the game? we already had that in the previous titles! :(\n\n-no fog of war: thats a real bummer. if you keep looking at your opponents castle (no problem with hotkeys), you know when and where hes attacking all the time. suprise attacks not possible.\n\n-siege equipment is expensive: there are some really cool things, like mantlets, trebuchets, fire wagons... but they are expensive and most of them are not viable because of the reasons stated above.\n\n\nSo this leaves us with only one strategy that is viable in competitive play:\nSpam a ton of woodcutters. sell everything and buy wood. spam all other resources, and even more woodcutters, no walls needed. now you have 10 times more gold/resources than a guy that builds a cool castle. spam crossbowmen and knights, build 20 catapults, and go face. thats it. thats the entire competitive play. and everyone does it and its so boring.\n\nalso, this just leaves out all the cool things that should make this game great. fancy siege weapons? nope. strategic play with special units and cool abilities? nope. long time besiegement with deep tactical play? noooope.\njust spam resources faster than the other guy and go face.\n\n2) AI opponent lords are as stupid as they were in all the previous games.\nand they all do the same thing: they build their castle until it has a certain size, and they just send troop waves in certain time intervals. like stronghold 1 from they f*cking year 2001.\nthe only things that vary between the different enemies are: units used, amount of units used, type of food/resource buildings used, and the way the walls and towers are placed.\ni mean there is NO improvement since 2001.\n\n3) the game has less features than the previous titles in general:\nno laddermen/siege towers, you cant choose which resource is produced by an allied province anymore, all those little things.\n\n\nso to sum it up, the game has the same flaws that every stronghold game had before for 14 years.\ncompetitive play is stupid (at least i think it is), and its not very feature rich.\ni really hoped this game would give me the old stronghold feeling back, but it has too much flaws to be great.\n\nif you are unsure:\nthe game is fun if you just want to play with your friend or some casual battles against some AI lords.\nbut you shouldnt buy it if you want a super fluid competitve experience.","May 18","false","81.8"," 107 of 121 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","107","121","7","5"

However, I do not find my money wasted on this game. As a fan of the stronghold series and a proud owner of all the games (save one that I'm not too proud of...you can guess which), I will happily say that this game is the first stronghold game to not be a total waste of your time since 2002 with crusader 1 itself. On top of that, I highly recommend buying this if for nothing else than supporting the small indie studio Firefly Studios in hopes that, now without their 2K publisher forcing release dates on them, we can begin to see some proper sequels in the stronghold lineup to recover from...a troubling past, to say the least. Perhaps a stronghold 4, or even the possibility of a Legends 2 (Don't kill me, we all know somewhere inside we want a better legends :D)\n\nWith gamespy down, this is also the only remaining stronghold game besides the abysmal pile that was stronghold 3 to have functional multiplayer without the assistance of a 3rd party tool that can sometimes, to inexperienced users, be a large pain in the ♥♥♥ to use properly. So for crusader multiplayer with ease, this runs through the steam servers allowing you to simply invite your friends and such as you would for Team Fortress 2 or something.\n\nBuy this to support firefly and enjoy the first stronghold game in 12 years to not suck right out of the box...or download in this case. And if not, do yourself at least the favor of, if you don't already, going and purchasing Stronghold HD and Stronghold Crusader HD on steam or GoG.com or somewhere - those 2 games, alongside this one, will not fail to give you hours of fun.","November 22, 2014","true","16.4"," 265 of 366 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","265","366","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/232890/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Short VersionI have finally gotten my hands on a copy of this medieval RTS Simulation game after it being wishlisted since its initial pre-release announcement. The reviews have been a mixed bag of tricks from the start so I wanted to give Firefly Studios plenty of time to bang out any kinks in the ol' armor before launching my assault and possibly bludgeoning this game into fragmented code. After a lengthy (and sometimes exhausting) battle, the dust has settled and as my gaze reflects upon the still-burning fires, the blood-soaked desert sands, and the rubbled remains of what once was a towering and majestic castle, I muster up the strength to utter a few last words with my last breath fading away - "I strongly recommend this game..."\n\nOk, so why the mixed reviews? A couple of reasons. First, this is an expensive game even after being released for almost a year. Not uncommon for many AAA titles, but let's face it - this is Steam and the majority of Steam users are known for pinching pennies and expecting everything on the cheap. Not totally unreasonable and for those who pay the hefty full price for this game, I understand why there may be some mixed feelings about it. The game is good, has a lot to offer, and is entertaining. But at the same time, there are a few bugs and issues in it still and don't appear to be getting fixed any time soon. They aren't necessarily being ignored though and Firefly Studios is still actively working on the game and new content for it.  Keep in mind, Stronghold Crusader 2 is a AAA title and its normal for periodical updates to be released as major patches that address many things at once rather than a multitude of weekly updates that may address one specific element as seen with smaller indie-type games.\n\nMany gamers who have played the original Stronghold Crusader  before grabbing this long awaited sequel have been openly critical because the graphics are only slightly improved after more than a decade. Stronghold Crusader is very similar to the original, in fact, almost identical at first glance. But there are some differences -  new units (and special abilities added to others), a modified economic system, a change in the housing dynamic, co-op mode for multiplayer games, an automated purchase/sell system added to the market, weather/natural disaster random events, some new AI characters (and more planned as future DLC), troop formations added and improved, and a few other changes  or removed content from the original (such as the removal of moats and feasts). However, for the most part, Stronghold Crusader 2 is identical to its predecessor at a much loftier price so it draws a lot of criticism for this. So why would I give this game my recommendation?\n\nI review games individually based on their own content and whether they offer up gaming enjoyment to its players. This game is a lot of fun and has plenty to offer. The graphics are 3-D, unlike the original Crusader game. They will not leave you with that "wow" feeling, but they are still solid and detailed for a real-time strategy sim. The soundtrack to this game is a harmonic masterpiece that injects the player with a true sense of the environment and time period. There are several different game modes and each of them offer a numerous amount of gameplay. Hundreds of hours can be spent playing without ever trying out each one. There are a multitude of buildings that can be built and a nice variety of units available. A map editor has been included for easily creating and sharing your own designs with the Steam Community. And don't forget the most popular feature - Castle Building. This is what really makes the crusader series so great. Its one of the best castle building systems in gaming and while slightly different from previous versions, it still performs smoothly and allows for simple and fun creativity to give your kingdom its own personal touch.\n\nGameplay BasicsIn Stronghold Crusader 2 players will need to gather resources for building structures, creating weapons to train armed units, and produce enough food to support the populus. Fortifying your base is an important aspect as well, so players will want to protect their kingdom with castle walls and defensive structures like towers and traps. Naturally, you will need an army to defend your kingdom and attack your opponents. Each troop type requires specific weapons or armor to be crafted first and also have a price in gold. Gold can be earned by collecting taxes or by selling excess goods on the market. Troops can also be purchased from a mercenary post with gold. Governing your kingdom is very basic. It is based on overall happiness and there are several ways players can influence this statistic positively or negatively. To claim victory you must simply defeat all of the opposing lords on the map.\n\nGame ModesStronghold Crusader 2 is packed full of gameplay content offered in a variety of game modes to ensure countless hours of entertainment. They include single player, co-op and multiplayer options. There are a variety of customization settings available to adjust the level of difficulty a player wishes to encounter, configure for team play, and map selection (in some cases). Computer AI players can be substituted or added in place of additional human players and each AI character has its own habits, strengths, and weaknesses that also influence how challenging the game will be.\n\nLearning Campaigns - Tutorial campaigns that play out as a campaign while progressively teaching the game's         concepts.\nSkirmish Trails - A chain of skirmishes versus AI characters that increase in difficulty as you progress.\nCustom Skirmish - Up to 8 players and team play. Players can be human or AI. Custom settings including map selection.\nSandbox - Build your mighty kingdom in peace and without fear of being attacked from any opponents.\nMultiplayer - Players can either join a server from the list or host their own game and can be played individually or as teams. There is also a simple in-game text chat available by pressing "Enter."\nCommunity Maps - Skirmish maps designed by the Steam Community.\n\nThe Good:+  Challenging gameplay\n+  Solid 3-D graphics\n+  Excellent soundtrack and quality voice acting\n+  Simple controls and a smooth user interface\n+  Beginner's tutorial included\n+  Multiple customization settings\n+  Variety of game types available\n+  Many distinctive units with their own abilities/uses\n+  Nice selection of buildings and resources\n+  Great castle building system\n+  Custom map editor included\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Some DLC content added for free\n+  Continued development and support post-release\n+  No heavy CPU strain for systems mid-range or above\n\nThe Bad:-  Very expensive at full price\n-  Still contains some minor bugs. (Not game breaking)\n-  The graphics are stale and unimpressive for modern gamers\n-  Updates are periodic so fixes and improvements are not quickly available\n\nFinal Thoughts:Stronghold Crusader 2 is a very entertaining medieval RTS castle-building simulation that is packed with gameplay and will continue to get better with time as more content is added. However, it does come at a considerable price. I recommend this game to all RTS lovers, but if you're on a tight gaming budget then i would wishlist it and wait for a sale. In the meantime, you might also consider buying the original Stronghold Crusader game to get a taste of the crusader experience.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 21, 2015","true","66.1"," 271 of 388 people (70%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","70","271","388","22","17"

And also I've played this game both before the optimisation patch came out and after that. And I must say, I really can't join the obvious hate train on this one. Maybe you'll dismiss me after these words, but first hear me out.\nNot only will I bring some closure on some of the infamous aspects the other reviewers have pointed out about the game in it's early stages, but I will also recommend you which Stronghold game you should look for according to your interests.\n\nAbout the claims saying that this game is unbalanced. Let me point out that this game, is both warfare-wise and economy-wise, is more balanced than any other stronghold game that I've played. In older games, bread production was the way to go in all situations, and sword production was the thing you should go for, simply because all other melee units were simply trash compared to swordsmen and knights, removing the reason/need for more than half of weapon workshop options and the soldier options. Mantlets and horse archers were simply overpowered, and it was the best choice to amass them. In Stronghold 2, siege engines were so broken that you could defend a "castle" without building a single wall, or you didn't need to actually move in your melee units to kill advancing swordsmen, because they couldn't even get close. But in this game, you can see that all of those issues I mentioned above don't exist anymore.\n\nIn first crusader game, everything was so cheap that money virtually didn't cost anything after you've set your core economy in place, having thousands upon thousands of gold and not even being able to find a way to spend all of that was simply meaningless, and at the same time arabian units were simply way too expensive to train early on. But in this game, you can always feel the pressure of being short for money, from all the way from beginning to the endgame, as it should be. And this doesn't mean that it's impossible to build a rich settlement, there are actually new features that immensely help with that!\n\nFor example, in this game a market is not required to sell or buy goods, but still there is a market building option. Why? Because this market building provides autosell and autobuy options. And stockpile, granary and armory buildings have unlimited space. Honestly, these are the most important reasons why this game is actually superior to any other stronghold game (stronghold 2 didn't have unlimited stockpile). Anyone who've played enough stronghold games can know, that it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ both trying to manage the stockpile by selling excess stone so that your bread production chain won't crumble upon itself, and trying to command your units in battle at the same time. Let's say that you don't have iron reserves but you really need some armor in your armory. But you cannot stop what you are doing and buy iron because the enemy is keeping you busy all the time. Worry not! Just set some iron to autobuy, and the system is already set in stone. You just set your autosell and autobuy options and sit back and enjoy warfare while the money counts itself. The new minimap and UI are also way better than the older games. It's easier to spot units on map, and UI is customizable and you can see how much goods you have in your stores at the top of your screen all the time, if you wish so. The new popularity chart is vastly superior to the older games, aside from the default popularity displays, you can see both the daily income and consume of food, ale, and candles, so when you increase the rate of rations you don't have to pay attention to your granary all the time to figure out if they are declining or not. Which makes setting taxes and setting your economy a lot easier than it was in older games. Another example that points out that it's still easy to have a rich settlement: the default tax rate is "low taxes" now, and it doesn't exert a negative effect in your popularity.\n\nRoughly all buildings are more than 2 times as expensive than it was in older games, and that is a welcome addition. It's a bit harder to spam quarries to get rich early on, and it's still possible. Now there is a reason to set up other types of food farms as well, and even at the beginning you are still able to set up bread production if you play right. And also multiple food types provide way more popularity bonus than it did in original games, now you can raise your tax rate by one level just by having all food types in your granary. So having multiple types of food production is relatively not something so useless contrary to how it was in original games.\n\nNow, there are 2 more important melee fighter options alongside swordsmen. Sergeant at arms and templar knights, which (other than armor) requires pikes and maces, respectively. Sword production is not the only important weapon production anymore. In this game, european archers are better than arabic archers, so opting to craft regular longbows are not obsolete anymore. Horse archers are way more squishy and fire way slower while on the move, all archers are way more accurate and they do not miss horse archers anymore. Mantlets are way weaker to arrow damage, it's not possible to just create 100 mantlets and have an invincible army. Mantlets cannot go on walls anymore, so you can't just build one tower and a few archers and a mantlet, and have the most unbreakable defense ever. Knights, sergeant at arms, and arabian melee cavalry are all very expensive units, so training swordsmen does not become something obsolete when you are short on money. Some siege engines are way more expensive than they were in original games, and some of them are also even cheaper, making them relatively more balanced. If you want to have a strong army, you will have to train some of those expensive units, and that will constantly keep your economy in check and you won't be swimming in meaningless amounts of gold. Gold will be important throughout the game. All of the things I've counted by now clearly shows how more balanced and therefore, a better gameplay this game provides compared to previous games.\n\nThe siege engines do not knockback units they hit as they did in Stronghold 2 anymore. Even though it was fun to watch your hapless enemies in that situation, it was inarguably overpowered. However, siege engines do knock soldiers down from walls when they hit them, and that is an instant kill regardless of what type of soldier it is. (and in Stronghold 2, crossbowmen would survive those falls) This is much better, and more realistic.\n\nDid I mention that the game got an optimisation update roughly more than 6 months ago? Yes, I already did. I must admit, the game looked promising but it was literally unplayable before the patch came out because of the massive FPS drops in skirmish games. But now, that's all gone, it only happens rarely when you are nearing the maximum number of buildings limit in a full on 8 player game. And it mostly depends on how strong your computer is, really. If your system cannot run some of the games that came out last year, it might as well be pretty normal that you are having problems while trying to run this game. For that, I would only advise you to upgrade your machine. Other than FPS problems, a lot of bugs the reviewers have pointed out are also gone as well, sure still a few might happen from time to time like cross positioned models, knights not being able to mount horses and archers not being able to mount war wagon while they are moving, but it occurs rarely and doesn't make the game anything short of enjoyable.\n\n\n-Because of the maximum word count Steam review system enforces, I will continue my review in this review's comment section, and you can read there if you are interested-","April 2","true","48.0"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","69","84","4","17"

Egyptian hieroglyph looks better than what we see here.\nUI is terrible, it feels very alpha. *cough* look at that type font *cough*\n\nNo economy, just a lifeless corpse of a castle that spits out little clones to either attack or defend it.\nIf you wanted a sim, like me, you wont see people chatting and going about their lives, there is no micro management. Nothing to see. Where are the citizens, the animations?\n\nTake SH1, just awe at the amount of detail that it had, moss in the walls, cracks in the wood and stone. Even wind ffs.\n\nUnfortunatly, you cannot stop and think: is this just a SH3 reskin with less bugs?\n\nIs it a waste of time? God no. The gameplay is bland but at times, you may find some joy in it. Fans will do a fair bit of it out of pure nostalgia. Smashing walls can be fun.\n\nIn the end, the game just doesn’t do much for you to like it for very long.","December 9, 2014","false","7.4"," 184 of 268 people (69%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","69","184","268","11","4"

Stronghold 3. You know what is comparatively better? Stronghold Crusader 2. Be warned, there are a few 'day one' glitches and bugs, but nothing game breaking and unfixable like in SH3. As stated in other reviews, the game does feel a bit clunky as of now, but I believe these issues can be ironed out in the next week or two. Take note of the system specs, because my desktop meets the minimum but not the recommended and it's definitely noticeable. Assuming you have that, both die hard fans and ones new to the series won't be disappointed with the options to start with. Skirmish mode, (hooray!) multiple campaigns, and sandbox are all playable. I also like the new art style and updated graphics. Overall, it feels like an updated SH:C with more features, hopefully more to be added through DLC. (Additional units, both new and rebooted AI, all new campaigns, etc) In addition, the Arab lords no longer have to build churches; mosques have finally been added. A small thing, but really helps with the balance between Crusaders and Arabs.\n\nThe game takes a different spin on how it approaches the Crusades, and now the 'right side' is whichever side you're fighting for. There's no 'good' side, as both sides view themselves as freedom fighters locked in a righteous struggle against the infidels.\n\nThere is multiplayer, but I have not tested it yet, so take that with a grain of salt. I somewhat agree with the opinon that Firefly sacrificed some content for a more realistic game, but that is not nearly as off-putting here as it was in SH3. I'm excited to see where Firefly takes SH:C2, especially after the SH3 letdown, and hope to enjoy this game quite a bit in the future.\n\nEDIT: (Since day one was quite a while ago, and the above review is outdated) I don't think considering this as a solid 'yes' review would be correct. Firefly has put in effort to fix the bugs, but the game is still not optimized. As stated in other reviews, really expect those performance drops during sieges. The game does feel somewhat lacking in certain aspects, namely graphics and troop types. As a fan of the Stronghold series since Stronghold 2, (which is still a really fun game for its shortcomings) I will say that, given the price tag, this isn't a 'gateway' Stronghold game. New to the series? Play the original Crusader, or Stronghold 1. Enjoy skirmishing? Stronghold 2 has an above-average skirmish mode, and a nice, easy to use map maker as well. It's not the trainwreck of Stronghold 3, but Stronghold Crusader 2 still mediocre.","September 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 151 of 230 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","151","230","0","2"

First, some background on me.  I was playing games when DOS was still around and when Age of Empires 1 was the new thing on the MSN gaming zone.  My video game history encompases every genre but primarily focuses on Strategy games, FPS games, and the occasional RPG.  Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader were essentially the same game with a different atmosphere and some unit changes.  Both were excellent games and the sucessors to follow did not so well.  Stronghold 2 was mediocre at best, the fantasy mythic Stronghold and Stronghold 3 were bad.\nFirefly split from their old publisher and became their own, just as many developers are doing these days because publishers like to add their two cents to game they know nothing about.  Stronghold Crusader II takes what the original did and improves upon it further.  The music and sound and very similar from the first and well done.  Some of the original quotes from the units are still there as you move your catapults and archers.  The villagers no longer speak to you when you click on them, instead it simply tells you what they are doing.\nOne of the things that made Stronghold so great for me back in the day was destroying the castles and watching the walls crumble.  The massive armies going at it with each other and heads rolling.  The physics in this game are much improved as to be expected.  When catapults slam their boulders into a wall bodies standing near the point of impact are screwed.  See those thirty archers in a tight group?  Well now they are at the bottom in a pile where they belong.  Trebuchets have great range and destructive power and still need to be setup while the catapults have less range and can be shot by archers. Overall the military feels well done, especially that mace men frenzy charge that leaves nothing standing as they spit and scream their way into battle.\nWhile on the topic of military, some things have been reworked.  The laddermen are gone, which wasn't really a surprise, who ever used them anyways?  Moats and tunnelers have also been removed. At the time of this review sieging a castle isn't an easy task.  Strongwalls are not an option but the time it takes for any military unit to chip away at a wall or gatehouse isn't worth that route.  Almost your entire military force would be dead while they were picking away at the walls.  While I would still like the strongwall option, it works well as it stands.  As said before, catapults, trebuchets that fire boulders, cows, camelheads, and pigs, a bigger version of a catapult, rams, firecarts, and troop carriers are all the siege units.\nArchers have remained the same but the crossbows no longer use animal hide as armor.  The swordsmen are still slow but the knights can get horses to get them from point A to point B quickly.  There is a new unit called the Sergeant at Arms which gives a bonus to troops within an area of effect, this can boost your other swordsmen, pikes, or whatever else you got nearby.  Of course, the higher military units cost a fortune to field but can essentially soak up arrows while your catapults lay waste to the walls and mace men haul tail into the base to wreck everything.\nWhile building a military you will notice that you run out of gold quick unless you run an efficient economy.  Churches, breweries, and extra rations are all ways to keep your citizens happy to so you can generate more taxes.  The market will let you auto-sell and/or auto-purchase items.  This can be set as high or as low as you want.  Iron, stone, wood, pitch, all the basic resources sell for the least while the armors and weapons sell for the most.  Unlike the previous Crusader game, Inns providing ale do not need to be spammed but rather you adjust how much ale is consumed much in the same way as you would food.  This will increase happiness to get you the desired level but just make sure you have the hops farms and breweries to accomodate the usage level.  Churches act in much the same way in that you only need one but have to provide them with candles.  Once again, here you can adjust how many candles are used for the desired happiness.\nSo far I have played through the tutorial and the lionheart campaign.  The story isn't that great but the game does a good job at preparing you for harder battles.  Some are so difficult that if you don't complete the level quick enough the army forces become so numerous it is a massive chore to keep them at bay while you invade.  Additionally, I have played many skirmish matches, which is where the game is at for me.  I like setting up from scratch and playing massive 4v4 battles.  The game hosts 8 players, human or computer.  As in the old ones, the rat is the worst player while the wolf and some of the new comers bring a better challenge.  I have only had one crash to the desktop at the time of this review and that was right after intial installation and launching of a skirmish.  I loaded that same map again a second time and it worked fine.\nThat brings me to the bugs.  Most people were holding off on this game because of the reputation Firefly has.  Since Firefly is now technically a "indie" developer as they separated from their publisher, I would like to take away the fears of  purchasing this game.  Other than a few issues with selecting units or them getting stuck in a gatehouse I haven't had any issues.  Below are my specs just in case you are wondering and want to compare.\n\ni5-2500k OC'd to 4.4 Ghz\n16 GB of G Skill Ripjaws RAM\nDual 7970 Radeons\nEVGA FTW Motherboard\n2 OCZ Vector SSDs in RAID 0\n1200 Watt PSU gold from Corsair\nH100i CPU Cooler\n\nWith that setup I have no issues.  Some people have reported problems while others have not.  I am not sure how well they maintain their computer or what they have going on, as a system is going to be different from the next.  I run a tight ship on mine and have zero problems with running the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nStronghold Crusader II is a well designed game that is being constantly updated with both fixes and soon to be new content.  On their forums they have laid out a plan on how they wish to progress with supporting this game.  It appears as though their heart is where it should be and a fleshed out game was designed.  Is it worth 50 dollars is the next question?  I would say no, 30 or 40 dollars maybe but not 50.  There isn't enough new content to justify the price but if you are a big fan of the original then price might not matter much to you.  I waited for 24 hours and looked at what people were saying before I purchased the game.  I hope this review helps you decide for yourself but please watch YouTube videos of the gameplay and try to find the glitches some are talking about and the ones I spoke of.  If any of that puts you off, give it a week or two then come back.","September 24, 2014","true","21.0"," 124 of 188 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","124","188","0","2"

Hardcore fans and achievement hunters will be the only ones who will appreciate SC2. The "Campaign" trails are back from the original. They offer no more than a series of AI skirmish challenges that vary in difficulty. There's a dozen or so tutorial missions the have some kind of "Narrative" but I use that word loosely.\n\nMelee Fighting: Winning consists of massing a blob of units into another player's castle to kill thier avatar "Lord." I say "blob" because the units clip into each other It's not pleasing on the eyes when a group of a hundred pikemen can't be distinguished between a single guy. To make matters worse, during a fight they all clip into smaller blob. To make matters EVEN worse, a well placed pitch pot can decimate a group of hundreds.\n\nCastle Smashing: The castle walls are no more than ten feet high and seem as strong as paper mache't. A few catapults can blast through a wall very quickly.  Probably why they removed ladder men and seige towers from the previous games. They added "ragdoll" physics, when a unit is arrowed they will tumble off the wall, if their foot doesn't get stuck and trap them hanging like maniquins for a few seconds before they disappear. When a tower falls with units on top the ragdoll levitates like Wil-e- Coyote holding up a sign before they fall to the ground.\n\nThemes: The music is the only thing done right. Really great Crusade feeling soundtrack. As for the two religions, a lot of care was taken to avoid controversy. The Islamic Saracens dont eat the "pig" food ration (they grow sheep farms instead) and don't drink Ale, another handicap seeing as how they can't gain the happines benifits from Bars, and no other feature was put in place instead. Churches and Mosques are only distuinguishable from a little moon and star above the Mosque.\n\nTL:DR= Only for fans of Stronghold. a lot of features done poorly, none really dont right. It's old Stronghold with new spit polish. Nab it on a sale and knock out the generous achievements.","November 6, 2014","false","19.4"," 93 of 142 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","93","142","0","0"

No controls changing! No advanced graphic settings (for a 2014 game).\n\n-------------Moving to gameplay now---------------\n\n-Unit Pathfinding sucks. utter terrible. (could be improved with a patch so wouldnt worry too much)\n-Wall building system is terrible, i could place a wall then try to delete and not work.the wall is still there! (probably a bug)\n-No moats! What happened to Crusader 1's moats??\n-Everything is over simplified by a lot compared tot he original.\n-No tooltips or explanations ( have to look on game wiki but i think the devs are being lazy here)\n-Graphics in general,Textures are horrible! for a 2014 game\n-LESS buildings than the original, YES, LESS STUFF, (isnt the point of a sequel is to expand the original?? not take stuff out!)\n-Maps arent well designed, not many trees, not enough grass etc.\n-Expensive! Everything is so expensive and selling doesnt get you much, (maybe needs a balance)\n-They got rid of the happiness, decorations system! (sandbox without decorations?! thats suicidal)\n-Units dont look as good as they should for a 2014 game, (maybe i should include this in graphics?)\n-Right/left clicking was weird, cant change controls for these.\n-Building against a natural ditch or water doesnt work very well, wall might cut off randomly without the battlements.\n-Natural disasters!! Who the heck thought it was a good idea to include this??! (well at least you could turn it off xD)\n-Did they recycle voices from the original? (i dont really mind but might not sit well with some people)\n\nPros: ( lets end witht he happy stuff)\n-AI changes were much better than the original, although they still fall for the same tricks used in the original.\n-Likes the market auto sell system!, nice touch!\n-Got the same old Crusader 1 feel to the game!\n-Liked some of the new defensive attachments.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSomethings devs might want to consider:\n-INFORMATION! Add more tips!\n-When your resources are low make it blink or something!\n-Can still repair walls instantly while enemy blowing up walls with trebs.\n-Add moats back in.\n-Maybe try some better graphics? ( dont know if its possible at this point).\n\nAlso just a note to the devs!\n\nWe love your work, we dont mind how long it takes to come out, be it 10 years or 20 years but please make it a great game worthy of the firefly title. I know you guys can do it from seeing crusader 1.

This one is totally terrible however.  At first glance it seems totally awesome.  There are additional units that have been added, and the graphics are excellent.  Unfortunately the AI is ridiculous.  In the old Stronghold crusader you could actually use tactics and choke off your enemy by hitting his supply lines.  In this one, he randomly generates additional units, and no matter how low his supplies are, each wave keeps getting harder and harder.  I made it through half the campaigns and started with hard, and then went to normal and then to easy.  Never had this problem before, and I've played all sorts of strategy games, including warcraft, starcraft, crusader, etc.  The tutorial is very basic and its up to you to figure out how the new units actually work, so not much fun there either.","April 9, 2015","false","12.8"," 55 of 79 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","55","79","6","2"

I also miss the tutorial how you play for example how you let the game run faster. For me the first 3 missions are just missions but not a tutorial, so for me as a beginner it was realy hard to understand that game, I had to watch some gameplay videos to learn more about that game.\n\nSo as a beginner the missions are realy hard its much different then playing AOE or Settlers, you also can`t change the game mode to easy, normal or hard.

I have immediately launched into skirmishes to figure out what is new, how are the systems changed and so on.\n\nI have to say, some aspects have been made simpler.\n(There is generally an easier relationship between buildings&mechnisms, such  as 1 temple only, you make a couple  candle workshops and you can figure out how many more you need for the best effect, opposed to the %of people blessed via priests in the first game)\nI do not necessarily consider it a good or a bad point, so long as either fits the game, which it imho does here.\nHowever, I really miss the popularity system. That added a lot to the feels and complexity of crusader. (nice lord/ cruel lord)\n\nThe look of the game is  the best they have done in 3d, but the art of the original made it visually impressive and timeless, which I miss to some degree.\nAlso, it seems some settings arent perfectly optimised yet, because despite my PC's strenght, framedrops were present after a couple hundred troops started battling. My greatest concern was with the pathfinding of units in general. Peasants are working allright, but troops seem to glitch out rather often. If they go near impassable terrain in a large group (lets say because of a rally point) some of them will freeze and dont move unless commanded again. The assassins are even glitchier if you control more than 5 of them, they just stop or clump up in certain areas of the castle they should figure out how to use. (stairs seem to confuse them a  great deal)\n\nDespite it silly  problems, I do not see anything that could not be fixed with patches.\nFor those who have loved how the archers arrows were shot in the original game (in nice, somewhat slowish arcs), that is not how it is done here. Arrows travel almost instantly. Ranged combat resolves faster imo, probably because they wanted to  make the game combat feel faster, more responsive. It certainly feels a bit odd though, on how the arrows travel. Melee combat however, felt slower. I think because units do not stack up to the ridiculous extent they did in the original crusader, and hence 50 units cant swing their swords in a 1 square meter area. I do not really mind this change of feel that much.\nWalls are extremely weak vs any sort of catapult, and need to be made extremely thick to be effective. (which is sad because it takes away so much space)\n\nAs for the new units and features, I actually like them more than I thought I would. The abilities of units are welcome, the new units are (mostly) interesting.\n\nTL,DR: Has potential to be a really good long lasting experience, speaking from a  skirmish/multiplayer mindset. If you want to be on the safe side, wait for some meaningful patches to roll out, which would fix the bad(glitchy) pathfinding,  occcasional random crashes, poor optimisation, and odd fps drops.\nMost maps are also somewhat small.\n\nBiggest beef with the game by far: There is no space grid watch. As in, one used to be able to press the spacebar to see an up-top view of the building grid for better building placement, and unit directing near difficult terrain/high buildings. It is of utmost importance, and  sadly, it isnt included. Not yet at least.","September 25, 2014","true","20.9"," 63 of 97 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","63","97","0","0"

The engeniers system like in SHC1 was fine it only needed to be able to build easyiers more siege equipment. p.s. NO ladders??? no siege towers????? no Moat??? wtf!!!\n\nAlso the city simply didn't feel as lively as the original stronghold crusader did. Everything goes to slow the peasents jobs are very boring and the city is pretty empty. The original crusader had problems with not being able to build over people but it least it had mothers caring over children, children playign around, drunkers getting wasted and simply more people that did more interesting stuff, Let people enjoy your castle to... (the apothacary could have been healing your lord and your peasents and make him wandering about). The economy also goes far to slow wich can easily be solved by doubling EVERY peasents there walking speed and there spawn speed. perhaps an auto create soldiers function could be a great idea to\n\nThe good stuff:\n-Graphics are well updated despites the poor animations.\n-You can now choose some apearance to your lord and by it how the keep looks. Choosing from christian or arabian lords result in building either square towers or round towers wich is an excelent way to make the castle look instantly diffrent. (if u realy want to spoil fans why not make a custom outfitter to create an own lord with custimizeble loadouts from helmets armor weapons and mantle... Fans would LOVE this)\nAlso the churches for christian lords and mosques for arabian lords are well done(despites there mechanics).\n-Some units ability's are a good way to increase the way how your soldiers want to react to threats and gives more influence on the outcome of a battle.\n-Everything is VERY WELL organized really compliments on this one! You can on multiple ways see and adjust some of the most importent things about your economy, also the market with auto buy and auto sell option while you can buy and sell everything from the beginningin there respective storage depot is absolutely well done.\n-Infinite store space in the stockpile and granery, perhaps unrealistic but for smooth gameplay this is a must and you have did it great! (however the stockpile being a square rather then a straight lane would have been even better!)\n-How the flying cows, lions, donkeys, and camel head explode on impact when launched from a catapult awsome!!\nIt would have been SO MUCH greater if u used more of the same gore with the fighting troops (meelee fighters cutting other soldiers heads arms and leggs off) I know that in 3d gore is more difficult but it realy could have been better done.\n-You need only one church and one inn and the effects are custimizeble. This is a good way to keep castles more realistic but it also makes the castle more boring.\n-You can now create walls without een auto platform for units to walk on, now you can create mulitple layers of walls without auto connecting all of them!\n-the iron mines are much better done! longer and nice animations but the birng up more iron every turn. (this would also have been great for the stone quarry)\n-The fact that people always can get to there working spaces due to narrow corridors.\n-The greater numbers on popularity and economy resources are also much better done\n-The continious increase of gold true taxes gives you a much better vieuw of how much gold you get from them.\n-The prices of the market realy encourges you to make everything yourself and not producing to much since selling it is hardly worth it, however it would have been nicer to see a changing market based on what all the people buy and sell in the market to see more rare materials and more common materials result in price change.\n-Reduces range of archers catapults and averything that fires SHC1 realyt had a problem there with archers that kills people on ranges a sniper rifle would hardley do the trick.\n\nSo overal i will say i still reccommend this game but i do hope the developers are not going to do something else cuzz this game needs lots of updates and perhaps an expansion or 2-3 before it will be realy good. I thank you!\n","September 22, 2014","true","10.8"," 87 of 140 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","87","140","0","5"

The game only barely looks better than Stronghold 2, a game released in 2004. The models are off proportion and rather amateurish, and the art ranges from passable to horrid.\n-Random events negatively impact your popularity. Who honestly thought this was a good idea?\n-No real innovation. The only new things here are the Templar Sergeant, the Slave Driver, the Arabian equivalent of the Crusader Knight, that stupid ♥♥♥ dude with the dreadlocks, the War Wolf (which is just a catapult with more HP) and the Hussite Clown Car. Weather is new, but it serves no purpose other than to hinder progress.\n-No collision detection in an RTS. As a result, melee fights degenerate into blobs of stacked units flailing about.\n-The UI. Why whoever designed the UI chose to ignore the perfectly sensible UI seen in the first two games and decide that the best solution would be spread all relevant information to the far corners of the screen is anyone's guess.\n-The game is missing quite a few things from the first(Siege Towers, etc)\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is bad buy Stronghold Crusader HD","September 22, 2014","false","62.0"," 173 of 291 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","173","291","0","2"

It hasn't ever recaptured that momentum that Stronghold Crusader delivered back in 2002, producing games that didn't deliver for a variety of different reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think newcomers to the game will enjoy the game as much as we do. It still has a lot of content missing, and areas such as the menu's and HUD are definitely missing a much-needed improvement. The graphics aren't as good as you'd expect, and the AI is broken at times. Troops refuse to obey your commands due to bugs, and so on. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, thats for sure.\n\nWith this said, I do rate Stronghold Crusader 2, and I do enjoy playing it. It has been great for a player like myself who grew up playing the original. Just to have the feel of Stronghold again, to get a taste of what originally made it so successful. Character dialogue is witty, the gameplay is fast, and the numerous scenario's that you partake in provide excellent replayability. The tutorial and majority of skirmishes are brilliant, even for me a few of them I kinda thought "..how the hell am I supposed to do that?!" but you eventually get into the groove of how the game dynamics work. Its good to progressively see yourself get better & better, as you challenge yourself further by adding multiple AI and restricting yourself to using certain units/buildings. I haven't completed the campaign as of yet, but so far its been extremely good fun.\n\nSo for fans of previous Stronghold titles, I am sure you will learn to appreciate the game for the quality it has, though somewhat trapped inside a conglomerate of faults. For newcomers I am skeptical as to how much you'd enjoy it, as there are other titles in this genre that do much more then what Stronghold Crusader 2 provides. Still, SC2 provides some memorable moments and entertaining game scenario's, yet lacks the full package we truly want to see that follows in the originals footsteps.","August 14, 2015","true","35.0"," 60 of 96 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","60","96","2","0"

Like for example the healer which makes u heal your army , Rangers , sergeants at arms,,, etc.\n-Easier managment for the economy and goods from the panel on the top right of the screen to get more taxes. it tells you how much you product and consume.\n-A new feature of occupying free lands in the map to take goods from them , wasn’t in SC1.\n\nPros (in general)\n-The game is very realistic , there are 2 types of lords , Arabs and Crusaders , where both are very realistic in the army type and economy , for example there\\\'s a sheep farm and mosque instead of pig farm and church for Arab lords.\nCheck here.[i.imgur.com]\n-The learning campaigns are realistic and Historically accurate , they are some about Antioch and Jerusalem , you should reach there and occupy it , you will enjoy the skirmish trials as well.\n-The game offers 4 DLC which add 2 new lords in each dlc with their skirmish trials. so 8+8=16 lords with dlcs.\n-Each lord has his own type of army and economy, and his unique castle design.\n-The Multiplayer side of the games seems stable most of the time , you can play with others in wide options of peace time and what\\\'s allowed and not( Assassins , trebuchets..etc) . and it has a cool feature which is if the host was P*ssy and left the game , the game migrates the host to another player in the game so there\\\'s no interruption in the gameplay.\nCheck here.[i.imgur.com]\n-Easy use of army and positioning\\\\lining them , with the attack mode which tells the warrior what to do with enemies.\n-You will enjoy the soundtracks in the game , they are really exciting and fun.\n\nCons\n-The game is unstable yet , it still has some bugs in it and needs frequent updates, last update was on april\\\\16 , so expect a glitch or a crash.\n-The cost of most things is generally high , walls for example will cost allot of stone , market and inn will cost much wood too..\n-The multiplayer system is unstable yet , sometimes u won’t be able to join a specific lobby , or it will appear empty.\n-The game sometimes doesn’t accept more than 4 players in multiplayer , so its 2v2 max.\n-The army stops sometimes when u move it , or it goes back and forward again.\n-The knights gets off their horses for no reason sometime , you have to put them back on it.\n-The mantlet health is high enough , if you put your army under 100 mantlets , i dont think the archers on the towers can stop you while catapulting them under mantlets.\n-The tower ballista damage is lower than the crossbow , looks weird for me.\n\nSo shall I buy this game ?\nWell , if you love strategy games specially historical\\\\medieval ones , and you think you are smart enough to build and manage a desert castle, yes buy it. But if you think you can learn everything in the game and become an OP player in it in 2 hours , then don’t buy it.\nThere are allot of videos and guides there you can watch or read to learn how to have strong economy and military power.A good video.\nDon’t look at the reviews percentage on steam store page , most of them are 1 lined review with no reasonable dislike. However, don’t buy this game unless it\\\'s on sales it gets really cheap, otherwise it’s too expensive and doesn’t really deserve its original price without sales.\nOne more thing , don’t buy the special edition , it really adds silly things for nothing.\n\nThe game is very addictive and you will enjoy it.\nThank you for reading!\n\nMy funny artworks xD.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695210566\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695243240","June 1","true","145.4"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","22","29","3","2"

In my mind, 2 was the best game due to its complexity, and features such as towers actually having an inside, revunne from estates, and feasts among other things. This game has none of improvments of 2, nor most of the features from the original crusader, such has different sized walls and gates and actually different tower designs. Towers in SHC2 are the exact same model only upscaled in size. Going back to what the game has from SH2, there are candle makers who magically create wax, the terrible formation system which is useless once you're in the heat of battle, oh and here it is also useful to mention a unit cap which only seems to increase for every enemy you defeat, which is a bit counter intuitive to met at least, as i always prefered fighting two or three strong enemies over several seiges than anything else. THis game tries so hard to be an RTS which it is not and never will be, when it was perfectly fine beign stronghold. I will still play this game, and hope that updates will come out that improve it, but that won't be likely unless they are radical changes. I would recommend SH2 before SHC2 if you're lookign for a good combination between castle buildign sim and RTS, and SHC1 if you want an excellent medieval strategy game.","September 24, 2014","false","7.6"," 79 of 132 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","79","132","0","0"

After just a mediocre Stronghold 2 (and yes it was, at least in my opinion) and the disastrous Stronghold 3 (and yes, IT WAS) it's no wonder, if people are a bit sceptical about another "try". After watching pre-alpha gameplay and the dev diary I could see 'the old crusader 1' in it. The devs wanted to go back to the roots and that's exactly what I wanted. Therefore I have decided to throw in some Euros into the gambling house (preorder) and to cross my fingers, that Firefly won't mess it up this time or it would be their last game for sure. Long story, short answer: this time they could deliver!\n\n\nPro:\nthe old 'crusader feeling' from the past!\nit's always fun to build castles and to destroy the stuff of other people\nrebalanced and new units (no more unstoppable horse archers)\nsmarter construction of buildings\nlearning campaign + skirmish trails will offer ~30 hours of singleplayer fun\ncustom skirmish battles with AI possible (and you can change your own color now too)\nVERY hard final skirmish trail mission (yup, it's fun for your brain)\nworking multiplayer\na lot of maps (the old classic maps of SHC1 are also planned to be added later)\nmap editor\nSteam Workshop support is planned\ngood soundtrack\nyou can throw several animals through the air\nsome of the old german voice actors are back\nthe release version was very playable with only some minor bugs (my experience, maybe not yours)\nthe devs actually care about the game and have further plans for it\nyou can brew beer, germans love beer\n\nNeutral:\nmediocre graphics (it's not bad but it isn't too great too, could be better, but I don't care that much about it)\nnot much visual variety...because of the crusader setting of the game which means desert, desert, desert, some palms, some oasis, some rivers, mountains and have I already mentioned desert? (that's no contra)\nno moats anymore (I miss them, because they contribute to a more challenging defense, but let's be honest...moats don't make that much sense in a desert)\nno leather armors anymore (crossbowmen need and wear steel armor now, macemen need no armor anymore)\n\nContra:\nnot all promised features are in yet (Coop playing as the same lord, strongwall option)...but they will be added later\nlittle lags in multiplayer, if there are a lot of units running around\nmain menu artwork isn't that great\nhorrible ingame info-vids of the AI players, when they decide to attack or want stuff...poorly done!\nthe AI hasn't changed much...they can be pretty tough, but they're predictable, don't act that smart and cheat\nno 'good karma' (monuments, garden, ...) and 'bad karma' (gallows, cages) buildings anymore [popularity bonus of church services, beer production, food and taxes is still in]\nno laddermen anymore (no tunnel diggers too, but I don't miss them, because they were bad in the original)\nI REALLY miss the voice reactions of the peasants, if you click at them\n\nConclusion:\nStronghold Crusader 2 isn't revolutionary. Nothing spectacular has changed compared to Stronghold Crusader 1. Some new stuff got added, some stuff has been changed, some stuff got cut out and everything is presented with new graphics in 3D now. As a yummy topping you're now able to play Multiplayer with no problems or workarounds. There is some stuff I really miss though. Is it bad, because there's no major advance? No, not if you ask me. Why should you change a formula, which works well? All I wanted was a updated version of Stronghold Crusader 1 with a working multiplayer via Steam, nothing more. And that's what I almost got. I'm happy with my purchase and can recommend it to all the old fans of the old Stronghold titles, which share my expectation. If you're looking for brand new mechanics and stuff, then you won't be that satisfied.\n\n7/10\n\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

Only get basic shields for your profile until you unlock the rest. You can sign up for emails from firefly to get 10 additional shields...seems odd for a full price AAA game, but alright. Couldn't figure out how to continue, so I had to restart the game.\nInto the homescreen.\n\nFirst thing I notice are DLC's being advertised down the bottom of my screen. Not too in my face, but still a bad sign. Menus seem easy to navigate. Setting up my first custom skirmish.\nNo idea what the faction-like button is and nothing explains it - no tooltips either. Nice to see some familliar faces in the enemy AI (Rat, Wolf, Sultan). About half of the faction-like head things are not available to me to pick, so I assume they are the DLC they were advertising on the homescreen. Set up a 1v1 with medium difficulty and a slight cash advantage for me because I haven't played this in a while.\n\nStart of the game seems pretty similar to Stronghold that I remember. Buildings look a little more 3D but nothing too great for 2016 graphics. Lack of tooltips still makes the game pretty confusing to pick up; thankfully my knowledge of SH will get me through the first trials. Apple orchards seem a lot smaller than I remember them, not sure how this will turn out.\n\n- Large mercenary-guarded short-cut routes could make the game interesting\n- Strategic resources guarded by animals\n- Smaller resource deposits\n- Food seemed incredibly difficult to secure (at least on the map I was playing on)\n- Mercenaries launch attacks on you (ARGHH)\n- AI doesn't suicide men into your walls if there is a long way around\n- Archers are much more realistic\n- Resources seem to take a lot longer to aquire than I remember\n- AI targets strategic resources when attacking - wood, stone and iron camps\n- Wall building is incredibly different. No different wall heights and simplified building. Still can't have diagonal gates for some reason either. Expensive AF.\n- There are estates which players can capture which bring resources in for your empire\n- Barricades make an interesting addition\n- I like the new weapon-making buildings. Removing leather armour was a good idea\n- Strategic resource bar on the side is a helpful addition\n- I wish there was some way to build a small tower outside your 'build zone' similar to the baracades. Like a wooden tower or something\n\n\nEdited connclusion: I would give this game a solid 7/10 once I played it a couple more times on an easier difficulty which helped me sit back and see more of the game. Estates are a cool idea and there are a surprisingly large amount of different ways to cross a map which I think is good. The new resource bars are a welcome addition. Overall, I think the game is an improvement over Crusader in many ways. Lack of tooltips and some overall bad ui makes the game a bit annoying.\n\nEdit 1: What I think this game really needs is a GAME TIME ADJUSTER. This is a unique RTS in that instead of starting off with simple mircomanaging and then making your way slowly towards complex systems and buildings it dumps you right into the middle of the game. You need to move FAST or you get left behind. Having a pause button (for single player anyways) would help new players get a handle on the beginning of the game. The AI can place buildings all over the map simulatneously whilst a new player must navigate around and figure everything out. Having 2 and 4 times speed would really help with the painfully slow resource intake.\n\nEdit 2: Changed some things about earlier after second playthrough","April 2","true","1.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

Knights cannot cross bridges w/o dismounting their horses which is odd considering that trebuchets can and they weigh more.\nMultiplayer also needs some small balancing issues as it stands right now it is way to easy to get a thriving economy using candles/bread/ale. Dervishes also seem to be a bit OP.\n\nIdeas for the future....\nAs far a s DLC goes a European map pack/unit pack would be something i would definetely get behind. More lush green forested maps......longbowmen possibly added as a unit.\n\nFor my review after 100 hours of gameplay and 3 patches i hereby give SHC2 a....\n8.3/ 10\n\nDepending on future updates/DLC this number can easily rise.","October 20, 2014","true","249.1"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","41","65","0","2"

Only their are more people playing this one in multiplayer but I am sure that will die out as their is little that is enticing to the repetative gameplay.

Overall, FireFly really just took the game into a different, unsuccessful direction that cripples the game from the start. The failures of this game pile up the longer you play, and you won’t be playing for long.\n\nMost of the positive reviews are from players who have never touched Stronghold:Crusader before, and are probably bots being spammed to promote sales. Almost all of the negative reviews you see for this game are from veteran players like myself whose hopes of seeing an even DECENT modern Stronghold game fade away.\n\n-What turns me off as a 10+ year Stronghold:Crusader player-\n\n-Stronghold:Crusader 2 just doesn’t seem like a finished game. Animations aren’t complete, this is most noticeable when watching the Duc Volpe (The Wolf’s) message animations, which are well done and smooth, to the paper mache, 5 frame animation for Saladin.\n-The game is dumbed down. There are no more moats, engineers, fear factor, decorative items, or laddermen.\n-The UI is ugly, and appears rushed. This looks like anyone without decent drawing skills could have done the art for the menu screens/ The main menu screen in Stronghold: Crusader looks better than the main menu in 2. The lobby UI for multiplayer doesn’t even show other players in the lobby. While some details are cool, the overall vibe is Aladdin than a brutal strategy game set in crusader times.\n-The map sizes are so small, they counter this by slowing everyones economies down, to the point where its simply not fun because you have to wait forever to get resources.\n-Stronghold:Crusader had epic campaigns, and Stronghold: Crusader 2 can only offer 3-5 mission mini stories that don’t feel as grand or as impactful as the original.\n-The gameplay is slow. This is due to the horrendous changes they made to building costs. 20 Wood for an apple farm is reasonable, but 60 wood for a dairy farm? 100 wood for a mill? How are people supposed to develop economies without falling asleep? You are guaranteed to spend all of your starting gold on wood, or die due to you being crippled by having to wait 10 minutes to collect 100 wood.\n-Castle building was thrown out the window. This is primarily due to the small map size and new clunky and slow resource mechanics. There are two wall options, thin and regular, and considering how weak walls are, if you want an enclosed keep, you have to spend at least 500-1000 stone, which by the way, will take you half an hour to accrue.\n-While the graphics are nice, you would be better off playing Age of Empires 3.\n\nThose are the primary concerns with the game. Bad gameplay, slow economy development, bad and ugly UI, and an unfinished feel, this game robs hopes of FireFly every making something as epic, or downright fun to play as Stronghold, and Stronghold:Crusader. This game is a horrendous attempt as a successor, and many veteran players would gladly go back to playing the original than wasting their time with this unfinished mess.\n\nThe anger and frustration in this review comes from the countless failed attempts FireFly has made. Stronghold 2. Stronghold 3, and now Stronghold:Crusader 2 are miserable failures, and it’s hard to comprehend why nothing has changed regarding the production of these sequels to the God-Games, Stronghold and Stronghold:Crusader. $50 is theft for an unfinished game that would never sell if it didn’t have the Stronghold name. I wouldn’t even play this game if it was free.\n\n0/10. For $50, they are stealing money from hopeful fans. There is nothing fun or exciting about this game. You are better of buying Stronghold:Crusader HD.","October 2, 2014","false","5.5"," 40 of 66 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","40","66","0","3"

The Stronghold franchise is one I have stood by through everything. Sure, there are new, more technical, more advanced games now, with new technology but you can't compare an FPS to a strategy.\n\nI started with Stronghold 2 and have played every other game since. You may have seen a lot of negative reviews on Stronghold Crusader II, allow me to counter those reasons.\n\n"It's completely different to the first one"\n- It isn't 'completely different' at all\n- It has NEW features and units, it would be different\n- The whole point of a NEW game is that it isn't 'identical' to the previous, why would you buy a sequel that was exactly the same?\n\n"It's poorly optimised"\n- I can run this game in 1080p and keep a solid 60FPS in most cases with all my settings on medium. I have a 3.1GHz processor and a discrete GPU, come on\n- They recently released a new patch with a huge bunch of optimisation tweaks\n\n"I hate it, so will you"\n- Possibly the most ignorant review ever\n- If you like Stronghold 2 and you like Stronghold Crusader, you will most likely enjoy this too\n\n\nThe new features really appeal to me. Not just in-game but lobby personalisation. Allowing you to set certain tradable goods, peace time, teams etc. Sure these were available in Stronghold 3 but the options are far better now.\n\nIf you are a lover of the Stronghold franchise, then give this game a chance.

TL:DR- Score: 8.5/10\n\n\nAfter a series of very long patches, over the course of two years, this game is finally worth the purchase.   The bugs have been fixed, minus the occashional graphical hic-up and everything has been through a balance pass.  It may not be the original Stonghold, that everyone seems to base their opinions of this game on but it has vastly improved since it released.\n\nPro:\n-Castle building is fun and simpler to use than before.  There is a lot of room for creativity, if you're creative you can design quite impressive castles.\n-There is more of everything since Crusader 1. More units, buildings, mechanics, etc..\n-The game is actually challenging!  If you don't use your resources correctly you will lose.  Which I see a lot of reviews complain about but the fact is if you can't manage your resources correctly, it's not the games fault, It's yours. Sorry.\n-Steam Workshop.  All those complaining about, "small" maps you can find hundreds of custom made skirmish maps.\n-Graphics are improved, duh, but the game does look good.\n\nNeutral:\n-The DLC is good for the price as long as it's on sale and does add a lot of content.  Especially the two newest ones.  However, they have patched in a lot of FLC as well.\n\nCon:\n-My main compaint is the way the story is set up. I miss the structure of the original strongholds mission design where you fought through each kingdom, growing powerul as you advaced. Crusaders 2 campaign is broken into trail missions which loosely tie together but each one sets you as a different lord.  Soloman or Your crusader.  However, they are still fun to play, and there are a lot of them\n-This is just a minor gripe but I would like to see units that don't stack anymore, like the Total War series.  It's not really a negative but It still bothers me.\n\nConclusion:  If you like Stonghold don't be dettered by all the old negative reviews that mean nothing because all their complaints have been fixed.  This is still Stronghold just a little different, which isn't a bad thing.  If you're on the fence, and can't decide whether or not to buy it just buy it and if you don't like it refund it.  If you do like buy all the DLC's because they add so much to the game, but only on sale like right now.\n\n\nScore: 8.5/10\n\nEdit:  I haven't put much time into the game.  Before people start calling me out, in my defense I've been waiting for all the FLC, DLC, and patches to be released to put serious hours in.  I played little by little after each patch, waiting for the right fixes and now I finally feel the game deserves a reinstall, and game time.","March 31","true","7.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","16","25","3","0"

Online play is ok minus the above.\n-Very shallow in terms of strategy, buildings and units.\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed in this release and would not recommend a purchase until heavily discounted.\n\nIf you love strategy games as I do, you might get limited enjoyment out of it- just wait until the price drops below $20.","October 20, 2014","false","7.8"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

Being such a fan from the Orginal Stronghold Crusader I saw this and bought it thinking it would be new and just as fun as the orginal, sadly I was misguided. The game wasn't even close to my expectations however it does bring back some stuff Iw as thankful for, such as Ai opponents I loved, skirmish mode and crusader trails. However it was missing lots and lots of things (overtiem these could be added) many siege equitments are gone in the game to name jsut one. The graphics of the game (personally) don't fit the experience. The troop cap is to little and the maps offer to little rescources (one map does but only 1 map, for noobs like myselft at Crusader 2 more maps with more rescources would of been better), in game map builder is gone and instead it is with steam level editor which is much more complicated for the AVERAGE person to use. The variety of the game gets dull quick and it doesn't flow very good (in my opinion). All in all I was disapointed with it and I would get it when it is on sale definately not worth $50 U.S. I give it 6/10","October 27, 2014","false","5.0"," 42 of 75 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","42","75","0","1"

I think they did a great job with the game. Some requests. So far not one bug. It's NOT SH3 again.\n\nI played Co-Op with a friend on Multiplayer and had a blast. I think they did a great job and it takes me back to the begining days of the first one (minus the moats :p). It was fun playing as long as we were on voice chat. Not sure how you could possibly play Co-Op without talking to eachother. One person handled the logistics and the building, while I handled the military aspects. I also built all the miltary devices I needed and they built the walls. I would simply state I need gold for x and wait for my partner to grant it to me.\n\nSome minor things:\nI wish catapults would take out troops. Maybe it needs more testing but it seemed I couldn't use my catapults to take out troops.\n\nIf you play as co-op on a single team and the host surrenders the game, the second person is left in the game and made host. I think that it should surrender your partner as well but there might be an argument for the way it is now.\n\nI would really like to play the Campaign on Co-Op. It would make for a more engaging game, as playing deathmatch gets old after awhile. I'd rather sandbox build with eneimes on the map or play the campaigns with a story line. That would be the ultimate.\n\nOver all I like the mechanics and the game play and the controls. I had no issues at all. It's definitely not SH3.","September 23, 2014","true","6.4"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","0"

I'll agree with anyone who says that $50 dollars for this game is pretty steep, however If you get it while it's on sale I feel that it's completely worth buying. I have played Stronghold, Stronghold 2, and Stronghold Crusader. They are all really great games and I feel that this game is just as good as those.\nMechanics wise the only gripe I would have with this one is the way houses are made. The closer your house is to your Stronghold the more populated the house becomes, however it also increases in size, so therefore it costs more wood. This isn't a problem on big maps where you can build a house on the border of your territory and it only adds 2 to 3 peasants to your overall population and costs less wood, but in small maps it's difficult because you don't have enough room to make those smaller houses, and all of your houses end up being big with 6-7 more peasants added to the popultaion which naturally means you have that many more mouths to feed, so then you need more farms while the map already has little room to spare.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7/10 I really enjoyed it.","March 20, 2015","true","31.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

But this game for me was worth the price, it has a great physics system and a large combination of buildings and units and really gives you the feel of a castle simulation RTS. The graphics are stunning, as well are not overdone so it can run easily on PC's that are less powerful than others. Currently I very much enjoy this game, however this game is rather difficult to master, and the balancing of resources and the strategy you slowly develop takes a lot of time for you to properly enjoy the game.

While stronghold 3 was horrible, this game truly brought back the wonderful stronghold feel to all the players and fans of the series. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is fun and nostalgic, the amount of different units and buildings is quite amazing, and the amount of content is something to behold. While I cannot say I am a die hard fan of the game franchise, I can say that I have played all of the stronghold games and I have enjoyed them all very much and this one is by far a new favorite of mine. It'll keep the series alive. Also, many have said that the voice acting is bad: this is simply bull-sh*t. They used may of the same exact voice lines from the other games and added new ones for the new lords. The swordsmen still say "our swords are yours!", the macemen still say "need some muscule?", the archers still say "our bows shall sing!". They are the exact lines from the other games.\n\nOne note though: I tried alt-tabbing out of the game for a minute and it crashed my pc. I thought it was just a fluke so I did it again a few hours later and it crashed my pc again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/recommended/232890/","Emperor60","Raptor Jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/","265 products in account","Stronghold Crusaders 2 somewhat fills the empty hallow that Stronghold 3 gave us. It does somethings well that older Stronghold fans like myself love, but FireFly Studios continues to fail to make a high quality Stronghold game since Stronghold 2 (My personal favorite, but the originial Stronghold is great of course).\n\nPros:\n-Great soundtrack\n-Graphics are absolutely OUTSTANDING and the best they have ever been. I thought Stronghold 3's graphics were impressive but SC3 takes it to a whole new level! It seems that FireFly has put immensive detail into every buildings, character models, and textures. But the most coolest part about the graphics was that you see the farmers walk into the grainary and physically put the apples/cheese/meats inside in their proper place; even the most smallest of details amazes me\n-Some of the orginal voiceovers remain for the units inside the barracks (except the men at arms, they seem very unmotivated and poorly made).\n-My personal favorite part was that when you try to place a building that requires wood, the same man continues to tell you "We need more wood!" That has been in the game since Stronghold 2 and it is absolutely glorious! The best part was when he said "Oh I give up" he actually gave up, left, and never came back. I absolutely lost it.\n-The curtain walls return and it makes castle building fun as it should\n-Buildings take up MUCH MUCH less space than ever before! This means you have more room to work with and place more buildings.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n-The absolutely dreadful housing system returns from Stronghold 3, which means the further you place a hovel from your keep, the less peasants you get. Which is absolutely annoying to play with when you want to play freeplay and make grand cities like before and all you can make are small huts that only support 2 peasants.\n-The Arabian voiceovers are abysmal. The older voiceovers from the original Crusaders were well made. These voiceovers sound like somebody just screamed random words into the microphone. It sounds made up and racist really. I don't speak the langauge but some more effort could of been put into it.\n-For some reason, Firefly will NEVER allow you to build walls or gate houses inside your estates. I never understood why.\n-Continuing with estates, for some reason in freebuild you can't even place buildings in them!! Even if you own it the game fails to put any buildings to enhance production or produce different resources!\n-The game seems to limit you like a parent forcing a curfew at age 22. Any sort of quarry or mine can only have a max of 4 ox teathers per building. This is extremely annoying especially if they have a long walk to the stockpile. The game is forcing me not to be able to maximize my resources.\n-You can no longer put Mangols or Billistas on top of your towers. Instead you spend more wood resouces to put them on a half-fasted wooden platform. Which it looks ridiculous and poorly made. The design of this is awful.\n-For some reason you can't place a carters post. The only have prebuilt ones for you during freebuild, but thats it. Really disappointed in that.\n------------------------------------\nFinal Verdict: Barebones Crusaders\n\nThe game isn't bad, HOWEVER its far from good. The game feels much better than Stronghold 3 and has caught my attention much longer as well. BUT ITS NOT WORTH 49.99USD. Please, do not buy this game for that much, you're EXTREMELY overpaying for this title. If you're itching to play it, go buy it on a sale. But not at full retail. You can wait to buy it. But overall, its a solid playing experience.","April 2","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I enjoyed playing sandbox, map editor, as well as some easy peesy skirmishing. It was a very peaceful game where you could decorate the castle and have a wonderful time. I had multiple copies to play with my family and friends.\n\nThis game is absolutely a worthy successor to the first.\n\nThe feel, music, and sounds are all there, but with an impressive addition of far better graphics, new units, and different enemies to face. But to compare to the old one, the resource grabbing system, map editor, sandbox, and 8 player multiplayer features are still there, as well as new defense features. Multiplayer is solid, with the ability to save your game and continue later.\n\n\nSome detriments that I sort of feel dissapointed about are the ranged units ranges, they seem rather long for the map sizes to be so small in comparison. Granted, the map sizes is about the same as the first crusader, it's a big map, but for small maps ranged units could literally snipe resource points from your own base.\n\nThe game was just released a few days ago, and there have been no crashes or game breaking glitches I have run into.\n\n\n\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a real time (midevil) strategy game set in the Middle-East Crusades. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed original crusader which sets you back in the middle east versing some familiar foes (Rat, Lion, Shah, etc) and some new comers to the series.\n\nAs this game came out recently (September 23rd, 2014) it can obviously be expected that there are some minor bugs that occur (such as small series of lag, misplace of troops, etc)\n\nIn comparison to Stronghold 3 this game is far better as it has a better hosting connectivity, less troop lag, and improved physics.\n\nMassive armies, easy to lay castle wall design, and town square layout design makes this game far easier to play.

While loading it up, I was prepared for the worst (based on the mediocre Stronghold 2 and disastrous Stronghold 3 release) but after playing for a few minutes I was surprised at how much I was enjoying it.\n\nCrusader II fully flushes out what they were trying to do with the Stronghold 3 economy. Every building in the game is expensive yet does its job well, meaning you'll constantly be weighing different strategies. Limited oasis space makes these decisions even more difficult yet rewarding. Is it better to tie up valuable space with hops farms to create ale, or make candles safely within your castle but then spend the resources on the much more expensive church? Of course, you have to defend yourself from constant attack while making these decisions.\n\nThe greatest improvement in this game over the original is the difficulty. While not being at all welcoming to newcomers of the series, veterans should be pleased at how much time you (usually) have to invest in every match before claiming victory. The AI attacks early and often, and truly grows stronger as the game progresses (much stronger). They know how to defend themselves as well. Compared to the original, you will need a much larger army to kill your opponent with a single siege.\n\nThis review is already longer than I intended but I have to touch on the combat balance as well. It is exceptionally well done. Every unit has a clear purpose and fills that role well while ignoring all other tasks. Archers, for example, are excellent against non-armoured units but next to useless against swordsmen (especially if they are escorted by a sergeant) and even conscripted peasants with pitchforks kill them easily with melee. I could come up with an example for every unit type but that would be redundant. Suffice it to say, the combat feels excellent.\n\nWith more enemy lords and campaigns being added down the road, this is definitely the game I have been waiting 12 years for.","September 26, 2014","true","155.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have only played single player so far, but now that it's playable, I find the game to be as challenging/easy as the original.\n\nI've seen a lot of people complaining about the game missing the laddermen and tunnelers.  I never used them so I don't care about that.   I don't understand the purpose of the market though.   Why have a market when you can buy things from the stock pile?  Am I missing something here?  I do miss a few things;  Engineers guild, leather armor, and the fear factor.

Why?\n\n-Decent graphical updates\n-Lots of free content, many campaigns\n-New units and buildings\n-More advanced AI\n-Many detailed improvements\n\nNow, sure, there are some cons as well. There still could be more variety in castle structures, controls are not always in favour of the player and eventhough it got a nice graphical update, it still is behind on the latest standard.

Here's my experience\nGet into an AI skirmish after playing tutorial, build 5 woodcutter huts and 2 stone quarries. No starting peace, so I decided to rush the enemy production to cripple them. I thoroughly destroyed every single woodcutter hut and farm they placed in their oasis, continued to rush slaves, and even managed to get a siege camp up with 3 trebuchet continuously firing at their castle. I build some mantlets to protect my trebuchet from ranged fire. My AI adversary just kept re-building walls and farms/woodcutters, and I kept destroying them. He even started building siege tower defense, but it didn't matter. I just kept destroying them.\n\nThis is the weird thing though. No matter how much I destroyed, he just kept building. No matter how long I besieged him he just kept building. I managed to destroy the same little area of his castle over and over again, but it just didn't matter.\n\nThis was irritating enough. My plan was to starve him to death essentially, not just with food, but with resources as well. I figured he would keep building until he ran out, and then when he was on the verge of economic collapse I would send the huge army that I'd been building to absolutely crush him inside of his castle. that economic collapse never came. Even though he wasn't producing stone anymore, he just kept rebuilding his walls, and even though his gold economy had probably died, and his wood production was non-existant, he kept building siege towers which I kept destroying.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back however, was when I was finally ready to crush him. My plan was to send in 5 flaming cards through a hole in the wall, then hit his fortress with camel heads, then send in 25 slaves followed by 2 wagons full of crossbowman, mantlets, and about 40 swordsman. I spawned the 5 flaming cards and directed them into the fortress.\n\nAs soon as they touched my trebuchet, they exploded instantly and destroyed all my mantlets and my 3 trebuchet.\n\nNo thanks.","April 3","false","11.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is suppose to be fast paced and you have to be quick to build up your castle and army I cant even begin. When i click to place any buildings i have to click the building 3 to 4 times before its highlighted and then i drag it to where i would like to place and i have to click it again 3 to 4 times to place the building and theres times where it doesnt place at all. This makes it impossible to move fast, i go the pace of a snail which makes the game unplayable. I thought it could be my computer as it only has a Nvidia GeForce 9300m GS 512MB graphics card but that cant be the case as i dont have any problems with the actual game play. I thought i would wait a few months to see if they have any patchs released and i havent seen any to fix this issue. I cant even write this review on what the game is like (tho from the few minutes i managed to play its nothing like the old crusader) as I have played every stronghold game before this with Stronghold Crusader being my favorite but this is a huge let down. I dont understand why change something that works and has a huge following, is the graphics in the old one great or amazing no, but it makes sense and was alot more appealing and user friendly then this 3-D crap which has been in all strongholds since stronghold 2 and i just find it to be a killer for the franchise which is so sad as it was one of my favorite computer games.","February 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Stronghold 2 was okay, but faaaar too difficult for someone who is horrible at RTS like me. Stronghold 3, got bored within the first ten minutes. Legends, also bored within minutes.  Stronghold Kingdoms never played, but can tell it was a horrible online game.\n\nAfter so many years of losing hope for Firefly Studios with the later games. They had finally listened to their fanbase and come to their sense with a whole new game... Stronghold Crusaders 2!\n\nStronghold Crusaders 2 is what all these Stronghold I find boring should have been. It has everything that a stronghold fan like me wants. Mechanics from the previous Crusaders, very fun and intense gameplay. The popularity meter is more focused, as they added a disaster event such as Twisters and Locust swarms. Food, Taxes, Ale rate is still on the popularity list, though I never seen a hovel popularity rate in a Stronghold game.\n\nOf course, you got the amazingly fun battle mechanics with the iconic armymen with the spearmen, who throws spears now it seems, archers, knight, swordsman, and the siege camps and the mercenary posts. Using siege weapons to take down the enemy's castle, shooting from a distance with the archer, and many strategies to take down the enemy lord! Yes, the focus of beating stronghold is killing the enemy's lord.\n\nYes, these is, of course, the fun Skirmishes and Multiplayer.

I watched in disbelief as my soldiers stopped running and stood and watched the town get sacked.

Please keep the games coming :)... I do however have a small concern with the balance of the AI on Stronghold Crusader 2. I am mainly a single player person and prefer to play skirmishes with computer lords (AI) only. I have noticed during games with computer lords that the computer lords are able to spend/use gold and resources which they do not even have stored!! This makes playing with AI a little unbalanced and unrealistic :(. This was not the case in the first Stronghold Crusader. To give you an example, at the beginning of skirmishes with computer lords you can see them training troops and completing walls with little to no stone in their stockpile and even with the starting resources set to Low. It also makes it difficult to win sieges in 1v1 matches vs AI as they can immediately rebuild their castles with no stone at all!! Computer lords can attack with very expensive and tough troops during the first 5 minutes of the game due to this....I enjoy the game, I just believe in keeping it fair. Please look into this issue for a loyal customer. Thanks!","June 5","true","80.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The logistics side of things is much more important here as you must carefully manage your resources lest you totally screw yourself over (run out of food, money, weapons).\n\nIt is much more siege-like than other RTS games I feel. Don't let the trailers fool you, no one fields armies that big. Most maps don't support forts large enough to generate such armies and it takes an hour+ to even get to the start of that scale of things. Most battles are small, between packs of units and such. Finishing long before reaching epic war levels.\n\nAdditionally - It is a slower paced RTS, which I think is nice. You really must siege your enemy to win. Its almost impossible to storm a castle in one go. Instead you need to take control of resources, starve the enemy, wear them down, and then launch multiple assaults that push progressively farther and father into their defenses to get to the lord.\n\nSo, if you like those things, then yay, you'll probably have fun.\n\nLastly, my chief complaint is that the AI is absolutely aweful. There's no difficulty controls at all. All AI are just what they are. They are also braindead and cheaters. I've burned all my opponents' food, iron, and stone only to watch them continue to send units at me without bothering to rebuild those resources. Lemme tell you... no food = no troops. Its like fighting someone from a scripted campaign where troops are just auto-generated for the story. Its atrocious.\n\nThis is a complicated game to learn. The economy is not like other strategy games and is hard to master. I've never had a problem beating the AI, even on my first aweful try where I ran out of food and had no iron for half the game.\n\nFor the only good figthts, you'll have to PvP. That's a big disappointment for me cause I hate RTS PvP. As such, I can't tell you anything about what options there are here for that.","March 26, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Yet Stronghold crusaders the orginal and extreme were great, heck most people got into the franchise becuase of Crusader. They couldn't mess it up, could they?\n\nThey went back a step\n\nNo longer: Gardens, Torturer  devices, less towers, can't dig trenches, can't scale under walls, can't mount a weapon on a tower platform, no slave slingers, less castle defenses.\n\nAdded: Few new units which some are good like the sgt of arms that boosts your soliders health. Rangers on the other hand are archers with a sword who last an extra second in battle, but took away the slaves that sling rocks.\n\nWhat the game does do right is the economics. You can't rely on selling materials anymore and things cost more when you attack you got to make it count. I wanted to see the horse back archers nerfed down which were greatly, but too much because even in a large horde they get cut down with doing almost no damage.\n\nI thought multiplayer was going to catch on this time around, but no the lounge is still empty or if you do get into a game, pepole leave.\n\nThe graphics haven't really improved though really I don't think that was a big concern for the fan base. They added a bunch of different shields and characters that I could care less about, there is no real big back story to them. I don't want the game to become pay to win, but perhaps it would have been interesting if you would have taken someone like the pig to get a buff on mace men being cheapier or stronger, or if you played Richard foot soilders cost less.\n\nSo what it comes down to it, if you enjoyed the first Crusaders I doubt you will hate this, but it's not a 50 dollar game. If you spend under 15 or 20 even your going to get more than your money's worth and spend some time in between games playing this. It's a good game to have if been playing another game for a while and want a short break.\n\nI got to give it a thumbs up because it provides some enjoyment but it's not the crusaders we all been waiting for.\n\n\n\n","January 2","true","104.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However certain tweaks and changes in the gameplay are showing.\n\nResource management is quite different and slow-paced compared to the original.\n\nSome units are nerfed and some are buffed (Crossbowman are now Gods amongst soldiers and Horse Archers are not the harass units that will carry your game any longer.)\n\nSome units that was added to the game ARE wonderful (Healers,for instance will heal your soldiers and Lord,allowing to sustain your army without depleting treasury and allow your Lord to get into engagements giving him a more active role in defence of your keep)\n\nSome units are not. (Sergeant is an heavly armored unit that buff the soldiers around him.If mass produced,he just creates an army of Mary Sue's that is very hard to counter.)\n\nThe castle building system is atricious. For example,instead of putting your tower mounted siege weapons on the top of the castle towers which was one of the trademark features of the Stronghold franchise devs decided to put the on ugly looking wooden turrets that come with the onagers. You have no option of putting them on turrets neither. There are no ditches,which was just cringe for me. No low walls so you could stop laddermen from climbing up. Towers also give little to no protection for your archers against the enemy archers which are low ground. I have seen my 42 arabian archers get completely annahilated by crossbowmen that were low ground. Towers are in variety also extremely lacking. There are only 3 types of towers in the game. They all look like the defensive turrets from SC in varying sizes which was just extremely sad thing for me to see.\n\nGood graphics makes watching your citizens work and complete production cycles even more fun.\n\nHousing system is also quite brilliant. Closer the hovels to the keep more population it brings to you (maximum being 8 and minimum 2) however that drastically changes their cost.\n\nVariety in buildings were quite disturbing. Lack of chapels and cathedrels are filled with Church. There are no ''good and bad''  buildings from the original series neither (gallows,bear dance,gallows,statues...)\n\nI would also like to state that besides the burning haystack throwing onager the mounted siege weapons are also pretty much useless.\n\nThis game is NOT the Stronghold Crusader that we played and loved years ago. However it is still worth a shot since devs are updating. I am hoping they will bring back the good old buildings from the original game and HOPEFULLY fix the atricious mounted siege equipments. This hope is the reason I recommend this. I guess being a die-hard fan also helps. This game is fun,however if you are expecting SC you will be dissapointed.\n\n","November 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It really feels good to command endless units in desert warfare, while fighting with the constant need for gold, popularity and supplies. SHC2 gameplay is a bit more stale in the economic side, but more mobile in the military side and the new units+buildings fit very much into it.\n- The Skirmish mode is what carries the game on its back: largely customizable games against and with the AI and human players provide virtually endless possibilities. You can even work on the same castle with your friend, and the AI can be quite challenging even for veteran players with its offensive attitude. Creating and shaping castles on your own style is the true beauty of this game and succeeding in defending it gives a rare feeling of accomplishment, even from game to game.\n- Player customization feels alright. You can choose your own crest, your own name and building style, and there is no more need for some casual play. However, there is no option to differentiate yourself more with i.e. some lifetime stats or ranks. There are achievements, sure, but they don't feel as much yours as some custom accomplishments, as everyone can earn them.\n- In story and character detail, Crusader 2 is sort of a setback compared to Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader's skirmish trails. There is virtually no story in any point of the game, and AI characters have descriptions no longer than a few lines. While the game partially succeeds in hiding the importance of a story for playing skirmishes all the time, the skirmish trails still feel bland for not having at least an average storyline.\n\nAll in all, while Stronghold Crusader 2 may not appear strong story-wise, it delivers excellent gameplay and a great feeling for it. 8/10","January 2","true","97.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Many useful buildings (such as the much needed popularity buildings, and the replacement of the different religious buildings with a one-size-fits-all church or mosque) and beloved characters, including the dastardly pig, snake, etc. have been removed in exchange for a handful of what in my opinion are much worse characters.  The economy has lost much depth from one game to the next, many systems (such as leather or hunting) have been trashed in favor of unifying the materials needed to recruit troops (ex: crossbowmen now use plate armor rather than leather).  Not to mention that units such as the horseback archer, engineer, laddermen, miners, and monks have all been discarded, removing an entire aspect of seige warfare from the game.\nThis being said, however, there have been a few good additions to the game, namely more in-depth castle defense (meaning a handful of new defense buildings), even though the developers got rid of moats.  Those of you who have played Stronghold 3 will be glad to know that hoardings and barricades have survived into Crusader II, along with seige engine towers.  The (formerly much-needed) healer unit can now be recruited at the mercenary post.  I'm sure I missed many other changes, but those were the biggest changes that I could recall.\n\nI'll stop here since I'm just plain tired, but in conclusion, Stronghold 1 fans should avoid purchasing this (overall disappointing) game.","January 16, 2015","false","6.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

When I first started I thought they could have done more with the graphics. I noticed they got rid of things like having honor to train troops, trenches/moats, gate with a draw bridge (I really liked it), and a lot of castle cosmetics such as a basket of rock to place on wall to drop on enemies.\n\nI did like how they changed the way you do battle in skirmish mode. You can set it up to battle against every lord on the map instead of them battling among themselves. In other words they focus completely on you. That’s a really nice feature they added.\n\nThey have some new troops or at least to me. There are some troops that throw fire bombs. They’re great for defending your gate. Get enough of them throwing bombs in one spot and watch enemies turn into crispy critters. Being able to download new maps in Steams workshop is also nice.\n\nBUT the game crashes and acts funny too much for what they’re asking for it. For example I noticed there were a few troops sitting outside my gate that wouldn’t die. No Problem right? Well I couldn’t repair my walls and had to reload game because they were close to breaching my walls. Also, they were killing all of my bowman I had sitting in a tower. After reloading game I saw the troops in question all at once die.\n\nOther things like dragging and dropping were you want to be on the map stops working after a battle. I'm so sick of having to reload the game for small problems. it does work but it seems the more I play it the more bugs I notice. The bugs must be like germen cockroaches because they can't seem to get rid of them and the game has been out long enough.\n\nI felt I got ripped off myself and I bought the game on sale. It’s an okay game. But this has to do with whether I would recommend it or not. That’s why I’m giving it a thumbs down.","February 10","false","68.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Some of the skirmishes are fun but most give you no resources to battle against 5 lords.  There is no time for planning or strategy, just clicking as fast as you can to build repair and try to make some troops.  The high level skirmishes just dont give you a chance expecially after the nerfing.  Your bombarded with attacks of huge armies right from the git go and it never stops.   THe only way to win is to save often because in the midst of furious clicking sometimes you make a mistake and then your screwed.  The game is way too frustrating and the strategy is gone.  For instance, you just get your economy set up and your hit with 50 crossbowmen and 50 knights.  Most of the later skirmishes dont give you any stone, iron or pitch for resources so your forced to make hundreds of candles to try and get some gold.  First stronghold gave you moats which would buy you a bit of time, now there are no moats.  Once again its just click to set up as fast as you can and even when you win it doesnt feel like it involved any strategy.","January 21","false","92.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

I bought it on sale, in one last hope that Firefly Worlds would get their ♥♥♥♥ together. Apparently not, even though they took their time, published the game themselves, and worked out the kinks from a typical (post SH1/SC1) buggy release. Many complaints of fans are left unadressed, such as tiny maps, and lack of any modability. It takes elements from All games and blends them together, for some undesirable results.\n\nI never thought building a castle would feel like a game of tetris. this wasn't a huge issue in the old games. Quite frankly, it's clear the developers dont give a ♥♥♥♥. Unless their new project completely blows my mind i intend to never buy a single thing from firefly again.\n\nIn summary... If you liked SH2 and SC1, you'll probably have some cheap thrills from this game. Wait till it goes for 10 bucks unless you're dying to play it now. As is, its only marginally better than Sh2, and i wont even meantion SH3 because that didn't count. The developers seem to think that way too with their "Gold" turd being completely disavowed.","November 8, 2015","false","3.1"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

So the game itself plays decently according to the Stronghold games but only on certain mechanics of its RTS base ground. NONE of its uniqueness carried on with this game at all. Matter of fact it’s all gone now, the dancing bears, decorations, what made your castle feel like a castle and not a regular RTS base builder base. It used to have vast problems to fix with your people, people even just running around and little things like executions and punishments you can watch them all do that you can’t do here anymore because they made it streamlined. I made the mistake of trusting the game but not even an hour in game told me that I definitely wasted my 50$ that I could have spent ALOT better elsewhere. Get this at a lower price if you want it, ignore peaceful mode unless you just want to stare into nothingness due the games now basing a lot on the RTS side and not its castle sim side which made peaceful mode at least slightly entertaining. But now the game unless a patch improves this IS NOT considered in my opinion a castle building simulator due to its lack of castle life that used to exist that made the other games more unique and different. the entire franchise except the past 2 have been going quite well, unfortunately this games not getting the taste of stronghold I hoped for, but I do hope they add it back in the future because that’s one of the things that made stronghold a different RTS game.","December 15, 2014","false","4.7"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","0"

Numerous times, I've been "seiged" by cheating (a LOT of cheating) AI where, by having a single tiny hole in my castle walls at the very back of my castle, the enemy sends everything they have through that hole, walking past, through, and over traps, defenses, and archers. Never once have I really felt a challenge from the AI that wasn't related to their massive economic cheats.\n\nThe bugs are relatively ok, I haven't encountered any major, gamebreaking bugs (nothing like SH3's "dogs walk up ladders").\n\nPathfinding: Walls are to be seiged or used by archers, nothing else. One of the first campaign missions asks you to seige a small, minor AI settlement. It is defended by 2 towers with a handful of enemies. My first approach was to amass as many small units as I could and send them up to the towers to kill the archers. However, my units were completely incapable of using new fangled technologies like "stairs" to the point their 5(?) archers killed 20 of my units because no matter how many commands I gave them, "stairs" and "walking" became too complex for them. This was only the 2nd or 3rd mission, a tutorial mission, that was rendered impossible to win because my units literally could not walk to the enemy.\n\nIf you want a good SH game, go buy SH Crusader 1, it's a good game, it's not 3d, but it has better/more mechanics with less bugs and far better gameplay.","November 13, 2014","false","15.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

They got a lot wrong here in an effort to make it a game more based on war rather then economy, and the end result is unfortunately not all that fun. let me explain why.\n\nThe devs said over and over while the game was in development that they were trying to recreate the fast paced skirmish mode feel you got when you played the origional stronghold crusader. While this is a good intention, the end result pretty much adds up to the enemy sending countless waves of small suicide squadrons to your castle CONSTANTLY, never bothering to create larger seige forces as a reaction to your castle growing larger. It is flat out tedious. At the end of a skirmish match when it says you killed literally around 3,000 enemy archers, you just want to smack yourself in the face.\n\nThey also majorly streamlined the popularity and economic systems from previous games, so now keeping your people happy is as simple as making sure they have food. Making money boils down to making ridiculously high numbers of breweries and candle shops so your peasants are happy enough that you can raise your taxes. So your castle will always be the biggest candle factory and beer company in the Holy Land. Thats very realistic.\n\nApart from that, they also decided to take out the funny little things your peasants said when you click on them, which is kinda sad, and they descided to release more AI opponents two by two in DLCs, after only giving you an insulting eight opponents at launch, while the origional Crusader gave you eleven at launch. and for this high price? its a rip off.\n\nSorry Stronghold fans, this was not the redemtion from Stronghold 3 that you were looking for. At least it functions, though.","June 3, 2015","false","37.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

Been all the way through everything ever made with this brand name (although managed to be scared away from Stronghold 3 by the 1-star rating on Amazon, and some of the most scathing reviews I think I have ever seen on a game).  By now, started to experience withdrawal symptoms because I changed PC and most of my SH games wouldn't work on Win 8 except for Legends. Saw Crusader II being advertised and was relieved...thank you, thank you, thank you...did some homework, watched some youtube playthroughs, and everything looked grand, but...\n\nThe game won't even run on my PC except in the lowest graphic setting, and then the buildings and everything looks awful.  Secondly, is it my imagination or are there only a total of about 12 buildings that can be built? Seems so very few now. If you are going to re-release a game, wouldn't a bit more content for the quite ridiculous price not be the order of the day? I saw that there are add-ons purchasable for it, but come on...I've already paid £22.99 and I've got to pay more for add-ons? Feel pretty stupid because I feel I have totally wasted my money.

We won't mention Stronghold 2 or 3 however. So you can imagine just how excited I was when I see Stronghold: Crusader II announced!\n\nFirst Impressions:\nNostalgic feeling.\nGameplay & controls are the same.\nGraphics are the same as Stronghold 2/3. Hardly much improvement. If any.\nPositives:\nRetains all the qualities of a Stronghold game. Have I already mentioned it's nostalgic?\nPlenty of campaign options and DLC for bonus content.\nThankfully they've incorporated a custom skirmish mode, unlike some previous Stronghold games.\nMultiplayer is fun - but testing.\nNegatives:\nThey've removed some content;\nSuch as when you click on a building, you could select between "Bow" and "Crossbow" for example. Now you need to build separate buildings for these and many other things you used to once be able to make your buildings multi-purpose.\nThey've removed mini-video content of the buildings when you used to click on them.\nThere's very little that's new. This just feels like the first Stronghold Crusader - very disappointing.\nOverall:\nThis game is most definitely NOT worth the price it's been retailed at. I am a massive Stronghold fan and sure, they've had their ups and downs with previous games, but I thought they might've made this game the polished diamond of the series thus far - however, it falls very short of being anything better than the first Stronghold Crusader game.\n\nI'm very saddened they haven't ventured anywhere new with the game. The units are the same, apart from a few new additional units you can purchase from the Mercenary Camp. Otherwise, they've taken A LOT of the content away and made the game feel very bare... No, I'm not even joking.\n\nI'd rate this game 4/10, it's very disappointing.\nThey've gone nowhere new with it and even stripped it back, making it feel empty.

The only downside I have is the map editor being its seperate program, but that's just me, it's still an awesome program regardless.\n\nMy only issue with the main gameplay, however, is the Caliph... ¬~¬ (that is the only time I'll have a face on here, ever) He looks TOO CLOSE to being an Englishman, rather than an Arab inhabitant of the desert. I'd prefer the turban and bandit face mask he had from the first Stronghold Crusader game, than this guy with the face of an Englishman and the beard of a muslim, with the voice of an Englishman's attempt at an Arabic-English-influenced accent. Fix that one part to where he should be originally, then I'm pretty much good and set for the rest of the gameplay.\n\nYes, there are others who are posting NEGATIVE comments about this game, but from what I can tell, most of them have valid arguments regarding what they think are the biggest issues, but there are also those who think "Oh, this game is too damn expensive." That's because they either a) didn't work in a job, or b) would rather be cheapskates and buy it for the lowest price possible. Here's a life lesson tip for ya, and I learned this the hard way: Gaming IS NOT a stock market! You don't haggle the price, the donors to the companies who makes these games DO. We just buy a provided product. Deal with it. The ones with the most valid arguments are largely about the in-game issues, such as the lag and the bugs and all the other things; I want to make it known here and now in the next paragraph below.\n\nThe issues about the problems in-game?\nTHESE WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED IN TIME!! TRUST YOUR DEVELOPING OVERLORDS AT FIREFLY!\n\nYes, it was a joke they're the overlords, but the analogy suggests why I included the term anyway; the issues found about bugs and lag and terrible multiplayer gameplay WILL be addressed, but with TIME can it be done. Yes, they will release patches, but the sheer amount of coding it takes for these issues to be released as a massive conglomerate of coding fixes for the bugs and the lag and multiplayer gameplay takes a huge amount of time, so ALL PLAYERS NEED TO BE PATIENT FOR THEIR RELEASE(S)! Please respect the amount of work the developers put into this game for YOU guys to judge this, BASED ON what you experienced already.\n\nThe developers will take the time out of their lives to provide for you guys the fixes you demand, so PLEASE respect their time, devotion, and dedication to make you guys happy. Accept what they are and what they HAVE given you.\n\nNow, this game's many issues I've experienced, but I have no quarrel with them, as I experience lag a lot on Minecraft and Sins of a Solar Empire, compared to this. That is nothing to me. Bugs? I flick them off as I do real ones. Price? REASONABLE! Buy it at Target, if you want it cheap. I payed $20.00 for this game and 2 extra non-included DLC as I would only get the regular game from this store page.\n\nLong story short, this game is great, has major/minor in-game issues, players need to respect developer dedication and work to this game, and price is very reasonable, stop being crusty cheapskates.\n\n","August 10, 2015","true","114.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

I was disappointed right from the start. I will address my issues in the order I came across them. Forgive me if I sound petty but I had such excitement for this game and to come across an intro that looks like it came from a 15 year old game was utterly disheartening. I tried to push the fail image of two poorly animated warriors, one who vaguely looks of jack sparrow, out of my mind upon entering the game. The menu seemed ok, nothing wrong at first glance. Looking at the single player options though I was again remorseful. Hardly any missions and nothing that matched the wonderful historic castle mode from the first game. I played every castle in the original stronghold and hoped to see it return with an Arab twist but foolish me. I then chose to see how the game play was. I gasped when it loaded, it seemed like a direct copy of stronghold 2. To say my excitement was dead is an understatement. Pretty epic though, you killed my desire to keep playing this new game in fifteen minutes.\nSomehow I managed to keep going despite this sickening feeling in my stomach. I think the final blow was the stunning lack of features I had come to love. It baffles me how you choose to keep such a mundane feature like STAIRS on the barracks but completely destroy all the cool towers and their features. I thought that being able to put troops inside towers was one of the coolest features. Putting siege equipment on large towers a no-brainer, to now be left with stupid ballista scaffolds.... WHAT?! Those would be a great addition to have but not the only option. If you would finally add wooden palisades from the first Stronghold and create some further options with that, then you might have a great set of features. However like I have come to expect from your company you bring more disappointment than Bungie's new story free MMOFPS garbage. Not to mention the lack of innovative wall traps, stone baskets, monks, leather armor, wax for candles (currently material free production), siege towers, diggers, ladder men, moats, workers who repair walls automatically, short walls, and one of the most annoying the ability to lower building height so I can avoid everything getting in my way. Have you tried to build walls it your own game? It can take like 30 seconds to get the wall icon to appear in an area because it is on a corner or near a building. Unless the idea is just build a square and forget about actually making an interesting castle..... IN A CASTLE SIM. Pretty sad when you can't improve on a game you made almost 15 years ago.\nI got the game so I could play it with my wife. Stronghold crusader was one of the few games we enjoyed together. Besides for the new one lacking anything exciting or innovative, we need to deal with the worst optimization I have ever experienced. I bought two new computers in anticipation of this games release. To say it runs like dog excrement would be praise. Playing this game over steam with anything over three players on lowest setting is impossible for us. The only thing I have to say to you as a company is this. You are just as useless as EA and Activision if you think you can phone it in like this and promise to make it better with DLC. Why should I give you more money to fail? These things should have already been in the game! It is clear to see you took the mass market video game cookie cutter formula. Make a game and promise how awesome it will be. Focus test everything, then remove every part that might confuse a simpleton. I am surprised you still include Crusaders and Arabs, they might offend someone.","October 7, 2014","false","56.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

Don't believe any hype or marketing statements. I'm a huge fan of Stronghold Crusader but not the Stronghold series. This sequel changed EVERYTHING that made the original so good. The style of the game is like the original stronghold and feels slow when trying to place buildings. I don't know what to call it; gameplay, interface, style, layout or actually all of them, but it changed too much. The graphics are actually worse. This game was a waste of money. Certain concepts with the siege equipent were good. The game had a process of which you had to watch take place and had control of (and could manipulate during warfare or running an efficient economy) which are not there anymore. I can't stand to play it very long because it looks awful.\n","June 28, 2015","false","5.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

First of all, if your a fan of the series, wait till this game goes on sale. For a big name game being just released, this is pretty sad for the most part. The graphics are good, not great or at least not great compared to other games you are paying for these days. The battle side of the game is pretty frusterating... The units move very quickly and instead of using "strategy" to bring a castle down, pretty much need to just throw overwhelming odds of troops to win each battle/castle. Bottomline, not much strategy is necessary. Like city building? This game isn't for you either, it could take you hours to get your castle built and tweeked just the way you like it but it will get destroyed in seconds. The walls basically buy you a minute or two to react or they are coming down.\n\nOverall, this is a $20 game or less, not up to date with today's standards. The AI is also horrible, its impossible to play against them, you basically need to build up a defense ASAP and hold off their waves they are sending at you while you build up a wave of your own, they essentually have unlimited resources too which is annoying. The game is pretty laggy too which is sad, I exceed all of the requirements and even toned back the not so great graphics so I'm guessing this is still alittle buggy.\n\nEven if the AIs are fixed, the overall battling is poor and lacks any strategy. Its hard to experiment with troops when their impact is only noticed if they have armor or not. Overall... buy this on sale.\n\nUpdate 10/17\n\nThey updated the game, they fixed the resources issue for AIs (They seemed to have unlimited before) They did not fix gameplay performance however... still very glitchy, some aspects have gotten worse. Some units glitch and glide across the map now. It would be a huge improvement if they would just slow down the speed of units and attack of units, its hard to use the features/benefits of the units when the units move and attack so fast, by the time you decide on troop placement, the battle is probably over and the winning side is clearly winning. The game now crashes, never had this issue. The glitchy movement is still very present while playing, making some commands unregistered. Not a great release still, not worth the money spent upfront either yet unfortunately, i'll start playing again when they release another update.","September 28, 2014","false","11.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

If I wanted someone to guide me through a video game I'd get real drunk and go on Twitch.\n\nPros:\n1. YOUCANTTAKEMYCASTLE,KNAVE,TRY. Seriously, using the catapault on other dudes' castles was hella nice.\n2. YOURFOODSTOCKSAREGROWING. The devs did get some of the charm from the original game.\n3. Stronghold Crusader in 3d is good looking.\n4. The Rat can smack talk you... in 3d!\n\nCons:\n1. GOODMORNINGYOURLORDSHIP and silly profile quips when clicking on peasants are missing. This was one of my favorite parts of the original game. Small, subtle, but it's this kind of charm that you can't leave out due to taking a AA name.\n2. Can't issue more than one order to troops at a time. This was how it was done in Stronghold Crusader, but it's 2014. Look at Planetary Annihilation, a successful RTS, and you can get a rough idea of how troop command should be handled.\n3. Hated the territory system from the other games, extraordinarily disappointed in myself for not realizing it would be in this game. Disappointed in the devs for implementing it here as well.\n4. Renamed Spearman - seriously.\n\nThey had 12 years to understand how to merge Stronghold Crusader and the current set of expectations for video games. They dropped the ball. There is so much wasted potential here.\n\nAvoid, definitely, avoid.

Looking at the single player options though I was again remorseful. Hardly any missions and nothing that matched the wonderful historic castle mode from the first game. I played every castle in the original stronghold and hoped to see it return with an Arab twist but foolish me. I then chose to see how the game play was. I gasped when it loaded, it seemed like a direct copy of stronghold 2. To say my excitement was dead is an understatement. Pretty epic though, you killed my desire to keep playing this new game in fifteen minutes.\nSomehow I managed to keep going despite this sickening feeling in my stomach. I think the final blow was the stunning lack of features I had come to love. It baffles me how you choose to keep such a mundane feature like STAIRS on the barracks but completely destroy all the cool towers and their features. I thought that being able to put troops inside towers was one of the coolest features. Putting siege equipment on large towers a no-brainer, to now be left with stupid ballista scaffolds.... WHAT?! Those would be a great addition to have but not the only option. If you would finally add wooden palisades from the first Stronghold and create some further options with that, then you might have a great set of features. However like I have come to expect from your company you bring more disappointment than Bungie's new story free MMOFPS garbage. Not to mention the lack of innovative wall traps, stone baskets, monks, leather armor, wax for candles (currently material free production), siege towers, diggers, ladder men, moats, workers who repair walls automatically, short walls, and one of the most annoying the ability to lower building height so I can avoid everything getting in my way. Have you tried to build walls it your own game? It can take like 30 seconds to get the wall icon to appear in an area because it is on a corner or near a building. Unless the idea is just build a square and forget about actually making an interesting castle..... IN A CASTLE SIM. Pretty sad when you can't improve on a game you made almost 15 years ago.\nI got the game so I could play it with my wife. Stronghold crusader was one of the few games we enjoyed together. Besides for the new one lacking anything exciting or innovative, we need to deal with the worst optimization I have ever experienced. I bought two new computers in anticipation of this games release. To say it runs like dog excrement would be praise. Playing this game over steam with anything over three players on lowest setting is impossible for us. The only thing I have to say to you as a company is this. You are just as useless as EA and Activision if you think you can phone it in like this and promise to make it better with DLC. Why should I give you more money to fail? These things should have already been in the game! It is clear to see you took the mass market video game cookie cutter formula. Make a game and promise how awesome it will be. Focus test everything, then remove every part that might confuse a simpleton. I am surprised you still include Crusaders and Arabs, they might offend someone.","October 7, 2014","false","56.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

Don't believe any hype or marketing statements. I'm a huge fan of Stronghold Crusader but not the Stronghold series. This sequel changed EVERYTHING that made the original so good. The style of the game is like the original stronghold and feels slow when trying to place buildings. I don't know what to call it; gameplay, interface, style, layout or actually all of them, but it changed too much. The graphics are actually worse. This game was a waste of money. Certain concepts with the siege equipent were good. The game had a process of which you had to watch take place and had control of (and could manipulate during warfare or running an efficient economy) which are not there anymore. I can't stand to play it very long because it looks awful.\n","June 28, 2015","false","5.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

First of all, if your a fan of the series, wait till this game goes on sale. For a big name game being just released, this is pretty sad for the most part. The graphics are good, not great or at least not great compared to other games you are paying for these days. The battle side of the game is pretty frusterating... The units move very quickly and instead of using "strategy" to bring a castle down, pretty much need to just throw overwhelming odds of troops to win each battle/castle. Bottomline, not much strategy is necessary. Like city building? This game isn't for you either, it could take you hours to get your castle built and tweeked just the way you like it but it will get destroyed in seconds. The walls basically buy you a minute or two to react or they are coming down.\n\nOverall, this is a $20 game or less, not up to date with today's standards. The AI is also horrible, its impossible to play against them, you basically need to build up a defense ASAP and hold off their waves they are sending at you while you build up a wave of your own, they essentually have unlimited resources too which is annoying. The game is pretty laggy too which is sad, I exceed all of the requirements and even toned back the not so great graphics so I'm guessing this is still alittle buggy.\n\nEven if the AIs are fixed, the overall battling is poor and lacks any strategy. Its hard to experiment with troops when their impact is only noticed if they have armor or not. Overall... buy this on sale.\n\nUpdate 10/17\n\nThey updated the game, they fixed the resources issue for AIs (They seemed to have unlimited before) They did not fix gameplay performance however... still very glitchy, some aspects have gotten worse. Some units glitch and glide across the map now. It would be a huge improvement if they would just slow down the speed of units and attack of units, its hard to use the features/benefits of the units when the units move and attack so fast, by the time you decide on troop placement, the battle is probably over and the winning side is clearly winning. The game now crashes, never had this issue. The glitchy movement is still very present while playing, making some commands unregistered. Not a great release still, not worth the money spent upfront either yet unfortunately, i'll start playing again when they release another update.","September 28, 2014","false","11.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

A slapped mashup of Stronghold 2 and some texture packs? The biggest slap on the face was the junior high drawing of an assassin on the main menu.\n\nI didn't touch the campaign because I honestly don't give an F. If I wanted someone to guide me through a video game I'd get real drunk and go on Twitch.\n\nPros:\n1. YOUCANTTAKEMYCASTLE,KNAVE,TRY.

This was one of my favorite parts of the original game. Small, subtle, but it's this kind of charm that you can't leave out due to taking a AA name.\n2. Can't issue more than one order to troops at a time. This was how it was done in Stronghold Crusader, but it's 2014. Look at Planetary Annihilation, a successful RTS, and you can get a rough idea of how troop command should be handled.\n3. Hated the territory system from the other games, extraordinarily disappointed in myself for not realizing it would be in this game. Disappointed in the devs for implementing it here as well.\n4. Renamed Spearman - seriously.\n\nThey had 12 years to understand how to merge Stronghold Crusader and the current set of expectations for video games. They dropped the ball. There is so much wasted potential here.\n\nAvoid, definitely, avoid.

This gives the game a much more fast-paced gameplay in the Skirmish Mode.\nCompared to Crusader 1 or SH2, the units also seem to be better balanced. Spamming Horse Archers or Knights is for example much more difficult than in the previous game(s), because they can now be countered easily by macemen or whirling dervishes.\nThe whole combat system in general is improved by special abilites the units have. So instead of having useless and useful units like in Crusader 1, the game has offensive and defensive units with their own abilities. This gives armies a certain variety that can also be seen in games like Age of Empires 2.\nI also feel like the current AI Lords are way harder to beat than in Crusader 1:\nWhen the Rat is building catapults (so his sieges are not completely useless ;D) and the Wolf builds a stronghold that lets your castle look like a hovel, you know ♥♥♥♥ just got serious :D\nBut despite these aspects the game still has many flaws that need be patched and improved.\nThe most important would be performance improvement and bug fixing.\nOn big maps with many opponents the framerate drops under 20fps even on good PCs.\nAlso knights are sometimes unable to get on their horses or units stop moving entirely.\nIn terms of balancing there are still some things the developers need to change:\nThey already lowered the wood cost of woodcutters in previous patches, but there are still some buildings that seem a little bit too expensive, for example the market that becomes unvaluable through its 500 gold price or mills that cost 200 wood each (guys I want my awesome bread empire back :D).\nDespite that they need to add some more NPC Lords( Ssssnake plz :D), Units and buildings that are missing ( for example ladders, tunnels, moats, Gardens and voice overs for your peasents).\nAll in all this game is different from the Stronghold games. It may not feel that much like a complex castle simulator anymore, but more like a well balanced Strategy Game with castle building elements.\nFact is, there aren´t many games today that have this kind of gameplay, so Crusader 2 has a unique gameplay.\nDepite its current issues I recommend this game to everyone that likes strategy games and/or the stronghold series, but keep in mind that there are patches coming that may be improving the game that much, that games like Aoe2 or Command and Conquer have a serious competitor.\nIn Germany we would say:\n"Abwarten und Tee trinken." :D","October 20, 2014","true","68.3"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","15","30","0","0"

The only downside I have is the map editor being its seperate program, but that's just me, it's still an awesome program regardless.\n\nMy only issue with the main gameplay, however, is the Caliph... ¬~¬ (that is the only time I'll have a face on here, ever) He looks TOO CLOSE to being an Englishman, rather than an Arab inhabitant of the desert. I'd prefer the turban and bandit face mask he had from the first Stronghold Crusader game, than this guy with the face of an Englishman and the beard of a muslim, with the voice of an Englishman's attempt at an Arabic-English-influenced accent. Fix that one part to where he should be originally, then I'm pretty much good and set for the rest of the gameplay.\n\nYes, there are others who are posting NEGATIVE comments about this game, but from what I can tell, most of them have valid arguments regarding what they think are the biggest issues, but there are also those who think "Oh, this game is too damn expensive." That's because they either a) didn't work in a job, or b) would rather be cheapskates and buy it for the lowest price possible. Here's a life lesson tip for ya, and I learned this the hard way: Gaming IS NOT a stock market! You don't haggle the price, the donors to the companies who makes these games DO. We just buy a provided product. Deal with it. The ones with the most valid arguments are largely about the in-game issues, such as the lag and the bugs and all the other things; I want to make it known here and now in the next paragraph below.\n\nThe issues about the problems in-game?\nTHESE WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED IN TIME!! TRUST YOUR DEVELOPING OVERLORDS AT FIREFLY!\n\nYes, it was a joke they're the overlords, but the analogy suggests why I included the term anyway; the issues found about bugs and lag and terrible multiplayer gameplay WILL be addressed, but with TIME can it be done. Yes, they will release patches, but the sheer amount of coding it takes for these issues to be released as a massive conglomerate of coding fixes for the bugs and the lag and multiplayer gameplay takes a huge amount of time, so ALL PLAYERS NEED TO BE PATIENT FOR THEIR RELEASE(S)! Please respect the amount of work the developers put into this game for YOU guys to judge this, BASED ON what you experienced already.\n\nThe developers will take the time out of their lives to provide for you guys the fixes you demand, so PLEASE respect their time, devotion, and dedication to make you guys happy. Accept what they are and what they HAVE given you.\n\nNow, this game's many issues I've experienced, but I have no quarrel with them, as I experience lag a lot on Minecraft and Sins of a Solar Empire, compared to this. That is nothing to me. Bugs? I flick them off as I do real ones. Price? REASONABLE! Buy it at Target, if you want it cheap. I payed $20.00 for this game and 2 extra non-included DLC as I would only get the regular game from this store page.\n\nLong story short, this game is great, has major/minor in-game issues, players need to respect developer dedication and work to this game, and price is very reasonable, stop being crusty cheapskates.\n\n","August 10, 2015","true","114.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

Firefly studios has failed to do anything substantive with their series and its following ever since the first Crusader was a success. This Stronghold proudly follows in this manner.\n\n\nThe following did annoy me a bit:\n\nThe UI is clunky and outdated. Things are hidden away or put in obscure places that dont need to be.\nPathing is terrible. The pathing example for first time coders, 'Ants' on Netbeans does a better job.\nUnits dont seem to like being on walls.\nQuirks from the previous Crusader like the tongue in cheek humour from clicking on peasents is gone.\nUnit graphics are over all poor.\n\nTo me this just seems largely reflective of the gaming industry as a whole.

After Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, this series went straight to hell. Fireflys studios has either been replaced with all new people, or the old team has lost their creative spark. I really enjoyed the first two games for their minimalist approach on medieval warfare, but that has since been replaced with excessive features and components. This game is just cluttered with soldiers, peasants (villagers), and other buildings and requirements that you have to worry about. It doesn't have a smooth flow to it, and it underperforms greatly for the year in which it was released.\n\nThis studio has been leeching off the success of its games released over a decade ago. They have failed to come out with anything good in relation to the "Stronghold" series since those first two games. Don't take my word for it, look at metacritic. This game is not fun.\n\nLastly, Firefly Studios, you really disappointed me with your customer service. I ordered the game with a description stating that I *would* receive the bonus campaigns, but I never received them. To my surprise, your support was less than willing to help in any way possible. Because of that, I had an extremely short campaign experience. It's laughable that you sell your game like this to all new customers now. Holding back on content never helps the consumer.\n\nIt appears both the game and team behind the game are of lack-luster quality. To all potential customers, spend your money elsewhere.","October 14, 2015","false","11.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Firefly studios has failed to do anything substantive with their series and its following ever since the first Crusader was a success. This Stronghold proudly follows in this manner.\n\n\nThe following did annoy me a bit:\n\nThe UI is clunky and outdated. Things are hidden away or put in obscure places that dont need to be.\nPathing is terrible. The pathing example for first time coders, 'Ants' on Netbeans does a better job.\nUnits dont seem to like being on walls.\nQuirks from the previous Crusader like the tongue in cheek humour from clicking on peasents is gone.\nUnit graphics are over all poor.\n\nTo me this just seems largely reflective of the gaming industry as a whole.

High cost of buildings makes mistakes more costly. The introduction of the healer unit was a welcome breath of fresh air which has helped to offset the impact of the nerfs across the board i.e. long cooldown between launching mad cows and more, which have helped to balance the game. Pikemen have now become strategic chokepoint units, something which makes pikemen more relevant as the ultimate defensive unit. Players can look forward to a certain degree of challenge when playing this game. (Coming from someone who completed the entire stronghold crusader series)\n\nHowever, something is wrong with the pitch pits, sometimes the workers just cant get out of the pitch pits and there isn't any fancy options for decorating your castle.\n","November 10, 2015","true","77.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

By now, started to experience withdrawal symptoms because I changed PC and most of my SH games wouldn't work on Win 8 except for Legends. Saw Crusader II being advertised and was relieved...thank you, thank you, thank you...did some homework, watched some youtube playthroughs, and everything looked grand, but...\n\nThe game won't even run on my PC except in the lowest graphic setting, and then the buildings and everything looks awful.  Secondly, is it my imagination or are there only a total of about 12 buildings that can be built? Seems so very few now. If you are going to re-release a game, wouldn't a bit more content for the quite ridiculous price not be the order of the day? I saw that there are add-ons purchasable for it, but come on...I've already paid £22.99 and I've got to pay more for add-ons? Feel pretty stupid because I feel I have totally wasted my money.

Hardly much improvement. If any.\nPositives:\nRetains all the qualities of a Stronghold game. Have I already mentioned it's nostalgic?\nPlenty of campaign options and DLC for bonus content.\nThankfully they've incorporated a custom skirmish mode, unlike some previous Stronghold games.\nMultiplayer is fun - but testing.\nNegatives:\nThey've removed some content;\nSuch as when you click on a building, you could select between "Bow" and "Crossbow" for example. Now you need to build separate buildings for these and many other things you used to once be able to make your buildings multi-purpose.\nThey've removed mini-video content of the buildings when you used to click on them.\nThere's very little that's new. This just feels like the first Stronghold Crusader - very disappointing.\nOverall:\nThis game is most definitely NOT worth the price it's been retailed at. I am a massive Stronghold fan and sure, they've had their ups and downs with previous games, but I thought they might've made this game the polished diamond of the series thus far - however, it falls very short of being anything better than the first Stronghold Crusader game.\n\nI'm very saddened they haven't ventured anywhere new with the game. The units are the same, apart from a few new additional units you can purchase from the Mercenary Camp. Otherwise, they've taken A LOT of the content away and made the game feel very bare... No, I'm not even joking.\n\nI'd rate this game 4/10, it's very disappointing.\nThey've gone nowhere new with it and even stripped it back, making it feel empty.

They got a lot wrong here in an effort to make it a game more based on war rather then economy, and the end result is unfortunately not all that fun. let me explain why.\n\nThe devs said over and over while the game was in development that they were trying to recreate the fast paced skirmish mode feel you got when you played the origional stronghold crusader. While this is a good intention, the end result pretty much adds up to the enemy sending countless waves of small suicide squadrons to your castle CONSTANTLY, never bothering to create larger seige forces as a reaction to your castle growing larger. It is flat out tedious. At the end of a skirmish match when it says you killed literally around 3,000 enemy archers, you just want to smack yourself in the face.\n\nThey also majorly streamlined the popularity and economic systems from previous games, so now keeping your people happy is as simple as making sure they have food. Making money boils down to making ridiculously high numbers of breweries and candle shops so your peasants are happy enough that you can raise your taxes. So your castle will always be the biggest candle factory and beer company in the Holy Land. Thats very realistic.\n\nApart from that, they also decided to take out the funny little things your peasants said when you click on them, which is kinda sad, and they descided to release more AI opponents two by two in DLCs, after only giving you an insulting eight opponents at launch, while the origional Crusader gave you eleven at launch. and for this high price? its a rip off.\n\nSorry Stronghold fans, this was not the redemtion from Stronghold 3 that you were looking for. At least it functions, though.","June 3, 2015","false","37.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

I didn't mind the change at first. But after playing for a while I noticed that the selecting and placing of buildings felt very awkward and sluggish. If you have played you probably know what I mean. Some of the siege units that are supposed to keep my troops "safe" get killed so fast by so few enemies. Before you blame the sluggishness of the building placement on my computer it definitely isn't my computer. I have a very good gaming computer so don't be blaming it on that.

Some parts of SHC are missing, other new parts were added. Overall I think there's a proper balance between what was lost and what was added. The unit special abilities and formations allow for some really neat approaches to combat which I think are the best part of the game. At times, commanding your group of units and timing their abilities properly feels like playing something like a RPG and gives you the feeling of extra control over who wins the battle :)\n\nThat being said, the asking price of 34,99€ (currently) is a bit high. I think something like 15€ is more appropriate since you'll most likely want to buy the DLC (~5 eur each) once you get into the game.

Even with those low expectations I was still let down. The campaign takes well over an hour of unskippable grinding gamplay that inst even remotely interesting before you even get to do anything remotely interesting. To make matters worse, there was no mention or easily recognisable option that would speed up the game speed, and so it was almost when i was at the end of my patience when i discovered that the only way to change game speed is with the hotkeys "+ or -", making this game a hell of a drag for the beginning of any single player match\n\nThe multiplayer is barely any better, it shows none of the fast paced action of stronghold 2 or its predecessors, and the matchmaking was very poor and scarce.\n\nIn summary, unless you have played every other strategy game you own until you cannont bear to play them for one moment longer, do not buy this game.

I received a press code out of the blue from the developer and decided to check it out.  After about an hour of messing with the tutorial and first few campaign missions, I began to get a handle on what I was doing.  I then played around in the sandbox mode for a while in order to get a full range of the buildings available without having to worry about being attacked.  I really enjoyed how easy it was to connect walls and get the archers to make use of braziers (to shoot fire arrows).  Forming a productive economy also proved to be equally as easy.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricey side, I feel, but it offers quite a bit including but not limited to multiplayer, campaign missions, co-op, different AI lords/behaviors, and more.  I did experience a bug to where the victory/stats screen would display rectangles instead of numbers/text...very unfortunate considering this is a $50 game.  Other than that, everything seemed to work fine and hassle-free.  You can check out my experiences (and the aforementioned bug) via the below videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgPbVqH9oYc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p75iwV4mPM4","September 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vizkos/recommended/232890/","vizkos","Vizkos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vizkos/","239 products in account","Given my experiences with this game, I would be hard-pressed to reccomend this game to friends, especially with the current asking price.  Firefly Studios rigorously distanced themselves from Stronghold 2 when promoting this game, and rightfully so, the former being a disaster of a game that tried too many things with too little map space.  Firefly also touted this game as being a return to its roots, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.  Unfortunately, while the same level of complexity in the game was restored, many gameplay elements leave something to be desired and are lacking.\n\nMy first con for this game is the maps.  My favorite maps in Stronghold Crusader were:  I can't remember the names, but hopefully anyone reading this that has played Crusader knows which ones I am talking about and then continue with my review:  1) The map in which one player is in the center on top of a hill with all grassland.  There is then one player in the top left, and two in each of the other corners.  Grasslands are available in the corners and along the sides for a bit.  2) A Friend Indeed I think its called, 6 player map, you start within screen width of your ally, most of the map is grass.  And a map where it is all a dense forest with little to no Iron, 6 players.  As one might gather, I have a preference for maps in which food is plentiful but one would be hardpressed to defend the vast area, allowing one to strategically build casles rather than strategically defend a small scarce (or non-existant) farm land.  Stronghold Crusader 2 does not offer this option.  All of the maps have either small amounts of grass, no grass at all, or have it right next to your castle so you cannot build walls without surrounding the grass or building over it.  The fact this game does not offer maps such as that dissappoints me.  The game tries to make it easier to gather food by increasing each facilities output (I only need 4 wheat farms and 4 bakeries to support a population of 60), but that takes away from the experience for me.\n\nNext, they tweaked how castle defences work, for the worse I think.  One cannot build castle artillery on towers anymore, instead requiring wooden towers that are placed over straight sections of wall.  This would be tolerable, if one could place these wooden towers diagonally, since I favor walls on the corners of my castles.  In Crusader I would favor the strategy of building many large towers on the corners of my castle and stack them with balistae.  Not possible here.  They also changed how military units work: removing the need for leather armor on macemen, requiring metal armor for crossbowmen, etc.  Not a big deal maybe, but these small things made the strategy for me.  On top of that, a small group of bowmen can kill a similar number of knights' horses, nutralizing the appeal of mounted knights...I would expect horses in armor to have smilar health to a pikeman, not fall to ~2-3 arrows.\n\nThe "estate" system they have decided to keep is also an irk of mine.  You cannot build walls in areas that are not assigned to an estate.  In some cases, this means you cannot build walls 10 squares away from your castle. (~1/4 screen width).  This is very annoying.\n\nThey also decided to keep the same graphics of Stronghold 2, Legends, 3, etc.  I find it ironic that the sprites of Stronghold Crusader look better than these new graphics.  I also find it semi annoying that there is no unit collision.  Lack of collision kills the strategy of melee on melee formations and blockading.  I recall numeroues times I defeated opponents that had a superior melee force by just running a majority of my force past their units, since that is an exploit with this system.\n\nOk one might say, I should expect changes in a sequel to balance the gameplay.  I don't think these things are balanced.  I find them to be a pain (balistae towers) and unrealistic (unarmored macemen).    Because of all of these unfavorable changes, the lack of map variation, etc, I cannot reccomend this game to any of my friends.","September 27, 2014","false","13.3"," 65 of 132 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","65","132","0","3"

It is in no way a $50 AAA title. Graphics are a throwback to a good 10 years ago. Game momentarily freezes every time it does a save and then jerks around your last input request as it catches up. Crashed or locked up a couple times already. The game's overall pacing is much quicker than I recall, too, being less like a "castle sim" and more like a standard RTS that happens to have slightly more advanced than usual wall construction. Control inputs and notifications are out-of-date (no queing of orders? no notice when enemies are knocking down my buildings?)\n\nA.I. is a nice challenge. Very well done in that regard.

Loved the original and missed playing it with my partner. So, we forked out the $s on 2 copies so we could play together. Has been a total disaster so far.\n\nProblems I'm facing:\n\n* Game is totally unbalanced, so between super hard and completely impossible, even when you make the setting easy and in your favour.\n\n* Lots of glitches. Eg. Enemy soldier glitched and was stuck on one of my walls. I couldn't kill him,  repair the wall  or build anything near it. Basically killed that match for me and my partner.\n\n* Game is super laggy.\n\n* Difficult to select and place items. Sometimes have to click on something multiple times for it to be selected. Very jumpy when placing items. Will end up putting items not where you indicated they should be, so can't make optimal use of space.\n\nI will continue to give it a go, as at times it shows promise, and we spent our hard-earned $s on it!!","March 26, 2015","false","27.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Simple? Yes, customizable? Not really. 1 had small walls, pleaceable crenulations, a moat. flammable pitch.\n\ntowers\nTowers are sort of there, but where in crusader, the most expensive one cost only 80 stone, in 2 it reaches 220.\nIn crusader, units could move from tower to tower. That is, if you put a wall with some stairs on one side and connect it to a tower, then connect this tower to another, you could order your units to go from the stairs unto the last tower. In 2, each tower has to be connected to a wall leading to stairs to be reachable. Not gamebreaking but can really ♥♥♥♥ with the castle design and is a waste of resources.\n\nDefensive tools\n2 removes the need for engineers garrisoning tower-mounted ballistas/catapults and just has you put them on a wall section.\nThe wooden pseudo-tower on a wall section is a terrible idea, although I've got to welcome removing engineers.\nMany ways to decorate your castle are missing and the new brazier sucks.\n\nverdict\n1 wins\n\nCASTLE WRECKING\nWhere 1 suffered from too little units, 2 has a lot of them, mostly unnecessary.\n\nUnit diversity\nIt's really unfair to compare the two, stronghold vanilla had only 7 units, crusaders' remedy was cloning those 7 except wiht oriental haplogroups.  In this regard, c2 gets to field out all it can.\nEuropean units are simplified, for example the maceman now doesn't require leather armor, Really costy ones there too.\n\nEngineers\nIngegneri vil razza dannata!\nOne thing I'm glad is the removal of engineers, having to amass a lot of those guys and send them one by one to build 5 coin mantlets is a chore I'm glad to go without.\nHaving a siege camp pump out all I need is a welcome addition in this regard.\n\nRecruitment\nPart of the old stronghold formula is the 24 unit recruitment system.\nFor those not in the know, you can only summon 24 unit types before reinforcements run out and you have to wait another random period of time to get 24 villagers willing to fight.\nA flaw of the original, it could have easily been done without, instead it carried over, probably for balance reasoning.\n\nactual fighting\nDon't expect micromanagement or piercing formatiosn for cavalry. It doesn't go further than stronghold 2's "3d models flailing their hands = attacking" style.\nTaking a castle down is not satisfying after you've breeched the walls, you can argue that it's a fault of the AI, but when it's sold in DLC's as a feature, it's stil relevant.\n\nverdict\nC2 wins, at worst it tried.\n\nECONOMY\nOther than being an RTS, stronghold prides itself in its economic mode, the ability to create a fledging medieval economy gathering resources that are used to make the citizens happier, the happiness used to levy more taxes and taxes used to pay for a proper army to kill the enemy's king and become the supreme ruler of the land.\n\nit's ok...I guess?\nC2's economy is just a copy and paste of C1's with some "balancing".\n\nfood\nMany complain about the Mill costing 200 wood now, but they forget how one mill could make enough flour to power 20 bakeries, it's not really a contest.\nAlthough with c2 there's no reason to get on bread production, since the primary modes of food production can provide an easy flow right away until the end.\n\nResources\nYou can sell stuff at the stockpile now, which is great, and the market is an autoselling service, which is something that c1 lacked, especially in the latter stages.\nc1 had a priest blessing the populace, and besides the simple +3 happiness you get from cathedral + church combo. Good luck getting anywhere if your population is growing.\nAnd with a working economy, that's a given.\nc2 tries to remedy this by adding "candle production": you make candles that are used in the religious ceremonies that raise religiosity. Sketchy, but it works better this time around. And you can increase candle consumption to get a higher popularity, which is reasonable.\n\n"flow"\nTakes a while to get an economy up and running, even if you have a lot of farmland, iron, stone and wood laying around, you're still going to get busted for a while at the beginning. With those same conditions in 1, you could get to the top fast.\n\nfear factor\nYou could make the population lazier, happier and the army stronger by adding "good things" like mayflower poles and dancing bears, or make it get sad with hangman posts and chopping blocks, with the upside of better work being done.\nA mix between a "morality system" and a way to decorate your castle: it's a lot more fun with chopping blocks than with dreary stone walls!\nOne problem it had is that you had to put a lot of those if you wanted to get the +5 or -5 but it could have been fixed someway.\nHow does it fare in c2? they removed it.\n\nVerdict\nSame-ish economy with some imrpovements here and there, the removal of the fear factor system is just heretical though. 1 wins.\n\nSTYLE\nObviously we're comparing a 3d game and an isometric one, the 3d has got to get on top, right? Well....\n\nunits\nThey look weird, like superheroes more than actual medieval characters. Their fighting is blocky, and I'm not tired of repeating how silly it looks.\nIt would have worked in 2008, it doesn't work in 2016, a system that doesn't age well.\n\nvoice acting\nSoldiers talk like they're from a generic RTS, not exactly a fault but when you compare it with the original it fails hard.\nSelect a maceman and you get a gruff mocking "what do you want?", instanlty understand that these are no-nonsense brawlers.\nSelect archers, "Archers, ready!", tense but aggressive, don't get them too close to the enemy.\nForgivable, forgivable...\nWhat is unforgivable though, is that c1 characterized every single unit in the game, selecting any wokrer would update you on their current actions, give you a portrait and they'd tell you what they think of your tax plan, the food, or strike a monty python joke.\nIt gave the otherwise serious stronghold series a soul, for a while they stopped being symbols on a screen and got a character of their own.\nRemove that, and it becomes a generic castle simulator, with no soul or energy.\nGet that part, firefly.\n\nArchitecture\nBuildings look all too blocky and all too similar, only by zooming in can you "get" that this is a place where you grow food and this is the one where you smelt iron.\nIn 1, an apple orchard looked like an apple orchard, an inn reminded of an inn.\nThe number of churches went from 3 types (chapel, church, cathedral) to 1 grey looking one, regardless of the transition to 3d (which might be necessary today), it lost the middle eastern look crusader let it borrow, it looks like something out of a south gernan forest town rather than a middle eastern crusader state.\nSo many buildings ended up this way, it's almost sad.\n\ncastle itself\nAll the towers look the same, all the walls look the same. There's not much to say here, but if you can, look at crusader 1 and compare The Scorpion's build style with The Abbot's, You'll realise that you could express yourself in a lot of ways in the original.\n\nverdict\nCrusader 1 wins, no argument, it wins on a landslide. Original, charming, context-related, it had it all and the sequel just apes that with its faux comic book style.\n\nVERDICT\nCertainly a lot better than the abysmal 3 or the mediocre 2, but doesn't top crusader or vanilla stronghold.\nIf you get the chance, get crusader 1, better experience, more atmosheric, cheaper, fuller gameplay.","April 3","false","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Positive aspects are the for Stronghold well-known building of a castle, and there are now some additional trading options that are really helpful to automate the economy. The main reasons why i give a negative review are: At first, you are welcomed with a ten second long, bad rendered intro sequence. It seems unfinished and is wretched. Then, the developers come up with another effrontery: "Type your Email to receive bonus-flags!". When i saw that you even get an achievement for signing in with your Email, the game was done for me. Besides, the game is laggy, the graphic is not on an acceptable standart and the old principle is adopted identically, even the music is the same. Conclusion: You do not play Stronghold for the graphics, so just buy and play the first one. It is not a bad game, but the mentioned impudences of the developers really detain me to spend money on this (i played it at a Free-Weekend).","April 2","false","7.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

This game is just weird. Certain building area's, food goes so fast, peasants are just moody ♥♥♥♥s, and the AI just loves ninja's.\n\nThere has to be ONLY one way to start your city out in this game. Like it micromanages the ♥♥♥♥ compared to RTS's like Starcraft 2 which are SLOWER paced then this game. If you can play this game on full speed and win, congrats, you know the trick.\n\nI have tried. Several times since I bought this POS for 60 dollars long ago and I just can't do it. I install it, get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by AI in Skirms, either "campaign based" or just random and get rolled over.\n\nI don't get it. I understand the different buildings and how they work, I understand the fundamentals of the game but the AI are just punishing. They either go super ninja after my king ( AKA when my ♥♥♥♥ ass army is out protecting my lumberjacks or farms ) OR go straight for my buildings ( AKA when my army is inside the castle trying to keep that dumbass king alive ).\n\nIt's not complex. I just don't enjoy games that require you to have ONE set starting build in order to survive. The pressure gets put on right out of the gate and they have like tier 5 units coming in with a set of 4 and can wipe 30 of my basic ♥♥♥♥ units within the first 5 minutes.\n\nIt's just brutal on normal. If you crank it down to Easy ( I THINK ) it becomes dull because they don't do anything. I honestly think the AI are a bunch of hardcore cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by how their base and amount of buildings vs mine within the first 3 minutes of the game looks.\n\nI wanted a game to bring me back to those good old RTS games.\n\nThis wasn't it.","March 21","false","60.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure, it's not as great as the original, but what sequeal to any game is as good?  The bottom line is that this game is still sound, and most of the bugs in the game have been patched at least to my general view.  Sure, some of the mechanics and things could be better, but hey, all games have their flaws.\n\nOne thing I did want to bring to attention is that this game is still kind of buggy.  Things don't seem to line up super well and the actual units themselves can get kind of glitchy.  Other than that though, the game still provides me with lots of fun.  I bought this game on sale for 10$, and can say that it is worth at least that much.  But 50$? No thanks.  Get the game on sale.  I would wait for another sale like this weekends, or maybe up to half off at the most.  But don't pay full price.  This is nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, which was worth every penny.\n\nHope this review is at least somewhat helpful.  It's still a great game and addition to the series, and they did redeem themselves quite a bit after the disaster that was stronghold 3.  So I personally would ignore all the negative reviews, as most of them complain about problems that existed in the original games, but of course they didn't have a way to comment for those ones.  Any solid member of the Stronhold Series would still enjoy this game, especially for 10 bucks.","April 3","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Half the fun was watching the peasants do their work in Stronghold Crusader 1, that's pretty much no longer entertaining now, because everything is tiny and the serfs dont deliver funny lines when you click on them. Graphically, this is unoptimized BS in terms of demanding GPU power because framerate is low for a game that has graphics very similar in quality to Age of Empires III (and that game was released in 2006). They reused some musical cues and icons from the original Stronghold because apparently they are still the best. Finally, the artwork looks cheap like some guy from Deviantart was comissioned for 50 bucks to do the art and backgrounds for this retail game.

The gameplay stays similar to the original, the AI has progressed, and the ambient audio truly immerses you in the crusader atmospehere.\n\nAll in all its a good game, but not worth $50.

Sure, it's not as great as the original, but what sequeal to any game is as good?  The bottom line is that this game is still sound, and most of the bugs in the game have been patched at least to my general view.  Sure, some of the mechanics and things could be better, but hey, all games have their flaws.\n\nOne thing I did want to bring to attention is that this game is still kind of buggy.  Things don't seem to line up super well and the actual units themselves can get kind of glitchy.  Other than that though, the game still provides me with lots of fun.  I bought this game on sale for 10$, and can say that it is worth at least that much.  But 50$? No thanks.  Get the game on sale.  I would wait for another sale like this weekends, or maybe up to half off at the most.  But don't pay full price.  This is nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, which was worth every penny.\n\nHope this review is at least somewhat helpful.  It's still a great game and addition to the series, and they did redeem themselves quite a bit after the disaster that was stronghold 3.  So I personally would ignore all the negative reviews, as most of them complain about problems that existed in the original games, but of course they didn't have a way to comment for those ones.  Any solid member of the Stronhold Series would still enjoy this game, especially for 10 bucks.","April 3","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even if I had not started with Stronghold 1, I would not\nreccomend this game.\n\n- Difficulty. The programmers confused cheating with difficulty. What this essentially means is the moment you have finally breached the castle walls, the AI will instantly spawn a very large amount of troops to flood you, then instantly repair the breach.\n- Economy. While you certainly have to tend to yours, the AI does not. Destroying farms, mines, quarries, food, does nothing to slow down or stop the AI. While it appears they are spending money, they are not and can always afford anything.\n- Rushes. The campaign is an exercise in defending against rushes. Remember the cheating thing? Combine that with a rush. Takes 30 seconds for a fully grown AI to be outside your castle with catapults, torches, and enough to kill your Lord, meanwhile your fletcher has not even gotten to his workshop yet.\n- Defensive ability. All you have to defend yourself are walls. That is it. No moats. Hoarding is killed by a couple arrows, and arrows tend to simply pass right through it. No real way to create a defence besides building more walls. Walls that have to constantly be tended to due the the sheer catapult rush the AI throws at you. No engineers to help either. And Walls are super expensive to build, which wouldnt be an issue if I did not require so much time to tend to them.\n\nIt wants to be good, but falls flat.

Even if I had not started with Stronghold 1, I would not\nreccomend this game.\n\n- Difficulty. The programmers confused cheating with difficulty. What this essentially means is the moment you have finally breached the castle walls, the AI will instantly spawn a very large amount of troops to flood you, then instantly repair the breach.\n- Economy. While you certainly have to tend to yours, the AI does not. Destroying farms, mines, quarries, food, does nothing to slow down or stop the AI. While it appears they are spending money, they are not and can always afford anything.\n- Rushes. The campaign is an exercise in defending against rushes. Remember the cheating thing? Combine that with a rush. Takes 30 seconds for a fully grown AI to be outside your castle with catapults, torches, and enough to kill your Lord, meanwhile your fletcher has not even gotten to his workshop yet.\n- Defensive ability. All you have to defend yourself are walls. That is it. No moats. Hoarding is killed by a couple arrows, and arrows tend to simply pass right through it. No real way to create a defence besides building more walls. Walls that have to constantly be tended to due the the sheer catapult rush the AI throws at you. No engineers to help either. And Walls are super expensive to build, which wouldnt be an issue if I did not require so much time to tend to them.\n\nIt wants to be good, but falls flat. Play Stronghold 1, 2, and Crusader 1.","April 16","false","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Complaints: enemy attacks seem like they are of lesser scale but more frequent (AI), which is annoying, no time to relax and its not a oh ♥♥♥♥ factor when you see them coming, its more of a "didnt u just attack 1.5 minutes ago?" and your attacks will constantly be runing into them. The price of 50$ is too much 25 is more like it, but around this time this far after release? 20. deforestization is a issue and i think trees should grow back on all maps. Seems very grindy after a while in a game if you are matched with your oppenet. Peasant cap should be 50 people at the campfire. overall a great game with great economy play, very fun to play with your friends. I would recommend this game very much, Still a big improvement from previous games in my opinion, Not as much grinding for population happiness as it took in previous games which is nice.","May 22","true","34.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","3"

TL;DR at the bottom\n\nFor a little context, I have played the other games, but really fell in love with the first Crusader game so I thought I would give this a shot. I had been in an half hour long game with the AI on easy(Which was 1/4 of my playtime) and I was finally getting the better of him which felt great. I set up siege camps and had a pretty nice army but looking at his castle... I knew we could get through the walls but we would fail inside.\n\nSo I decided I would pick of his men with Trebuchets and kill all of his villagers so he wouldn't be able to produce food or troops.  It worked partially, I picked off one of his walls and about 15 men, and kind of continued doing this for about 15 min. During this he just kept sending more and more troops, not his defending force, new troops that he just kept making. Despite his total lack of food and income, he could quadruple his force. I mean a little militia would make since but an entire army? Please. While on the other hand if I lost a single lumber camp my Kingdom would be brought to a halt. I lost the game an hour in...\n\nNow, losing a game I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy after an hour of gameplay I can handle. BUT WHEN I LOSE THE GAME ON EASY AFTER AN HOUR OF GAMEPLAY DUE TO MISSING CORE MECHANICS OF A SIEGE, THAT WHEN I GET A LITTLE UPSET. The game is described as a 'Simulation Castle builder". Well ♥♥♥♥ that description if the enemy has a constant refill on troops. They don't actually need the recourses. If you have all the stone in the game, their stone walls are just as good as yours, and if you destroy them, they will be back in 2 min.\n\nThe game encourages abusing glitches, and because of the OP AI, YOU HAVE TO. Not to mention the AI of your troops. You know how they say "Aberham Lincon would be considered autistic to our standers". Well Guess what, your entire army all have 12 extra chromosomes and are blind and deaf. On top of random charges and literally refusing orders, you would think that they just don't have any coherent form of understanding at all. But then the enemy AI are doing back flips over my walls and getting a 1 hit headshot on every single on of my brain dead men.\n\nIn the end, the game is broken to hell. Its OP AI, and actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troops make it virtually unplayable.  Also the lack of impact of what you do to them but the massive impact that they do to you makes it not fun. So there you have, unplayable, and not fun, If you can, refund.\n\nP'S ♥♥♥♥ THIS DLC MAN! YOU WANT ME TO PLAY A SLIGHTLY DIFF RENT TEXTURE OF THIS CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥, AND PAY FOR IT?

I mean a little militia would make since but an entire army? Please. While on the other hand if I lost a single lumber camp my Kingdom would be brought to a halt. I lost the game an hour in...\n\nNow, losing a game I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy after an hour of gameplay I can handle. BUT WHEN I LOSE THE GAME ON EASY AFTER AN HOUR OF GAMEPLAY DUE TO MISSING CORE MECHANICS OF A SIEGE, THAT WHEN I GET A LITTLE UPSET. The game is described as a 'Simulation Castle builder". Well ♥♥♥♥ that description if the enemy has a constant refill on troops. They don't actually need the recourses. If you have all the stone in the game, their stone walls are just as good as yours, and if you destroy them, they will be back in 2 min.\n\nThe game encourages abusing glitches, and because of the OP AI, YOU HAVE TO. Not to mention the AI of your troops. You know how they say "Aberham Lincon would be considered autistic to our standers". Well Guess what, your entire army all have 12 extra chromosomes and are blind and deaf. On top of random charges and literally refusing orders, you would think that they just don't have any coherent form of understanding at all. But then the enemy AI are doing back flips over my walls and getting a 1 hit headshot on every single on of my brain dead men.\n\nIn the end, the game is broken to hell. Its OP AI, and actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troops make it virtually unplayable.  Also the lack of impact of what you do to them but the massive impact that they do to you makes it not fun. So there you have, unplayable, and not fun, If you can, refund.\n\nP'S ♥♥♥♥ THIS DLC MAN! YOU WANT ME TO PLAY A SLIGHTLY DIFF RENT TEXTURE OF THIS CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥, AND PAY FOR IT? DID THE GUY WHo CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA ALSO CREATE THE TROOP AI?\n\nTL;DR\n\n2/10- Unplayable and Not Fun\n","April 4","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackavram/recommended/232890/","jackavram","SO FUNNY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackavram/","1112 products in account","Don't listen to the reviews saying even die-hard fans should stay away, it's one of the best 3D Stronghold games in the series. A mostly decent castle rts with a few holes, some losses, but  many new features (including achievements).  I don't understand why some reviewers tore it to shreds, have they really played all of the Stronghold games?  It's definitely not complete trash and better than most of the lesser "3D" Strongholds for sure.\n\nGameplay: Overall, the game objective remains the same - build your castle and economy, make troops, conquer the enemy through a series of skermish trails.  Like Crusader I, the sequel also focuses more on wartime than peace-time - so you will find more war and defense buildings and less economy peacetime buildings. Too much disappointment, the Fear Factor system has been removed...seriously, what the hell? Production is stuck at slow as hell now.  Economic management has been improved with the lovely "automatic trades"  at the market and finer tuned popularity management with supply adjustments all made in a single window.  You can also see your daily production & consumption levels of popularity supporting goods to be sure the production meets the need. Troops vary from many familiar to several new troops as well.  New troops include some most-powerful "leader" troops that will boost the defense and attack for certain troops around them - Sergent for Knights, Slave Master for Slaves. A few favorites from Crusader I were unfortunately replaced with new troops too .  Keeping them all and adding on would have been better...I miss the underrated rock throwers.\n\nDifficulty: Difficultly has been taken up a notch as Enemy AI loves to rush your castle early.  Even the weaker known AI such as The Rat will provide a greater challenge.  Some players say the enemy AI cheats more too and spawns many troops regardless of how bad their popularity and economy are doing.  Mastering stategic defense early is utmost importance, troops (towers & crossbowmen) must be made before much of the economy.  Popularity responds significantly faster to your economy now with negative and positive ratings immediately affecting your peasants - i.e. the moment your popularity drops, workers start leaving in seconds!!  Also castles are more expensive to build with stone walls costing 7 stone each and stone curtains being 3 stone...stone stocks too low sir!!\n\nPerformance:  The game runs fine until your castle starts filling up with tons of buildings (Bakers, Brewers, Hovels), peasants, and troops.  Then even systems with a Radeon R9 3GB+ will have frame rates of around 25ish.  This isn't a bad console port and they really should optimize the code further.  It's not horrible  and I still enjoy the game plenty regardless, but it is funny that my system also runs Fallout 4 around 45-60fps on max graphics... Many of the major glitches and flaws noted by early reviewers are now patched up and gone, however I do still rarely see the "crusified troops" glitch where they walk in a frozen T position for a bit or also troops getting stuck on the stairs. Also the audio for catapult rocks hitting stone structures and walls is overloaded and WAY TOO LOUD.\n\nVisual:  The graphics are similar to Stronghold 3 and perhaps even better. The animations are about the same too.  The enemy AI FMVs have been completely redone with entirely new and goofier looking characters for classic familiar foes and many new adversaries.  The interface really varies from a crappy low res title screen of an assassin (come on, looks like crap) to a nicely done very zen feeling skirmish trail amongst the stars.  Some recycled troop graphics from Stronghold 3 for sure.\n\nAudio:  A mix of half recycled, half new when it comes to effects and music - perhaps more new.  This is typical for Stronghold games.  Music really varies, but I feel it is not randomized enough and many tracks are rarely heard while a few are played too often.  Classic familiar AI features new voice acting that is a complete joke compared to the much more intimidating classic voice acting.  The Pig now says things like, "No No No, that's ma land!" compared to "I WILL CRUSH YOU!!! I WILL KIWWLLL YOU!!!." The Rat is also more dull and bore with phrases like, "My father didn't like ya, I don't like ya either." Blah.  The newer non-familiar enemy voiceacting (mostly arabic tyrants) does seem to be higher quality and more charismatic charm though.  Lionheart seems decent enough too actually.\n\nConclusion: A worthy castle sim gameplay for many new and veteran fans alike but nothing perfect or AAA.  Die-hard fans shall enjoy the new features plenty to make up for the loss of some favored features.  It's not the best RTS and there are flaws, but it's still pretty fun and easily to get lost in for hours.  Firefly always releases these too early in development, but I luckily began to play after much of the final development.  I'd say grab it on sale, and definitely wait for the DLC to go on sale.  The main game is tough and should offer plenty while waiting on the DLC.","April 17","true","74.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I am not expecting a big improvement or anything, as least please just be as good as the one I used to play. But it is not, countless game feature that has been removed, even art works and CGs are not as good as its predecessor(But thanks god you keep the music as it was).\nI will say this game is unfinished, the ONLY reason that is comforting me is I can use Steam to play with my friends instead of playing with myself as ten years ago, Yay.\nBTW, if you are adding those features you used to have in DLCs! I WILL NEVER TOUCH ANY GAME FROM YOUR COMPANY!\n========================================================================\n总的来说我对这款游戏很失望，可能是因为前作对我影响太深吧。小时候没有网络，没有钱，我就玩着盗版的单机，一玩可以连续玩好久好久。\n不过说实话我也对游戏行业的续作有些了解，知道成功的续作并不多。但是这款游戏不仅没有新的东西，许多经典的兵种啊特色啊CG什么的都被删除了- -，失望之余更多的是费解，我实在是不知道为什么。\n总之吧，我买这款游戏的原因差不多就是有因为玩盗版前作的内疚感，算是还帐了~还有就是这次可以跟朋友玩玩多人模式。。虽然游戏是阉割过的，但是也挺不错\n最后说一句，如果开放商打算把那些特色作为DLC加进去的话，我是绝！对！不！会！买！帐！的！","September 24, 2014","false","9.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

Still, you're not gonna be able to build any "castle" worthy of that title.\n\nEdit to add: Commanding units is extremely cumbersome, and precisely placing them on walls is nearly impossible since the icon turns from "move" to the stairs/"man walls" icon. Stronghold 2 had a perfectly working system (you click on a spot on top of a tower, and your units will move to that spot instead of some nearby spot on the walls) and it's completely beyond me why they had to go reinvent the square wheel here.","September 23, 2014","false","25.3"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

Here is some pro and cons for a shorter version:\n\nPros:\nStronghold series name (no really thats a pro)\ngood troop variety (both for arabic and crusader units)\nmilitary production buildings expanded (no longer buildings that produce 2 of something everything has it's own producer)\nmildly good graphics (not great for 2014 but eh I didn't buy it because of looks)\nEconomy is fun to build (but nothing better than the others)\nHEALING UNITS! FINALLY!\n\nCons:\nAI does not need a economy (the Wolf the main enemy in the game doesn't even bother with even trying to look like he uses one)\nyour troops are still brain dead (Idk how many times I lost loads of troops because I had to mouse over my castle fix something and my men had let archers and crossbows kill them without even trying to run or fight)\nMaps are too small (8 player games feel like you could toss a rock at the others, they fix this by making a cap of units 1000, so 5 players get 200, 2 players get 500, etc.)\nUnit capped at 1000 (This is 2014 for God's sake raise it, but I know why they can't because:)\nPoor optimization (or memory leaks unsure) I have a PC with 16GB Ram, Nvidia 650 Ti 2GB, Intel i5 3.2GHz quad core, this shouldn't be happening to me:)\nGame lags badly when over 500 units (and when I say badly I mean my FPS was at 1-5 the whole time, I literally quit because it took 20 minutes for my units to exit the damn castle)\nFeatures stripped from the original (the Good Evil system is gone, want engineers? NOPE! How about a moat? Go play SC1 this SC2 we don't need moats, oh and how about siege towers? Hehehe this is 2014 we don't need them)\nWalls are made of plastic (I mean seriously I shoot maybe 3-4 shots at a 4 thick wall and it's gone, I can take out a strong castle fairly easily by just using 1 cat 50-100 horse archers and maybe 7 templars that is all I have ever had to use)\n\n\n\n\nThe closing part:\n\nI want to love this game I really do, but it is not fun. I played 10 hours and have no desire to play any more than that , the AI does not have to build a economy and units just appear out of thin air (I literally destroyed the Wolfs merc center and the units just pop up where the merc center was throughout the game)\n\nThis game is not a honorable addition to the SH series, and I wish they would not have called this Crusader because that was one of the only AAA series not undone by idiots who think they can make a better game. If Firefly reads this then here is to them:\n\nYour game as it stands right now is TERRIBLE, you failed at remaking a wonderful game and you are losing fans for it BUT. But, this game has potential why? Because it is Crusader, bring back the engineers, beef up the walls, bring back moats, and for GODS sake give me back my siege towers. I want to believe that you guys didn't lose all your good talent and that this was a oversight somehow, I want to believe someone took SH3 and mixed it somehow with this game and your fixing it now and removing the bad things that that devil of a man put in here.\n\n\nConclusion:\nStronghold Crusader 1 was and IS the best Firefly video game to date, do not buy this until they fix the sloppy work they did here.\n\n\nEDIT:\nSo I recently looked through the news as I saw them talking about the future of this game, paid DLC has never hurt so much in my life. This game is truly not worth your money, Firefly a studio known for siding with the players has now gone the route of EA, SEGA, CA, and so many others, I am sorry but this game is a BIG PASS do not do NOT buy this game, they stripped features and are going to have us pay them for them (remember CA and the blood packs? Sparta? ♥♥♥♥ING BLOOD PACKS???) please just go buy a indie game, there are literally hundreds with better enjoyment then this.","October 23, 2014","false","11.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","4"

Great!' If only you could not duplicate resources whilst doing so. Woopdie do.\n\nDo you guys remember the stronghold 2 multiplayer? All the small fighting guilds that shot up to battle eachother whilst having fun?\nThat does not exist here, It's more like the time around a year after the release of the game, one or two hosts actually waiting to play someone.\n\nI'll spell it out for you however: [Remember this is an educated estimate] Only around fifty people own the game.\n\nNow, I'm sure a large amount of people actually bought this, But the multiplayer is so empty that either they got chased off by the campaign and demanded a refund or they took one look at the multiplayer and said 'I'm not waiting ten to twenty minuites just to play a game'\n\nThe characters in the game, You know the rat and the other guys?\nIt just seems too easy.\nThe animations of the characters are also quite flawed, a little like they used a really old animation software. [It can easily be improved]\n\nThe voices and sounds seemed as if they were copied over from a previous game, it would have been nice to have thoughs get changed up.\n\nDid you know messing around with archers get thier old voice, and then suddenly if you are lucky the voice suddenly changes? Quite interesting, I actually found out myself about ten minuites ago.\n\nI'm surprised you actually read this.

Diplomacy is nonexistent, your enemies are either your friend or foe, with very little interaction other than death threats and begging for your resources. The learning curve is pretty is medium, but the game does rely on a sink or swim mentality, help balloons would be nice to help you build the proper traps and units.\n\nVery limited construction. Your keep is not upgradable, it’s a simple tower that you can build up with walls and towers, but the keep itself never adjusts in power or in aesthetic. The building options are very limiting as well with now upgrades to work for, and very little reason for expansion beyond your walls.\n\nOverall, the game will hold your interest for a couple of hours before getting old quickly.

The graphics are horribly optimized, the controls aren't fluent at all (turning the camera around with mouse wheel feels terrible, the x-asis isn't inversed and isn't inverted, also you use left click to select troops then right click to move them/attack stuff, feels so wrong in Stronghold), and it feels extremely slow paced without any way of increasing game speed. It takes ages to get food/wood/stone/iron/weapons ect. in, and everything costs way too many resources to build. Taxes come in slowly and there's no good things/bad things that I found. It isn't very balanced, either. It's extremely easy to attack and very hard to defend. Catapults (not even trebuchets) out range the highest archer tower and ballistae do very little damage. Walls crumble (and kill all your units on them) in 1-2 catapult shots that are built and start shooting within a few seconds. There's no way to repair towers or gatehouses. Archers on towers/walls are nearly useless. So you're better off building little defense and focusing on keeping your opponents on offense all game. Lords are extremely tanky and can be healed with a new healer unit, which makes the game more about bursting him down than getting passed his defenses which is no where near as fun as the original. Knights (Called Templar in this game) come in un-mounted and you have to mount them manually which is really buggy. Combat between troops isn't visceral and satisfying like it was in the original. Voice acting is atrocious, probably the worst I've heard in 10+ years. I am happy about no moats though as units weren't programmed very well to dig it out so it was a pain to fight against in the original Crusader.\n\nA lot of these things can be fixed in patches but I wonder if Firefly will see them as issues at all.﻿ If you're a fan of the original Stronghold and Crusader, definitely give it a shot, you'll probably like the changes more than I do. If you're just looking for a solid RTS, wait for some patches or a sale first.","September 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 34 of 71 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","34","71","0","1"

The game seems to be designed in a bubble where the last 10 years of RTS design simply do not exist translating into some unintuitive controls, a UI which buries the most useful information while pushing the useless stuff up to the top, no unit collision, and easily manipulatable AI.  The game also gave the impression of probably needing another QA pass at launch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV40_CTEsMs","October 17, 2014","false","35.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The gameplay is great, it has updated features (It finally tells you how many troops you can have) and it's graphics are nice to look at.\nThe only other problem I have besides the glitches is the fact that there is no real story.

When this game popped up in the store I got excited. Years and years ago I was an avid Stronghold fan. I had the warchest which came with 1, 2, and Crusader. Didnt pick up Legends till years later and liked it, but not nearly as much as the juggernaut that was Stronghold Crusader. After the abysmal dissapointment that was 3, I was ready to give up on the series. Then I saw this...\n\nI was first struck by the asking price. 50 dollars is a lot to ask for a game like this, but if it means what is (supposed to be anyways) a more modern and updated version of Crusader, then the asking price is worth it. Only that is not what I bought. What I bought was another farce.\n\nThe reasons it sucks:\n1 - Lacking in depth - where did the happy/sad castle adornements go? why cant i build monks at the church? why take out units for that matter? why are there so many weapons shops when we used to be able to dictate what weapons the shops made? no leather armor for that matter?\n2 - combat is ridiculous - no engineers guild? what is the deal with the seige towers? anyone else notice how freaking fast all of the troops run? enemies are way too persistent in their attacks as well.. why the hell cant i build a moat anymore? and just how exactly do i even use the horses in my stable?! 3 seige weapons are just slightly bigger versions of the catapult..\n3 - maps - maps lack any creativity whatsoever. none of them seemed very fun to me.\n4 - characters are no longer fun - I remember the good ol days when the skirmish leaders were entertaining and had distinct personalities. now theres not as many to choose from and they seem like perverted versions of their former selves. troops as well...no more "WE ARE THE MACEMEN" or "HEEEERE COMES BESSIE"\n5 - bad AI - I cant tell you how annoying it is when I'm building up my castle and all of the sudden my teammate builds a seige camp in the middle of my town. (For that matter, why do we even need seige camps!? they should never have changed the engineers guild mechanic)\n\nAll in all it seems like all the devs tried to do was improve graphics and make the game more fast paced, which is something it DID NOT need. The original Stronghold Crusader rules and moves at a perfect pace. Perfect. Like i said before, you are purchasing a farce, not a game here.","September 28, 2014","false","10.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Buy it. Fan of RTS games? Buy it.\n\nWelcome M’lord to a review of Stronghold Crusader 2.\n\nAfter waiting 12 long years since the first Crusader game, Firefly Studios have released the much anticipated sequel; Stronghold Crusader 2. Whilst the later instalments of the franchise have not lived up to the critical acclaim of the earlier games, fans of the series remained somewhat optimistic in the build up to release. Personally I found myself feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety, hoping that Firefly would rekindle the ashes of Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader and avoid giving us another flop (…cough cough looking at you, Stronghold 3)\n\nStronghold Crusader 2\n\nThe action starts straight away with a cinematic showcasing the iconic Templar Swordsman pitted against a Whirling Dervish, one of the newly introduced mercenary troops. A great little addition to build some atmosphere before getting to the main menu.\n\nJumping into single player, gamers are given a variety of options including the Skirmish Trails campaign, Custom Skirmish and Sandbox. These options include plenty of tutorials for newcomers and players who need to dust off their swords and bows before jumping in to the main campaign. Tutorial missions teach the basics of building your castle and surviving out in the desert whilst the Learning Campaigns gives players the opportunity to implement all the tools they have learned. After you’ve had your fill of practice, the main Skirmish Trails await. Acting as the main campaign, this set of Trials pits you against multiple enemies in a variety of scenarios, requiring different approaches for each enemy and terrain that you encounter. The Trials are split into a six missions trees, helping break up the relatively time consuming campaign into more manageable chunks.\n\nMy initial impressions of the tutorials missions were that they are infuriatingly restricted in terms of available buildings, troops and ways to complete the obnoxious goals such as destroying every single piece of rubble or painfully waiting for a set number of resources to be collected. My feelings about the Learning Campaigns are slightly more positive, at least they have an element of challenge and a variety of strategies to achieve the mission objectives. In hindsight I do appreciate that these missions are heavily tailored for newer players and provide an environment to learn all the basics and ante up the degree of difficulty until they reach the same playing field as more veteran fans of the series. Yet the sheer amount of training missions is what seems unnecessary, especially given that players will need to endure hours of patronising gameplay to unlock all available achievements.\n\nThe Skirmish Trials do a valiant effort at injecting some fun and excitement into the game, offering a wide variety of challenges by mixing up your enemies, allies, map size and access to resources. The learning curve is steep right off the bat, with quick decisions and a fast clicking finger being vital. There’s a fine balance to be struck between getting your economy up and running whilst also prepping your defences for the incoming attacks that happen extremely soon due to the rush-happy nature of AI opponents.\n\nStronghold Crusader 2\n\nAfter sinking 20 hours of gameplay into the campaign I can safely say that there is an element of repetition between the missions. Is it because of the rinse and repeat approach of spamming overpowered archers until you have enough gold and troops to blitz the enemy? Is it because resources are so scarce, forcing you to twiddle your thumbs and wait? Is it because peasants spawn painfully slow and hovels are woefully overpriced? Probably a mix of all 3, plus countless other aggravating features. Talking of annoying features, let’s quickly address the voice acting and narrations. Irritating opponents such as “The Rat” have been a staple of the franchise since the initial Stronghold. Well, if the Developer’s aim was to annoy players then they sure succeeded. The voice acting seems poor quality throughout and the repetition of phrases seems more apparent than it should be for a reputable game produced in 2014. Fortunately the soundtrack provides some saving grace, providing an enjoyable ambience whilst you go about your medieval business.\n\nThere are some redeeming features to the game. The inclusion of unlimited stockpiles, granaries and armouries are welcomed additions. As are the improvements to team AI who are surprisingly competent and respond to your trade requests unlike in the first Crusader game. The easy-to-manage popularity metre is also a nice touch, allowing players to balance positive and negative popularity contributors to find the sweet spot between taxation and resources. The graphics, whilst not extraordinary, remain nostalgically reminiscent of the first Crusader game and the improvements of seeing towers shudder and walls crumble under your siege assault is certainly rewarding.\n\nIf you fancy a change from the pre-set missions there are a variety of choices to wet your castle crushing appetite. Creating your own scenarios allows players to edit maps, starting resources and computer controlled Lords. Moreover, if you crave even more customisation feel free to create your own maps in the Sandbox or download some user-created maps from the community. This contributes to the replayablility that the game offers, giving an almost infinite combination of enemies, maps and ways to conquer your opposition. There is also the option of jumping in to Multiplayer for a real challenge. There does seem to be a relative lack of lobbies though, so my recommendation would be to grab some buddies to bulk out the numbers. If, when it comes to your friends, you’re more of a lover than a fighter, there’s the chance to play co-operatively and take control of the same castle. This was one of the new features promoted during the build-up to the game, but in reality it’s quite gimmicky and leaves me with the disgruntled opinion that it’s simply more fun to control separate keeps and team up as normal.\n\nStronghold Crusader 2\n\nOverall Stronghold Crusader 2 just doesn’t do enough to win me over. It’s a noticeably better game than recent instalments in the Stronghold series, but if Firefly hopes to rekindle the success of the earlier games in the franchise they still have a way to go. The lack of innovations and major improvements over the original game is underwhelming to say the least, there is also a feeling amongst the community that the focus is much more combat focused rather than actually building up your castle and infrastructure, a sign of the times in modern gaming. I frequently found myself not even bothering with a castle and opting instead for a few strategically placed towers filled with archers. Ultimately the game is a satisfactory addition to the RTS genre, but the slow paced growth and underwhelming improvements over the original game leaves me reluctant to recommend it to anyone other than hardcore fans of the series and genre.\n","October 5, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dymetreus/recommended/232890/","dymetreus","ATNicholas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dymetreus/","68 products in account","Thus far, I've only forced myself to play this game, while the original I couldn't do anything but help give hundreds upon hundreds of hours into the game. At first it's simple structure seemed likeable to me, only to realize the maps are horribly designed for Stronghold Crusader 2. You have to build your mines completely exposed, with no way to build fortifications anywhere near them to defend it, leaving you constantly buying iron, stone, and even sometimes FOOD. Yes, that's right even the oasis seems to be terribly misplaced. On some maps these disadvantages are fine, because it could prove a challenge that veteran players are looking for. However for the masses, I cannot see how this was a good move.\n\nWhile it may not bother some, however it should be noted that the characters from the previous series who make a come back in this one are no where NEAR alike that of the original Stronghold, or Stronghold Crusader. You can't tell me that they can't afford better voices and animations for SHK2, everyone I've seen who liked the series purchased it immediately. Stronghold Crusader is better in many, many aspects in not only animations, but also the looks of said characters even noting the pixelation. Their voices also fit the part well, and the actors did an exceedingly wonderful job at sounding convincing. However for SHK2, their lines are corny, their voices sound unconvincing, (as if he wasn't talking about the same subject that he was) and overall their cut-seen is horribly tacky. It gives you a big, "So and so time.." and transparents to a scene with two warriors, they clash blades and.. that's all. Yep, that build up for nothing.\n\nBut let's get out of the pit of despair for a bit. They have some new units, to which are likeable. Such as the Ranger, who is capable of both range, and meleee combat, though not an expert at either.  They updated the graphics... for the most part. (again not on character models, ie when the rat portrait comes up when he's mad/attacking you) They have a simplier, clever system. Although I think overall for me this is good, this can be debated on highly. I just now thank the game that I don't have to focus on rebuilding economy/walls constantly when I'm being barraged with enemies.\n\nIf you're certain about purchasing this game, just keep in mind I was too. Overall I regret it as it stands, but if they fix the animations, voices, script for lines, and maps, then we'll start talking. In comparison to Stronghold Crusader, this game has very few gameplay hours, unless maybe you're a PvP-focused person? Not too sure how well PvP works in this game, but considering the maps.. I imagine not too fun since your economy being smashed is nothing you can really control. Unless you love fighting field battles.\n\n","October 4, 2014","false","7.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat controls and AI are pretty horrible,  There isn't even an attack-move command. Your huge siege force needs to be seriously babied for them to be even remotely successful, which makes many of the potentially more fun units useless. I can't even seem to figure out how to get my flaming hay launcher to actually shoot at invading troops. Also no range indicators on siege engines mean a lot of guesswork especially when there are height differences in terrain.\n\nThe game also just doesn't seem very polished. It won't even change the sound over when I plug in my headphones, I have to completely exit the game and renter for it to work. And unlike the 10-year old first game, you can't customize your castle's staircases, and it doesn't draw entraces to towers on your walls. Your units literally port up to the top of towers. You also have less options for putting things on the walls of your castles like trebuchets. Instead, ballistas and such are defensive wooden towers on their own, but don't even connect with your stone walls. Also gone are all non-stone castles, save wooden barricades that get burnt down pretty much instantly.\n\nIf you can get it on a large sale, I'd say pick it up, but this Isn't a sequel to stronghold crusader 2, it's a reskin of a 10 year old game, with nothing new and no improvements to AI. Not worth the price. For a grade-A game price, I expected a grade-A game, but feels less polished than many $10 indie games I play.","December 9, 2015","false","11.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The Cons are the game play can get stagnant after a while and the tutorials difficulty changes dramatically and ruins that part of it. The second main con is the AIs are really stupid and follow the same paths and attack the same areas.\n\nBut I think the money they ask is a reasonable amount to ask for the content included in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDroid52hd/recommended/232890/","TheDroid52hd","☢DЯo!d╰_╯★☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDroid52hd/","321 products in account","Plausible but not better than original Stronghold Crusader As an experienced Stronghold Crusader player that spend probably more than 1000 hours on it I’m disappointed by Crusader 2. Overall the game is much better than Stronghold 3 but does not surpass the classic Stronghold Crusader 1 or Stronghold 2.\nLet’s start what is good in the game.\nCastle building elements and economy elements are familiar to old Stronghold players.\n\nAll the units are there and recognizable with some more units added.\n\nWheat, Hop, Dairy and Apple farms all take up much less space on oasis (compared to SC1) and seem to be producing at same rate as their SC1 counterparts on 1/4 amount of space used.\n\nI like how trebuchets can pack and unpack now.  I hated when I put a trebuchet in SC1 only to find out its out of range of building/tower I wanted to hit.\n\nOld enemies like rat, pig and wolf are back as well as new ones.\nNow the things which depend on opinion of the player:\nNo need for engineers to build siege weapons.\n\nSome players will like the fact that they can make the siege weapons they want directly from siege camp, thus you don’t have to hire engineers and build each weapon separately.\n\nI liked using engineers because I could take them out of the siege weapon and use them again to make another weapon, for example if I had too many ballistae when I attacked a heavily fortified castle I could just tell engineers to exit and make a catapult/ trebuchet without hiring and waiting for them to come to battlefield. That was a neat feature in SC1.\n\nPeasants don’t talk when you press on them.\n\nPersonally I liked when I press on peasant and hear their opinion on taxes, food, mood and other things. I found it funny when they used Monty Pythonesque male voice for female peasants.\n\nSome players could have found this annoying, so I see an argument for not adding this to the game.\n\nProduction buildings take 1 extra square of space for entrance.\n\nSome will find this efficient and helpful.\n\nOthers like me will say it hinders creativity of castle building, If I block an entrance with another building it’s my fault so then I have to fix it myself.\nNow the Cons:\nEconomy takes too long to start up.\n\nI remember being able to quickly build up my food economy by making bread which was one of the fastest and most efficient way to sustain food. Now I cannot do that because everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is more expensive on wood and the woodcutters don’t seem to collect resources faster. For example, mill increased from 20 wood to 200 wood!!!  Thus it makes it a luxury to make bread from start. Don’t rely on the market to buy the resources because you have to spend 300 wood plus 100 gold to build it (it was 5 wood in SC1).\n\nOverall economy takes much longer to start up and more expensive thus you will need more woodcutters in this game and you will more often use market to buy wood, and stone for defences. Thus it will make for much slower early game experience, and I felt like I was just waiting for resources to come it than building my castle.\n\nThis all can be fixed if we had speed slider like in SC1 and make buildings cheaper.\n\nWalls and towers are more expensive there is much less creativity with walls compared to SC1.\nIn SC1 I could build a castle however I wanted, if I wanted to mix small walls with big walls against assassins I could do it.  While in SC2 you can only build complete walls and the stair case is bigger and longer the size of the bakery or a house.\n\nNo moat and SC2.\n\nTowers cost way too much stone for quarry’s work rate.\n\nCannot place a ballistae or mangonel on big towers. Instead they act like they are towers themselves.\n\nNo popularity buildings (flowers or knot buildings). Thus I can’t be a benevolent king or a ruthless tyrant to affect their work rate.\n\nVoice acting had no effort at all.\n\nIt feels like they didn’t even try to hire professionals and used a programmer to act it out. Even then he sounds like it was his first take and has no emotion and energy at all. It sounds like a normal talking speech.\n\nOn some units like archers and some siege weapons they literally used some voice lines from older Stronghold games.\n\nSometimes has lags and stutters during the game.\n\nUI and controls are a bit clunky especially with when trying to make buildings face a certain way.\n\nUnit animation sometimes just stops, and battle animation looks very cringe. Projectiles look very unrealistic, and physics feel very unrealistic for a 2014 game.\n\nAI is no better than in SC1 and maps feel a bit small for a modern game.\nOverall I would only get it if it’s on sale or if you want to support firefly and hope for a miracle that they can recreate the old Stronghold games of early 2000s.","April 1","false","2.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

More or less the same units, same buildings, same game mechanics, also the music is fitting (well, its the same as in SHC). So, how can this be a bad game?\nGraphics. Everything looks washed, tiny and small. Units look the same. Original SHC looked much better in my opinion. You cant differ. AI was bad in SHC, it hasnt improved much. Enemies just ran at your castle walls without any tactic at all (and they seem to use the same routes more or less everytime they attack). I cant figure out how to rotate buildings. Is there any hotkey? Are there any hotkeys at all? I dont know, the game doesnt tell me and there is now way to configure anything. There is not much new content. You even got nearly the same enemies you had in SHC1. There are bugs. Like catapults standing right in front of you shooting at your walls but somehow you cant destroy them with archers because they overlap with that enemy construction camp.

However, I waited it out and bought the game. Originally, it was slow. When I viewed a castle it lagged. I discovered this was a problem with my RAM - 3GB. I tried it on my laptop - 4GB RAM - and it proved to be much better. It is a great improvement on the original crusader, if a little memory-draining. The multilayer is a great advantage, if a little buggy.\n\nSome good units have dissapeared, but thankfully, were replace with units of equal awesomeness. Engineers have been removed. Another good point is that the view is much more controllable.\n\nI would recommend, despite it being similar to the original.

This is bc it is so damn unfair...I could not even complete the tutorial missions because i kept dying bc the AI cheats like crazy/ or the mission design is terrible.\n\nI have played RTS games for years and this is by far one of the most frustrating games i have ever played in my entire life. The tutorial missions suck because they don't always explain why you should do something. Additionally some of the mechanics in this game are stupid...i build a huge catapault behind my castle walls...8 archers approach my wall and kill the catapault by shooting THROUGH the wall somehow and destroy a huge defensive structure that takes a lot of resources to build.\n\nIn the territorial mission i got stuck on, within minutes of starting you are faced with constant attacks. They tell you to use your horse archers to harrass the attackers as they can fire and move. So i did...repeatedly. Ya that works to a point (bc sometimes they stop randomly and die, and after enough time while your trying to fend off the repeated attacks with your archers, you need to also raise your defenses and then build an army capable of destroying the enemy castle.\n\nEven with a literal army of those archers, and some frontline infantry and catapaults...the enemy base is structured in such a way that to get your catapaaults near the walls to destroy them (so your melee guys can get in there) the catapualts must enter archer range..and subsequently get destroyed as your trying to manage them, defending against the constant attacks, while trying ot push your own attack. I lost this mission repeatedly, even after i attacked the AI's economy in the first few minutes of the game (destroying his farms and all other buildings/workers outside his walls).\n\nI like a challenge..but when less than an hour into a games F$%&#@@ tutorial and i am constantly having to reload and reload..its just ridiculous. Oh..and did i mention that the AI on YOUR side is just stupid?\n\nYou have oil pots laced around the map..your flame archers are the only ones who can set it off..but you have to micro manage EACH one and get them to fire at the oil patches you placed earlier..individually..while being attacked from multiple sides....this unit is the only one you are given in the mission to start the fires...yet you must tell them to start a fire individually (the fact they are near a place to start a fire and enemies just walked over it is not good enough...). Which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have people attacking you from 3 sides at once.\n\njust writing this review is making me relive the annoying and frustrating experience that was trying to "play" this broken, unfair, unfun, rip off, totallly poor excuse for a game. A game is supposed to be fun...minutes into a game when your yelling at the $$%$ screen because you keep dying in the tutorial...its not any fun period. This is not a game...its like internet trolls got together and created something they called a "game" to just @$#$% with people who wanted to have fun.\n\nAvoid...this..game...at...all...costs. you will regret it if you dont heed my advice. i plan on never giving this developer my money ever again...total garbage! Dont even buy it on sale..i paid full price for this garbage and after less than 4 hours of play..its been deleted.","March 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I could use that 50 bucks back too. Heres why:\n-FAR less units than the original\n-Absolute nightmarish AI with infinite resources. Expect them to already have a castle and an army headed your way in 5-7 minutes.\n-I got bored of the campaign. Rather quickly too.\n-Laggy for some reason\n-Watered down gameplay. Once upon a time, Stronghold was known for being a castle-sim RTS. And boy, were the older games SO MUCH FUN. Now? Its a watery, poor RTS. Really Firefly? What happened? All you had to do was make a sequel to the original crusader. Does anyone remember having cool things like executing criminals and inspiring fear to your own people? How about the old Honor system? Castle feasts to gain honor? ITS ALL GONE HERE. Its a bit VERY sad that the original Crusader had about 42.7 times more content. I think you were better off doing a 3D remake. Not this.\n-Instead of fixing the game, Firefly makes some DLC's. I understand you are a small company, but you already milked those that bought this 50 bucks each. At this point, you don't NEED more money.\n-I don't know if this still happens, but even with 3 other people in a multiplayer game, it will either crash or disconnect. Fun.\n-It takes FOREVER to get resources. I do not recall it taking THIS long in Stronghold 2 + Stronghold Legends.\n-Again, Firefly could've had something going on here. but I couldn't tell you what happened. But the game just feels empty and not really finished.\n-Am I done yet? No.\n-There were interesting choices, like using the Havok engine for destruction. It DOES feel good when you tear down an enemy wall or tower. BUT the wall or tower will just re-appear momentarily.\n-Strategy? What? You think this was Strategy? I've played this game long enough to tell you that even if you DID get an army of units, you'll notice there is NO thinking involved when you attack. This is because there are 2 main types of units, and a few Special Mercenary units that attack in different ways. The Mercenaries were an interesting touch, to be honest, but if you see a large force of Arabian Knights heading your way, you'll notice your archers basically tickle them to death from a distance with arrows. Literally the only way to counter the tougher units like Knights is with Knights. The only thing to be concluded about strategy here is that Archers are used for taking out unarmored units and enemy peasants, and the tougher Melee units are only good for countering units of the same type. Fun. On top of that, the AI still has infinite resources and can spam such said Knights and such said Archers before you can blink.\n-Even worse is that back then, it felt pretty cool to be able to siege and starve out a faction's castle or spread diseases by launching sick cows. You can launch diseased animals in SC2, but its just an area of effect that deals some damage over a little bit. As for starving them out? Nope.\n-False advertisement. I will quote something from the description that makes me laugh every time: "Crusader 2 recaptures the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation". What fast-paced gameplay? You mean being rushed by the AI before you can recruit one guy is fast-paced? Authentic Castle Simulation? What are you simulating exactly? Nothing. The only thing to look at in a castle are the citizens moving about, gathering resources, etc. Thats it. No feasts, no jousts, no guards chasing criminals, no criminals rotting in a jail, no criminals being tortured, no criminals period. No falconers, dung patrol guys, no jester wandering around, no women tending to the households and going about, Nothing but people walking around. Sigh. Just a boring, plain castle with next to having absolute zero life in it.\n\nYou know, if Firefly would have created a sequel by following in the footsteps of the original and grabbing a few things from the previous Strongholds, it would've been worthy of the 50 dollar price tag. I can't even fathom this game being sold for any more than 10 dollars. I would rather see the old 2D crusader ported into 3D, with the same units and stuff. That would've been much more worth it. But I just CANNOT understand HOW these guys messed up. They have the IP of a game that could quite possibly DESTROY the other RTS games out there. They could've gone more in-depth and perhaps added bigger maps, a territory system that you see in games like Rise of Nations, more units, actual strategic thinking, Hell, even some decent optimisation and a really high unit cap would've turned the tables. It seems like the graphic quality of this game surpasses the actual gameplay too.\n\nIf you read this enormous wall of text I typed out, I thank you for reading this rant. If you are thinking of buying this game, GO BUY THE STRONGHOLD COLLECTION. It costs less and just ONE of the Strongholds it comes with has LOADS more content than this... abomination. It pains me to write this because this was once a respected series, and now its come to this.","June 9, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

Ranged units like archers or crossbowmen will attempt to attack hostiles in the same way.\n\n- Pathfinding is a mess.  Units will get stuck on things, or just phase through things on occasion (as well as the standard Stronghold thing where units will clip through each other as they move, though I don't mind this since it means you can get groups through tight spaces in a reasonable-ish time).  In order to get units up onto my walls, I had to click the ground in front of them - clicking on the walls themselves got the "no path" icon.\n\n- Units seem to be unable to attack-move.  "Attack ground" is a button option but it doesn't appear to do anything for most units.  The AI can have units attack anything as they go, but the player cannot do the same without lots of micromanagement.\n\n- Units will sometimes stop animating as they move, becoming stuck in an unmoving "standing" pose as they glide across the landscape.  Shadows glitch out, and textures are inconsistent, with some objects feeling like HD while others feel like they're from the late 90s.  All movement seems... floaty.\n\n- Camera controls are awkward, with too much "glide" applied, making a QUICK zoom in/out impossible.  You cannot zoom in or out with the mouse wheel while trying to place a building, as the mouse wheel is instead used to rotate the building.","April 1","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The overall vibe of the game is really cool and feels so much like the first game. Overall the game is very enjoyable, and offers a lot of game modes. This game is good restart point for firefly studios and from here they can build the game up and add more features. The game still needs some patching and improvement however.\nIf you are a stronghold series fan get it now with no hesitation, if you are new then you can wait for patch or two or get it when it is cheaper, because to be honest the price is kind of high for what the game is currently delivering.","September 27, 2014","true","73.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I could use that 50 bucks back too. Heres why:\n-FAR less units than the original\n-Absolute nightmarish AI with infinite resources. Expect them to already have a castle and an army headed your way in 5-7 minutes.\n-I got bored of the campaign. Rather quickly too.\n-Laggy for some reason\n-Watered down gameplay. Once upon a time, Stronghold was known for being a castle-sim RTS. And boy, were the older games SO MUCH FUN. Now? Its a watery, poor RTS. Really Firefly? What happened? All you had to do was make a sequel to the original crusader. Does anyone remember having cool things like executing criminals and inspiring fear to your own people? How about the old Honor system? Castle feasts to gain honor? ITS ALL GONE HERE. Its a bit VERY sad that the original Crusader had about 42.7 times more content. I think you were better off doing a 3D remake. Not this.\n-Instead of fixing the game, Firefly makes some DLC's. I understand you are a small company, but you already milked those that bought this 50 bucks each. At this point, you don't NEED more money.\n-I don't know if this still happens, but even with 3 other people in a multiplayer game, it will either crash or disconnect. Fun.\n-It takes FOREVER to get resources. I do not recall it taking THIS long in Stronghold 2 + Stronghold Legends.\n-Again, Firefly could've had something going on here. but I couldn't tell you what happened. But the game just feels empty and not really finished.\n-Am I done yet? No.\n-There were interesting choices, like using the Havok engine for destruction. It DOES feel good when you tear down an enemy wall or tower. BUT the wall or tower will just re-appear momentarily.\n-Strategy? What? You think this was Strategy? I've played this game long enough to tell you that even if you DID get an army of units, you'll notice there is NO thinking involved when you attack. This is because there are 2 main types of units, and a few Special Mercenary units that attack in different ways. The Mercenaries were an interesting touch, to be honest, but if you see a large force of Arabian Knights heading your way, you'll notice your archers basically tickle them to death from a distance with arrows. Literally the only way to counter the tougher units like Knights is with Knights. The only thing to be concluded about strategy here is that Archers are used for taking out unarmored units and enemy peasants, and the tougher Melee units are only good for countering units of the same type. Fun. On top of that, the AI still has infinite resources and can spam such said Knights and such said Archers before you can blink.\n-Even worse is that back then, it felt pretty cool to be able to siege and starve out a faction's castle or spread diseases by launching sick cows. You can launch diseased animals in SC2, but its just an area of effect that deals some damage over a little bit. As for starving them out? Nope.\n-False advertisement. I will quote something from the description that makes me laugh every time: "Crusader 2 recaptures the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation". What fast-paced gameplay? You mean being rushed by the AI before you can recruit one guy is fast-paced? Authentic Castle Simulation? What are you simulating exactly? Nothing. The only thing to look at in a castle are the citizens moving about, gathering resources, etc. Thats it. No feasts, no jousts, no guards chasing criminals, no criminals rotting in a jail, no criminals being tortured, no criminals period. No falconers, dung patrol guys, no jester wandering around, no women tending to the households and going about, Nothing but people walking around. Sigh. Just a boring, plain castle with next to having absolute zero life in it.\n\nYou know, if Firefly would have created a sequel by following in the footsteps of the original and grabbing a few things from the previous Strongholds, it would've been worthy of the 50 dollar price tag. I can't even fathom this game being sold for any more than 10 dollars. I would rather see the old 2D crusader ported into 3D, with the same units and stuff. That would've been much more worth it. But I just CANNOT understand HOW these guys messed up. They have the IP of a game that could quite possibly DESTROY the other RTS games out there. They could've gone more in-depth and perhaps added bigger maps, a territory system that you see in games like Rise of Nations, more units, actual strategic thinking, Hell, even some decent optimisation and a really high unit cap would've turned the tables. It seems like the graphic quality of this game surpasses the actual gameplay too.\n\nIf you read this enormous wall of text I typed out, I thank you for reading this rant. If you are thinking of buying this game, GO BUY THE STRONGHOLD COLLECTION. It costs less and just ONE of the Strongholds it comes with has LOADS more content than this... abomination. It pains me to write this because this was once a respected series, and now its come to this.","June 9, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

It is just awful, a complete let down. First off you're going to need a pretty beefy computer to run this, it isn't like the old crusader with simple graphics, it's all this new fancy ultra 3D graphics that will require much more then your basic video card. Second of all the whole game mechanics have  been demolished. If you played the original crusader you'll remember how you could press certain buttons to change the view to make it easier to build? Ya those are all gone. You can't lower the buildings down to see what the heck someone is doing behind your building. Also on that matter all buildings are faced forward, you cant change the direction their facing. I could go on for half an hour about everything wrong with this game but I'm just going to finish it short and simple:\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nIT IS AWFUL\nYOU WILL REGRET IT AND IT WILL RUIN STRONGHOLD CRUSADER FOR YOU","December 29, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This series is the best Castle Sim RTS out there. With Crusader 1 being dear to my heart, and with the last title in the series, Stronghold 3 being a colossal failure, I, like many longtime Stronghold fans, was trepidatious as to how this title would pan out. Upon seeing mostly positive reviews I scooped it up and haven't regretted it since.\n\nI have seen negative reviews complaining about some of the elements of the original being taken out. So what, you want the exact same game again? Sure things were omitted, but things were also added too. The siege equipment is much more varied and detailed, and the castle defenses offers fun alternatives, as just a small example of new material.\n\nWHAT I LIKE:\n\nEconomy and Food Balance & ease of interface with this aspect - this element is enough to make it challenging but does not require constant micromanagement while out pillaging and rampaging.\n\nNew Troop options - offers additional new units through both the barracks and mercenary post that are worth trying. Slave Driver, anyone? A couple Whirling Dervishes?\n\nNew and Entertaining Siege Equipment - ever wanted to watch a rotting camel carcass splatter on your enemies' castle and minions? Now is your chance!\n\nNew AI Characters, plus the classics\n\nSkirmish mode!!! Hours of fun. Hours.\n\nDevs plan to add more content as they go\n\nMY CRITICISMS:\n\nAI is better than facing a mouth breathing 10 year old, but could be better still. Its really not bad, and I haven't faced everyone yet, but like the other titles most of the AI have a routine and once you figure it out that opponent is less challenging. But the skirmish maps balance that by creating difficult combinations of circumstances and oppenents. I just finished a skirmish map facing one competent opponent and one incompetent, and they had twice the starting resources as me. It was very challenging at first to get an economy, food production, and defense as they ransacked me and I had to start several times before I found an early approach that worked. But once I did get established, it was just a matter of time until I felt comfortable with the size of the army and siege equipment to finish them off. I realize how difficult it would be to design an AI like this, but some adaptations expressed by the AI late game would make that part more challenging.\n\nGraphics aren't blow-you-away fantastic. I've seen this complaint in other reviews and I won't deny I have more graphically astute games in my collection. But I have always chosen gameplay and an engaging challenge over graphical perfection and for me this title does just fine with the graphics it has. Could they be better? Yes. Do they need to be? No way.\n\nMore content, although from posts I have seen it sounds like the devs will be actively adding to the game in the future.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor me, the pros have far outweighed the cons and I have no regrets with the money & time I have put into this title. I can't wait for a couple friends to get it so we can get medieval on each other's castles.\n\nHappy Sieging!","September 28, 2014","true","87.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

At the moment on the larger maps, i can pretty much ruin anybodies fun by placing a couple of seige camps and burning down all their buildings, if the distance away from buildings was increased, this could help, or even just a better marker on the map for the seige camps, because they are hard to see at the moment.\n\n-Although there is already heaps of units in the game, maybe bring back engineers, tunnelers and laddermen, these were always very useful when trying to get into a castle plus i love killing the laddermen :)\n\n- The castle building FPS drop, for some reason there is a massive FPS drop when you try to make walls and towers and this is very noticable further along in a mission, perhaps there is a way to fix this?\n\n-Campaign!!! - like the old crusader, there should be a campaign you can play on! those were always fun and maybe a story could be thrown in with cutscenes :) i think this would be fantastic!\n\n-Churches should still be able to create monks, because monks were the best when stacked against an army of knights!\n\n-fear factor could be brought back, but after playing a fair bit, i realise that it may be useful to newer players or players that may be limited to only a few resources depending on the map and type of game. However having it might be crucial.\n\n- a few more voiceovers for the AI, getting sick of the rat telling me how im a "bumpkin" every time he attacks.\n\n- perhaps a few more ai? i quite enjoyed the old crusader ai's however that isnt as important.\n\nWhat i enjoy most about the game:\n\nWell i have owned, stronghold deluxe edition, stronghold crusader, and stronghold crusader extreme.\n\nthen i bought this,  and i dont understand why people are saying this isnt like the older ones, sure things need to be added, but what game these days is sold and not fully fixed? plus they need our help to fix it.\nITS STRONGHOLD FOR GODS SAKE IS FU**ING AWESOME :D\n\nYeah so this is pretty much my review, maybe bring back moat digging, oh and before i forget\n\nThe online servers still need to be fixed, once a few players start building the lag becomes unplayable.\n\nThankyou\n","October 20, 2014","true","49.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Since the base game is $50 and my hours at the writing of this review is over 37, I would consider this game a winner.\n\nIf you were a major fan of the old Stronghold games, you may dislike this game. It is a striped down and simplified version with some moderate graphics. It does have some very disappointing AI and gives the impression that the designers spent very little time thinking of balance or performance.\n\nIt is an enjoyable game, but after about 30 hours you will likely begin to lose interest.

This game didn't quite achieved them.\nBut hey, I'm still enjoying it. It has great potential thats just needs more polish, bug-squishing and a little more love,\n\nPros and cons in my opinion:\n\nPros:\nGraphics, I like it. Just that. Could have been better? Nah, of course. But im not all about graphics.\nGameplay. Feels like home in original Crusader, with a bunch of new units. Game is tougher also.\nAtmosphere. Stronghold-like. What more is to say? Love the music, also.\nEconomy has more balance than original, more focused on taxes than selling loads of stone/iron. Bigger challange.\n\nCons:\nSome bugs there are. Really weird ones also.\nFew things missing like "strong walls", siege towers, easy and strightforward setting your lord as crusader/arabic with specific units for start.\nPerformance issues. Eating more than 2Gb of Ram is not a thing to be proud of... and fps decrease with time when playing with more than 4 AI players.\nCampagins are OK, but short. What i missing most however is First Stronghold type of storytelling (Character chatting before each mission and after, by the fireplace, loved that, made a great atmosphere)\n\nSo yeah, thats it. Im looking forward to future updates which this game needs. Maybe some expansions too, like new characters(especially good old pig and snake).\n\nOverall, this game is not like Oh-My-God-This-Is-Best-Game-Ive-Ever-Played.\nBut it is fun. That's what matters here.\n\nKudos for the Firefly's two programmers running the project. (I'm wannabe programmer so seeing a quite complex game made by two people I can't be in awe, so much to learn...)\n\nKeep it up and running, keep it updated, keep it alive Firefly.\n","November 5, 2014","true","72.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its really not bad, and I haven't faced everyone yet, but like the other titles most of the AI have a routine and once you figure it out that opponent is less challenging. But the skirmish maps balance that by creating difficult combinations of circumstances and oppenents. I just finished a skirmish map facing one competent opponent and one incompetent, and they had twice the starting resources as me. It was very challenging at first to get an economy, food production, and defense as they ransacked me and I had to start several times before I found an early approach that worked. But once I did get established, it was just a matter of time until I felt comfortable with the size of the army and siege equipment to finish them off. I realize how difficult it would be to design an AI like this, but some adaptations expressed by the AI late game would make that part more challenging.\n\nGraphics aren't blow-you-away fantastic. I've seen this complaint in other reviews and I won't deny I have more graphically astute games in my collection. But I have always chosen gameplay and an engaging challenge over graphical perfection and for me this title does just fine with the graphics it has. Could they be better? Yes. Do they need to be? No way.\n\nMore content, although from posts I have seen it sounds like the devs will be actively adding to the game in the future.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor me, the pros have far outweighed the cons and I have no regrets with the money & time I have put into this title. I can't wait for a couple friends to get it so we can get medieval on each other's castles.\n\nHappy Sieging!","September 28, 2014","true","87.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Stronghold is back!\n\nOnce you get past the horrible front-end, you'll find an addictive and highly engaging RTS in the style of AOE3, with a highly developed castle building element. The economy echos the Anno games too, but in a much more streamlined form.\n\nIn-game graphics are good, with nice character designs, and some good animations. Castles look well planted, and the environment is fairly interesting.\n\nVoice acting is as excellent as ever, but it sounds like clips from the older games have been re-used, including much of the fantastic music (possible the best I've heard in any game).\n\nThe game has currently dropped a lot of the whimsical characterisation of the peasants, and certain popular features, such as the castle enhancements and punishments, have been left out, but crucially, Crusader 2 plays better than the original Stronghold. City management is easy and rewarding, castle designing is incredibly simple and flexible, and the siege element is the best in any RTS yet.\n\nThere's much more to come, according to the developers, and i believe them. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the game that should have been made years ago. It captures the Stronghold atmosphere perfectly and actually improves on the original's core game play.","September 29, 2014","true","21.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
