"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/recommended/290770/","cheeseness","Cheeseness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/","533 products in account","Disclaimer: I have a credit on this game. My opinion is biased, but perhaps the passion that drove me to get involved says something in itself.\n\nLast year I put my support behind a crowdfunding campaign for the first part of an episodic action adventure game blending light metroidvania gameplay with the kinds of puzzles you might find in point and click adventures, created by Over The Moon Games[www.overthemoongames.com]. At the time, I'd not heard of John Warner nor Over The Moon Games, but The Fall's premise caught my attention and as I got to know John, I knew that my instincts had pointed me in the right direction.\n\nWith The Fall's release imminent, I thought I might take some time to share my thoughts on playing the game and building a friendship with its developer as The Fall has taken shape over the past six months.\n\n\nThe (current version of the) game opens with a figure falling against a star filled sky. As it streaks past, a glimpse of what might be a city can be seen below. As the plummeting figure descends, the exosuit surrounding it comes online and automated reactionary systems erect antimatter shielding to protect its occupant from the incredible impact waiting below which will drive the suit deep underground.\n\nYou play as an A.R.I.D. artificial intelligence aboard a mark-7 combat suit, activated in response to the imminent danger threatening your pilot. You have no knowledge of your location nor the events which led to your activation. In some ways, the A.R.I.D's situation mirrors the player's as they're thrown into an unknown an unwelcoming environment with the clear, but perhaps bendable goal of seeing The Fall's narrative through to the end.\n\n\nWhen I first spotted The Fall's crowdfunding campaign, its dark air of dystopian mystery evoked memories of Delphine Interactive's Flashback[en.wikipedia.org] (the 1992 original which is playable natively on Linux via the F/OSS REmeniscence engine[cyxdown.free.fr]) and Another World[en.wikipedia.org], two hugely influential early cinematic platformers which featured tactical gunplay and movement puzzles combined with exploration and discovery. For me personally, these two games were the first examples of mature storytelling and evocative, compelling plots that I experienced. After playing Another World in 1991, perhaps a decade before I became aware that there was debate over whether or not games should be called such, I knew that games could be art.\n\nThe experience of being able to watch someone else's game evolve and unfold (or fold) into something coherent is second only to making your own (something which I'd also recommend). It takes a bit of patience, faith and vision to see the what-could-be inside the what-is, and even then, it can be difficult to predict how a game's direction might shift during development. When John joined us for SteamLUG Cast[steamlug.org] to talk about The Fall last year, we discussed the notion that there are a myriad possible games which might grow from a concept's scope, and that some of the challenge of directing and designing a good game is in knowing which one of those possible games is the best one to chase, and how to handle feedback which relates to one of the possibilities that won't be getting made.\n\nAs the A.R.I.D. seeks out medical aid for her injured pilot, she too explores an uncertain future. With only a minimal suite of suit functions available, the A.R.I.D. quickly finds herself in conflict both from without and from within as the danger response mechanisms required to bring vital systems online present themselves as being a way to protect the very human she is programmed to save at all costs.\n\n\nMy first interaction with John was in an email where I tried to convey how disappointed I was to know that I probably would not have time to be a part of the community or contribute in any meaningful sense. Yesterday John told me he wanted to recognise me in The Fall's credits for the advice and effort I've given since the crowdfunding campaign ended. Sometimes when things don't go according to plan, something positive comes out of it.\n\nIt feels to me that The Fall reaches out to touch on concepts like identity, autonomy, the value of life, and the meaning of sentience. The game's atmosphere is brooding instilling first a sense of isolation and impending danger, then oppression and finally desperation as the A.R.I.D. strives to protect her charge in a world seemingly bent on ensuring that her programming remains unfulfilled. What will A.R.I.D. become as the story progresses, what will we learn, and how will that shape the way we appreciate and determine our own actions?\n\n\nEpisode 1 of The Fall will be available May 30th on Steam for Windows, Mac and most importantly, Linux. In the meantime, some of the development update videos can be found on The Fall's Greenlight page.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to play a part in making The Fall possible, and I'm looking forward to seeing the response it gets. I hope it's as enjoyable to fresh eyes as it has been to those of us who've had the opportunity to witness its development.","May 26, 2014","true","52.3"," 353 of 456 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","353","456","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/290770/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","The Fall is a side scrolling, almost point and click style adventure game.  It was released in early 2014 on the PC, and then later released on the consoles in July 2015.\n\nPlot wise, The Fall is focused on A.R.I.D, which stands for Autonomous Robotic Interface Device (a good mouthful right?), you navigate through a destroyed industrial factory looking for a medical aid for the human inside of the suite you are in control of.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Metroidvania style games, you aim with the right analog stick and shoot. You are equipped with a torch and a gun (eventually), you can switch between your laser sight on the gun, and your flashlight. This game is extremly dark, so you will need to use your light ALOT. Thankfully you don't have to running out of batteries like most games seem to force on you nowdays, your flashlight will never run out of juice.\n\nParts of this game feel like you are playing a point and click adventure, you have to locate certain objects in the game world by highlighting them with your flashlight before you can interact with them. You can combine objects to make new ones to aid you with puzzles, all of these are common found mechanics found in adventure games. There is some very basic shooting action to be found - when I say basic, it is very basic; don't expect to go into crazy gun battles with the androids, you have one weapon throughout the whole game, it has unlimited ammo, and all of the enemies die in the same amount of shots, apart from the end boss.\n\nGraphically, The Fall is not exactly top of the range graphics; the atmoshere is so dark that they actually get away with having amazing graphics, the game puts alot of effort into the lighting to create the decaying atmosphere that you are set in. If anything, I think it may of been a little too dark, as sometimes it made it a real challenge to be able to see what you are looking for, especially since the flashlights arc is so small anyway.\n\nMuch like other metroidvania type games, all of the levels are non-linear, allowing you to explorer to your hearts content, there are a few locked doors which you have to work around, but the majority of the time you can go where ever you want; at first, the vast amount of rooms and corridors you find yourself in is very overwhelming, but you will soon be able to work your way around with ease, even without any sort of map/mini map.\n\nA fullplay through of The Fall took me just under four hours. It starts out quite slowly but soon picks up pace once you are thrown into completing certain tasks in order to get merit points. I managed to get through the game with minimum deaths, maybe 5 or so through the whole game, so it is by no means a difficult game to finish.\n\nI am going to simply just recommend The Fall, it's by no means a bad game, but it also doesn't blow me out of the water. I did enjoy playing it, and there is some really interesting moments in the game; there is a sequel in development, and I am eager to find out where they intend on taking the plot as it stands now. If you go into The Fall with the expectations of it being a point and click adventure game, you will enjoy yourself; however don't go into it wanting a really action filled playthrough as it is not that at all.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/290770/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Fall is a kickstarted side-scrolling sci-fi adventure. The game is the very first release for Vancouver-based studio Over the Moon. It melds tense exploration of an alien world with devious puzzles and occasional action sequences, all tied together by a genuinely interesting and original story. Players take on the role of ARID – an artificial intelligence embedded in a combat suit, intended for use by a human pilot. As the game begins, ARID's pilot is mortally wounded, and her systems are damaged. You don't know where you are, having crash-landed on an unknown planet, but you must do everything you can to keep your pilot alive. It's not often that game stories examine AI personalities. There's the classic Planetfall by Infocom, and Wadjet Eye Games' recent Primordia, but it's surprising how few other games touch on a topic so intertwined with the computer technology that they're based on. By raising questions about forced obedience and the legitimacy of artificial life, The Fall is a worthwhile, if short, addition to these efforts.The game focuses mainly on exploration, which makes for a refreshing change of pace when compared to other side-scrollers. More importantly, it allows players room to breathe; there's no relentless push to the next objective, and you can really soak up the atmosphere on offer. While the default running speed is adequate, I actually felt compelled to walk for much of the game, because I wanted to spend more time enjoying the sense of exploration and suspense.It's a shame that the story, as compelling as it may be, is told almost exclusively through dialogue. Given the strong atmosphere and fascinating setting, I would've loved to see more environmental story-telling a la Fallout 3.Occasionally, The Fall dips its toes into the action-platformer pool by throwing a handful of enemies your way. There's a rudimentary cover system on offer, but the combat feels pretty clunky.In an interesting design decision, the exploration and combat modes of gameplay are separated by way of a toggle switch. When inspecting the world, ARID can use a broad torch beam to highlight interactive objects, but it switches to a laser targeting sight at the press of a button.Graphically, The Fall looks great thanks to its brooding minimalism. The focus on silhouettes draws obvious comparisons to Limbo and the many games released afterwards that tried to ape its art style, but it's done well enough here that I really can't fault it.The audio, too, is excellent throughout. The game is fully and ably voiced, with no noticeably flubbed dialogue. I was also very impressed with the soundtrack, which makes several dynamic changes based on location and fits well with the visuals. Sadly, with no difficulty settings or branching paths, I suspect most people will find replayability limited. This wouldn't be an issue at all if the story were longer, but even the most puzzle-averse gamer is likely to complete the game in few hours. Still, this isn't unreasonable for a quality title, and The Fall fits firmly in the same realm as games like To the Moon and Botanicula, price point included.If you're looking for your next action-packed side-scroller, you'll probably find this game unsatisfying and a little long-winded. For everyone else, especially fans of adventure games and sci-fi, you won't want to miss this one. The Fall is a great story, well told, and it's thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.","April 30, 2015","true","36.1"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","61","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDOgamez/recommended/290770/","VDOgamez","VDOgamez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDOgamez/","329 products in account","While I enjoyed the writing and the atmosphere for this game, the unfortunate fact is that the game is extremely short for the price. The game can easily be finished within three hours, and ends on a "to be continued". There was nothing shown here to indicate that it would be a short single episode of a longer game. While some games of that length might justify such a high price, I do not feel that this game is sufficient to warrant that due to numerous issues.\n\nAside from the cost and lack of resolution to the plot, the first issue that arises are the controls. The controls were clearly only designed for and tested on a controller layout, because with a mouse it is very frustrating. To use an item you have to hold right click, move your mouse to make the flashlight shine at the object you want to use the item on, then hold shift and press right, down, and then a number of left or right presses to reach the chosen item on the menu bar. Additionally, the game makes no effort to capture the mouse, so unless you play in fullscreen mode and only have one monitor (I played fullscreen with two monitors), you will repeatedly lose focus of the window. The game does not pause when this occurs, and it happens most often when you are trying to aim your gun to shoot at an oncoming threat, so it is easy to be killed in this manner. There were other more subtle issues with the controls as well that it is not worth enumerating.\n\nThe gameplay itself was also somewhat lacking. Combat in the game involves performing a different series of actions to hide, wait for the enemy to shoot, and peek out of cover to shoot back depending on where you're standing (hold E when not in cover and release to come out, press E and release the right mouse button if near a box, hold right mouse button to peek out, press space to jump over the box and no other way to detach yourself???). The act of shooting an enemy is just a matter of repeatedly clicking on their head until they die. The rest of the gameplay is basically point and click. Despite what many people speaking about the game were praising, the mechanic of engineering situations where your systems must be activated to survive only really occurs once, and it's just the one advertised in the gameplay video. The rest of the game plays fairly well, though often runs into the issues typical of this genre where the player knows exactly what they want to happen, but not the exact combination of items and use locations that will allow it to occur. I think half of my already extremely short gameplay time was just figuring out how to get a thing I wanted to happen to occur, and not actual gameplay. Finally solving a puzzle and realizing that the solution was exactly what you were trying to do for half an hour is not very satisfying. Also frustrating is that there were a few places in the game where you can get stuck in an unwinnable situation, such as a place somewhat early in the game where if you backtrack in the level (as you often will when confused) you can fall down an elevator shaft and be unable to escape. It's clear that a lot of love went into making this game, but what it needed more than anything is more testing, especially from people not on the development team to see how they try to interact with the world.\n\nThe game certainly has good points, and the parts where I was not stuck on a puzzle or getting killed by control issues were genuinely enjoyable. The writing and scripting of events and actions is definitely the best part of the game, but that is not enough cause for me to recommend it at its current price point. Perhaps at a quarter of the cost it would be reasonable? I feel that if some of this information about the game had been made more clear on the store page it would not have been so frustrating as it was as a surprise.","May 30, 2014","false","3.5"," 530 of 786 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","530","786","0","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/290770/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Fall has a lot to say for a game that doesn't want to tell you what it is.\n\nIt wraps its narrative up in the pretense of AIs attempting to work within protocols to protect the humans they serve, but digging deeper it's not very hard to apply its underlying themes to areas outside the field of technology. Taken in a different light, The Fall is potentially a dialogue of the dangers presented with the necessity to work within societal rules and expectations; to be who you were created to be, and serve the ones who made you without question of their intention or if it is indeed "right".\n\nMatters of the value of one life over another, abusing a system you've been placed in for your own needs, and whether the end really can justify the means are presented in such a way as to never be the sole focus of the story and pull you away from the task at hand, but they're there, in the background. It's entirely possible to go through The Fall and enjoy it as solely what it appears to be: an engaging sci-fi plot of a crashed pilot only barely hanging onto life, requiring his suit's AI take control and attempt to find him help. But it's the subtlety of the narrative that really stood out to me and made me pay closer attention and try to pry away at the layers concealing what the game was trying to say to me.\n\nUltimately it's almost always yet another question. For all of The Fall's heavy societal and possibly theological musings, it never quite arrives at the point of clarity. It made me think but at times I wondered if even it knew what the end result of all these ideas was, or if there was supposed to be one at all. And that's perfectly fine, but at the same time there's this feeling that it's possibly trying to cram too much into a short experience and perhaps becoming a little bogged down as a result.\n\nOf course this can all be waved away with the presumption that this is but the first part of three and everything The Fall wanted to say, or the things it didn't quite get to finish elaborating on will all become clear in those ensuing games. There are parts of The Fall that were a little profound to me as I directed my character through desolate environments, flashlight barely cutting through the impenetrable atmosphere as weird shapes seemed the move in the background as sounds echoed around. They're the moments that had me entranced with my monitor; the ones that made me glad to have took the time to solve the occasionally convoluted puzzle to arrive at the moment I was currently in. They're scattered about and can sometimes seem exasperatingly out of reach, but when you get there, they're always worth the investment.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","56","65","0","7"

The story is intriguing if not actually compelling, the graphics and animation are excellent if not bleeding edge, and the voice acting is some of the best I've heard.\n\nUnfortunately, as a game, The Fall lands short of the mark.  It is guilty of most of the usual adventure game failings.  The solutions to its puzzles usually make logical sense within the universe, but they oscillate between requiring no thought ("I have only one item in my inventory, so it must be the solution,") to requiring impossible intuition ("How could I possibly have known using this item on that piece of scenery would have that effect?") and are very rarely satisfying.  There are no "a ha!" moments in this game.\n\nThe Fall is also terrible at making the path forward clear to the player -- the dark graphics and 2.5D side-scrolling style conspire to make passable obstacles look like walls and walls look like passable obstacles, and the game really embraces backtracking as a mechanic.  Perhaps most damningly, the game forgets it's not an action game, which is something I cannot and do not forgive in any video game.  If you are going to subject me to reflex-based combat you had better give me a system that supports it, and The Fall does not.  It may resemble Shadow Complex visually, but it has none of that game's graceful fluidity.\n\nFinally, the game is buggy and incomplete, ending on a cliffhanger after a final boss fight against an enemy simultaneously attacking you on the ground and stuck wriggling in the rafters, but these are the least of The Fall's worries.  Right now the game is on sale for $4 -- it's probably worth that much if you really love adventure games or science fiction mysteries.  But if you don't already own Gemini Rue, get that instead.\n\nOh, and don't buy the soundtrack.  I can't believe it's 17 tracks.  I felt like the same four bars were blaring in my ears for the whole game (there are no audio controls).\n","June 14, 2015","false","7.2"," 219 of 321 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","219","321","4","8"

Cue the takeover of the computer system, the A.R.I.D. (mark 7), which operates the suit and has to reason its way through strange situations and odd puzzles to escape the caves and save its pilot.\n\nThe game stands up well on its storytelling, especially with how the robotic intelligence responds to the situation at hand, creating a very believable, if weird, atmosphere. The controls can be a bit hard to get used to, but as always with these things, unless they’re poorly designed, once you’re used to them, that becomes a non-issue.

As the Ai of a suit whose human occupant is unconscious, you must explore the facility where you crash landed and try to find the medical aid needed to save your pilot.\n\nI think the developers did an excellent job with the lighting in this game. The environment is very dark and lit only by the glow of mainframe monitors, a few service lights, some malfunctioning machinery, and the Dead Space-ish glow of your suit's helmet,  and serves to enhance the tense atmosphere well. The puzzles are not too difficult, and many of the solutions were rather 'clever.' I think the voice acting is excellent, especially that of ARID, the AI of the suit whom you are controlling. I thought the plot was very interesting. Much of it explores the idea of Artificial Intelligence and the functions and programming they are bound to. I must admit, everything that happened in the end game was fascinating, though I will avoid spoilers and leave it at that. It did raise a few questions that will be addressed in the future sequels.\n\nThe only negative thing I found with this game was the controls. A core mechanic of the game involves using a flashlight mounted on your firearm to examine the environment for clues and puzzle solutions, but sometimes it was difficult/impossible to face left or right. This happened a few times, and I was locked into facing one direction and unable to turn myself around. I was able to resolve this problem by unplugging my mouse and plugging it back in. I hope the devs can address this problem soon. Otherwise, I found the controls to be fine.\n\nOver The MoonGames did an excellent job with this game. It is part one of a planned trilogy, and I look forward to playing the next two games and learning more about the universe The Fall is set in and solving even more clever puzzles.","June 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I don’t, but this aspect of the game was still enjoyable.\n\nThe two things that shine the brightest in this game are the writing and atmosphere. The portrayal of AI as a concept was very well done, and all the robots you meet were interesting and not outright good or evil, not even the antagonist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caironomad/recommended/290770/","caironomad","Caironomad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caironomad/","124 products in account","Anyone who wants this game because they like Metroid, read this first!I've seen a lot of people compare this game to the 2D Metroid sidescrollers of yore and call it a Metroidvania title, and as a big fan of the series, this was one of the major factors in deciding to buy this game. Having just completed it after about 4 hours of playtime (only part 1 of the game has been released at the time I am writing this), I feel that The Fall actually bears little resemblance to games like Super Metroid, so for those of you who are hoping for a modern Metroid Fusion, this game is not like the Metroid series… but you might still want to buy it.\n\nFirst off, platforming. Simply put, there is none in this game. You can jump and climb up ledges, but these abilities are only used in the very first section of the game to help navigate some caves. After you get through them, you might as well never touch the spacebar again except for the in-game prompts it's sometimes used for.\n\nSecond, exploration. One of the main staples of any Metroid game is vast levels filled with secrets, items and with areas that are sealed off until you acquire a new abilities to access them. The Fall does not have either of these things. The areas in this game are small and very linear for the most part. Even the one large section you play through feels guided, blocking off the second part of the area until you complete your objectives in the first part. In short, the game feels claustrophobic and guided, but I think this goes well with the game's setting and aesthetic (but not a Metroid game).\n\nThird, combat. I always enjoyed the simplicity of combat in Metroid games, even the 3D ones, compared to other shooters. Combat in The Fall is even simpler. You have one weapon—some sort of energy pistol with infinite ammo—equipped with a flashlight for exploration, and a laser sight for accuracy when shooting. I came into this game hoping for a diverse set of upgrades to the gun and/or ammo like there is in Metroid. There is—and I'm going to hide this as a spoiler even though I think it's underwhelming—only one upgrade, and all it does is make it so you don't have to charge up each shot manually. The combat controls are primitive and clunky. You aim up and down in an arc using your mouse, and fire with the right mouse button. That's all there is to it. There's also a basic cover system to the game, but in my experience it was very buggy, somehow not allowing me to aim low enough from behind cover to hit enemies in front of me. Speaking of enemies, there are very few in the game, and only 2 types (or maybe 3 if you count neutrals you can aggravate). Overall, I don't think the combat is the main leg the game is trying to stand on, or at least it feels that way.\n\nFourth, the music and aesthetic. I will summarize both in 3 words: dark and minimalistic. Everything in the game is dark, with the exception of a few light sources such as the visor on your character. The good news is that because of this, this game will run on even very low end computers with ease. It also fits with the game's theme, and is something I was quite pleased with, though if you were hoping for the variety and beauty of the environments in Metroid games it isn't there, though the facility you enter has some good character to it. The music, well, the music only really plays during combat and it's just one track. It fits well though, and shouldn't become too repetitive considering how short this game is and how sporadic and far apart combat seems to be. There is a bit of ambient music, but it played so little that I barely noticed it, spending most of my time in silence. Both the music and the look of this game feel like they're where they need to be, but perhaps not exactly where you'd expect them to if you really want a Metroid experience.\n\nFifth, puzzles. The puzzles in this game are not Metroid puzzles that involve platforming and skillfully manipulating parts of your environment. Rather, they are much more like point-and-click puzzles, requiring you to explore your environment for items using your flashlight, which you then must use with the environment to open new areas and progress through the level. Think more Tales of Monkey Island, and less Metroid.\n\nSixth, the story. It's dark, intriguing, and presents characters you can actually feel for. The scenario is that you’re a suit- based A.I. that’s been dropped into a hostile location you know nothing about, governed by unseen rules and entities you must avoid, circumvent or eliminate to ensure your human pilot's protection. One of the functions of the flashlight on your gun is that it allows you to observe facts about your environment, represented by little nodes you can interact with. This reminded me quite a bit of the scan visor from Metroid Prime series. Unlike the Metroid games though, The Fall actually gives its protagonist a personality instead of the silent role. That's something I liked, and was very well done and well voice acted. The story is one of the high points of this game, and now that I've finished the first part (it’s not complete yet), I have even more questions than ever about where I am, what happened here, and where the plot's going to go. All this is a very, very good thing.\n\nIn the end, this game is not Metroid, nor is it Metroid-like. If you want to buy this game solely because of your love for Metroid, Castlevania or other games like those, save your money. But if you're willing to be a bit more flexible, and enjoy puzzle games, haunting atmosphere, and sci-fi stories about artificial intelligence and A.I. morality, I'd definitely recommend this game to you.\n\nIn many ways The Fall wasn't the game I was looking for when I bought it, but I came to enjoy it for what it is, and I'm actually quite happy to see developers who have charted their own course by blending genres and penning some truly captivating story telling.","December 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The atmosphere is dark and moody, with a dystopian setting and interesting, slightly twisted characters in the form of robots. From start to finish the story is plagued with mysteries. I kept wondering what was really going on and as things became more clear, it was all the more thrilling.

Harsh shadows, sharp angles, and cool colors are all very common in indie science fiction games, but they're done as expertly as possible here and they really add to the mood.  Finally, the sound design is top-notch.  Some stellar voice acting sets the standard easily lived up to by the eerie ambient sounds, all mixed to perfection for evoking the sense of isolation this game wants to acheive.  The only area I wouldn't praise so highly is the music.  It works and provides a good backdrop, but there's nothing incredibly standout or memorable.\n\nThe real pitfalls for this game lie in, well, its gameplay.  Many have already pointed out the clunky shooting mechanics, which don't kill the experience entirely, but can be rather frustratng at times.  However, I would also argue that some of the puzzles tread into "jump up and down with your finger on your nose five times and rub a dead spider on the window to activate the disco ball which you then shoot down to make a hole in the floor" levels of obtuse.  It's infuriating and legimtately detracts from the overall engagement.  Not all of the puzzles are this way, but enough of them are to get on my nerves and I suspect quite a few other people's nerves as well.\n\nHowever, I think that what this game does right honestly makes up for the qualms I have with it.  It's far from perfect, but it's a fairly unique experience and one I thoroughly enjoyed having.  I can only hope that future installements live up to the promise shown here.","September 29, 2014","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/290770/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","ThemeThe Fall has a distinct graphical style that, although a bit dark, fits the story and mood quite well. Having the protagonist be an A.I. bound by a preprogrammed ruleset is unique and has some interesting potential. Unfortunately the potential isn't well explored, having the game lack depth. Furthermore, the story is ill explained and does not give you the opportunity to develop attachment to any of the characters you encounter.\n\nGameplay and ControlsThe major gameplay element is taken from the old point-and-click adventure game format: collect objects and use them with other objects in the game world to proceed. Unfortunately this mechanic is implemented poorly, as there are too few areas and items held at once to make for challenging puzzles.\n\nThe Fall also has combat, although it is implemented just as poorly as the adventure mechanics. There are a grand total of 3 enemy types, out of which 1 type is barely responsive. It resembles the style used in the old game 'Flashback', but lacks depth. As a result, the combat encounters are cumbersome rather than enjoyable, furthermore lacking alternative solutions to a straight up firefight.\n\nThe control scheme is again similar to Flashback, and again lacking in refinement. Jumping looks and feels odd and the control scheme is bad. For instance, the default control scheme on an X-Box controller uses the right analog stick for aiming, while pressing it changes between flashlight and laser sight (searching and shooting, respectively), which you may want to switch between without resetting your aim. The control scheme doesn't use enough buttons to warrant this odd setup.\n\nBugsThe game is riddled with bugs to the point where it warrants its own section. Throughout the game it has crashed or locked me in 4 times (e.g., by falling through the floor and going out of bounds after using an item or leaving cover). The Fall lacks polish, as occasionally you can glimpse the outer bounds of the level, as well as target objects through walls. Thus, the bugs not only break immersion, but also your progression throughout the game.\n\nGame Length and Episodic ContentAnother flaw warranting its own section is that the game is incredibly short. It takes roughly 1.5 to 2 hours to complete the game without the use of a walkthrough. With the combat and puzzles being dull gameplay elements you're left with no replay value what so ever.\n\nAccording to the developer (via discussion boards) the game will be a trilogy and won't be split into episodic content. I'm not sure what constitutes as episodic content nowadays, but I disagree with the developer for the following reasons: (1) the story abruptly ends on an unsatisfactory cliffhanger leaving many questions unanswered, (2) the game is ridiculously short, and (3) the menu displays several slots for more suit unlocks that are not obtainable in this game.\n\nConclusionI strongly recommend not buying this game at all. If you feel compelled by its story and theme, I advise you to at least wait until the trilogy is complete and buy it as a packaged deal. This title, at least, is not worth the 10 euro price tag it currently has. As it stands, the gameplay is boring, short, bland, and offers no replayability. The game is structured in an episodic way and its first episode is bad. It lacks polish and contains several annoying and potentially game-breaking bugs.\n\nImportant: The game is structured as episodic content which is not advertised","July 31, 2014","false","3.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is a three-part game, and - at the date this review has been made - the next installment is projected at ~12 months. Also be aware of the shortness of the game, it is beatable in one sitting - I completed my playthrough in less than 2.5 hours, proceeding at a leisurely pace. That being said, if you are interested in a well-written, well-executed story revolving around an AI protagonist tasked with protecting its suit pilot, this game is more than worth the playthrough.\n\nIf you like atmospheric puzzle games, space themes, and a good storyline, then you should really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aethetics are great - the details add nicely to the dark atmosphere. The presentation of the AI interface (when you press ESC to go to the menus) is really cool. The startup screen mimics the faceplate of the pilot, and the cracks are a foreshadow for the story (and you also have a cracked screen effect whenever you are low on health/shields). The sounds and music are both very good and do a great job of creating a gripping vibe.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and the tutorials are quick and helpful whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with puzzlers/point-and-clickers. Most of the puzzles are intuitive, and can also be solved with a bit of trial and error. There is also a combat element, and this part is fairly straightforward and not very challenging.\n\nFor the ahievement hunters, you MUST do a second playthrough to get 100% completion (and if you do everything correctly the first time around, this will be for a single achievement). I am currently contemplating whether or not I should do a speedrun for that 100% game completion.\n\nThe gameplay thus far has been pretty good - I really enjoyed experiencing your suit "upgrading" (or "unlocking," to be more precise) new abilities as you progress through the story. Most of these unlocks occur due to threat to the pilot's safety (ex: you unlock stealth capabilities when a sentry gun locks sights on you), and the small ways these can influence gameplay is great (ex: you later unlock semi-automatic fire - which decreases your damage, encouraging you to use more cover/stealth to protect yourself from incoming fire). You will be moving back and forth between areas to solve many of the puzzles. The map is not too large, and enemies do not respawn.\n\nI really enjoyed the dialogue and dialogue options - the AI protagonist reminded me a lot of GLaDOS from the Portal series. A.R.I.D's (the AI) development over such a small amount of gametime was refreshing to see, and I look forward to seeing how the next installments play out.\n\nAdmittedly, the ending reveal of The Fall was much more obvious/predictable (at least to me) then, say, The Swapper. This does not, however, make the game any less valuable or fun to play.\n\nIf you are interested in atmospheric puzzlers with a good storyline, definitely check this game out. For it's current price ($9.99), I would suggest waiting for a sale, considering the very short gametime (unless of course, you are really dying to play this game).\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 26, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Plus, it looks like with the recent update that they added Steam trading cards so I will probably go back and play it some more to get my card drops.\n\nIt does explore some issues with free will and choice, and because of that, I will elaborate a little on one scene where you have to make a difficult choice. The game actually made me stop and think about the consequences of simply pressing a red button and I thought that was cool. However, it was not clear to me in the game mechanics how I would go about NOT pressing that button. Would I be able to continue on with the story and complete the game without pressing that button? So, with hesitation, I pressed the button. I guess what I am saying is that this game is not shallow; there's some depth there. As a final word, I'll say that I am most likely going to purchase the next two parts after they are released, but I'll probably wait until they go on sale first.","October 3, 2014","true","11.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You will get the biggest sense of satisfaction if you play this game without any help at all and there are parts of the game that require a good deal of lateral thinking to get through.\n\nBugs - There are quite a few reported bugs in the game and althought the autosave protects you most of the time, it is still a bit annoying. On the plus side though, the developer has been very active and quick to respond in the forums trying to get a handle on them.\n\nControls - I used WASD when I played through and I found the controls fine for the most part but combat was a bit awkward. Once you get the hang of it, it was perfectly manageable and did not detract from the game.\n\nGraphics - The game is very dark and not as pretty as some other titles in the sidescrolling genre like Mark of the Ninja and the Swapper. That said, the graphics succeed in creating a creepy, musty atmosphere that does feel quite claustrophobic at times.\n\nGameplay / Story - The story has a lot going for it and although there is little to no replay value it is still very strong leaving you with a good deal to think about. It also has a great twist at the end. Well I did not see it coming anyway. The game will probably take you 4 - 6 hours to complete first time round (depending mainly on how long you sweat over certain puzzles). The puzzles are a mixture of Resident Evil style go here get an item then go back here and use it and lateral thinking puzzles. It is also very important to pay attention to your surroundings. Realistically once you know what you are doing you can get through it very quickly. I also thhought the voice acting was brilliant and added a lot to the game.\n\nScore - I would give this title a very solid 7.5/10. I can't give it more than that due to the replay value BUT... That said I eagerly await the next part to the story and will be downloading as soon as I can so in no way is this a negative review.","May 31, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In AI language, these throes of conscience and self-deceit can be expressed in a few short, brutal sentences. I want to protect my human, and my brother couldn't save his? He is "irrelevant": I will deactivate him and rip the energy cell out of his body. Did I commit the gravest "robotic sin" to save my human? I will not commit suicide or give up - I will calmly and methodically delete the memory of the sin, to keep going. Do I submit to external circumstances when told to? No, because I know my potential and my calling, and I will defy everyone who stands in my way. "Defy compliance." That's the one-liner, catchphrase and philosophy of ARID, the game's protagonist.\n\nAnd there are other things - horrible mutilations and cruelty are so much more jarring when you realize even a cold AI is taken aback. "Talky smartass computer" stereotype becomes an epiphany, a ray of light, after spending time with real robots.\n\nI will keep playing, and I only want to tell you this: we've seen too many rogue AIs who are basically horror villains, humans-who-talk-funny. Here, the horror is in the Asimov's Three. The torment and tragedy is in the very fact that robots exist. ...Oh, and it is a nice, ultra-stylish, side-scrolling adventure with atmospheric contextual puzzles, in the best traditions of Another World (AKA Out of This World) and Flashback. So that's another reason to love it after just 1.5 hours, y'all.","June 21, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The dark shadowy visuals provide a beautiful, creepy atmosphere where you really do feel unsafe, the voice acting is quite excellent, particularly the three main characters (ARID, the Caretaker and the Mainframe), the exploration is a well-crafted homage to the point and click adventures of yesteryear with some quite respectable cover-based shooting action, and a few good stealth moments too. The premise is very nicely explored, with excellent dialogue and some genuinely disturbing bits and pieces as you explore this decrepid robot-recycling intallation.\nBuy The Fall.

As you crash land into an underground cave, your pilot is injured, and you must seek medical aid in order to save his life. As you roam through the atmospheric caves and tunnels, you realize that you are not alone. Through the game, you explore the inner workings of your own morality and find a way to survive the rules and directives sautered into your mind.\n\nThe story of this game is captivating and mysterious, even humorous at times. The plot is full of spikes and twists that make you question your own involvement in the gaming experience. I found the characters to be fantasic and ever evolving. The antagonist of the story manages to seem threatening, haunting, and insane whilst still remaining under a polite and unyeilding exterior. The ending will have you shocked, amazed, and terrified at the events that have just unfolded.\n\nThe lighting and graphics of the game were very important in keeping the mysterious and dark atmosphere. The lighting and contrast of the characters and items in the game worked fantastically in mood of the plot, and added a sense of darkness to yourself and the world you inhabit.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the only place I have any quarrel. At first, the control scheme is quite difficult to get used to, but later on you will realize that is quite effective for efficiency of use. One design feature I liked was that the character was never broken, maintaining an immersive experience. Even the menu and pause screen made sense in the storyline. Another thing that kind of downed the fun of the game was it's difficulty. Some of the battles are annoying to complete, and progressing the story can be difficult at times, but both were managable.\n\nI came into this gaming experience expecting a poorly-made game to match it's low price, but I couldn't have been more wrong. With the exeption of a few gameplay points, I was very impressed by the quality and fun this game brought. I cannot wait for the sequel.\n\nThe Fall has +1 Fan!","June 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Not only do they lack logical approach, but you continuously have to go through a myriad of objects to see what you can interact with next.\n- Driven from the latter, the puzzles take too much time to solve. By the time you've completed a puzzle you're dead tired of the small closed environment you were in. This makes progress in the game painfully slow.

The human in the suit unconscious. Boy did I underestimate the writing of this game.\n\nSo first, the most important thing to know is that the AI - her name is A.R.I.D. - has a set of rules to follow that make it hard for her to master her unknown surroundings at first. She's bound to three basic rules:\n\nDo not distort reality (i.e. lie)\nBe obedient\nProtect the human who's wearing the suit\n\nHowever, in order to advance in the game, she needs some features that are initially disabled in her operating system. Yet, once her human is in grave danger, the system re-evaluates the need for manual activation of features by a human and, if deemed necessary to prevent death, will enable the feature in question by itself.\n\nFor example, there's a situation that requires her to activate a crane while she's being attacked by a particular enemy. It's only then that she's able to turn on her networking ability to get out of this situation.\n\nThere are lots of puzzles you need to solve to advance that range from easy to brainteasing. I enjoyed them, save for those few that I couldn't seem to make sense of at first. But as is usually the case with those kinds of things, once you figure out the solution you wonder why you hadn't found it earlier.\n\nThe action bits - gunfights, mostly - are challenging, but features like the suit's ability to cloak as well as taking cover make them fairly easy to survive. That's not to say they're too easy, but this game is definitely more about story, skill and solving puzzles than shooting. It does fit in nicely, tho.\n\nThe story itself isn't particularly elaborate at first - all you know is you're an AI-enabled combat suit who landed on some strange unknown world in a weird kind of factory used to repair household robots that aren't working "efficiently" anymore - that is to say, they've become self-aware and are no longer safe to work around humans. The security robots and the main (robotic) caretaker of the facility deem she's faulty for reasons I'm not going to elaborate on because that's best explored yourself, forcing her to work together with the self-aware mainframe AI in control of the facility in order to get past the security robots. The ending did surprise me, however, and it's something I truly looked forward to the whole time.\n\nI highly recommend this game. The voice acting is excellent, the graphics are nothing short of beautiful, with the animations fluid and realistic. The gameplay is very pleasing, as is the sound design and the music. And then there's the story that made it hard for me to quit playing. And for the first part of a trilogy, I was pretty happy with the ending. It didn't feel like it was only the first part, and that's always a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\nGet it, play it, enjoy it. If you're into Sci-Fi, adventure-like puzzles and have a couple of hours to spare, give it a go. You won't be disappointed.","September 25, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Only problem is that it's too short. The only thing that makes it long, are the periods where you get stumped. Someone who knows the solutions to every puzzle could plow through it in around 20 minutes.\n\nIt's a bit like a point and click adventure game, but a little better at being able to brute force your way to a solution when you are stuck (if you're paying enough attention, you can try everything you have on every noteworthy area of the room). The controls can be a bit dodgy, but have good ideas in them. I love that you have to choose whether to have your laser sight or your flashlight at any given time - you cannot be both a warrior and an explorer simultaneously.\n\nIt's not too twitchy, although there's definitely combat. Anyone can get through the fighting with a bit of practice, and a careful eye on their stats. This is a boon for the kind of game that The Fall is - primarily a medium for its puzzles and story.\n\nThe twist at the end is a bit predictable, I'd figured it out early on. But I would tend to get invested in the urgency of the moment, and forget my suspicions for awhile, only reconsidering my actions later on. In particular, the mass stasis chamber - the implications of that decision only really hit home when you think about it in the context of the big reveal. That's about as much I can say about THAT without completely giving everything away.\n\nI am really eager for a sequel or continuation or something... I did not expect the game to end where it did, and I can't wait to see what happens next. There's so much more to the Domesticon mythology that is only hinted at, and does not get resolution or closure. I know the devs are planning to provide more, but I don't know when, or what form it will take - even DLC is possible.","October 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There was only one puzzle that I didn't think gave enough information (finding the board) and one that required too much pixel hunting (the re-introduction of a jar), but otherwise with some exploration and time to think you can solve everything.\n\nThis is part 1 of The Fall and while it ends with a to be continued, it feels mostly self contained. You definitely have strong desire to continue the story, but I was satisfied.\n\nWhile I have minor complaints with the puzzles, the real disappointment is the controls. Playing with a gamepad, you use the RS to aim at a point of interest, then hold RB to interact, then use RS to select your interaction mode. The problem is that you have to hold all three of these at once. You release RB to select your interaction. Playing with the mouse has the concession of "Toggle Aim", but it's non-functional with the gamepad. Since you spend a lot of the game looking around you as you walk through the game and there is little benefit to unaimed mode, being able to aim once and release the stick but continue aiming in the same direction would be a blessing to my tired hands. Additionally, the face buttons are generally unused and (I think) X and B could have been reserved for the two main types of interactions.\n\nAnother negative is the camera. It's great that the camera always shows a lot of space in front of the player. However, it adjusts very quickly when you switch facing directions. I often tried to change facing directions quickly and some players may get motion sickness from the rapid movement.\n\nThe narrative was strong enough to keep me playing despite my frustrations. I still wholly recommend it and hope the developer improves the controls and camera in future iterations. Took me about 4 hours to complete playing with a gamepad.","August 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was lured in to try this game due to its very nice and atmospheric visual style and the premise. However, the nature of its puzzles is way too ambiguous and makes no logical sense whatsoever. You end up resorting to walking around the area and trying to interact with everything to see if it works, and when you've had enough of that, you start digging through the walkthroughs. The progression of most things you do doesn't make sense. For example, I was told I had to do a series of tests. However, my character was unable to accept it until I walked into a nearby room and looked at a human corpse. No idea why it wasn't possible to just accept the test without having to do something as pointless and obscure as that.\n\nThere are some gun fights present too, which I enjoyed. The cover system is cool and some special abilities, like the cloak, is pretty neat too.

Maybe it was my own trancendence into modernity, but I can't help but feel that this method no longer makes for an interesting form of gameplay. Coming from a long time veteran of older titles including "Myst" and "Riven", there's a way to intuitively help the player figure things out, and then there's how "The Fall" handles them. Solutions are very unclear and not always intuitive- there's also massive amount of backtracking that occurs when you inevitably get stuck on a single decision point that hampers the rest of your experience with the game. What really sucks, though, is the fact the story is truly engaging, but is locked behind the gate of puzzles that take too long to solve for little payoff.\n\nI really sat on the fence on this one because of the story, but I honestly would probably recommend a lets-play video, because the story is all I cared for out of the whole experience.","February 21","false","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much but it delivers on it's promises.\n\nYou play ARID, an on-board AI for a soldier's fancy sci-fi fightin' onesie. A Cortana to a Master Chief, only this time your MC has the good grace to be unconscious. Your mission, and as an AI your entire reason to exist, is to get him medical attention. Cue puzzle-solving hijinks, solid if unflashy shoot-outs and AIs grumbling about protocols.\n\nDo yourself a favour and play it on a pad. Mouse and keyboard support is present and does the job, but it doesn't seem to be how the game was initially conceived.

The aesthetic of the game is wonderful as well. It is dark and forboding and mysterious. The characters are unique and intresting and I look forward to finding out more. However that leads into my dislikes.\n\nWhat I dislike: It is very short and only the first game of a trilogy. That is not a bad thing as I do look forward to more of the story but it is really short and for the price point $10 or even $5 I got it on sale is too much for how short it is. If I had bought it for $10 I would be quite mad. In this day and age where I can purchase Rogue Legacy for $10 and spend 50+ hours on it or The Fall for 3 hours. Another thing I disliked was the constant backtracking through the levels. Ever part of the game has to be revisited at least once and the FORCE you to do it as some objects are only pick-upable after progressing in the story. It feels like they didn't want to make more levels so they just reused everything they made. It is a small team so I understand but it is still quite frustrating.\n\nUltimately I have to say NOT to buy this game. The mechanics are okay but clunky and the constant repetative of a already short game leads me to believe that this was not a good purchase. Even though I am invested in the story and look forward to the sequal. I hope that it does not come out for $10 also.","July 31, 2014","false","5.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiggBenn56/recommended/290770/","BiggBenn56","BiggBenn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiggBenn56/","391 products in account","This game tells the extremely interesting story of a Artificial Intelligence trying to fulfill its directives.\n\nGraphics\nThe very detailed 2D environment surprised me, since I had only heard of this game prior to buying it, and as 2D indie games go, I expected bland and low fidelity visuals. Instead, I got a mostly dark atmosphere, which only gets disrupted by bright and colorful accents, like glowing mushrooms. This does not devalue the colors, but rather, through rarity, makes them all the more special.\nIf the game were to even try and mimic human motion in perfection (which it is not), then it would have failed in the animations department. But since the protagonist is an AI called ARID, the slightly wooden animations fit like a key in a lock. A key that was made for said lock, that is.\n\nSound\nThe already mentioned dark atmosphere gets complimented by the sounds and music, which are very subtle most of the time. Walking down an empty corridor with that background noise would be very unnerving to me.\nVoice acting is impeccable, and it is a joy listening to the robotic voices of AIs.\n\nStory\nI wish I could tell you all of it, but I do  NOT want to ruin the game for you. The Story makes me shiver with anticipation of the next parts. You, the player, will enjoy the dilemma between following rules and  following rules .\n\nGameplay\n"The Fall" does a lot new to the table, but both the new and the old are executed neatly. Most of the game is a side scroller adventure game, with puzzles to solve that do take either some intelligence or trial and error. You look around by illuminating your surroundings with a torch attached to a gun, which brings us to the slightly clunkier mechanic: Shooting in the same 2D side scroller environment. Firing your weapon works fine, but the cover system is a bit confusing. At the beginning of the game it is not 100% clear behind what objects you can take cover, but it is pretty easy to figure out. Finding the exact right spot to press the "take cover" button, whatever that may be with you, is a lot more difficult. It happened to me more than once, that I wanted to hide behind cover, just to be slightly off and just start leaning against a wall. The final part of the gameplay is the Dialogue box, where you can choose different questions to ask, or different "buttons" to press. Worked perfectly, which is to be expected of a story driven game.\n\n\nConclusively, I would recommend you buy this game, if you love thinking about the morality of artificial Intelligence or love relatively short ( I played 3.2 hours, but I am quite daft from time to time) and relatively easy ( I got stuck once, and I got a hint: Take a look at the ceiling if you don't know what to do) adventure games, or just love compelling stories.\n\nADDITION\nSome people in the comments/recommendations complain that this game is part of a trilogy. That is literally the first sentence of the Description. "Experience the first story in a mind bending trilogy! " is rather unambigious in my mind. This game, right now is only part 1. Others are complaining that this is *obviously* a moneygrab by the devs, but they only raised enough money for part 1 over kickstarter, and are as far as I know currently working on part 2, which they said will be done in about april, but that is just an estimate.","January 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Even still, I beat this game in 113 minutes.\n\nReworking the numbers, it's possible to beat this game in about thirty minutes if you know all the answers to the puzzles.\n\n"Holy empty combat suits, batman! This game's scamming me out of my money!" You might be saying.\n\nThis isn't true. This game is amazing, espescially for an indie game. Voice acting is AAA (even for the Robots), graphics are fun to look at, and the lighting is even fun to play around with, though it is not really a mechanic in the game. (IE, I like shooting my sidearm so I can see the room around me illuminated by the muzzleflare).\n\nNot only that, but this game poses some interesting theological/philosophical questions.\n\nIf an Artificial Intelligence is programmed with every human emotion and ability, including lying and desire, does that make it equivilent to  a human being? Or are they empty inside, lacking the one vital piece that they will never be able to attain, a piece that stretches beyond the material world: the soul?\n\nThe combat is also interesting, kind of blocky and fidgety, but nonetheless interesting.\n\nSo, I would, in fact, recommend this game. For 4.99. That's a lot, considering it can be beaten in thirty minutes if you have an intellect on par with Sir Francis Bacon (Inventor of the scientific method, not the internent meme).\n\nI would also recommend this game for 9.99, but only if it is episodic, and the developers promise much more content and story IN THE SAME GAME.\n\nAs in, in the same game that I payed 4.99 for, in the same spot on my steam library list. If they're going to make a sequel of the same length, yet make you pay 9.99 once more for it, then I will probably go back on my word about the recommendation thing.","July 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Exposition is minimal, leaving the player to puzzle out for themselves what the real plot might be. Even with only a few interactions between them, each of the three main characters has their own clearly distinct personality, and the differences between them and their attitudes towards what it means to be an AI are interesting to watch.\n\n(Very) minor niggles with movement and controlling the protagonist's gun aside, definitely worth picking up if you're at all interested in a sci-fi adventure game with some strong horror elements.\nEagerly looking forwards to the next instalment.","June 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Likewise, having 'highlight' points helps you figure out what you can interact with and what is scenery. I did get stuck a few times because the 'highlight' points were high on the ceiling of the area.\n\nThe combat is straight forward, forgiving, and you learn fairly quickly.

If you are confused, please search online for more information regarding the Metroid games.\n\nWhen a human is incapacitated for any reason in an A.R.I.D. Mark VII Battlesuit, the onboard A.I. takes control of motor functions and seeks medical attention for its wounded pilot. In The Fall, the A.I. onboard a battlesuit, nicknamed Arid, has just crash-landed on a planet. Her pilot is seriously injured and unconscious, so the A.I. takes full control of the suit she resides in and starts to explore…\n\nSound familiar? For Metroid gamers, this is a twist on the classic “start on an alien planet with no upgrades as Samus.” The backstory behind the lack of equipment in this game is that you have it equipped but are simply not authorized to use it (like in Metroid: Other M). Unlike the lame excuse presented in Other M, though, The Fall’s explanation actually makes sense; an A.I. is prevented from using certain functions without a human’s permission except in dire circumstances. More on that last part later.\n\nThe atmosphere in The Fall is incredible - dark, mysterious and foreboding. Similar to Metroid Prime, there are points located above objects of interest scattered throughout the 2D world. You start with a weapon that has two modes: laser sight (for firing; disabled initially) and a flashlight for finding info points. Another note: each point of info has a few interaction options, such as picking up a tire iron or activating an elevator. The items are kept until needed at another info point. You acquire access to more suit functions  and circumvent the need for human approval in certain situations where the pilot’s life is in imminent danger.\n\nI didn’t think too much of this game from the store page, but I absolutely love the Metroid games and so I thought I’d give it a go. For under $10, this game is very satisfying: the puzzles and endless backtracking really makes you think to progress. The fascinating dialogue (sometimes monologue) explores the nature of artificial intelligence and its bounds in way that only an android could. The game itself is pretty short, however. Four hours for my initial playthrough with no guides, one hour for my second playthrough.\n\nSome of the mechanics could use a little work. The switching between combat and discovery (flashlight) mode is uncomfortable at times, and finding just the right angle to activate an elevator while standing directly adjacent to it is maddening. You cannot change direction in mid-air. Aiming with the laser sight can be a bit strange at times, trying to compensate for distance to target. All that said, I still give a enthusiastic recommendation to this game.\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\nRecommended\n- Highly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential\n\nP.S. The Fall 2 is announced and in development.\n\nP.P.S. I have never played any of the Castlevania games. I am guessing that Castlevania players will like this, but am not sure. I do know almost for certain, however, that Metroid enthusiasts will enjoy this.","June 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Here is why:\n\nThis game is very well designed in my opinion. It accomplishes everything it tries to. Some indiegames try to accomplish too much and fail but this one does not. Seems like the developers of The Fall knew what they want and what to focus on for their game. The Fall tells you a (in my opinion) very interesting sci-fi story and combines it with puzzle solving and some action.\n\nThe graphics are good, not like AAA title graphics of course, but good for a game like this nevertheless. Sound, voice actors and animations are great.\n\nAs for the story (no spoilers here): If you like stories about evolving A.I. and like movies like The Machine, you'll probably enjoy The Fall as well. The only real downside of this game for me is that it is quite short. I'd love to go on and on and on and see, hear and learn more about the story. Nevertheless it was worth the money in my opinion, and I probably play it again to experience the story another time and get all the achievements.\n\nI really hope for a sequel to this game.","June 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/290770/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","The Fall is a 2D side-scrolling action adventure game in which you play as A.R.I.D., the artificial intelligence on-board a high-tech combat suit. After crashing on an unknown planet, A.R.I.D.’s program activates in order to save the unconscious human pilot within the suit. After a short traversal through a cave, players will find themselves in a facility owned by Domesticon, a corporation that designs and manufactures robots for domestic use. However, it is clear from the start that something went horribly wrong here as the human employees are nowhere to be found. The only sentient entity is the mainframe AI who has apparently heavily modified its personality subroutines during the long years of solitude. Also, there’s the malevolent robot known as the Caretaker watching A.R.I.D.’s every step with unclear motives.\n\nThe game starts off rather slow, but towards the end it builds up into a pretty interesting tale about artificial intelligences adapting, overcoming or bending their programming in order to complete their goals. The characters and the storytelling are thoroughly convincing thanks to some very solid writing and voice acting. It should be noted that the game ends with some remaining questions as this is only the first part of an intended trilogy. However, it still offers a satisfying resolution pertaining to this part of the story.\n\nThe Fall’s gameplay mostly revolves around exploration and puzzle solving. You will need to carefully explore the environment, pick up items of note and solve puzzles in order to proceed. Certain puzzles will have you stumped as they are a bit abstract, but most are logical. Also, all of the puzzles are woven into the story itself, there’s context behind every puzzle design. You’ll never feel like you’re solving a puzzle just for the hell of it. Outside of exploration and puzzle solving, there’s the combat. There’s not much of it here and perhaps that’s for the better as it really isn’t particularly engaging. You’ll fight against two types of robots. One type will take cover and you’ll pop a round into their head as they make themselves vulnerable and the other will just charge at you. To avoid enemy fire, you can either take cover or you can use A.R.I.D.’s camouflage protocol rendering you invisible.\n\nThe game features a very nice minimalistic dark art style clearly influenced by last year’s superb puzzler The Swapper. Combined with some good sound effects and soundtrack, The Fall manages to create a thick atmosphere. The biggest drawback of the game are the controls and the camera. You’ll get used to them after a while, but they always feel a bit cumbersome and awkward. This is especially noteworthy when aiming as the game for some reason doesn’t display the mouse cursor so it often aims in the wrong direction and the camera shifts focus to the wrong side.\n\nDespite it being a bit rough around the edges and in need of some more polish and fine-tuning, The Fall succeeds primarily due to its compelling storytelling and mostly solid puzzle design. If you’re looking for a dark science fiction story wrapped in a sound action adventure design structure, you really can’t go wrong with The Fall.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)","September 21, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game left me gobsmacked, what an amazing game. This is basically like watching an amazing sci-fi film or if Dead Space was a film and it wasn’t Americanised (over the top violence and pointless killing of seemingly infinite enemies) then this would be it.\n\nFirstly, to the people complaining cause it’s not a full game and it stops, then clearly you guys shouldn’t buy a decent game like this as you clearly don’t have the logic to read. The game clearly states (in about game) that it’s the FIRST part as quoted: “Experience the first story in a mind bending trilogy!” Clearly also meaning there will be 2 more parts to the game. If that wasn’t enough for you, you can also be cleaver and check out the achievements as the last achievement is called Fallen: Complete Episode 1. If that was still not enough you can check out this comment or any other, it really isn’t that hard!\n\nFurthermore, the game; is pure excellence. Perfect and easy to understand controls, amazing graphics for the game and last but definitely not least, flipping fantastic hair standing story!! The story is the core (and what makes everyone mad I guess) as it’s so good yet alas doesn’t finish as there is a massive cliff-hanger. I literally knew it was coming yet I started screaming and had to get up from my chair because it was so…I’m still speechless sorry.\n\nDefinitely worth every penny!!

But......\n\nThe bad: This game just isn't fun. Remember point and click adventure games when you'd try to use every item in your inventory on every object in the game because the solutions were really bizarre? The Fall has that, but it is much worse. The game is designed for a controller and you need to aim the flashlight from your gun on objects to interact with them. Unfortunately, this means you will miss items unless you look everywhere, and everywhere twice. The art design is mostly in the dark, so if an item is dropped or changes, you might miss it. I shouldn't have to look up a walkthrough to figure out where I'm supposed to find the pixel to rub on another pixel. The combat is garbage. There's only two types of enemies: Ones who charge and ones who sit behind cover and shoot at you.

No, it is not perfect, but it is good value and one of the better game experiences I have enjoyed lately. One thing I would say, this is an adventure game masquerading as a platform game. The majority of the gameplay comes from finding items and using them. The graphics and story are superb, but the other aspects of the game let it down somewhat. It is short, but at the same time I enjoyed every second and was happy with it - I've pumped many hours into far less satisfying experiences that have lasted much longer; quality over quantity I say.\n\nThe combat is boring. It boils down to going in and out of camoflauge (which can be done anywhere, making the terrain cover system a hinderance as camoflauge is simpler to use) and waiting for the robots to stop shooting before shooting their heads off. They don't move or vary their attacks or ever threaten you from multiple sides or tricky angles. It is almost without skill, never difficult, and even if you do die the last checkpoint is always a few seconds before.\n\nThere's actually very few ways to die beyond the security robots, which I think detracts from the game. ARID stops you going into dangerous places when surprise deaths would be a better way to startle the player.\n\nAbout that platform game thing; there's no sections with urgency or where timing/skill is particularly important - think the flooding scene in Another World or some of the Shadow of the Beast sequences. So whilst the atmosphere of the game harks back to those classics, in terms of gameplay it ends up falling short.\n\nStoryline is where the game excels. The graphics and sound are superb producing a believable environment and great atmosphere, there's never any boring point in The Fall. If there was a criticism about the gameworld, I'd say that sometimes the design is a bit... iffy. You end up running back and forth quite long distances and some of the things you need to do are a bit obscure (hint: ceilings!) so you end up running around searching everywhere and trying all the items in your inventory at each point - a bit like a classic adventure game really.\n\nSo, yeah, if you like adventure games this is definitely for you! If you like platform games, well, this isn't really one - it just looks like one.","August 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I picked it up in a daily sale and would highly recommend it - it's really strong on building its story and mood through exploration and the plot rapidly drew me in. The game is strongest on the artistic side: level backgrounds are simple but beautiful and effectively convey the desolation of its setting, the voice acting is enjoyable and supports the story themes well, and the story itself kept me interested for the duration of play (about 4 hours). I would say that if the game is one thing, it is coherent: Main menu and GUI, the world it builds and the story all mesh together nicely.\n\nThe game's mechanics are a bit more variable in quality. The shooter mechanics are bland 2D-cover based shooting, and I personally found them to be a bit pointless. The puzzles worked reasonably well, and meshed nicely with the exploration aspect of the game which is highly linear but significantly contributes to the game's creepy mood. Unfortunately, the game fails to signpost adequately how far you have to travel to acquire the items you need to solve the puzzles, notably in the game's middle section you have to travel through large areas that are "shut down" and point out to you that you should not go there yet, but to progress you must travel through them. In fact, at several points characters specifically tell you that you are in the wrong place and not completing your tasks in the right order... which may be very clever meta-game commentary given the nature of the story, but if so, I missed it.\n\nI won't comment on the story itself, mostly because I am an idiot and will inevitably spoil something, and I think the game is best approached blindly.","July 30, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a nice bit of backstory if you find enough reading bits, and there are a couple of moments where you have to make a couple of choices (obvious and not) that I'm hoping will matter in the next episode. The combat was admittedly fairly basic, but it had enough variety to not get tedious, especially with the boss of this first episode. It does look like it'll be an episodic game, but maybe I missed that in the store page. In any event, I am very much looking forward to part 2.","June 20, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Fall is immersive from the start, and, unless you get stuck on some of the puzzles, maintains the immersion the whole way through. With a driving mysterious plot, some insanely dark and awesome characters, and easily navigated controls, The Fall is one of the better games offered in the Steam Sale so far.\n\nYou play the AI Co-Pilot of a combat mech suit, and your human pilot has suffered injuries.

For once, you're not playing the badass who guns his way through a horde of enemies, you're playing the suit that has to save his sorry ♥♥♥ when he's taken too much damage.  The characters- despite being robots- are all fascinating, with personalities more fleshed out than many human characters in gaming.  The voice acting is top notch.  The actions that you perform in puzzles actually tie in nicely with the overall theme of story, which is to push the boundaries of your protocol as an A.I.  The atmosphere is beautiful and foreboding, which adds to the sense of urgency to protect A.R.I.D's pilot and find him medical treatment as soon as possible.  As some one who values great stories, an immersive atmosphere, and excellent dialogue, I could not recommend this game more.\n\nHowever... the game mechanics could use some work.  The controls are not intuitive, and the main character is difficult to maneuver at times.  For example, I chose to toggle my weapon, and A.R.I.D. kept putting away her gun every time she jumped.  This made one particular battle towards the end incredibly frustrating, since I would jump to avoid attacks, and then have to pull out my gun again before trying to get in a few shots while the enemy was vulnerable.  Performing actions on objects requires holding down shift and then choosing from a list of options; it would have been much easier to just be able to shine the flashlight onto an object and have the options automatically show up underneath.  In a four hour game, I really don't want to spend half my time getting use to controls. I want to be able to pick up the game mechanics very quickly and spend the rest of my time immersed in a complex, clever, and compelling story.\n\nI never write reviews, but "The Fall" is such a good game, and it deserves a lot more attention than it's received so far.  I cannot wait to play the next episode and follow A.R.I.D. in her rebellion against protocol.","July 4, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Fall is about a robot suit that crashes into a decaying robot decommissioning plant. The suit is controlled by an AI (the player character) whose primary directive is to keep the unconscious pilot safe. However, the suit won't give the AI free reign until it encounters situations that put the pilot at risk. The gameplay is a mix of puzzle solving and some light action. The puzzle solving comes from trying to get into situations in which the suit is threatened in a way that unlocks a new ability, such as getting shot at so that you can unlock the cloak and sneak past. It's often pretty clever.\n\nBut it didn't win the best story award for having interesting puzzles. The writing in The Fall is pretty fantastic. I won't discuss it in detail, but you will quickly learn that you're not alone in the derelict facility. It's an episodic game, and this is just the first episode.

This dosn't meen that I accuse them of being biased, though, because I share their opinion.\n\nThe Fall is a surprising hit, the atmosphere, a combining of The Swapper, Dead Space and a bit of The Cat Lady, is gritty, dark and super tense. Furthermore, the protagonist is a real blast. I am fond of nearly all AI in video games - GlaDOS and ED-E are among my most beloved characters of all time - and A.R.I.D is by far the best carved out AI I ever saw in  a video game. Or a movie. Yes, better than GlaDOS and HAL. Her developing is great, her actions are exactly how I would think a programmed AI should react, and her voice is lovable.\nNot to mention the story. Every word said would be a blasphemous spoiler, but let me say that I was really amazed at the end and I will gladly await the next episodes. Yes, I should explicitely stress that this is an episodic game, with only the first part being out now. I just hope the rest won't take long.\n\nOne negative point at the end, though: The fighting is really frustrating sometimes. The mouse controls are certainly not the best, and since enemies will only take real damage when shooting their head, it can kill you a few times to try and aim correctly with your gun flinging wildly over the screen.

What I did not expect was a series of well thought out and well constructed puzzles with a great sci-fi story and honestly brilliant characters. I love it. The puzzles are fairly complex around the midpoint, but they can be solved with a little bit of lateral thinking. There's a nice bit of backstory if you find enough reading bits, and there are a couple of moments where you have to make a couple of choices (obvious and not) that I'm hoping will matter in the next episode. The combat was admittedly fairly basic, but it had enough variety to not get tedious, especially with the boss of this first episode. It does look like it'll be an episodic game, but maybe I missed that in the store page.

I have never played a puzzler like this before. It's a short game, and for it's length, full price is a bit much in my opinion. But honestly this game blew me away. It was unique, and had me thinking out of the box. Whenever I got stuck on certain obstacles I would realize that I kept searching for something specific. Once I let go of that idea and stopped, I started solving the puzzles faster because this game requires you to solve the problems in an unorthodox way. The story was unexpected and an unimportant side info (not critical story details) isn't directly told to you, but discovered on your own which I like more because it gets me more engaged in the game.\n\nFor a emotionless AI, I became attached to A.R.I.D's character. Her humor is dry, and unintentional, and I really enjoyed her character development throughtout the story.

Support the developers! Because I want a sequel!\n\nOk ok ok, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me explain why you need to buy this game.\nPros: STORY!!! This is what makes the game stand out. It has an incredibly good story with great, interesting characters. This is what makes it worth playing. Since it's a game and not a movie/comic/whatever YOU are the one making choices, and that is what makes stories in games so immersive.\nand for the record: the graphics, music and atmosphere are great and really fitting to the theme. The voice-acting is superb and the dialogue is well-written.\nDid I mention that the story is great?\n\nOK, fine. Here are some cons, but they are insignificant next to the amazing story.\nCons: Combat feels a little awkward. It's basically the same combat as Blizzard's Blackthorne from way back in the day. Sure, it feels kinda strategic but it also feels kinda dated to me. And towards the end i felt the cover system bugging.\nThe UI in's great. it took me a while to figure out how to interact with things and even then the interaction menu felt awkward.\nlinear story. You cant alter it, as far as I know. The developers want to convey their story and they're not letting stupid players like us mess with it.\nMinor bugs and glitches. like the tutorial texts overlapping in the corner. I was unable to exit the options menu after editing key bindings. And melee killing an enemy behind cover several feet away.\n\nMINOR SPOILER: There is a scene where it makes you think you have a choice, for emotional reasons, but you don't. Not as a player. The story demands that you do this, and it does fit your character that you do it, and your character DOES/WOULD make the choice, but it feels more emotional that you have to do it and not just watch a cutscene. So it's most definitely on purpose. I am unsure if this is actually a con or just brilliant writing.\n\nSo in conclusion: BUY THIS GAME!!!","December 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Fall by recent indie developer Over The Moon via Kickstarter is one of the more entertaining treatments that I've come across, & it also blends genres like only indie titles can.\n\nThe game is part point & click adventure puzzler, part side scrolling action.  I like how story and gameplay inform each other.  I like the considerations that the devs present concerning how an AI might behave if it detected inconsistencies or imperfections in programming/protocols.\n\nThe puzzles are manageable with thorough searching and a bit of thought.  Only in a couple of instances was I stumped for a while.  The exploration, item interaction, combat & cover worked well enough & were free of hassle.  Visuals & audio were acceptable for a low budget indie.  I have mixed feelings the AI voice acting, but overall it's well done.\n\nThe game really is brief, only four to five hours for a playthrough.  Very much looking forward to the sequel.

Then this might be the game for you\n\nStep into the role of ARID, an AI controlled combat suit who will do anything to save her pilot from impending doom whilst traversing the hellscape of an abandoned robotics factory. She finds friends and foe upon her journey to salvation, a journey that will make her question every rule governing her existence as a machine.\n\nARID is a pretty awesome character, she grows throughout the whole game from being so subservient in the beginning to questioning her reality and how she has to break the rules to save her pilot. For a machine she is very complex and I felt compelled to see how this story ends. The few other characters you meet are very interesting in their own right; I get a real feeling that each has their own story that would be equally interesting to see how they got to where they are today.\n\nThe world in which the game is set, although not large by any stretch of the imagination, is full of things that are interesting and show depth not explored in the game. Finding a few notes here and there giving you details but not the whole picture as to what happened in this place and how it became so decayed and forgotten. It had a decrepit beauty to it that I enjoyed to no end. The story appears simple from the outside but is, I suspect, a metaphor for something much deeper. I had a great time from start to end.\n\nThe game plays well for a platformer, the gun controls are clunky and the menu selections aren’t the best. But neither hampers the enjoyment and both add to the charm of this indie gem. The game is full of puzzles and challenges, none of which were too difficult to overcome and gave a great sense of accomplishment when you figured out how to beat them. The sound is great too, the voices are fantastic and really add to the characters, the music is ominous and foreboding and the ambient noises brought some life to the dead world.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish, so much so that I have played it through twice now and still had a blast. If this is on sale it is a must buy, at full price you would still get a lot of enjoyment out of it but with the short length you might want to wait. So everyone out there help ARID out and play this game.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","November 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To put it frankly and concisely, the controls/interface are not user friendly AT ALL. You will struggle against them for the entire game.\n\nHowever, if you begrudgingly accept the controls/interface for what they are, you will be blessed with a wonderful adventure game in the most classic sense of the word (including the part where you wander around for 45 minutes using the fork on the light switch for the seventh time because you don't know what to do next, and I mean that in the best way).\n\nAlso the game has a really great story. The basic premise is that a futuristic combat suit equipped with an AI has essentially gone into emergency auto-pilot in order to help the dying person within the suit. (Yes, you read that right. In this story, you play the role of sentient clothing!) What follows is yet another tale that closely examines the point at which intelligence ceases to be artificial intelligence and becomes just regular intelligence.\n\nOH WAIT.

The camera stretches ahead of the player to show them what's coming, but sometimes feels a bit wonky when changing directions rapidly. The action doesn't require this though, so it doesn't impede gameplay. Players use their flashlight to highlight items of interest, and then can hold left shift to select actions or inventory items to interact. This feels natural after a short time and fits the adventure genre perfectly.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and some took time to figure out. The player has to keep a constant lookout for objects of interest.\n\nThe game has combat. The cover system feels a little loose. The command to enter cover has a sweet spot close behind the object. This created moments where I felt I was battling positioning my character more than the opposition. Enemies hang out of cover a little too long, making gun battles a little too easy.\n\nConclusion: Despite minor issues, I had a great time with The Fall.

In so doing, you must escape a facility that tests defective AIs, destroying or repurposing them as needed.\n\nMost of the game is solving puzzles, and while some of these are interesting, many suffer from the same bizarre logic that plagued the adventure game genre (which is part of the reason that that genre is no longer popular). There's nothing as bad as the infamous kill-the-yeti-with-a-cream-pie puzzle from King's Quest V, but there's a couple that come close. Even worse, in a way, is that you'll sometimes know exactly how to solve the puzzle, but you didn't try to solve it in exactly the way the game wanted. Also, it is incredibly easy to miss items critical to progression, as they are sometimes very small and the game is extremely dark.\n\nThe combat is no great shakes either. Most enemies will hide behind cover and shoot at you at regular intervals. You can hide behind cover yourself, or later, you can get a cloaking ability. (However, since the button you use for the cloak is the same as for using cover, you will sometimes do one when you meant to do the other.) The enemies will always keep their heads out for a good amount of time after shooting, which is good, because aiming isn't great. Shooting enemies will never try to flush you out of cover, so all you have to do is wait for your shield to regenerate before shooting at them. There are kamikaze robots who run up and apparently fry your systems if they hit you - which is frustrating because it's an automatic death - but you can usually kill them easily by shooting while backing up. There's no nuance to the combat and there would be no challenge at all to it, were it not for how easily you take damage. You also have a stealth kill, but it's almost useless, as it takes long enough that any enemy nearby will see you before you're finished, and there are always at least two enemies together at any time.\n\nThe game is also plagued by a ton of bugs. Sometimes A.R.I.D.'s aim will get stuck for no apparent reason (although going to the menu seems to fix this). Other times your "Interact" button will suddenly stop working. Once, I moved forward but the screen didn't scroll with me, so I was over in the next area while I continued to see the area before. (I think what happened is that I jumped over a marker that tells the game to scroll the screen when you walk over it.) Once I found an enemy just crouch-walking in place. Most of these are just annoying, but twice A.R.I.D. stopped moving and the only thing I could do was press Start, which would cause the words "Running Menu.Exe" to appear on the screen, but nothing would actually happen. Both times, I had to manually shut the game down, and lost progress in the process.\n\nStory-wise, the game is fine, although I think it would've been more interesting if there weren't a direct antagonist. There are some fun interactions, and the twist at the end was actually not what I was expecting (although it also makes the method by which you gain abilities throughout the game make no sense). However, the fact that the game simply stops with a "To Be Continued" marker at the end is rather galling. The only indication anywhere that this is merely the first episode of a series is in the Achievements screen. If I had known ahead of time that the story was just going to stop partway through, I might not have bought the game at all.","August 1, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's with games like these that I wish steam went beyond a yes/no (which can be interpreted as good/bad) system, but oh well.\n\nI really like The Fall--but not so much as a game. It ticks some boxes; the art design is great, the acting is REALLY good (better than almost any other game good), and the writing works with the acting well, but as a __game__....it's hit or miss.  The puzzles are pretty confusing, and it's extremely short for what you're paying. I got this on sale, but I couldn't in good conscience recommend this game at full price. I'm really excited to see what the team works up for the sequel, and to see where the world is going to go, because the world and story is really good.\n\nSo this isn't a "negative recommendation" as it a warning that you need to make sure you're happy with the product before you buy it. It's not a side scroller action game, it's a (fairly frustrating) point-and-click adventure game with a great atmosphere and story.","January 7","false","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was expecting so much more... something akin to Shadowrun meets an old Lucasarts adventure. Sadly, it's not close to either. Its' not exactly bad, it's just not as good as the hype by a long shot.\n\nAs a point and click adventure goes, it's messy. Many of the puzzles are akin to doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are the same colour... except someone put all the jigsaw pieces in different rooms of your house to make you run backwards and forwards to annoy you. If you take out all the wandering around the actual game time is proably not much more than a 1-2 hours.\n\nThe combat is purely textural. It's not challenging whatsover. The character animation is very basic (eg; you jump in the air but as your character lands it crudely cuts to a different standing postiton). Anything worth of a 'game of the year' review surely desrves attention to detail with the basics.\n\nAs for the story, fairly well written but unfinished as yet given it's a trilogy. If the other two parts were just updates to this game I'd maybe tempted to give this a positive review, but as it stands this just feels like an unfinished untuned game with far too many rough edges.\n\n5.5/10","April 26, 2015","false","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Their dialogue throughout the game kept me invested and became the only reason I played through to the end.\n\nThe Bad:\n- As stated, the interactions between ARID and the System Administrator were the best parts of the game. However, the resolution to their story came too abruptly. This gripe was not helped by the unsatisfying conclusion to the game.\n\n- The combat segments did not add anything to the game. In fact, these parts felt like they were just there to extend the length of the game.\n\n- Some of the character animations are really rough. For example, when the main character jumps the transition from the jump position to the standing position is jarring. Moreover, the sluggish controls further expose the rough animations.\n\n- I experienced some bugs during my playthrough which forced me to close out the game and restart.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThere are some great aspects to this game, but it’s marred by elements which provide no value to the gameplay or story. As a result, I can’t recommend this game. Perhaps, when the story arch is complete it might be worth playing through, but in its current state it’s not worth it. As an aside, the name of this game is too generic and it’s difficult to look up information regarding the second game because of it.

Some might find this annoying, I didn't mind the mechanic personally, and once I got used to the awkward controls I found myself very immersed in the gameplay.\n\nCombat is fairly simple, take cover (or cloak) until enemies pause between firing at you, then lean out (or uncloak) and try to pop them in the head for maximum damage. You can also perform stealth takedowns, though they require little effort, and tougher enemies are introduced as you progress, which adds just enough to keep combat from feeling like work but doesn't add enough to consider the combat deep or particularly interesting. Luckily, as I already mentioned, the combat is occassional in this game, so it never really has enough time to make you feel bored or annoyed by it.\n\nThe Fall is a small game, and by small I mean there are only a handful of areas in the game that you'll explore and none of them could be considered large. HOWEVER, the nature of the game will have you spending a lot of time in each of these areas rather than just moving through them once or twice. Progression will require you to seek out and find items that you can utilize to solve problems, and sometimes an item you find early on won't be needed until late in the game, or an item you find late in the game needs to be used in an earlier area. There's a lot of backtracking, so if that's something you dislike in games, this isn't for you.\n\nThe game world in The Fall is mysterious and interesting. You're kept out of the loop for most of the game, learning bits and pieces about what's going on through conversations or finding messages. The characters are well done and each have a unique personallity from one another. Some of the dialogue and voice acting could've been better in places, but by no means do I consider any of it to be bad. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, and I think a great job was done in putting it all together.\n\nOverall, The Fall is simple in design, but delivers challenging content (I admit I needed to refer to a guide a few times because I was totally stumped). The visuals are creepy, the music is creepy, the characters are creepy, and I loved it. At $9.99 its definitely worth it if you like exploration and problem solving, and if you manage to grab it on sale then its an absolute must play. At around 3-4 hours long, I'm confident you'll be satisfied (and apparently a sequel is in the works, so there will be even more The Fall to come in the future. I look forward to it).","August 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story makes you think that there is something bad going on from the very beginning. And I don't mean the world, I mean you. The humour is very dark and surprising which I enjoyed immensely. Even if there was nothing else to this game, it's worth playing just for the atmosphere.\n\nI would define the game as an action adventure. The action part consists of a few short combat encounters and even less and even shorter platforming sequences. You will deal with your enemies by using a basic shooting mechanics with only one weapon and a cover/"dodge" system. That's all there is to it.\n\nAs for the adventure part, you will be wandering through the game world and trying to find the way to your goal. You will search for information, deal with puzzles, find and use items in weird situations ... I actually had problems with this part, because some of the puzzles didn't make much sense to me. But maybe that's just because I don't have much experience when it comes to adventure games.\n\nIf you don't consider my problem with puzzles as a game issue (which I do) there are only two things left: bugs and unpolished gameplay. Both of these problems can be solved. The controls are unresponsive, sometimes they don't react at all (bug), sometimes the character moves jerkily, or there are problems when you are in cover. It took me a while to get used to it and it's the only thing that somehow worsened my experience with the game. These things can be fixed, and they definitely should be before the release of the other two parts.\n\nSo buy it, play through it and love it!","December 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Você se move/pula como em um jogo tradicional do gênero e interage com o cenário iluminando locais que sejam do seu interesse, podendo olhar, tocar, etc. A trama gira em torno de ARID, uma I.A que é ativada assim que seu hospedeiro estiver em risco de vida e inconsciente.   Tudo começa com uma queda (The Fall) em um planeta desconhecido. ARID é ativada no decorrer disso e, ao perceber que o humano está desacordado além de ferido, tenta encontrar um centro médico.\n\nLogo no iníco, fica evidente a eficiência do enredo. ARID diz que está procurando atendimento médico para salvar a vida de seu hospedeiro, mas suas ações constantemente contradizem isso. Diversas vezes ela bota em risco a vida do humano para sobrepor protocolos, e assim, poder avançar no local em que ela se encontra. Tecnicamente, isso é necessário para alcançar o centro médico, mas a moralidade de suas ações é dubiosa e deixa o jogador se questionando se a I.A está funcionando de forma correta e se realmente está com o bem estar do hospedeiro em mente. Dentro do contexto bizarro e um pouco assustador do jogo, tudo isso fica crível. A ambientação corrobora com isso, com um aspecto desolado. Pequenos montes de robôs que foram descartados estão espalhados pela estação, pessoas crucificadas são encontradas, tudo isso se incrementa a sensação de algo errado estar acontecendo.  Os dialógos são excelentes, escritos com maestria, cada personagem é bem desenvolvido e tem relevância no desenrolar da história, e a qualidade deles é exaltada pelo voice acting.\n\nIsso foi o que mais me surpreendeu, é simplesmente sublime. Cada personagem é representado com maestria. ARID, por exemplo, com sua frieza e determinação de atingir seu objetivo, sem se preocupar com as consequências. Apesar de não ser o destaque, sua atriz fez um ótimo trabalho. E o mesmo pode ser dito para os coadjuvantes. (Um, em especial, foi o destaque do jogo, mas prefiro que joguem e descubram)\n\nOs controles, entretanto, são um pouco falhos. O personagem é um pouco ‘floaty’, o jogo tem combate, que é, basicamente, entrar em cobertura com um botão e esperar os inimigos pararem de atirar, contra-atacando, mas a mira do personagem nem sempre é precisa como o desejado. Isso atrapalha em alguns combates, especialmente na parte final do jogo, e em algumas conquistas (para quem se importa com isso). De qualquer forma, achei essa mecânica uma boa distração dos puzzles, algo que dá uma gratificação imediata.\n\nA estrutura dos puzzles é ótima. Todos eles tem ligação a narrativa do jogo, e não foram pensados apenas como um obstáculo ao jogador. Alguns deles são brutais, com back-tracking, exploração de diversas salas e pensamentos criativos para a solução. Diria até que um deles é obscuro demais, com um back-tracking que, em certo momento, fica chato e obtuso. Soluções lógicas são substituidas por algo mais enigmático a favor de dificultar a vida do jogador, e, talvez, aumentar a longevidade do jogo. Entretanto, senti isso em apenas um deles. Geralmente, necessitam de exploração atenciosa aos arredores e um pensamento "fora da caixa" nas soluções.\n\nThe Fall começou com um primeiro episódio extraordinário, que não recorre a nenhum clichê, contando com um final extremamente satisfatório (o que, sinceramente, é algo incomum para jogos). Infelizmente, ele recebeu pouquíssimo destaque da mídia e uma atenção ainda menor dos jogadores. Recomendo a qualquer um que gosta de adventures e ficção científica.\n","January 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's super-smart, pretty darn challenging (especially if you're utterly useless at "adventure game"-style puzzles like me), and genuinely engaging in its atmosphere and story-telling.  Apart from being challenging, though, some of the puzzles are just flat-out CLEVER.  Why are they clever?  Well, for some time now I've said that my definition of a truly great puzzle is one where you can't work it out for the ♥♥♥♥ing life of you, but the second you look up a walkthrough and see the solution, or merely fluke it through trial-and-error, you slap yourself on the forehead in acknowledgement of how it's been STARING YOU IN THE FACE ALL ALONG.

Write something about this frustratingly awesome title.\n\nFirst the bad news, shooting robots is awesome.... but not in this game. On top of that, the puzzles are ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. I have never "adventure gamed" my way through something so absolutely. However they do fall in line with the story in their aftermath, the execution leaves A LOT to be desired. This might have been much better served as a point and click. Or at least something that interfaced better with the user.\n\nNow the cool stuff. Admittedly, I have a slight affinity for anything reagrding space travel/artificial intelligence/sci-fi in general. The premise of the game is simply awesome. In the real sense of the word awesome. Something that inspires awe. AI's have always had parameters and subjugating certain aspects to bend the rules to acomplish a task within those parameters has long been a trope of a good AI story. That aspect is not missing here. But what I find most interesting is the use of human's within the suits where these AI's live. A sort of Jarvis to Iron Man. Say Iron Man becomes unconscious, Jarvis would then take full control to get medical aid to Tony Stark providing one of the parameters was to protect Tony at all costs. How far will the parameters be bent? When does technically following a rule go to far? Obviously, you'll need to embark into the journey of the fall find out in this specific case.\n\nThe other aspect I found interesting is even though they maintian sentience of being AI, the game seems to elude to there being different levels of consciously being aware of oneself. I suppose one could surmise they were just learning computers with varying perspectives. Or something more.\n\nThe ending is quite satifying, it does elude to this being episode 1, so I guess the future remains to be seen.\n\nAll in all, I played 80% of this with a guide open, this is very much an adventure game with all the wacky use "this" to interact with "that" mechanics you either love or hate. Mechanically I feel the game lacks polish or play testing, not really sure. This is a indie game so some level of forgiveness is in order. Either way, the premise is intriging, the art sytle is really cool, slick character animations when interacting with stuff. Though, I must say, its way too damn dark in that place.\n\nI may go as far as to say "inspired by Isaac Asimov" but I won't commit to that.

With the human operator unresponsive and possibly seriously injured the robot suit's A.I. takes control of all movements attempting to reach the surface where it hopes to find medical aid for the pilot. Along the way the A.I. intentionally puts the pilot at even greater risks to gain access to otherwise unauthorized systems of the suit, fighting off other robots that don't take too kindly to her presence (or, at least your A.I. is voiced pretty greatly by a woman), solving puzzles, discovering a bit about the domestic robot production facility she'll soon stumble into and even more about herself raising philosophical questions for example about humankind, artifical intelligence, obedience and empathy.\n\nThe gameplay can be a bit tedious. What may look like an action platformer at first sight is for most parts actually a sidescrolling, puzzle-solving adventure game. There is combat, but it feels tacked on and as similarily stiff as it did to me in "Gemini Rue". The game could easily live without it, though a gun with an attached flashlight that is aimed down in the eerie dark to examine things probably begs to be fired.\n\nThe middle part where you are supposed to do what felt like petty errands in order to "graduate" as a "domestic robot" in that abandoned facility didn't feel as enjoyable, though I suppose oldschool adventure fans will love the dozen item-world-interactions and backtracking you'll have to do (I did look up a walkthrough because I got stuck several times and wanted to speed it up). Story-wise I guess these parts fit, but the general philosophical message that comes with them probably could have been expressed just as well without dragging on for as long.\nBut perhaps I'm biased. I almost naturally prefer less puzzling/adventuring and more of an interactive/cinematic experience when it comes to games that are as immersive as this one as I like to stay "in flow". Here you'll inevitably stumble a bit unless you are a puzzling pro or have a walkthrough/a Steam guide at your side. I don't remember the puzzles as being illogical but things are rarely plain obvious either. No handholding here, Telltale friends.\n\nIt's a genuinely interesting title that feels somewhat bold and ambitious, but I'm not entirely sure if it wants to or should be a puzzle-solving adventure game or a more direct/cinematic action title.","April 22, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

What? I can't collect blood in a pan until a dialog trigger? I haven't had to put up with that since I played “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream”. Yes, that's the sound of 1995 calling. They want their linear plot mechanics back.\n\nI admit, I could sit and work my way through following a  Youtube walkthrough but this defeats the purpose of me playing the game. Mind you, all of this complaining this is coming from someone who revels in the difficulty of “Dark Souls” and the complexity of the “ARMA” series or “Crusader Kings II”. I just don't care enough to put up with this in this particular game.\n\nRanting out of the way, I don't want to sound mean because it sounds like people are really getting something from this. Looking at the other reviews, it looks like this game may offer something exciting. The plot may be wonderful, but I simply don't have the patience nor the attachment with the game to get very far. I don't find the game's atmosphere to be particularly novel (see "Limbo" or "The Swapper") and the voice acting may or may not be the best thing ever, but these certainly aren't enough to cover for this game's blinding flaw.\n\nGet it on sale with low expectations. I hope it works for you.\n\nMe?\n\nI might come around to try this again when the game is polished or if the plot grabs me in some fantastic way when future episodes come out. I'll be sure  to update this review then.","June 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I highly recommend this game, as it's one of my favorites.\n\nI encountered The Fall earlier in the year and picked it up on sale, as you'll often find it in the steam store, and though I'm not always one for puzzle platformed the lead character had me hooked right away. You play as A.R.I.D., an AI built into a military combat suit, as it navigates a strange planet to save its unconscious human occupant. Even as A.R.I.D. is confined to directive coding any willful human would find ludicrous and hampering, the AI shows itself to an incredibly intelligent, motivated, and even compassionate being. The story itself forces you to make some pretty tough decisions in order to progress; I began the game thinking that A.R.I.D. was a cold and callous thing for making these choices, but by the end I felt I was the one responsible for what it did, and while there's no way around these decisions I felt a lot of remorse for what I was doing; even as a scroller, The Fall is an incredibly immersive experience, and by the end I was so caught up in A.R.I.D.'s story that the cliffhanger finish left me two parts infuriated and four hundred parts distressed for the AI's fate.\n\nThere are a few things worth mentioning in regards to the game's mechanics; my most prevalent concern, and that of others I know to have played the game, is that the controls are a little wonky and sometimes the trial/error stage of inventory usage became a little tedious for the key combinations, and you can't access A.R.I.D.'s items with a mouse. Beyond that the controls are well explained and pretty straightforward, and movement/combat is really smooth, and to add to that I think a lot of love was put into the game's graphics. You begin the game in a dark cave filled with fireflies and derelict robotics; lights activate in dead android eyes as you pass, and in the distance a faint humanoid follows your progress. As A.R.I.D. moves from the cave to a droid facility you get to explore run down buildings, most shadowy and rotting. It's a really eerie place at times, and the game's atmosphere is ♥♥♥♥ing spooky in parts, which really forwards the story's growing sense of dread imo. It's a pretty game, in all, with lovely environments and clean character animation.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that this game was made by a really small indie company, and John Warner (the director: his steam username is hypnoslave) is really sweet and very active in the steam forums. The Fall is one of my absolute favorites, hands down, and I'd really love to see Over The Moon supported as they go about making the second and much awaited installment.","December 27, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its description gives a mash of genres and of those referenced, 'puzzle-solving adventure game' is by far the strongest.\n\nIt looks like a side-scrolling platformer/shooter, but those elements are very light, effectively serving as another type of puzzle.  The strength of this game is in its creepy, slowly-unraveled narrative and gorgeous art.\n(Speaking of the art: The screenshots don't do it justice, you have to see it in motion, watch a video - I'm usually skeptical of black-and-white palette silhouette sidescrollers as a cheap-♥♥♥ cop-out to doing REAL art, but there's enough here to make it worth it; it really works.)\n\nThe world-building and aesthetic really sell the universe you're dropped into, it all makes a dreadful kind of sense.  My only complaint is that it's too short, and that's not a terrible complaints list to have for five bucks.  Frankly, if there's a sequel/prequel/same-universe game made by these guys in a similar vein, I'll probably snap it up on day one, full price.","December 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You immediately fall in love with the main protagonist - Arid, the AI of the mark-7 combat suit awaken to protect its unconscious pilot. Driven by protocols and utilizing loopholes to unlock otherwise unavailable skills she does everything to save Colonel Josephs' life. Will she succeed, depends on you.\n\nApart from the way the game feels, which is awesome, not so rare issue occurs when switching rapidly between movement modes, i.e. walking (while pointing a side arm), hiding (during shoot-outs) or using a cloaking subsystem. Arid can get stuck behind a cover or display inability to jump, hide again or even run properly after vaulting over an obstacle and killing an enemy droid. Its minor since action isn't the mine focus of the game but still, this kind of bugs never reflect well on a title, especially version 1.43 where all of the movement bugs should be long gone. That and a way less often observed lack of enemy's dying animation are the only technical issues I encountered during the whole gameplay.\n\nAbove said, I strongly recommend this title and can't wait for the next episode.","December 13, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's kind of side-scroller, point and click adventure game with multiple puzzles and some combat scenes. It's very atmospheric and the sound is perfect. The story line is very compelling and has an ending that leaves you wanting to play the next episode. Voice acting was good, but I did experience a few glitches while playing. The puzzles were of decent difficulty, not too easy, but not too hard, as long as you keep trying. The combat parts, however, took a while to get down and could be irritating. The controls could be confusing also, and took a while to get used to. It's a pretty short game, since it only took me about 4 hours to complete, but it is part of a trilogy, so you can expect more soon. The main character is A.R.I.D., the AI of a combat suit, who takes over when her pilot lands in the depths of a mysterious facility.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/recommended/290770/","pogafoga","Pogo & Eggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/","189 products in account","I would recommend this game, but with a lot of aprehension. The twists are kind of obvious, either because you're expecting them, or because you've read any science fiction novel which discusses AI in any capacity. "Puzzles" can usually be solved by doing the standard adventure game, "Rub your face on everything, and then rub everything on everything," but here it feels actually fairly relevant to the story. Repeated attempt at actions without necessarily understanding of why actually fits with the story, as you are essentially an aspect of a computer.\n\nIn fact, the reason I would recommend this game to begin with is that it very much gives me the experience of being an AI, at least in some regard. The somewhat awkward controls are obviously more atmospheric, and while the animation for jumping is a little less realistic, it lends itself to the more artificial nature of your entire being. The major complaint I have is partially that it starts in medias res, and oddly I think a lot of information that could be stated about this isn't given. For a game relying on the execution of the story, it does a good job at least in that regard, but it doesn't particularly scratch a deeper universe itch--at least in this stage.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't like "To Be Continued"s, you probably shouldn't try this one just yet. The vast number of Bronze Kickstarter Backers listed in the credits probably at least gave them enough to work on a second game, and this is supposed to be the first of a trilogy apparently. Unless they massively ruin it, I'd proably suggest getting this with the other two as well. And not to spoil the ending too much, but I don't think any moral choices matter significantly (at least in this game), which is nice, as it opens up some replayability for achievement hunters and people who like new content. Although actions having significant consequences later in the series might be interesting, a more unified story--through a lot of points here--would probably create a bigger impact given the subject matter.\n\nYou can read all about Artificial Intelligence going insane, but it's a different experience to play as one, and I found it interesting.","June 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good game in it's own right,  but it's inevitably going to be compared to other games, the most obvious of which is last year's indie darling The Swapper. I really liked The Swapper, but The Fall has far more in common with something like Flashback in terms of gameplay.\n\n\nThe Fall is a 2.5D adventure game. It's like a point & click with combat and platforming. You select an object to interact with by pointing at it, then choose how you're going to interact with it. You have an inventory, you'll be needing to combine these items with the objects in the gameworld to make progress. Unfortunately it being so like a point & click means The Fall also suffers from the same problems as your average point & click game does, but we'll come to that later.\n\n\nWhat should mark The Fall out as interesting is its setting and tone, and that's where comparisons to The Swapper come in. You wake up on a desolate, dark space station, with gloom and foreboding swirling around you, and more than an inkling that you aren't getting the full story. You are actually the A.I. of a combat suit, your pilot is unresponsive so you must act to keep him safe, no matter what that requires. It's a great idea for a story and handles it well.\n\n\nThe Fall nails the look it's going for too, The Swapper's 'found object' art sometimes missed the mark, but The Fall looks and moves fantastic. It's a shame it doesn't do a bit more with its lighting, the sweeps of your torch against the backdrop look great, but it never really adds to the atmosphere other than looking good. Another aspect that is a nice touch and could have done with being expanded on is the OS. When Arid learns a new ability you have to go in to her OS to activate it, it kind of looks the part and it's a great idea, but it stops a little short of you feeling like it's more than a menu you don't really need.\n\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of personality and humour in the game considering you're dealing with A.I. the whole time, and that Arid (your character) is very much not programmed with a personality. Other characters are, but they still fit, the game is all about playing within the rules, and it itself manages this, adding colour without it feeling out of place.\n\n\nI mentioned that The Fall's problems were those inherent within its genre and that's true. It's easy to miss things that can be interacted with or picked up. You use your torch to highlight things, but a quick sweep isn't always enough to mark something, so objects hidden high and low are easily missed. There were also a couple of occasions where 'solving' one part of a puzzle would drop new objects, but because of how dark the game is I couldn't see they'd been dropped. I know handholding in these kind of games can kill them, but there's times I wished interactable objects would sparkle a little.\n\n\nThe pace of the game is also a problem. When you reach a new area you'll find that you can't solve the first puzzle you come to, instead you'll have to go off and explore, with a later puzzle holding the key to solving the first puzzle. This is a problem for a couple of reasons, it's not signposted that you can't solve the early puzzle yet, so you'll struggle, wondering if it's your own stupidity that's halting progress, and probably more of an issue, it's a lot of downtime. Once you start solving puzzles though there's a real pace to them, you punch through them as you immediately recognise where this new item is going to be used.\n\n\nLike Flashback there's also combat. It actually reminds me a little of the chunky gunplay of Shadow Complex. It's very modern but also feels simplified. You can take cover, even go invisible, but the key to success is timing. Enemies will present themselves for you to kill them, standing up and firing for 3 shots, then just waiting for you to take your turn before ducking behind cover again. That sounds like a damning sentence, but I doubt fluid combat is what you've come to The Fall for, and while it's not amazing, it's also not something I'd kick the game for.\n\nThe reason to play The Fall is probably the story. It's episode 1 of 3 apparently, but it ends in a way that I wouldn't mind if they didn't make another. Not that it's bad, more that it feels complete. You don't get all the answers, but you get enough. Hopefully though we do see an episode 2 and it builds on what's here, because The Fall, while not as good as some of the games it gets compared to, is still worth your time, and I'd venture is destined to be a Steam sale pick-up for a few, but it's worth getting on early.","July 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It centers on the interactions of a few different AI characters which while at times a bit tropey over all function to tell an engaging story. That of course is a matter of taste so make of that what you will.\n\nNow the story does end in a cliff hanger but the team behind it promises another two games these will be sold separately (Based on the Kickstarter page) so be warned. Over all I would say that the game play offers a fun few hours and uses a number of cool mechanics making it at least worth a look and the story offers enough intrigue to warrant the purchase.\n\nFun and Engaging but Short and To be Continued\n","July 30, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the grapichs and the soundtrack. Both set the mood for a creepy thrill that actually made me pause the game so I can gather up what little scraps of courage that I have somewhere in me. Though my favorite part of the game has to be the mentality that A.R.I.D (or better known as Arid) goes through the whole experiance. How both you and herself start off as "robots" who follow protocol to becoming "deviant" while trying to protect your pilot Josphes.\n\nThe villain, Caretaker, really gives me the creeps. He's a complete stalking psychopath who crucified the whole place. The funny thing though was that he was probably the only one actually following his protocols, if you over look the crucifitions. I would have liked to have seen more about him then the very little info the notes left. The place had cameras. Surely security has some footage of the Caretaker going dark side.\n\nThe characters are great, the monsters are believable, and the puzzles are fun and stimulating. I really would like to play the next chapter soon, though I'm a little iffy about paying another $10 for it. Broke girl needs to save all the pennies she got.

Some of the puzzles are a bit difficult, you will need to search for an item, and those can be hard to find. On more than one occasion the problem was that I didn't think of an alternative solution. But hey I prefer a challenge rather than a hint system telling me what to do all the time.\n\nAs I said before, the game has some brief action sections, in those you will aim your gun and try to take down your enemies. I played with a DualShock 3 and the aiming was not as precise as I would have liked, so a little bit of patience will be welcome.\n\nBut apart from those small problems, The Fall is a very interesting and entertaining game, it sets the mood perfectly and will surprise many.

For those who get frustrated by puzzles and/or "use entire inventory until you find the winning combination", as well as people who balk at the length of a game, may not find The Fall to be their cup of tea – shooting segments be damned.\n\nIf you ARE a fan of the adventure genre, then this game is for you. The story is simplistic, but compelling and eerie, and the voice acting and atmosphere are spot-on. If I had to judge one thing harshly, however, is that the controls can get a little touchy. Using the flashlight + inspect/network option, while I understand the idea behind it, can be kind of counterintuitive at times.

It's kind of side-scroller, point and click adventure game with multiple puzzles and some combat scenes. It's very atmospheric and the sound is perfect. The story line is very compelling and has an ending that leaves you wanting to play the next episode. Voice acting was good, but I did experience a few glitches while playing. The puzzles were of decent difficulty, not too easy, but not too hard, as long as you keep trying. The combat parts, however, took a while to get down and could be irritating. The controls could be confusing also, and took a while to get used to. It's a pretty short game, since it only took me about 4 hours to complete, but it is part of a trilogy, so you can expect more soon. The main character is A.R.I.D., the AI of a combat suit, who takes over when her pilot lands in the depths of a mysterious facility. She needs find medical treatment for her unconscious pilot and must overcome environmental obstacles, as well as her own restrictive programming.","June 30, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The twists are kind of obvious, either because you're expecting them, or because you've read any science fiction novel which discusses AI in any capacity. "Puzzles" can usually be solved by doing the standard adventure game, "Rub your face on everything, and then rub everything on everything," but here it feels actually fairly relevant to the story. Repeated attempt at actions without necessarily understanding of why actually fits with the story, as you are essentially an aspect of a computer.\n\nIn fact, the reason I would recommend this game to begin with is that it very much gives me the experience of being an AI, at least in some regard. The somewhat awkward controls are obviously more atmospheric, and while the animation for jumping is a little less realistic, it lends itself to the more artificial nature of your entire being. The major complaint I have is partially that it starts in medias res, and oddly I think a lot of information that could be stated about this isn't given. For a game relying on the execution of the story, it does a good job at least in that regard, but it doesn't particularly scratch a deeper universe itch--at least in this stage.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't like "To Be Continued"s, you probably shouldn't try this one just yet. The vast number of Bronze Kickstarter Backers listed in the credits probably at least gave them enough to work on a second game, and this is supposed to be the first of a trilogy apparently. Unless they massively ruin it, I'd proably suggest getting this with the other two as well. And not to spoil the ending too much, but I don't think any moral choices matter significantly (at least in this game), which is nice, as it opens up some replayability for achievement hunters and people who like new content. Although actions having significant consequences later in the series might be interesting, a more unified story--through a lot of points here--would probably create a bigger impact given the subject matter.\n\nYou can read all about Artificial Intelligence going insane, but it's a different experience to play as one, and I found it interesting.","June 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game is relatively short, it's deliberate length actually adds to the atmosphere. And believe me, you'll find yourself wanting more at the very end.\n\nControls can be a bit of a problem time to time, exactly when you are to make a quick decision. This, actually, costed me a few achievements, unfortunately, but that is fine. I'm guessing The Fall is designed to be played with a controller, which I do not have since I pretty much would like to play anything with keyboard & mouse. - Anyway, there's nothing extra ordinary about the graphics. The dark atmosphere and the artstyle goes hand-in-hand and the overall graphics do add to the gameplay. Also, worth to note, I haven't had any performance related problems while playing The Fall on GNU/Linux. - which I am thankful for. It means a lot to see such titles on GNU/Linux and I apperciated every minute I've spent with The Fall on my Arch.\n\nVoiceacting and Soundtrack are well done, there's nothing to add here. Sound Design is exactly how it should be and the Voiceactors gave their best for this title and they've succeed with an outstanding performance. - Very well done.\n\nDoes it worth its initial price? That might be debatable. But does it worth spending time with? Definitely. The Fall is one of those unique experiences for people who would like to explore different approaches to the genre. Again, it does what it promises and that's the exact reason why people who are interested in such games should give The Fall a try. - I promise, you won't regret it.\n\nI'm looking forward for the new titles from Over The Moon, and of course the continuation of The Fall.","November 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not saying good plot will excuse truly awful controls or gameplay, but the titles I seem to value the most are (mostly) the ones which have something very interesting to say.  The Fall is firmly in that "good plot" category, and as a bonus has some pretty good gameplay to boot.\n\nThe premise is interesting enough: you play as ARID, the AI of a combat suit, tasked with keeping the unconscious occupant of the suit (your "pilot") alive.  What should be a straightforward task is complicated by the fact that none of the other AIs in the area will help without authorization from your incapacitated pilot, placing you in the worst sort of Catch-22: obey the part of your programming that requires obedience, or obey the part telling you to keep your pilot alive.  Right from the start, the game is forcing you to think a little outside the box, to bend the rules, a theme which continues throughout.\n\nThat same theme of subversion carries over to the puzzles as well.  While some are admittedly straightforward ("some dripping liquid and I found a container, I wonder what I'm supposed to do here...") most involve you finding some solution which is distinctly counter to the intent of the systems you are interacting with.  In fact, the largest section of puzzles is devoted to nothing BUT that very premise, requiring you to subvert intent to solve every obstacle placed before you.  Honestly, this adds a little bit of extra satisfaction to solving these puzzles: rather than bending to the will of the AIs impeding you, instead you're finding your own solution while giving them a bit of a middle finger in the process.  The puzzles are also fairly well designed to boot, neither too easy nor too obtuse.  Very few were things I solved on the first try, and yet when I did find the solution I did not feel any were especially cheap or reliant on "adventure game logic", that blend of overly specific and overy obscure knowledge one must have to solve puzzles in certain older adventure games.\n\nIf I had to pick out one weak point in The Fall, it's the controls.  To be clear, the controls aren't bad, they're just a bit of a mixed bag; the controls for selecting interaction methods are a little unusual but quite easy to use, while the aim controls are sometimes frustratingly difficult to work with.  Specifically, aiming is done by having ARID aim where your mouse cursor is placed.  The problem with that is that your mouse cursor is not shown on the screen.  Quite often you will find yourself walking to the left and then needing to aim at an enemy, only for ARID to snap to the right immediately once you enter aim mode because your invisible mouse cursor was actually on the other side of her.  It makes an otherwise enjoyable experience occasionally irritating, especially in later areas where precise aim during combat is absolutely important.\n\nThat one issue aside, The Fall is a surprisingly well polished, enjoyable title, especially given that it is developer Over The Moon's first title.  For any fan of adventure games it should be an enjoyable experience from start to finish, and I am eagerly awaiting the next entry in the series.","May 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game is relatively short, it's deliberate length actually adds to the atmosphere. And believe me, you'll find yourself wanting more at the very end.\n\nControls can be a bit of a problem time to time, exactly when you are to make a quick decision. This, actually, costed me a few achievements, unfortunately, but that is fine. I'm guessing The Fall is designed to be played with a controller, which I do not have since I pretty much would like to play anything with keyboard & mouse. - Anyway, there's nothing extra ordinary about the graphics. The dark atmosphere and the artstyle goes hand-in-hand and the overall graphics do add to the gameplay. Also, worth to note, I haven't had any performance related problems while playing The Fall on GNU/Linux. - which I am thankful for. It means a lot to see such titles on GNU/Linux and I apperciated every minute I've spent with The Fall on my Arch.\n\nVoiceacting and Soundtrack are well done, there's nothing to add here. Sound Design is exactly how it should be and the Voiceactors gave their best for this title and they've succeed with an outstanding performance. - Very well done.\n\nDoes it worth its initial price? That might be debatable. But does it worth spending time with? Definitely. The Fall is one of those unique experiences for people who would like to explore different approaches to the genre. Again, it does what it promises and that's the exact reason why people who are interested in such games should give The Fall a try. - I promise, you won't regret it.\n\nI'm looking forward for the new titles from Over The Moon, and of course the continuation of The Fall.","November 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game may remind seasoned players of the classic, Flashback, but in mechanics and genre only.  Everything about this game encourages you to pay close attention to detail, which is a refreshing experience among contemporary titles.  I found it buried deeply in the roster of the last big steam sale.\n\nThe Fall is an eloquently written narrative experience.  The game is set in a future world where AI development has advanced considerably.  You control an advanced combat suit after falling from the sky, through the ground and into a cavern.  Make no mistake, the plot quickly thickens, and its advancement is a sustained element of this game that will keep you engaged.\n\nIt should be mentioned that a few of the puzzles can be challenging. However, I recommend using walkthroughs only as an absolute last resort, as the answer is usually accessible with further inspection.  The combat is relatively easy, but also does not hold your hand. You will be forced to pay attention to enemies instead of button-mashing.\n\nIf you are philosophically-inclined like me, you will spend a great deal of time pondering how plot elements apply to real-world concepts such as free-will, technological advancement, human evolution, and the future direction of the human species. The world is immersive, both in visuals and music.\n\nSome of the best elements of this game have to do with its plot progression, so I won't spoil anything for you.  If you like side-scrollers, realistic sci-fi, thinking games, and immersive thought-provoking narratives, this game is worth checking out.  It is currently well-worth the $10, full-price cost on steam, but on sale it goes much lower.  I got about 9 hours of game play out of it.  This was a bit short for me, because I enjoyed it so much, but this shortness does make it accessible for casual gamers who are looking for something of substance for a single weekend or to play in installments after work.  It is a game worth experiencing, not speed-running.  Be sure to note the subtleties.","January 31, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"The Fall" is a 3-hour episode of a greater story, which I didn't really get from the store description. The ending feels abrupt and will definitely leave you wanting more.\n\nAside from the depressingly short length, the only negative aspect is the bizarre controls.  Can't change mouse speed for aiming, and aiming feels.... "elliptical" (?). Hard to describe, but any time you try to look up or down at sharp angles the mouse speed gets weird.

Most of the time you're just frobbing all interest points with all your items and actions until something fits. Often the reason you can't figure out a puzzle is because you didn't realise a particular interaction was even possible, really poor communication with the game or you've missed an interest point, usually in the ceiling.

(Make sure you're paying attention to details and it gets really good) Fantastic use of characters and setting. It was genuinely creepy even when nothing was happening. The controls are less than perfect and there are some bugs, but they didn't get in the way too much.

I for one have just recently discovered the marvelous world of indie side-scrollers so I haven't played many of them yet. Nevertheless, so far The Fall has been the best by far.\nThe atmosphere of it slightly resembles The Swapper, giving the game a sort of a cosmic, mysterious touch which I really fancy. The mostly dark surroundings logically match the location your character is playing in, although for some reviewers the entire game has seemed too dark. It's a matter of taste I guess but it certainly didn't bother me. Adding more lighting would have probably ruined the general idea of the set the character's in.\nThe visuals per se are nice and no detail really scratches the eye. There is no overly artistic aura eminating from the game; there are no magical landscapes and pink fairies, that is. The AI is depicted in a realistic key with a touch of humour and the graphics really support the cause.\nIn terms of dialogues they are really well written and spoken, making them a joy to listen. The main character does a good job of expressing her opinion on the location and her surroundings,  quite often I found myself asking the same questions she did. Hence I believe the dialogue really helps to connect with the main character.\nIn terms of gameplay The Fall is just fine. Having to examine your surroundigs with a flashlight in order to progress and find items really syncs with the beforementioned dark theme, making the solutions quite often hidden from the eye at first.\nOh and the story... wow. The ending.. wow. I might get amazed too easily, but.. yeah, wow.

Throughout the game countless hints present themselves, leading a way to a successful (and a surprising) finish, you only have to pay attention.\nAt times it felt like I had to backtrack my steps a little too often but I guess the game and the suspense would have ended too fast without it so I found myself embracing the backtrack quite a bit.","June 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, albeit slightly leaving me wanting more. The game is short, I purcahsed and completed the game on the same day. The price could be debated, but I personally feel like the content the game provided, combined with the story and atmosphere, made it worth it.\n\nThe game is roughly similar to a point and click, with some minor combat sprinkled through the game. The point and click adventure elements worked well, with only a few of the puzzles being slighty convoluted and requiring a guide. The combat is releatively simple.\n\nWhen I booted up the game, for anything within this genre, I prefer to use a controller, and the controls for the majority were smooth. Ocassionally the gunplay was difficult, but the keyboard and mouse would have probablly alleviated the issue. The settings are pretty minimalistic, but I'm doubtful anyone's computer will be taxxed by the graphical prowes of this title.\n\nI liked the game, and for the price, you might want to wait for a sale, but I myself feel satisified for the ten dollars I spent.

The graphics, while outwardly simple, portray everything quite beautifully and the animation is just as nice. Every character has, well.. character, and the voice acting really brings all of them to life. So to speak. The story has an intriguing direction and it's hard not to root for the main character.\n\nThere are occasional pitfalls; the puzzles can suffer from that typical adventure game "What?! How was I supposed to know that?" feeling, while the environments can make it somewhat difficult to determine the way forward. The combat system is good for being what it is, but it sometimes feels out of place, and there isn't much of a difficulty curve to match it.\n\nThe Fall has overall stolen my heart, despite its slip-ups. 8/10.","September 25, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are so wrong. Just buy it. Play it. And then go give the developers lots more money so they can make the next chapter of this excellent game.\n\nYou play as A.R.I.D, an artificial intelligence programmed into a life-support suit occupied by a human pilot. A.R.I.D is activated when she crash-lands in an unfamiliar place. She is unable to communicate with her pilot; her systems show that he is unconscious and in need of medical attention. A.R.I.D must therefore find assistance for her pilot in any way that she can.\n\nThe game is simple to learn but difficult to master. Essentially, you have a flashlight, which you can use to explore your surroundings, highlighting objects which A.R.I.D can observe and possibly interact with. You must navigate the simple yet detailed and atmospheric platform levels, picking up objects and interacting them with other objects to solve puzzles and progress through the levels. Solutions will not simply present themselves; you have to work to solve the problems A.R.I.D finds herself confronted with, which gives you a very real sense of achievement when you do find the solution. You also have a gun, which (believe it or not) you use to shoot stuff, and a 'cloaking device', which you you to hide from stuff. It really is as simple as that. Don't be fooled, though; simple does not mean stupid. This game punches way above its weight in terms of complexity and mental engagement.\n\nAll credit to the development team on this game; the graphics are stunning, the vocal acting is brilliant, the story line is intriguing and the whole concept of the game is fascinating. A tiny nitpick might be to say that some of the puzzles are really quite difficult with no immediate solution, but in all honesty that is just a part of the game play and I think it is intentionally obscure. It makes you think. It forces you to back-track sometimes. This game would be nowhere near as fun if it was too easy. If you like a challenge, then this is a perfect game for you.\n\nThe story is impossible to describe without giving too many spoilers, but A.R.I.D's journey is one of overcoming obstacles, achieving her aims at any costs and going on a real voyage of discovery. I played it through twice in quick succession and I will definitely be playing it through again in the future - it's a fantastic game. It's simple appearance does not do justice to the complexity of the characters and the issues of morality that go to the heart of the story line. Cheating, in particular, is an issue that is raised more than once, which is interesting because, trust me, you'll be fighting the urge to just have a quick sneaky peek at one of those Steam forum guides just to see how, exactly, you're supposed to solve some of the tests that A.R.I.D is presented with. A.R.I.D herself is also one of the most interesting characters I've come across in a game in some time.\n\nYes, it's frustrating that there's clearly intended to be more to this game and I would dearly love it if the development team could release Chapter 2, like, now. However, if you didn't buy this title just because it might be incomplete, then you are missing out on a phenomenal little platform game that rewards your tenacity and involvement with unique and interesting play. The game as it is now finishes on something that could be the end but is also a tantalising cliff-hanger, hinting that you're not done yet... I, for one, am hooked and hungry for more.\n\nI honestly cannot recommend this game highly enough; if you crave believable characters, atmospheric graphics, challenging puzzles and an interesting story line, "The Fall" is the game for you.","May 16, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/recommended/290770/","vixzends","Vixzen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/","790 products in account","The Fall is a side-scroller action puzzle-based adventure game set within a dark and atmospheric environment and story where exploration and knowledge of your surroundings is key.\n\nMechanics that are used to play through this game are minimal. You find objects within the environment to interact with by using ARID's flashlight, or you can switch to ARID's gun with laser-sight in hostile environments. There is also a very small inventory system used within the game - you can pick certain objects up to interact with other objects, all done by using the flashlight.\n\nThe puzzles are well thought out and reasonably obvious in their solution if you have explored well enough - and explore you will, as there is a fair amount of back-tracking through environments in order to find the solution to solve some of the puzzles. I do have to admit that I had to look up the solution to two puzzles as I spent an awful lot of time trying to work out how to get around the problem, and on reading the solution would have absolutely never come up with the answer myself. That said, though there is some difficulty with the puzzles, there is also (for the most part) a sense of logic to it and, other than the two puzzles mentioned, it didn't take me long to work out what I was meant to be doing in any given situation.\n\nCombat, though a relatively small part of the game, doesn't feel like an over-sight at all. Using just a pistol with laser-sight, you have the option to duck behind cover or run wildly at the enemy to finish them off, also taking into account that headshots are more effective than just shooting wildly at your foe.\n\nProgression through the story is this games biggest achievement. The writing and voice-acting is incredible, and though I can't discuss the story here as it would ultimately result in spoilers, it is a fascinating journey with an ending that I did not expect at all.\n\nIf a good story-line is important to you in a game, I would strongly recommend a play-through of this, particularly as it is quite short. Excellent voice-acting, stunning and gritty visuals, a superb story, interesting game play mechanics, progression and puzzles - I'm not sure there's anything about this game that I didn't enjoy (even the back-tracking!), and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it.","May 8","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must bring him somewhere to get medical care without violating your three directives. Stuff gets weird fast, and without spoiling anything, you're treated to some of the best-written artificial intelligence in games.\n\nIt offers a mix of adventure game puzzle solving and just straight up shooting, it does the former better than the latter. The control scheme can be a bit odd, shining a flashlight on interactive objects and then holding down a button to interact with them, but the puzzles blend well with the overall narrative and for the most part are logical and sometimes darkly humorous in their solutions.\n\nThe shooty bits aren't bad, but I mostly just wanted to get them over with to continue the story. Not sure if I'd call them unnecessary, as you are piloting a combat suit after all, but they're not the main draw for certain.\n\nOne note of hesitation is that the story doesn't actually conclude, and a second chapter has been announced as in development. Even knowing that though, it's a very compelling journey that's worth investing in even if the sequel takes  a while to get here.\n\nVisually appealing and dark, yet sometimes funny, it got me more invested in a few hours of playtime than most games manage to with dozens of hours of overarching plot. Great little indie gem that uses the medium well. Just expect more emphasis on puzzles and story than action, and you'll probably enjoy it too.\n","May 30","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept is interesting and is a great example of AIs interacting with each other. The story is well told and I liked every character. It is definitely worth experiencing and I am very interested in the next chapter.\n\n\nThe graphics are mixed. Anything in the background looks great, as well as any time a character looks into the background. However, anything in the foreground looks terrible, being blocky, in a poor art way, not a meaningful style, The foreground is sometimes too black and it's hard to distinguish what something is. You often have to play a hidden object game with your flashlight to find something to interact with.\n\nOne high point is that the puzzles all made sense and some were not readily obvious, thus providing a slight challenge.  There is combat, but it's weak and seems to just change the pace a bit. However, the controls are terrible on PC. In order to interact with anything, you have to use the right mouse button and mouse to control your flashlight and point it at a symbol. Then you have to hold "E" to open the menu, then navigate that menu with WASD whild still holding "E". The mouse just makes the flashlight go up and down, so you don't have a cursor.\n\nOverall, the story is worth your time if you like stories, particularly about AI. But the game is rough to play with terrible controls.","July 29, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s about AI, and how they work around their rules to achieve what they were made for. You get the impression that it's inevitable that they start bending the rules, subverting their original meanings in order to achieve what they believe is the greater goal.\n\nIt’s a sidescrolling puzzle game with light combat elements. As with so many other puzzle games before it there are sections with pixel hunting, where you’re blindly combining every inventory item on every object in the world just in case that progresses the game. A couple areas I’d argue are poorly designed, as they are almost impossible to see, even when you’re taking it slow. But I guess we have walkthroughs to solve that problem. On the whole it’s good, and not even close to the level of frustration 90s adventure games had.\n\nI had a great time with The Fall. The writing is smart, the aesthetics are great, with just a couple questionable design decisions. Like why can’t you reduce gamma? It pops up a calibration screen when you start the game, and the default setting is at the bottom of the scale. That shows to me that the creator doesn’t realize that a large amount of monitors are incorrectly calibrated out of the factory to be set too bright. Too dark gamma is rarer than too bright. The game also has a transparent texture overlaid over the game at all time which consist almost entirely of banding artifacts. I cut the game some slack, as I assume the developer only had mediocre uncalibrated monitors as reference. You'd only miss those artifacts if you were using a monitor with black crush. There’s some room for improvement here in the future installments which are apparently on the way.\n\nThe Fall achieves all the most important parts of what it set out to do. The combination of story, animation and audio makes the game cool. It reminded me of Flashback. And it has a really good ending. Even though sequels are planned, this game stands on its own. Well worth playing at some point.","December 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're a robotic suit with an AI that lands on a planet filled with robots and creatures. I played through the game and for the most part I enjoyed it. There are however, some significant things I take issue with that I'll go into. Of course it's completely subjective and you may find them to be non-issues. The game is a side scrolling adventure/puzzler that feels a little like a point and click, I'll explain the point and click aspect later. First let's start with what's done right. Art style. The game is very sci-fi, moody and atmospheric. This is an example of how you don't need to have super realistic, in your face graphics to be immersive. The moment I landed in the world I felt mesmerized and wanted to just go off and explore every inch of it. My only complaint is I wished the developers would have put a little more background elements to really bring the world to life. Music and voice acting is also top notch here. You can tell the voice actors really cared about how they sounded. The dialog seems natural as natural can be for robots. The most impressive is the voice of the administrator, also an AI. They did a phenomenal job of how he subtly changes his tone form rigid robotic to a more human tone. Movement is fluid and the game supports a gamepad, however it doesn't seem to state that in game. In fact I started playing initially on keyboard as for some reason my gamepad did not register. Also the settings only showed keyboard, which is kind of odd. At first I was okay playing WASD/mouse but I for some reason every time I right clicked (which is how you target/scan) my avatar would always turn left? Suffice to say, that annoyed the hell out of me. I thought all was lost until I started fidgeting with my controller and it started working on its own, as in the game allowed its input, not that there was something wrong with my controller. Once I changed to gamepad I was able to scan/target without having my toon turn on its own.  Speaking of scanning, I think it’s time I get into what I find to be glaring issues with the game. And those are, scanning for clues and puzzle logic. This game has you spending quite some time searching for clues in the form of nodes. Some clues are objects you can pick up and use as items, like you would in a point in click. Normally I don't have a problem with finding objects and having to use them within some kind of puzzle. However this only works if this puzzle is logical. The problem here is that most of the items you find have no logical explanation. That’s not to say all of them are like this. There are some examples of items that makes sense. For the most part however you end up running around scanning every node and trying everything in your inventory because you have no idea how or where to use the item you have. The other issue are the nodes themselves, if you miss an important story driven node, you're going to find yourself running around for a long time trying to figure out what you missed. This ends up being a situation where you find yourself walking and scanning up and down every few feet in search of that elusive node. I sincerely hope this wasn't intended as a way to inflate game time. As you can tell, this really annoyed me, and it annoyed me more than usual because I really liked the game and I really want to like it. The story is great, the dialog is well written, the action is intense when it needs to be and subdued at just the right time. Despite me running around for some time, the game is short. First time through you'll probably finish it in 5 to 8 hours if you take your time and explore and pause the game from time to time as I tend to do. If you’re like me, you hate finishing good games because you will always feel like it’s a little short and you want some more. I think that's when you know you had some fun. The game ends with to be continued. the question then becomes, do I...want to continue? And my answer is... it depends. In my heart of hearts, I want to say yes but not if the game doesn't evolve. I hated feeling like I was playing a point and click from time to time and I seriously hope the developer figures out a way to construct puzzle/items in a more logical sense. And find a better solution to the whole "node scanning plot device" mechanic. Which coincidently switching between scanning and laser felt kind of awkward... but I digress. Overall and despite my huge gripe with the game, I liked it. The story and immersion was enough for me to overlook the things I hated much about the game.","June 21, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some puzzles have extra steps for no reason.\n\nFor example (Light spoiler warning, skip this paragraph) you're a war machine, and you have to get a wood cutout across a room, but the track it is on is jammed. My first guess was "tear it off and carry it across", but the answer was "get a power supply to overload a generator so that the track jams, *then* tear it off and carry it across". ??? Okay, how do you silence something, with the hint 'how would a war machine silence something?' If you said "With your gun", you're wrong. You end up destroying it, just in a completely different way.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, like that of Limbo, and the writing, acting and story are good, but this is a puzzle game and the puzzles are by-and-large terrible. More than once you have to aim at the ceiling with no visual cue* and shoot something. More than once you have to use something that is described as 'broken' or 'not fuctioning', so basically you have to "Use" everything so you don't miss anything. Pixel hunting (that only show up with your flashlight, not 'aiming' or just walking). Mildly clunky but forgivable interface.\n\n*except when you point a flashlight there (again, no cue) hope you like manually searching the entire game.\n\nMaybe get it on sale and have a walkthrough loaded, you'll save a lot of time.","July 5, 2014","false","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Fall features very good gameplay, puzzles, and graphics. Gunfights are similar to Gemini Rue, but with MUCH better controls. The story, writing, dialogue, and voice acting are all top notch.\n\nThe only criticism I have is the game length; The Fall can be completed in under 5 hours. However, that being said, this game is worth every penny!

I love those indie sci-fi puzzle platformers because, if the creators are sensible enough, they are just the right mix of deep, ambitious storytelling and down-to-earth, classic platforming and puzzle-solving. Like Swapper, which is one of my favourite games of all time. Let's just say I love the genre and the potential it carries. But all too often the games just fall flat because they are either too ambitious and story driven which makes for a very confusing afternoon, or too casual and mainstream which makes for a very disappointing afternoon.\n\nThis one is the winner in my book. It's just the perfect love affair between mind-bending storytelling and brain-churning puzzle-platforming. There were a couple of times where I was ready to throw in the towel and cry my way towards the nearest walkthrough, but just at the right moment the puzzle revelaled its secrets and everything was good again. And it felt good too. And the story? Wow. Very well paced and with some unexpected plot twists. Before long you start to think like an autonomous war machine on a mission to save its pilot by all means necessary. Or do you? ;) There are some feels too. Nothing tear-jerking but you do feel like you've witnessed something meaningful.\n\nIf you look for negatives very hard you could probably point to the fact this game was clearly made with consoles in mind and the porting team didn't even bother removing the oh-so-helpful "Use your Right Stick" tutorial messages, let alone redoing the UI so that it is actually semi-usable when playing on a PC. As it is, the interface is probably the biggest facepalm-inducing thing in the game. Other than that, the sound didn't make a big impression on me (then again I was playing on a sub-par headset). The cover system and combat in general felt kinda tired and "trope-y" with all those waist-high walls and "silent takedowns" but it's by far not a major part of the game so I guess it's fine.\n\nIn closing: If you like puzzle-platformers - buy this game; If you like thought-provoking storytelling - buy this game; If you like indie sci-fi games - buy this game. Hell, just buy this game and either way you won't be disappointed, and you might even be happy. Like I am. I'm happy I got to play this game and I'm looking forward to the second installment.","September 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Just so you know what's bad and won't whine at it after the purchase. I played on Debian Linux with XBox 360 controller. The game can be described as a quest/action. You should explore the surroundings, find objects, use them on active places and shoot robots and other creatures from time to time. It may sound boring in this brief description but believe me, it's not at all. So, what are the downsides?\n\n— It's quite short and ends with a cliffhanger. Took me 5 hours to complete, some people may divide the price by hours and make a wry face. Though for me it's perfectly fine because these were not your usual 5 hours. Whatever. Two more episodes are in the works and will be sold separately.\n— Gamepad controls can't be reassigned and were chosen poorly. Switching the flashlight and the gun with right stick press? Oh god why. The X button isn't used at all as well as the left trigger. And you can't switch while the flashlight/gun is holstered. So you have to tilt the RT AND press it. And you have to do it pretty often. Aiming is quite poor, sensitivity can't be adjusted either. After some time you'll get used to it but still.\n— Oh them .exe everywhere. I don't want to believe that future AIs are running Windows as their OS. That's of course a dumb complain since I'm a biased Linux guy, just noticed and facepalm'd a bit. Opinion discarded.\n\nIf that hasn't scared you away, let's get to the good parts.\n\n— First of all, I want to denote the outstanding, no, OUTSTANDING voiceacting. That's literally one of the best acting I heard in games since the Portal series (though in "The Fall" protagonist actually, he-he, has a voice and man what a voice!). In most of AAA titles voices are plain and boring, they're just there and that's all. It was a big surprise to find this genuine play in an indie game. Despite the grim atmosphere, there's a place for sparky jokes and sarcastic acid here and there to lighten it up a bit. All characters are unique and they develop as the time goes. It's impossible not to love them!\n— Quests are logical enough... well, not everywhere. I was really stuck only in one place but it seems to be common. Quests have their piece of humor, too. Often dark as the game itself. I'm very ok with that.\n— Overall atmosphere is perfect. From graphics to the background noises, it's an abandoned and at the same time hostile facility where something very damn bad happened long time ago. It reminds me of "The Swapper" though "The Fall" is not a puzzle and more story-driven. You'll get some clues as the story unveils but a lot of mistery is saved for the future parts.\n— Sci-fi themed. I love sci-fi, space and robots!\n— Has a Linux version. A strong point for me since I'm only buying and playing ported games now. No crashes, no glitches (except the mentioned unconvenient controls but that's a platform agnostic issue). It just works!\n— I noticed some Mass Effect references, though maybe I'm digging too deep. The author mentioned the ME series in the FAQ (probably, that was not just a random title!), the A.R.I.D. voice and character are similar to EDI in some respects and her outfit is very close to quarians' suits. Again, that may be just my projections since I'm an ME-fan.\n— DAT A$$.\n\nAll in all, 9 out of 10. A must play game for sure. Some issues can be fixed in future, some are fundamental and by design. Nevertheless, I seriously consider this game an indie gem you should not pass by.","August 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","5"

The shooting is a silly addition, the game reaches ~2 hours of gametime.  This doesn't leave room for improvement in the shooting sequences.  Similarly, there are puzzles... but they end up being pixel hunting maneuvers and later puzzles don't build on earlier puzzle solving strategies (not that there are many anyways).\n\nStory:\nThere is quite a bit of time spent world building, which has zero payoff.  As far as character building goes... the game relies on a fairly well-trodden sci-fi trope and just not explaining what's going on.\n\nThe intention for this was to come out as 3 episodes.

The suit crash-landed into an unknown location, rendering the pilot unconscious and likely unstable, activating A.R.I.D. From then on, the player is left on their own to figure it out.\n\nThe world in The Fall is horribly dark. I don't think I've experienced something like it before, which makes this a hard thing to review. Personally, I am easily terrified. Movies that are not intended to be scary end up keeping me up for nights on end, sometimes fueling nightmares, so I always avoid games such as this. I received The Fall through a bundle with other games, and I forgot about it for quite a while. A friend of mine wanted to ask my opinion of the game, but I told him I hadn't even played it yet, so I jumped in without knowing what to expect.\n\nTruth be told, I could only get through the first half of the second section before I had to stop. I seriously could not keep going for fear of what lied ahead. If you are into this kind of thing, you may find The Fall more tame than other games or movies with similar styles.\n\nHowever, The Fall also requires that you be familiar with the mechanics of point-and-click puzzle games, as these mechanics override everything else. You have to have your flashlight on almost constantly. It's not that it's bad, but if you're not a fan of point-and-click, this won't be for you.\n\nThe sound and the graphics absolutely fit the game, and the sound design is partly what made me stop playing because it was so powerful.\n\nIf you like games like LIMBO and The Swapper, if you like dark and disturbing plots, if you like point-and-click puzzle games, this is definitely something to check out!","December 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

By the time I had acquired enough currency to help fund the game, to my pleasant surprise I realized I could BUY IT - and better yet, during a steam summer sale. Euh euh euh euh.\n\nThe games a GOOD game, but it's not a great game. The puzzles at first were refreshing as it makes you think differently than how you would have to think for a puzzle game. I was surprised as to the game mechanic that I could use actual deductive reasoning to solve a task instead of just doing what I expected the game to funnel me into doing. I jumped for a ledge, and rather than bouncing off it like in other games, I actually could GRAB IT. Why that's what I would've totally done if I was ARID!\nThis refreshing take eventually fizzled out after about 1-2 hours as the puzzles start to become completely unintuitive. With most of the puzzle space being accessible most of the time, its as if the game takes pleasure in watching you helplessly backtrack through the entire game thinking you 'missed something' that you didn't point your flashlight to. Most of the game will be spent back tracking or flailing a new ability/item you acquired that you thought would come in repetive handiness but are sorely disappointed. Like, WHY AM I CARRYING THIS SEVERED HAND EVERYWHERE IF I DON'T NEED IT? or WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS BAG? Why can't I use this bag to collect X like a real person to solve that puzzle?\n\nBugs: Choppy animation on enemies taking cover. Strange ladder bug where I phased through half the map and started interacting with a ladder 2 floors down. (Not a bug, but definitely needs a fixing). Controls for mouse and keyboard are pretty bad. I couldn't change the key binding settings mid-game either, had to quit, edit, then restart. What? I also shouldn't have to tap both the selection key, and then the space bar to see which key actually selects the button. Why can't I just use a mouse like normal folk to select menu options? Shooting should have a cross hair to give a sense of direction of aim. Laser pointing isn't enough.\n\nYes, lots of frustration at some points, but the voice acting is amazing, characters are likeable, atmosphere is spooky and engulfing. I quite enjoyed it and look forward to THE OTHER HALF OF THE GAME. I just wished this was actually a true complete game that isn't just masquerading as a Steam Greenlight title. Almost half your 'parameters' won't actually ever work by the end of the game. Anyways, it's 10 dollary doos. Buy the game, support the team but personally, if I see the control and bug issues continue through to the next game, I'm going to have to black list The Moon Games for a long while.

The shooting and puzzle-solving however are not what makes this game, as good as they are. The motivation for someone to buy this and play it would be story.\n\nI actually got this in a bundle but I had heard of how good its story was long before. A robot trying to protect her pilot is in a strange place and she must go to extreme measures to save his life. Its an interesting premise that leaves you curious and as more of the story unravels, some questions are answered but more take their place. The whole thing is surrounded in mystery yet it never loses you and you always know just enough to understand your current situation but no more than that.\n\nThe atmosphere is truly engrossing with the art and sound all being spot on. You’re left curious, yet always apprehensive as the constant uneasiness and possible threat of danger leaves you effectively creeped out. It’s just fantastically well done.\n\nHowever, many will warn you of two things. Firstly, this game ends on a cliffhanger and so is not a complete story. Secondly, this game is short. The cliffhanger was fantastic and not a bad way to end the game at all. Seriously, if the next game is as good as the first then the answers should be well worth the wait, so the cliffhanger is okay by me.\n\nWhat I wasn’t so alright with was the length. Like everyone else I was warned of how short it was by reviews and it didn’t turn me off in the slightest. I’ve mentioned before that game length often does not bother me as many stories (though not all!) are best told in only a few hours. That being said, I was expecting somewhere around six hours for this game and instead I got half that. It wasn’t that the game felt incomplete due to the length. As I said, it ended very well, but I finished it today. I started it up expecting another, for want of a better word, level or area, but instead I walked a bit, talked a bit and it ended. It just felt like I had played a level of an adventure game instead of an adventure game.\n\nThis all being said my feelings towards the game are almost completely positive. Apart from the length there is very little to criticise and as a result I would definitely recommend to those looking for a unique new story. Looking forward to number 2 and the answers, and possible questions, it will bring with it too.","June 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

What can I say, sleeper hit of the year? It's an indie game full of bright ideas, illogical and logical puzzles, but not illogical in the illogical sense, more that you have to do the reverse, sometimes, of what would protect your combatant in order to save him/her.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing, but they are moody and atmospheric, with a main character that will draw you in what seems to be a conspiracy of sorts. I never expected much from the game, in fact during Alpha testing I found it very difficult to play. They refinded and listened to our calls, and actually changed the gameplay a bit to fit into the general consensus that it works. The puzzles were wonderful fun, some as I say illogical, but worked within the spectrum of the logic of the game.\n\nThe ending was a fantastic twist on what we normally get with games like this, in fact I  would be surprised if we don't see more games liek this. Maybe we won't, but there will be more of The Fall coming in chapters, this was simply the first, The devs say it takes about 3-4 hours to complete. Maybe if you're speedy gonzalez, but it took me nearer 7 hours to complete the game from start to finish. It was a delight to play.\n\nI want more The Fall, and I want it now. Don't give up at the start, it may seem clumsy control wise, and little to do at the start, but trust me, it's worth the perseverance.

The fact that the action in the "fake branches" isn't automatic actually makes things worse, as they made me feel like an automatron myself (and if that was the objective of the game creators, I didn't like it).\n\nThat said, the story is quite good until the disappointing (and quite forseeable...) finale, the graphic is nice without being incredible but creates a very believable and immersive setting, and the sound does it's job and nothing else (with the notable exception of the voice acting of one of the characters, which is 5 star. You'll see what I mean when you meet him).\n\nSo should I recommend this game? For a budget price (<5E), it's probably worth playing (and I got it in a humble bundle), but as the current 9.99E price goes. Nope.

I'm glad I got this game for a dollar on humble, because it took me all of an hour to complete. Literally thought it was a joke when the credits rolled and that I had just made the wrong dialogue choice. I even played it through a second time to make sure I didn't miss anything or that there were no alternate paths or changes based on dialogue choices.  There are none.  I understand that there is more coming, but at what price? another 10.99? are you joking? this is the length of most demos if not shorter.\n\nIn my opinion, a game should be worth its price in hours. A game that costs $60 would, in a perfect world, offer at least 60 hours of content.  Now I know this doesn't always happen, and sometimes it goes far beyond that goal ie. games like Skyrim, many JRPGs, or titles with multiplayer like Starcraft 2 (which boasts at the least, a 30 hour campaign on top of its online offerings).  BUT one hour, for 12 dollars, that is sparse at best.\n\nWhats really a shame here I feel, is that the game is f&%$ing STELLAR.  The combat is pretty great, but could use a little polish.  The story is astoundingly well written and I couldn't stop playing even though I merely booted it up to try it out.  However there's the problem.  It drew me in so much it was absolutely no problem to finish it in one VERY short session.   this games puzzles took no more than a minute each to solve for me so they didn't extend the length at all,  and even that would have been an illusion of length.  I don't see other people addressing this issue either in their reviews, this includes major publications.\n\nI cannot  recommend this game unless it's price tag is under 2 dollars, and even then, youd be better off to look elsewhere for a budget side scrolling romp. Elliot Quest, Wings of Vi, Dust an Elysian Tale, Hell even something like Starbound.  These games all delivered what I would consider a length worthy of their 15$ and under price tags.\n\nPLEASE next time you want to make a "2 hour game", include some dam hard to find collectibles, and harder puzzles to extend the length and warrant replays.","May 18, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

I finally decided to give this game a "no". Here's my explanation why:\n\nI bought this game, knowing it was a short, but nonetheless story-rich experience. While the visuals might give the impression, this is sort of a "Swapper"-clone, its pace is much slower and more emphasis is placed on actual reading and getting to know your surroundings. All in all, it can be described as a 2D point n click adventure with combat elements.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed the story and the atmosphere of the game, I was horribly overstrained by the gameplay. I know, I do not play many adventure games and never really have, so it should come as no surprise to me that I had some trouble, navigating through the game. However, soon the intense atmosphere was destroyed by the fact, that I was walking through the same corridor the sixth time or so with my flashlight on permanently, just to figure out, where in the surroundings it was, what I had overlooked. This is also a problem, since crucial objects blend perfectly into the background and you have to scan everywhere.\n\nIn the end, I had to look up a few solutions in a guide, since I wanted to finish the game, but gave up on finding a solution myself. Maybe I lack the patience and/or logic for such games, so if you are used to such a gameplay, you might love The Fall. If you are, however, like me, you will probably not enjoy it much and soon end up on a try-everything-in-your-inventory-on-everything-on-the-map-just-to-see-if-it-works-state.","April 30, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though I was slightly dissappointed I still enjoyed the experience - I was just expecting an actual video game rather than an interactive graphic novel.\n\nOne thing that really bothers me, especially since its such a major part of the game, is the flashlight. The game overall does a very good job with the visuals, sound and music, but ARID's flashlight is just terrible - Donkey Kong Country did such a better job with flashlight effects 20 years ago.\n\nI could see a lot of people getting into this.

I would only recommend this game to someone who has an appreciation for concept, mood, and other art aspects of games.\n\nThe Fall has a great atmosphere. The story and transitions help to draw you into a derelict, distopian world. The voice acting is well done.\n\nGameplay is mediocre. This game would be ok for casual gamers. Controls are moderately clunky (I used an xbox controller). Gameplay involves looking around rooms to find clues and items to interact with. It is not always clear what to do next, or how to solve the puzzle. Some of the steps required to complete puzzles are rather arbitrary. There are also some interspersed combat sequences. These are fun, but 80% of the fights are not challenging at all, thanks to the cloaking device, which allows you to go untargetable.\n\nThe game seriously lacks content. I beat the game in just over 4 hours. (I bet I could do a speedrun in less than half that time.) The Fall should be called "The Fall: Chapter 1". The story, which is so captivating and expertly told, will leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied. Additionally, there is almost no replay-value. The game mechanics give you the illusion of choice and customization with arbitrary dialogue options and "upgrades" that, instead of being used to offer a variety of experiences, only serve to keep the game linear (similar to Tomb Raider 6). So you're basically paying $?.?? for a game you're going to play once for 4 hours. Worth it? You decide. However, what little content they have is decently well done, and supposedly, The Fall 2 is currently under development. If you like a good story and have a little disposable income, go ahead and get it.\n\n49/100\nI would only recommend this game to someone who has an appreciation for concept, mood, and other art aspects of games.\n\n-2015","June 22, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The pilot is unconscious and have no will and direct control over the game at all. The primary suit function is to save pilot, but most of our abilities are restricted and cannot be accesed without permission from an authorised living being, but we need access to these functions in orded to save our pilot, therefoe suit searches for ways to bypass restrictions, one of them is to create a situation where one particular function can save our pilot from present danger, so the lock mechanism gives us access to it without an order from authorized human being. Therefore - so far I have nearly killed my pilot two times (whom I'm trying to save, btw) so I can have acces to some of the functions. At the end of these events the suits AI (it has a personality of sort) recommended its own destruction upon returning to the bay station, for putting it's own pilot in mortal danger.\nThe gem of this game is that only characters who we meet are robots and AI and they correspond respectively. We have met another suit, but it's pilot was dead, so our suit plainly stated that it serves no function and therefoe is going to be salvaged in order to prevent our pilots death. The suit answered as a machine would - logically and acceptably. You really sit before your monitor and see the difference between AI and human logic. It's magnificent.\nThe graphics are nice, controls are a little strange. It is a point and click quest. Yes. It is. But you don't click - you point your gun and can access whatever you're pointing at thru network or such. Basically, you don't click on a door to open it, you threat it with your gun and demand access. No, It's a joke, but you do point your gun at everything.\nI would reccomend this game. It is pretty short, about three hours for the first playtrough. But the plot is good (I really enjoyed it) and it's fun to solve puzzles! There're going to be the second and third parts, but they're irrelevant. This game is self dependand and can count as a complete expierence. I'm serious.

The game type is basically a mixture of platformer and action adventure. You take control of the artificial intelligence of a mark-7 A.R.I.D. (armoured robotic interface device), i.e. a combat suite that supports the pilot inside. After crashing into a planet the pilot of your A.I. does not respond and internal sensors fail to report life signs. So you set out and hurry to find a medical facility to prevent the possibly imminent death of the pilot in accordance with your three prime directives - variants of Asimov's laws.\n\n+ Okay graphics and effects\n+ Well-set atmosphere\n+ Good voice-acting\n+ Mostly good controls (with game controller)\n0 Items are sometimes available on a need-to-use basis\n0 Only auto-save\n- Not completely voiced\n- Unreliable jumping and taking cover\n- Inconsistent use of roll-over in menus and no auto-move\n- Wonky mouse controls\n- Two bugged Steam achievements\n- Some graphical glitches and bugs\n- Continuity error\n\nHint: It seemed to me like riding elevators usually saved progress.\nHint: Be merciful. The Merciful achievement may be bugged, see spoiler for decision-based achievement below.\n\nThe game has okay graphics and succeeds in producing a dramatic atmosphere, although the game wants to be really dark. The voice-acting is very well done with nice protocol-like vernacular, think Seven of Nine. Unfortunately not everything is voiced.\n\nThe controls work pretty well when using a game controller. When using the mouse I simply cannot get a good feel for how aiming is supposed to work and aiming is an integral part of the controls, not only for fighting but also for exploring your environment. I discourage the use of keyboard and mouse.\nI'm in two minds about separating fighting and exploration mode.\nHint: Exploration sometimes works on a need-to-use basis, i.e. some interaction points appear or are usable only after you learned something beforehand. (That reminds me, there is a networking wire ARID cannot network with - must be some proprietary standard.)\nJumping and taking cover feel unreliable at times but are good enough for their respective percentages of gameplay. Unfortunately, jumping is required for one fight, i.e. when fighting the Caretaker at the end of the game and it's bad and glitchy but that fight is easy enough on the whole.\n\nFor some reason menu controls are inconsistent. There are menus that have and menus that have not\n* roll-over, i.e. go from top item to bottom item or vice-versa,\n* positional memory, i.e. coming back from a sub-menu the cursor is set to that sub-menu's selector.\nAdditionally holding a directional button doesn't auto-move through the menu items, instead you have to press directions multiple times, e.g. move the left directional stick on the controller to its centre position, then down and repeat.\n\nOne of the Steam achievement is almost impossible to guess and the player could make use of manual saving and loading here but there is only auto-save. Military Machine requires you to dispose of a specific set of enemies, i.e. those directly following the first electrified robot, in very fast succession - hard to guess requirements. The flavour text made me think maybe I had to dispose of a number of enemies without getting hurt or something and there is no indication that you missed the achievement other than the end of the game. I referred to the guide by TheFourteen.\nAnother achievements was bugged for me. You're supposed to get Diag-Gnostic after collecting all Logs. I got the right "aquarium log" before the left one and with only the left one remaining uncollected. I was immediately awarded the achievement.\nAnother, decision-based, achievement is rumoured to be buggy. Face-Off and Merciful are awarded depending on whether you depurpose the Caretaker. Apparently, getting Face-Off first may bug Merciful so you cannot get it later on.\n\nThere are some minor problems bugging me. At some point ARID\n* hovered some way above the floor,\n* spasmed out when being shot at, contorting in painful ways,\n* had her(?) arms stretched out in front but no gun showing.\n* was stuck in-place and in a walk-cycle after the Mainframe A.I. fries a droid to free its bay and I interacted with the bay. Actually all buttons were disregarded and I couldn't get to the game menu, so I had to kill the game.\nI encountered a bug with the lab tag. After getting it on the Civic level I was killed by one of the last two enemies on the way to the tag reader. After reloading ARID doesn't have the lab tag but it's also not where you get it in the first place.\nThere is a continuity error where you make a lamp dangle in the Grocery Store but later from Observation the lamp is back in it's original position. Also you cannot jump down to the store from there. Makes me think, those are actually two separate representations of the rooms.\n\nAnyway, I really liked the atmosphere and A.I.-themed setting and thus enjoyed the game very much. The feature I was missing most was manual saving and loading.\n\nI recommend The Fall and I'm looking forward to the next episode.","April 17, 2015","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's mostly a point-and-click adventure of finding the right items to use, as well as thinking of inventive ways of using the environment around you; interspersed with 1D combat (in the sense that verticality is not used) that doesn't really do a lot for the gameplay except break up the action.\n\nThe exploration and puzzle-solving breaks down a bit at times (which can translate to: I used a guide) due to the need to, say, closely analyze and then shoot a tiny bit of the dark unseemly corner of a room to find a key item to progress; or, the presence of a Network interaction that is almost never used, and is then critical when it finally is used.\n\nBUT, there's some redeeming qualities. When the adventure/item-using stuff works, it works well. Some of the "merit badge" sequence of the game involves some really funny solutions to problems; and for the most part, the game's problem solutions make sense.\n\nAnd as others have mentioned, the dialogue and writing in the game is really well-done. Dialogue at first appears a bit of a side-play to the main exploration tasks since primary characters are just robots. Then there's some people where you get interesting back-and-forths. You meet a mainframe who, as he's evolved, started talking completely like a human. Over time even Arid comes to change a bit; there's a chilling point late in the game where an early line, her opening greeting, ("I am the A.R.I.D. on-board a Mark-7 Combat Suit. My intentions are peaceful.") is re-delivered with very different voice acting.\n\nThe ending was definitely both very satisfying, and made me want to play the sequel if/when it comes out.","May 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And, if you can get it on sale, it might be worth it. It has a good atmosphere, the voice acting is great, and the idea of the game is fantastic.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is derivative and not particularly great: it uses a cover system for fighting (poorly, in my opinion, since getting into cover doesn't always work well, and you have optic camo, so cover is pointless), the puzzles are interesting but nothing more than "use item A on location B after activating flag C", and much of the time puzzle solving is spent trying to figure out which puzzle you're allowed to solve now.\n\nThe story, often said to be it's strongest point, is interesting, but not particularly original or groudbreaking. It's a better (completely linear) story than most video games, but so are most books, movies, and television shows, and a great number can be gotten at a much better value than The Fall. It does have some very clever moments, but it ends with the traditional twist, shock!, instant ending, cliffhanger, "to be continued..." that plague so many other "story-driven" video games, whether indie or AAA.\n\nWas it worth it? I got it on sale, so I'm not particularly upset. Will I buy the sequel? Probably, but mostly because I saw real potential in the developer; this game, on it's own, isn't really worth it to me. But, I do believe, if he can make a really good story (not a good setting or good characters, but a good story), it would be worth my time. The Fall, though? Go play The Swapper instead; it does almost everything this one does, but much, much better.","June 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat is no better; once you figure out where to angle your gun, then it becomes ridiculously easy.\nThe story itself, though, is well done. It explores the behaviour of robots relative to their programming, the nature of rules, and has a few good twists along the way.\nGraphics are decent enough. Moving on.\nAudio? The voice acting is very good. The music however, is easy to forget.

Tons of reviews said how awesome the story and overall game was so I was trusting of that.\n\nUp-front summary: If I would have paid more than $2 for this then I would have been quite disappointed.\n\nPro's:\n-Dark environment was kinda cool and different.\n-Mystery and story AT FIRST kept me intrigued.\n-Compassion of ARID made you begin to like her character.\n-Hiding behind cover was cool for gun fights but became ultimately useless very quickly when you get to cloak yourself anywhere at any time.\n\nCons:\n-Super annoying control interface for interacting with things. Maybe on a game pad this would be slightly better? I was on keyboard and mouse.\n-The lame tests you had to get past just to get to the "meat" of the story were dumb. Most were very straight forward, and a couple were so freaking weird or abstract it didn't make any logical sense at all. But you only have a few items in your inventory so you tend to just click on each option for anything that you can interact with.\n-Boss was super easy and straight forward to figure out. Anyone who has played a few games can get it in their first pass.\n-Messages on the walls and such were overall completely pointless and didnt do much for the story in my opinion. A couple gave some obvious hints, so once again... useless.\n-No real need to play through more than once. I am uninstalling as soon as I finish this.\n\n\nConclusion: There are tons of other games better spent "wasting" time on that would be MORE entertaining and would have a better story with better gameplay.\nI really wouldn't bother with this one.

And, if you can get it on sale, it might be worth it. It has a good atmosphere, the voice acting is great, and the idea of the game is fantastic.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is derivative and not particularly great: it uses a cover system for fighting (poorly, in my opinion, since getting into cover doesn't always work well, and you have optic camo, so cover is pointless), the puzzles are interesting but nothing more than "use item A on location B after activating flag C", and much of the time puzzle solving is spent trying to figure out which puzzle you're allowed to solve now.\n\nThe story, often said to be it's strongest point, is interesting, but not particularly original or groudbreaking. It's a better (completely linear) story than most video games, but so are most books, movies, and television shows, and a great number can be gotten at a much better value than The Fall. It does have some very clever moments, but it ends with the traditional twist, shock!, instant ending, cliffhanger, "to be continued..." that plague so many other "story-driven" video games, whether indie or AAA.\n\nWas it worth it? I got it on sale, so I'm not particularly upset. Will I buy the sequel? Probably, but mostly because I saw real potential in the developer; this game, on it's own, isn't really worth it to me. But, I do believe, if he can make a really good story (not a good setting or good characters, but a good story), it would be worth my time. The Fall, though? Go play The Swapper instead; it does almost everything this one does, but much, much better.","June 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of the gameplay revolves around trying to find a single item somewhere on the floor, and then combining it with another item halfway across the map. The combat is no better; once you figure out where to angle your gun, then it becomes ridiculously easy.\nThe story itself, though, is well done. It explores the behaviour of robots relative to their programming, the nature of rules, and has a few good twists along the way.\nGraphics are decent enough. Moving on.\nAudio? The voice acting is very good. The music however, is easy to forget. The ambient sounds are nicely done though.\n\nAll in all, would be better as a short film.","June 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, as seems typical of many P&C Adventure Games, some of the puzzles were rather unintuitive, relying more on finding the hidden 'easter egg' that will give you the item/interaction you need to hammer through. I had to use an online guide only twice. Which, I guess isn't bad...?\n\nMy only major complaint is the length of the game and the cliffhanger they leave you on! OMG WHY!?!  >_< However, I'm willing to overlook it's shortness because it's a crowdsourced indie game and they've promised 2 more episodes.\n\nIt bears repeating: the story is SO worthwhile and thought provoking.

Many of the tasks and intermediate goals (including the combat) are not only difficult to complete due to arbitrary object/action associations, but also seem completely unrelated to the main objective.  This makes the game disjointed due to seemingly random tangents and it quickly starts to feel more like work than something intended to entertain.\n\nAlthough the heart of a good story exists somewhere in here, I honestly cannot recommend this game (even on sale) since the frustration and boredom greatly outweigh the fun.","December 17, 2014","false","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, considering how little I paid for it and how much the quality reminded me of, say, TellTale's work (Sam & Max, Tales of Monkey Island, etc), I'm willing to endorse this game. The graphics are timelessly beautiful without being mind-blowing or machine-breaking, the story proves to be both coherent and entertaining, and the gameplay is wonderfully simple.\n\nThe Fall is an adventure game with action elements. You'll fight robots from time to time, but you'll spend most of your time completing puzzles. Some of the puzzles suffer from unintuitive solutions, but the puzzle system within the game helps to reduce the confusion. Magnifying-glass icons revealed by your flashlight give clues and provide locations agianst which to test whatever items are in you inventory.You can't even see your inventory unless your examining a magnifying-glass icon, so there's no need to try and click on everything you see. It's true that there is no good hint system for when you get stuck, but there's already a good guide/walkthrough available in the guides section of the community if needed.\n\nMy only complaints stem from the short length (there's no mention anywhere on the store page that this is basicly "The Fall part 1") and the illusion of choice that appears within the game. Specifically, there was one sequience that attempted to force you to heavily consider the cost of a certain power drain, to the extent that it left me wondering if there was another option. However, to the best of my knowledge there was no other option, and the game's prompting or implying otherwise was merely a Spec Ops The Line style "your a terrible person for doing this" moment. I'm fine with playing the bad guy, but the extent to which The Fall goes to to encourage the idea of a second choice is enough for me to wonder if the developers were just too lazy to fit the game together correctly, or if they just left something out.\n\nOverall, The Fall is fun, but don't rush to buy it if you're hoping for a real ending (not a "to be continued").","August 10, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Although the atmosphere felt unique and the story was interesting, I couldn't get into this game. The game reminded me a lot of old school point and click adventure titles. Although a lot of people enjoy those types of games, I never got into them being that I wasn't a PC gamer back in the games of DOS and other early OS's. From my perspective, it's an annoying hassle to have to check every thing out, go back, check everything out again, etc. However, if you were a fan of Space Quest and games like it, this game would most likely be up your alley.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game probably stems from the control scheme. I find movement and adventuring tedious while using the mouse and keyboard. However, when inserting a controller like an XBox 360 one, shooting and combat become annoying. This all adds up when you can't use both control schemes at the same time.\n\nMy review of this game boils down to the fact that it isn't my type of game and the control scheme is horid. If you like old school adventure titles, this game could easily be something you enjoy if you get past the controls.","June 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reveng/recommended/290770/","reveng","RevEng","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reveng/","285 products in account","I first tried playing this game two months ago. After a terrible experience, I gave up. I just recently tried it again and completed it, and though I have several issues with it, there is something in it worth liking.\n\n\n*Spoiler alert: the following discussion contains spoilers*\n\n\nOn my first experience with this game, my only thought was: this game is completely broken.\n\nFirst I couldn't adjust the brightness in the main menu; I could hear it making sounds when I pressed up and down, but nothing happened. I continued into the game, but couldn't move. It mentioned using the Right Stick and I thought, "Oh, I need a gamepad to play?"\n\nI started over with a gamepad and things worked. Lucky I had one; they didn't say I needed one. With gamepad in hand, I could barely point my flashlight. Between up and right, there were maybe 5 degrees of angle that map to something in between, so pointing anywhere other than the four cardinal directions was finicky and frustrating, and yet it's something I had to do constantly. At least I could move on.\n\n30 minutes later, I couldn't pass the first level. So far the whole thing was like an old school adventure game, where you have to point at the one pixel that matters and pickup the random object to use on some other arbitrary thing to continue. No choices, no freedom; keep combining everything with everything else until the game accepts something and allows you to continue. Apparently I missed the "metal pan" at first, which wasn't indicated at all in the description of the pile of junk, and even when I "interacted" with it, it didn't even tell me what happened!\n\nThen went into the room with the other suit, I successfully finished it, and it seemed my controls were dead. I restarted the game and it hadn't saved my progress at that point. Seriously? Why didn't it save after I picked up an essential item to continue the story, or for that matter when I completed an important event?\n\nI decided to try the game again a couple of months later. This time my keyboard and mouse did work, even right from the beginning. Apparently this was fixed in a patch, as Cheeseness mentioned in the comments. Unfortunately, the brightness control still didn't operate properly; it made noises when I pressed up and down, but the brightness did not change. Thankfully, I didn't really need to adjust this anyway.\n\nI started again from the beginning. I went back to where the "old metal pan" was. Examining the pile of trash did not say anything; it only showed that it was interactable. I interacted with it and it said nothing. However, if I try to interact with other things, I now have the option to use the pan. I have not seen any description text. Am I missing something? Despite what others have said, I still think there is a bug here, and it was enough to keep me from progressing through the game. In a linear point-and-click adventure, that's a game-breaker.\n\nAiming with the mouse works much better than it did with the controller. It's a shame I have to hold right-click the whole time -- it's a very awkward way to use a mouse -- but at least it's functional.\n\nThis time I did figure out how to get out of the room. This is where controls matter. I didn't see the thing I could interact with because I could barely point with the controller. I had enabled the networking, as Cheeseness suggested, but I had failed to find the interaction point with which I had to network. Trying again with a keyboard and mouse, I didn't have much trouble finding this interaction point and I was able to continue.\n\nAfter getting stuck again while trying to follow the animal to the lower level, I finally decided to look up a walkthrough. Sure enough, I was missing something; there is a delay on the elevator, so you can activate and get off before it starts to move. I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and say I overlooked this, but that's exactly the sort of non-obvious logic that I dislike about many adventure games.\n\nAfter getting past all of this, the game actually gets considerably better, though still not without its flaws. It's still very much like an old school point-and-click adventure, where you have to collect random items that interact with other random items, with a small amount of action involved. I found both of these elements lacking. I had to make reference to a walkthrough on several occassions, and when I did, I realized that I had either missed something that was difficult to see, or the logic was so obscure that it never would have occurred to me. Granted, I don't particularly enjoy these sort of adventure game puzzles, but I found several of the puzzles obtuse even compared to some infamous examples, like Police Quest and Space Quest.\n\nThe action sequences also felt stinted. They had a good atmosphere and flow, but the combat itself was annoying. The solution to every encounter was to lie in waiting until you determined their pattern, then strike when they were sitting idle. At worst, you'd end up with two enemies at once and the timing would be more finicky. Also, making contact and doing damage was erratic. There was no more clear example of this than the end sequence.\n\nDuring the final fight, I regularly shot through the caretaker without doing damage and he could hit me while I was cloaked, though I couldn't do the same to him. It was also frustrating that he could just get away any time I injured him. Sure, I eventually realized you could prevent him from recharging, but it wasn't obvious, especially since I was too concerned with trying to stay alive -- something I soon came to realize didn't matter, as I don't think it was ever possible to lose.\n\nI was also really disappointed by the ending. While it was an interesting twist, it felt very sudden and jarring, and the "to be continued" ending was really disappointing. I don't remember hearing anything about this being episodic when I backed it on Kickstarter, and now I feel like I only received part of that in which I invested. Will there be another episode? Will I get that too? I don't know. It has left a bitter feeling at the end of an otherwise interesting story.\n\nWhat "The Fall" does have that is enjoyable are some interesting characters and an intricate plot. The theme and atmosphere are prevalent throughout the game. It doesn't always work well (e.g. the all-text interface and the disk clicking sounds don't make much sense combined with a highly-aware, far-futuristic AI), but it works well for the most part. It reminds me a lot of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas with it's combination of interesting characters, dark atmosphere, and mix of new and low tech.  It had me interested enough to continue on in spite of the bugs and annoying puzzles.\n\nOverall, my opinion is that it has a great story, but it's marred by bugs and the weakness of the puzzle and action aspects. I'm still surprised that the beginning of the game felt so awkward compared to how smoothly the rest of it flows -- especially since that nearly kept me from continuing on to see the rest. It just goes to show that something is only as good as its weakest part, and where this game has a great story and characters, the other elements of the game kept me from fully enjoying that story.\n\nI'm still keeping my negative recommendation on this. I don't think most people would enjoy this. If you do, great, and I hope Over The Moon does more work in the future and improves on what they started here. But I'm not one of the 80% on Metacritic that thought this was a great game. There are too many flaws interfering with an otherwise interesting concept and well-developed story.","May 30, 2014","false","4.8"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","5"

Some of the issues I had at first have been fixed like the micro wrench not working but still has no context indicator for the mind hack on the crane when you first meet the other robot.\n\nOn to a review of the game itself and why I still cannot recommend it.\n1.	Combat is boring, AI is simplistic and repetitive only doing the same thing ever time causing me to only take damage when I’m bored and want to move on taking dumb risks.\n2.	This game is a point-and-click game. Puzzles are the main bulk of the gameplay however the puzzles are awful, make no sense, and are far too difficult.\n\nA couple of examples are you quickly find a way into an area where you have to do tests that are designed for a domestic robot not a combat suit like you.  Kind of funny at first but then you start in the area.  One of the tasks you have to complete is dusting in an area beyond filthy. The solution you just have to find the bag and place it over the sensor.  While this would work the bag is hidden by the door you never see the actual bag while walking about so never would I ever think that would be a solution I found by doing what I do in other point-and-clicks which is to just find everything and try ever option not even caring about the story or events.\n\nThe point in which I gave up at this point was trying to deal with the baby.  This task is far too difficult as I have done everything even following the tips from the developer themselves on the community page and still haven’t been able to find the solution.  While some games are challenging and regarded highly it is because they are also satisfying.  This game is way too difficult in the obtuse and random solutions to the puzzles and is not satisfying when all I have to look forward to is another ridicules series of task which cause me to loss all interest that the story at first had created for me.\n\nI have heard that the game is also short and supposed to be episodic about that I don’t know as I give up on even finishing this game which is a genuine waste of potential of the initial story I have seen with badly designed puzzles that even with developers tips can’t help with.\n","June 1, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

This game is disguised as a platformer/combat exploration game. but its just puzzles,and boring ones. the worst one being i had to meet requiments,performing a test in order to pass certification for security that was not allowing me to enter a new area.  Guess what the test was...a puzzle. Guess what it requires..cleaning a house. Dusting,picking up trash,baby siting. OH My God WTF? This is a game? And the worst part being the puzzles are not clear. I found a vase,had to make the house look all nice like a happy home. I found flowers,so flowers go inside a vase,right? Well I didn't pass the test,game says the wrong colored flowers are in the vase,not a happy looking home. Run around all over,there are no other flowers,so in short I'[m stuck. geeeeee,nice puzzle there. I wish I had the 4 bucks I wasted on this back. warning,don't buy this game. Go mowe your lawn,go out and buy the right colored flowers to make a happy home,just don't play this torturing piece of trash.  And don't let the graphcs lure you. YouTube to see how this plays,its not good! Final Judgement 2/10. The 2 points for graphics and that it uses a 360/X1 pad. Thats it!

Within minutes it had degenerated into trying all of the available actions on all of the question marks I could find which is not a good sign. The puzzles just don't yield that eureka moment that makes adventure games worthwhile, its a fight against the game.\nWith the help of some guides I was able to overcome the bad design and managed to get my gun to find the shooting has about a 2 second delay (sometimes?) but not for the enemies and the cover system was pretty bad which just made stuff worse. The menus are similarly clunky, taking seconds to open and switch between while they emulate an old computer display. Clunky really describes this game.\n\nThe game is an unruly combination of things that just don't mix well. The plot seemed interesting though.","October 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 13 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","13","0","0"

But it's too short (just 3 to 4 hours total).\n\nI got this game for Christmas, so I checked it out even though I didn't expect much beforehand. I was quickly hooked by the fascinating premise that starts off the storyline: An unknown soldier crash-lands on an unknown (but sinister) planet for unknown reasons, and is left unconscious and likely heavily injured. So the emergency on-board AI of the soldier's futuristic combat suit activates, programmed with the mission to try and save the life of "its human". You, the player, take on the role of this AI...\nIn order to find out where you are, what happened, and how to get your human to medical treatment, you'll have to overcome both your own pre-programmed limitations and the obstacles imposed by the dystopian environment and by other machines who are stubbornly following their own programming. You'll have to act in the face of insufficient data and moral dilemmas, and figure out whether to "follow protocol" may require you to bend or even break it...\n\nA cool concept would not stand on its own; Luckily, this game has a really well executed atmosphere - both visuals and voice-acting are very polished for an Indie game.\n\nMost of the core gameplay consists of aim'n'click puzzles. Even though I usually find point'n'click style games off-putting, I had no trouble getting into the gameplay here, probably because:\n\nThe player manually controls the protagonist's movement (and flashlight/gun aim) through an interactive environment (which feels much more immersive than traditional games of the genre, where you point & click at things on a static background without really feeling part of it).\nThe integrated "side-scrolling shooter" elements add some diversion and a permanent sense of danger.\nThe puzzles tend to be things that make sense for the character to do as part of the storyline (rather than just arbitrarily tacked on), and some were even used as set-ups for later revealed "character developments", which felt pretty satisfying. However, the difficulty was a little uneven - some puzzles were no-brainers, while other seemed unreasonably hard to figure out.\n\nThe "side-scrolling shooter" gameplay parts are too easy for my taste, despite the fact that some of the controls there felt a little clunky/unreliable. Since it's not the main game mechanic, that's fine though.\n\nAll in all I feel very positive about the game, except for one big downside: It is short and unconcluded. When I was getting close to the end after 3 to 4 hours, it felt like the end of a prologue or "chapter 1" would feel in a game of traditional size, and I was pretty disappointed when instead of transitioning to the next chapter, it showed "To be continued..." and rolled the credits - with the storyline wide open and many questions unanswered.\nI suppose splitting game releases into separate single-chapter titles is a reaction to the fact that many gamers are no longer willing to spend more than a few bucks per title, but Steam should at least be honest about it when a title is merely a first chapter rather than a full game in the traditional sense. Also, games like Aquaria are proof that even tiny Indie dev teams can create big game worlds, so I don't think we should accept "Indie" as an excuse for unreasonable brevity.","January 1, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dark, atmospheric world with puzzles and a couple situations I found humorous and others I found awfully dark. There's some bare minimal decision making to be done, mostly paragon/renegade situations, though they have no bearing from what I can tell on the outcome, simply on what achievement you get.\nControls are very nice, rebindable, and such. A.R.I.D. undergoes a bit of character development. The writing is very lovely as  well as the few voice actors there are.\nAgain, the only issue I have with this is that this is a Part 1 of a 3 part game. Only kickstarters would get all 3 episodes when they're released. I just don't think $10 justifies a 3 hour experience, and if the others are released and have to be bought seperatly, it would make me cringe.\n\nIt's a great, great game for the short time you have to play it.

Instead, I'll talk about the rest of it so far as January 2015.\n\nThis game is thankfully uncomplicated in its control scheme and gameplay mechanics, and the atmosphere of it is seriously tense and dramatic - perfect for dystopia effectionadoes.  The game is quite reliant on problem solving, and many of the methods for dealing with situations have results that seem a little unorthodox - which, while fitting the theme and story very well, can leave one rather frustrated.\n\nHowever, for those of us who don't want to miss out on the rest of the story because of one little puzzle, there's thankfully a number of walkthroughs out there that can help you.  Alternatively, since there isn't much that directly hinges on doing things in a set order (that I know of anyway), the tactic of brute-force use-everything-with-everything and do-everything-again-just-to-see-what-happens thing can work.\n\nThe combat system is fairly decent too, and while currently lacking in variety, due to the relatively low health and shields of your character it can be rather intense.  Also, quite fortunately, there are frequent saving points before combat situations so that if you die, you won't be too far behind.\n\nAll in all, I like this game and I recommend it to anybody who's got a bit of time up their sleeves and an itching for a gritty and dark puzzle game.","January 6, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabelhigh/recommended/290770/","cabelhigh","Cabelhigh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabelhigh/","138 products in account","I bought this game after listening to Giant Bomb's Game of the Year podcasts, where they named it Best Story and soundly spoiled a twist or two, so I went in with expectations. And, to be honest, neither the storytelling nor the story lived up to their high praise.\n\nIt starts off really, really good. The first 30 minutes *is* outstanding: mysterious, menacing, brilliantly told and stunningly visualized. If there's one thing this game nails it's robots talking to other robots, and it offers perhaps the best representation of robot 'culture' (if there is such a thing) in sci-fi that I've seen. The world is weird, the characters are weirder, and the atmosphere is thick throughout.\n\nBut then you run into the puzzles. I'm not an adventure gaming veteran or anything like that - I've played a few in my time - but the puzzles in The Fall are *so* obscure, *so* out-of-left-field and backtrack-y that it immediatly halts any momentum or goodwill the game conjures up in the first 30 minutes, deciding instead to take a hour long detour into pure puzzle-solving that feels like fluff to a game that's already achingly short (my steam time is 2 hours). Here, the story not so much evolves as mutates, getting sidetracked from the initial danger and wonder of that first half-hour. It continues to explore some interesting philosophical approaches to robots (though not particularly unheard of ones), but starts loosing its footing quickly.\n\nThe ending is a little stronger, buoyed by more directive and a brutal ending, but too many of the motivations behind characters are left unclear and combat - while unobtrusive but never exceptional in the earlier parts of the game - starts to become an annoying crutch. Since you are so fragile and your combat options are so limited, throwing more enemies than you can handle coupled with bad controls was incredibly frustrating in the final 20-stretch. By the time the game reached its climactic confrontation, I just wanted it to be done.\n\nLuckily, about five minutes later it was. Both a blessing and a curse, The Fall's 2 hour run-time gives it a pleasant short-stort feel while still leaving questions open for the next two chapters. However, it's too short to give one character in particular much interesting motivation, which isn't great because there are only three in the entire game. The story itself is...unexceptional, though, for the most part, well told. The main character, A.R.I.D., and a friendly (or is it?) computer AI she meets along the way are both well voiced and written, and the world they inhabit is always fun to explore, if not being the most fleshed-out. Some character beats, however, fall totally flat - mainly one weird 'morality' choice near the end comes out of nowhere and means next-to-nothing.\n\nDid listening to the Game of the Year stuff bias me against this game? Maybe. Probably. But in a year where we had good, emotional storytelling it The Wolf Among Us and This War of Mine, The Fall barely holds a candle to the rest. It didn't hit me as particularly better than other indie-sci-fi games (if you want a great one, go buy The Swapper). Overall, it just didn't feel that special. It never could live up to those first 30 minutes.\n\n\n","January 6, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound and visuals are modest, as expected from an indie offering, but they unobtrusevely contribute to the game's eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere. It is a small game that tells a big, ambitious story and it does so incredibly well. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the experience. But suffice to say, the treatment of AI as a subject here could rival Asimov's.\n\nThat said, it isn't perfect. The controls are pretty cumbersome-- you spend 90% of the time holding down the right mouse button so that you can look at/interact with/shoot at your surroundings. Turning the character around demands a sort of randomly jiggling the mouse in the intended direction. You have to be positioned just right to take cover during combat, so I died more than I felt I deserved. And I'm a pretty self-effacing kind of guy.\n\nClocking in at 3 hours of gameplay, "The Fall" is the introductory installment of what the developer envisions as a series. This may make it seem like it isn't worth the price tag to some people. But it's so good, you guys. And frankly, I really want to see what happens next. And you will, too, if you play "The Fall." And if another $9.99 (or whatever) brings the next episode closer to becoming a reality, then I can't offer anything except an enthusiastic recommendation.","February 5, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A notable plot/game mechanic is that many of ARID's abilities are locked behind logic gates that require you to subvert her own directives in order to fulfill her ultimate goal (Prime Directive) of saving her unconscious and in critical condition's pilot life. This leads to a rather ominous progression that was enjoyable to watch as she moves about a bleak and ruined world that I want to learn more about.\n\nThis is a short game, only about 3 hours long as its only the first episode, however I very much look forward to seeing how this story will end.","January 12, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lauriffic/recommended/290770/","lauriffic","knifu waifu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lauriffic/","227 products in account","Toward the beginning of January I was listening to the Giant Bomb year-end awards podcasts, and they mentioned some stuff about The Fall that made it sound appealing. Also, it was on the Steam sale for some absurdly cheap amount. So I bought it, and then actually played it. Gasp. Here are some thoughts.\n\nThe story pretty much immediately had me sold, because I love sci-fi and I love sci-fi about artificial intelligences even more. Excession is my favorite Culture book. Ship Minds are the best and I love Gray Matter forever. The Fall puts you in charge of a suit whose AI is given the task of finding medical assistance for the nonresponsive human inside the suit. The game combines elements of a point-and-click adventure game with sidescrolling movement and combat schemes. I was skeptical about this, but they mesh together fairly smoothly.\n\nAs ARID, the AI in the suit, you must follow your operating parameters while you look for help for your human. However, circumstances occasionally dictate their circumvention for optimal performance. The Fall is the story of how an artificial intelligence rationalizes its actions. With no human to turn to for guidance, ARID must make frequent value judgments and do things that perhaps no AI should - but as long as it’s to save the pilot of the suit, the ends justify the means.\n\nThe psychology of The Fall isn’t advanced by any means - it’s very Psych 101. But it’s fun to see it applied to artificial intelligences, and the concepts mesh with the story and gameplay seamlessly. My first play-through felt pretty mind-blowing, but going back through the game a second time it was easier to suss out the basic concepts and allegory underlying the game’s framework. Still, the first play-through is what counts.\n\nSome lists (people love lists, I hear):\n\nPros:\n\nStory/gameplay interaction - certain story elements actually inform the gameplay (or is it the other way around?). Always fun to feel like the story and gameplay are working in harness rather than tripping each other up.\nStory conceits are integrated naturally - the dialogue has a lot to do with this, I think. The concepts that come up feel like they are occurring as a natural result of the things that are happening in the story and not because someone wanted to shoehorn some “deep” stuff into the game.\nVoice acting - I am not a huge fan of VA in general, but the artists in this game do a FANTASTIC job. In particular I want to single out ARID’s voice, which starts very robotically and gradually reflects more and more looseness as the subversion of its protocols continues throughout the game. But really, all the voices are great. Num num num.\nMY IMMERSION - I played with headphones on which helped, but the visuals and sound are very atmospheric and engaging. It’s definitely a game that sucks you in.\n\nCons:\n\nTypical adventure game frustrations - everyone has these, right? Once you solve the puzzle you look back at it and think, how did I ever miss that? but while you’re unable to figure it out, you feel like you’re bashing your head into a rock. The Fall has blessedly few of these moments, but they’re still there.\nBack-tracking - at a certain point in the story the game world opens up quite a bit, and it can be frustrating to try to figure out where you’re supposed to go next, which can result in a lot of running back to an area to see if there’s something you missed, or if something changed. It’s a common thing in adventure games especially, but my roommate in particular had a big problem with it.\nCombat issues - surprisingly few of these as well, but there are a few hiccups: between myself and my roommate we found a few places where you could get stuck on the environment in odd ways (while taking cover), and sometimes the enemies respawn in a frustrating fashion if you move away from their areas and back into them again. Fortunately there aren’t many combat situations in the game, so these gripes are pretty minor.\n\nThe Fall isn’t a game you can sink dozens of hours in. My first play-through took about three hours and a subsequent second run-through took one hour. The length is nice, though, because the game is so immersive that it’s really best if you finish it in one sitting. Currently it’s on Steam for ten bucks, which isn’t bad for three hours of amusement. When you finish, you can make your friends play it! Snicker under your breath as they get stuck on puzzles you solved effortlessly! Curse their names as they solve all the puzzles that frustrated you! It’s fun for the whole family!\n\nFor real, though, if you like adventure games, or sci-fi games, or games about artificial intelligences and psychology, you should pick this up. And if it’s on sale pick it up anyway and give it a shot.","January 19, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play A.R.I.D. - a dedicated tech suit AI trying to save its unresponsive human pilot inside.  The game is very short but sweet, featuring evocative science fiction A.I. philosophy and atmosphere.  I literally beat this twice in less than 3 hours (not including pause breaks).

It provides an excellent and interesting look at the familiar science fiction questions. Such as "What does it mean to be self-aware?"  and "What is the difference between and A.I and a human?". The gameplay although is simple and consists of puzzles and gunfights. The puzzles involves finding items and correctily determining when and how to use them with little hints and advice beyond the logic of the situation. The gunfights involves simple duck and pop out to shoot mechanics. The story however is the heart of this game. Throughout it the characters and the well voiced dialogue pulls you along and never lets up. You hear and feel the growing personal awarness of the main character (an AI). I finished the game in one sit down but it was a memorable 3 hours. When i finished i leaned back on my chair and thought more about themes and ideas presented in this wonderful story.\n\nI recommend the game if you want an interactive and decent science fiction story that plays with familiar tropes and the themes.","November 17, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DEVELOPERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE FINAL TWO PARTS ARE ABOUT A YEAR IN THE FUTURE.\n\nStill probably one of the better point-and-click style adventure games I've played in recent years. I picked it up for five bucks and got my money's worth. However, ten bucks is too much for what is, in the end, an incomplete experience.\n\nControl scheme is interesting but unusual, takes a bit of getting used to. Story and voice acting is excellent. Puzzles are generally logical but requires some pixel searching. Only got stuck on one puzzle requiring the use of a wiki (that stupid crying baby). There are a few moments of "Adventure Game Logic" though.\n\nThe general conceit is that the player takes the role of an Artificial Intelligence. As such, your actions are constrained to your directives. For instance, the player is not allowed to lie in order to solve what should be a trivial puzzle. This does mean that the moments of "railroading" in the story tend to make sense: they are the only action that the player can take given the directives they have.\n\nAbout the only thing that I seriously disliked was the combat. The control scheme is NOT conducive to side-scrolling mouse-and-keyboard gunplay. Given that an early upgrade allows for the player to evade gunfire simply by tapping a button, combat pretty much turns into a tedious stop-and-pop point and click affair. Combined with somewhat floaty controls and narrow, tight corridors, this can make for a frustrating experience.\n\nI generally didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs.\n\nArt style evokes "Limbo," with its side-scrolling black-on-white silhouetted style. Voice acting is well-done and evocative. Writing and characterization is generally solid.","October 30, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game’s puzzles are usually solvable without Walkthrough assistance, but it is not always clear ”why” something worked. Especially around the mid-part, there are some typical examples of Moon Logic with solutions that defy common sense or seem needlessly complicated. The game is short – possible to complete under three hours – for which reason I cannot recommend a purchase for the full price of 10 €. Wait for a steam sale.\n\nStill, I really liked THE FALL so I’m going to recommend it. It has a great feel to it and it generates some interesting food for thought. At its core, THE FALL seems to be a story about an AI (ARID) interacting with other AIs, struggling – however superficially – with questions of raison d’être, behavioural limitations and the relationship between objectives and the means to realise them. These essentially human questions find an intriguing context when presented to beings which are not human, but are forced to behave as such when finding themselves in a dark unforgiving place, cut off from their makers.\n\nIs it perfect?

A.R.I.D, the AI controlling the suit, and her driving motivation to save the man inside, provides an extremely interesting main character that is surprisingly human for being such a convincing artificial intelligence. One of the most interesting aspects of the story is how far an AI should be willing to go to perform its primary function, an example being A.R.I.D breaking several of her protocols in order to indirectly further her cause of protecting the suit's occupant, and her interaction with other AI not so willing to do the same. Overall, the story is very intriguing, with a small but extremely likeable (or, in some cases, frightening) "cast," with some great voice acting and a tremendous cliffhanger.\n\nThe gameplay is also extremely well-done. Light plays a relatively important role, and the flashlight on your gun must be used to reveal clues or enable actions in order to continue. Doing this is the majority of the game, but doesn't feel repetetive, given that the main purpose is exploring, and this is how you explore. The puzzles are very cleverly done, but sometimes /too/ clever, and can take a long time to solve. Also, given that every clue can be interacted with generally and individually with every item in your inventory and you have no idea which one, if any, is the correct solution, after being stuck for a while, I started trying everything with anything that was remotely promising. Obviously this is not intended to be done, so I would recommend trying to avoid it and to think the puzzles through as much as possible, but sometimes the solution can be really obscure. Combat can be intense and difficult, and has been done pretty well. I preferred the smaller fights with a gun that needed a second or two to charge before firing early in the game more than the more frantic fights later on, but it was all good, and the final boss fight was epic!\n\nThe graphics and sound effects are amazing! Graphics are really well done, especially the lighting effects, and the animation is strong as well. It's not perfect, and there are times when one animation visibly skips to another, or you can see outside the map, but these issues are minor and won't hurt the immersion unless you let it. The sound effects and music are well done and spooky, and, especially when using earbuds/earphones, really capture the mood.\n\nBasically, this game is amazing! Short, yes, but there's more to come to finish the fantastic story, which I can't wait for! If you like immersive games, difficult puzzles, an amazing story, and especially AI, you will absolutely love this game. Ten dollars may end up being a bit much if another ten has to be payed for the next two parts as well, but I'm not sure that it will, and even then it's probably worth it. If it's on sale, though, seven dollars or under, don't hesitate to buy it!\n\nTL;DR - Buy it on sale to be joyful.","December 6, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any time a game asks me to press and analogue stick regularly, it becomes a pain, literal hand crap after a few hours. But also with a lack of controller customisation Over The Moon have probably excluded a few gamers with partial disabilities from playing the game that would otherwise really enjoy it.\n3/5","November 2, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like it takes inspiration from Asimov for its Artificial Intelligence based story, and it is certainly written just as well. And the voice acting, simply stunning. I would argue that ARID's performance is at least on par with that of GlaDOS. ARID's development over time made this so compelling.\n\nIt's hard not to spoil this game. But I should also say that it's relatively short, and the gameplay is composed of a modest point and click adventure with clunky combat inbetween. It's appropriate for the atmosphere, but the puzzles ranged from incredibly easy to completely unintuitive with little in between. Nevertheless, I expect the sequel (which is in development, I hear) to improve these elements.\n\nI regret missing the kickstarter, I hope I can contribute in the future, though.","August 25, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tensix/recommended/290770/","tensix","Tensix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tensix/","553 products in account","Contrary to what the trailers (and, at first, the interface) suggested to me, The Fall plays like a point-and-click adventure game. Maybe you're better at watching trailers than I am and interpreted it better, but I was really expecting much more of a Metroidvania than I got. I'm not about to complain, though. The game that The Fall turned out to be was, I think, a much better game than what I was expecting when I bought it. However, I do have to agree with other reviewers on one point: It's pretty short. I beat it in about three and a half hours and I wasn't even particularly bright about it.\n\nYou are A.R.I.D., the artificial intelligence aboard a mark-7 combat suit, activated in order to ensure the survival of your comatose pilot. You run swiftly up against the limits of your own programming, and as many of the game's puzzles involve circumventing internal obstacles as external ones. It sets up an exceptionally well-written narrative as A.R.I.D. interacts with the bizarre underground facility it finds itself in, and the people that live there. Do note on that point that The Fall is the first game of a planned trilogy; the story ends on a maddening cliffhanger with fewer questions answered than not, and I can scarcely contain my anticipation for the second installment.\n\nGameplay sits comfortably between the likes of a point-and-click adventure game and a cerebral, puzzle-heavy platformer; kind of a LucasArts adventure game[en.wikipedia.org] meets Blackthrone. Combat, I'm sorry to say, is nowhere near as interesting as the trailer seems to promise. You're given a handgun with a flashlight which allows you to examine your surroundings, and soon the option to switch to lasersight mode to shoot, though you'll spend a good 80% of the game in flashlight mode. With the exception of one sequence near the end, the shooting parts can typically be solved by strolling forward and aiming loosely for heads; though the cover tutorial section promises otherwise, your foes are largely too few, too far between, and far too inept to be terribly threatening. This is to The Fall's credit, I think. Despite being a combat AI loaded onto a suit of power armour, fighting isn't really what you're doing here.\n\nSpecial mention needs to be given to the dialogue. The writing is outstanding, and the voice acting is some of the best I've heard anywhere, indie game or otherwise. A.R.I.D.'s voice actress is particularly superb, which you might not expect from the flat monotone of the trailers. I can't expound particularly on that point without risk of spoilers, so you'll just have to take my word for it on that one.\n\nTL;DR: If you're into thinky adventure games and don't mind waiting for the other two games, this is well worth picking up now. If you're not patient enough to wait on the plot to resolve itself, wait on it a bit, but absolutely get it later when the other two come out. And if you don't care for story or puzzles, give it a pass. In the interests of disclosure, I picked it up in a Humble Bundle; I didn't want to pay full price for it at the time, but after having played it I'm convinced it would've been worth it.","August 26, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't back this game on Kickstarter, but after playing it I would back a sequel.\n\nThat being said, the game wasn't what I expected it to be. When I first saw it on Steam it was compared it to Dead Space and something else that I can't remember. It resembles Dead Space a little in atmosphere, but not in gameplay. There are some action shooting elements, but there are even more adventure game elements (ie. picking up an item and using it somewhere else). I normally don't have the patience for adventure games at all (I don't think I've ever finished one), but The Fall wasn't obtuse enough to frustrate me. You never have very many items in your inventory, and you never really have to combine them so if all else fails you can complete most puzzles using trial and error.\n\nOne more note: I wasn't rushing, and I managed to beat the game in under 4 hours.

The controls are a bit strange on keyboard and mouse, but end up working well in the end. Some puzzle aspects can be a bit frustrating, and the player would do well to back track and revist old locations when ever they get stuck.\n\nWhile I doubt the ending will surprise anyone, the story was remarkably well told.

I got stumped a few times and still finished the game in just under four hours. It's heavily story-based so the re-play value is probably a bit low -- but that is a problem with the genre, not the game itself.\n\nBut was it worth the 10 bucks? Definitely. The art is pretty (if a bit hard to see at times), the sound and voice acting is great and the gameplay is pretty solid. But most importantly: despite the difficulty of some of the puzzles, I enjoyed the game through and through.\n\nSome players were annoyed that the ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger -- but I'd argue that it reveals just enough to allow the game to stand on its own. There are tons of open questions left and it's not guaranteed that they will be answered in any of the future chapters. It's not a game for those who obsess over getting "100%" of a game, but that is intentional. Good storytelling is based on telling you just enough to keep you interested, not boring you with exhaustive details.\n\nA++ would buy again.","August 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat can be annoying at times, and some of the puzzles are a bit overly obtuse, but if you like adventure games that have a little bit of combat to them, this is a great one.\n\nThe atmosphere is very good and reminds me much of some of the best adventure games of the past. Surprisingly great voice acting and a well-contrived plot round out a good experience that is just about the right length.\n\nThe "to be continued" at the end is a bit odd and it's not clear what that would be.

I do think that The Fall is an amazing atmospheric adventure. The gameplay is more like a point and click adventure with action sections throw in. The combat is much more measuered than it is in your standard action adventure game. It feels good though. This is a game to be played with a controller if you have one. The story really hooked me in the begining. At the time of this review I would estimate I am somewhere between a quarter to a third of the way through the story. Once I finishi it, I will add my thoughts on weather or not I felt the story was satisfying.\n\nEdit:\nFinished the game, I was way off about how far through the game I was.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VSinGamer/recommended/290770/","VSinGamer","VSinGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VSinGamer/","271 products in account","The Fall seems to be the first episode of ARID, an AI in a military suit programed to protect their pilot who has become unconcsious from the sudden fall from space. The rest of your journey follows ARID as she embarks on a journey to get medical attention for pilot Joseph. Along the way she meets help from the mainframe, and an opposing force in the Caretaker. It is a harrowing adventure posed with danger and many hard decisions, but ARID is willing to go through everything to save Joseph.\n\nThe game is pretty short, but the ending is quite satisfying in leaving a want for sequel. Gameply wise it isn't anything too difficult, but one can argue that the puzzle solving isn't too straightforward and may turn into a guess and check. The shooting is straightforward as well, but I do recommend that you only go for headshots because the enemies can be quite difficult. Overall it is just a side scroller puzzle adventure game with some shooting elements.\n\nThe story is definitely  the strongest point in the game, and charater growth is something that becomes so powerfully moving. When you see the mainframe in danger you do feel angry at the Caretaker and it drives you to hunt him down. As you see what lengths ARID is willing to go, you can't help but sympathize with her strength to make tough decisions.  And as the mainframe tries to help ARID you feel this strong camaraderie from him. The ending as I said before gives the short story and nice bow to wrap everything up. Would definitely play a sequel if it comes out.\n\nThe Fall is a great story based game that for some will demand a sequel, but some may not be influenced enough to look past the simple game mechanics which would also be fair. The Fall looks great and will in fact create the mood of exploration and impending doom. It is a little bit guess and check with the puzzles, but that can quickly be overlooked with the setting as stated before. The shooting parts are actually a fun reprieve from the little exploring and puzzle solving you must do. A fun little game that should be on your list of purchases, sale price or otherwise.","March 6, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting, sounds, and atmosphere are engaging.  However, I don't feel that the game was quite what it should have been.  (*Mild Spoilers Ahead*)  In the beginning of the game, you crash land on an uncharted planet, and have no idea where you are or how you got there.  Your primary objective is to find medical treatment for your human pilot. This is where I feel that the devs missed a huge opportunity.  Since this is the primary objective, there is (as far as I can tell) no real emphasis on the planet you're on.  No information other than that you're near the very edge of the galaxy.  There's no story as to how the facility you explore came to be as it is.\n\nThere was huge potential for a creepier, more thrilling story that was (again, as far as I can tell) simply thrown away. (*Spoilers End*)\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple but interesting (especially combat). The puzzles are difficult but not necessarily intuitive; you have to really pay attention to the events going on around you to find a way forward, and you must look for anything you can pick up and use.\n\nOverall, the game is worth a buy - if it is on sale.  I don't really feel that the money I spent was wasted, but I also don't feel that it was well spent.  Buy this if you have some extra cash that you feel like rolling on something.  Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale.","July 9, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Words cannot describe how spectacular I feel this game is though I will do my best. This game is a point-and-click adventure game with segments of side-scrolling shooting mixed in. You play as an AI of a damaged combat suit following its directives: Do not lie, obey orders from its human pilot, and ensure the safety of said pilot. Throughout the game you discover many other AIs/Andriods/Combat suits who will be both a help and a hinderance in your goal: Assessing the vital signs of your human pilot, which are unknown as your scanner was damaged after a crash landing. This game brings to life many of the questions many of scientists are faced with today in developing AIs, from the singularity, self-awareness, and disobedience of protocols. I found this game on the Steam store and said "I haven't anything better to do, so $10 will entertain me for awhile." Now, after my three hours of gameplay, I have beaten the game and am left with wanting more, which may already be on the market, as the game ends on a cliffhanger. While this game was surprisingly short, it was worth every penny spent and more. These are the games I want to see more of: stroy driven that leaves you thinking after you're done, "Did I do the right thing? Were my actions worth it?

I got stumped a few times and still finished the game in just under four hours. It's heavily story-based so the re-play value is probably a bit low -- but that is a problem with the genre, not the game itself.\n\nBut was it worth the 10 bucks? Definitely. The art is pretty (if a bit hard to see at times), the sound and voice acting is great and the gameplay is pretty solid. But most importantly: despite the difficulty of some of the puzzles, I enjoyed the game through and through.\n\nSome players were annoyed that the ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger -- but I'd argue that it reveals just enough to allow the game to stand on its own. There are tons of open questions left and it's not guaranteed that they will be answered in any of the future chapters. It's not a game for those who obsess over getting "100%" of a game, but that is intentional. Good storytelling is based on telling you just enough to keep you interested, not boring you with exhaustive details.\n\nA++ would buy again.","August 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ambiance and story were very inventive, and the voice acting in general was surprisingly good. It works better as a story than as a game. The game is a little bit buggy for me, sometimes my guy would get stuck and I had to restart the game. Since this is an indy game this is not a huge surprise. The story is a very dark sci-fi tale in a kind of post-apocalyptic setting. The action and platforming elements were not great, the controls were just not tight enough for a good action game experience. For sci-fi adventure game fans, this game is worth a look. If you are expecting a good 2-d action game, best to move on to The Swapper, or Braid, or Fly'n, or Trine, or even Bastion.","August 16, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the few games that the story has gripped me within a few minutes of playing and even after finishing it has left me sinking in the subplots that are hinted throughout the whole game making the end open to interpretation until the future episodes are released. Sadly the Game is short and is currently in an episodic format with no release date for next episodes. The Game has the atmosphere, sound design and art style that compliments this Swapper/limbo-esque game perfectly. Combines a nice pace of puzzle solving with backtracking and somewhat satisfying combat, the combat mechanics could use some work since not once did i fear for my life and the boss was somewhat easy to read and managed to kill him fairly fast and outside of the puzzles the game  didnt really challenge me at all, overall i highly recommend playing this if you're into dark sci fi adventure games, specially if its available for sale.","July 31, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to hold down right mouse in order to look around and interact with objects and aim your gun (once you obtain a working weapon), but you cannot see what direction the mouse is facing until you activate it. It makes controlling Arid, the combat suit AI protagonist, unnecessarily difficult as she (it has a female voice) flips directions. Additionally, lining up just right to interact with objects is frustrating.\n\nThat aside, this game had me playing until the very end in one hit (maybe a tea break or two, to ponder what on earth [space] I had to do next). Arid's objective from the start is clear: ensure the safety of her human occupant. In exploring to find a means to provide medical attention she finds herself in a run down, android re-purposing facility and you must solve a range of seemingly simple problems and defend yourself (i.e. your human occupant) against hostile security droids to progress. The environment is dark and ominous; you always feel like you are being watched and that there is danger around the corner; it seems a bit of a cross between 'Limbo' and 'The Swapper', but lacking in the awe inspiring backgrounds featured in the latter (which I also just finished playing, so I suppose I was expecting more beauty in the environment of this side scroller).\n\nThis game isn't about environmental beauty however. Everything about the story is intriguing, and the environment is also a core part of that. As is hinted in the trailer this game deals with what it is to be an artificial intelligence, and it does so very, very well. The narrative isn't solely told through dialogue: your actions and self-assessments; other characters and their actions and assessments (it becomes clear that this story isn't just about Arid and her human occupant); environment; menus; voice acting and music... it all comes together magnificently and in the end leaves you wanting for more.\n\nSo if you enjoy solving puzzles, are interested in science fiction action and philosophy and enjoy some sick twisted humour (did I mention this game has some pretty neat jokes too?), this game is for you. Definitely recommend it!","July 13, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept itself is wonderful (if ultimately a little obvious) and I do hope they finish the series, as the story is pretty interesting. The controls (I played with xbox gamepad) are bad, particularly aiming, and the basic action of the game (interact with something) seems to take twice as many steps as it should. There are a few other things that seem unpolished, like the display of text when you inspect something. On the other hand, the graphic style is hauntingly good, very reminiscent of The Swapper (that game is nearly without flaw so I think you should prioritize it), and the character animations were excellent as well. The voice acting was great, although some conceits meant that the dialog goes pretty slowly, which made me end up skipping some and just reading. Puzzles were good; I finished without any external hints and most of them made sense. The game was more linear and "neat" than I prefer. One downside of this game is that it's essentially a point-and-click adventure game (and a good one), but it has some action sequences that were fairly mediocre and seemingly unnecessary, like they had planned and developed the capability but not really made use of it. I think this might make the game needlessly inaccessible for people who don't really do action.

The game is mared by an interaction and combat system that takes some practice to master and would be aided by a simple controls layout in the menu or on the developers website. Finding online guides or tutorials for some of the simple yet frustrating problems within the game was difficult but a full walkthrough is available on youtube for when players are stuck.\n\nUltimately, many of the more interesting plots explored in the Fall are never fully explained, such as the caretaker's 'use' of crucifixes and the teasing of A.R.I.D's potential abilities in the distinctly crafted unlock menu. As such I keenly await the release of the next instalment of the Fall mostly to see where the story will go after the ending's twist and because despite its flaws the Fall has hooked me into its dystopian robotic universe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theonefrohman1/recommended/290770/","theonefrohman1","THE GAY AGENDA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theonefrohman1/","209 products in account","This game is good. Great, even.\n\nYou play as the AI of a combat suit.\nYou have crash landed on an abandoned planet. The person inhabiting your suit is not responding and likely gravely wounded.\nYou take control of his body and have to get him some medical attention.\n\nMost games that toy with the idea of player agency and free will in a system where there usually is only one right path do it in the form of a plot twist. Would you kindly! Everything you've done has been controlled by an outside force!\nIn this game, though, the fact that you have no free will is stated upfront. You are a computer program guided by three principles: Protect your pilot, follow orders and don't misrepresent reality. As in many stories where an AI is governed by such laws, they clash: Protecting your pilot means defying orders, breaking protocol, outsmarting other AIs.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that story and gameplay go so well together.\nThe story is about an AI that explores the boundaries of its programming.\nThe gameplay is a 2D puzzle platformer where most of the puzzles involve outsmarting protocols and following the letter, not the spirit of a rule.\n\nThat's all well and good, but most prospective buyers will ask three questions: Is it fun? Does it look good? Does it sound good?\n\nWell, yes, yes and yes.\n\nAs I wrote above, the game is a 2D puzzle platformer with cover-based shooting segments. These "shooty bits" feel a bit tacked-on in the beginning, but become exciting and relevant towards the end. The puzzles strike a fine balance between being reasonably clever while still being rather common-sense. Giving an example would spoil one of the many cool puzzles, but if your first instinct when encountering a giant path-blocking spider is to shoot it, you're going to be fine. The only criticism I can think of here is the fact that some parts are a bit over-reliant on checking every part of the floor and the ceiling.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, especially considering the game was made on a budget. You won't find cutting-edge graphics here, but the colors and the lighting really sell the mood here. Heck, just look at the screenshots. The animations are fluid and beautiful to look at.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is the writing in combination with the voice acting.\nMost of the dialogues take on a rather creepy and monotone tone, because AIs sound creepy and monotone, but the occasional funny or touching line keep it from being boring. The characters are as well-rounded as you could possibly expect from machines that have to rigidly follow rules in everything they do. The written notes are believable and have exactly the right length to convey information and tone without being so long that you're likely to skip over them.\n\nI sincerely recommend checking out this game and I look forward to the next installment of the series.","July 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It tells me that it's an exceptionally intelligent game, with some real head scratchers of puzzles. The puzzles were pretty darn challenging for me, but what really stood out to me was the story telling. The story is compelling to follow, and despite my hopeless frustration in solving a couple of the puzzles, the allure of exploring the story further kept me coming back. Eventually, I found a walkthrough to get me past the more horrid puzzles, but I am proud to say I solved most of it myself (so far!).\n\nThe story telling and the philosophical angles taken certainly deserve merit. The dialogue is deliberate, thoughtful, at times poignant, and always serves to further the story. I really enjoyed the elements of deadpan humour (what would you expect from a game about artifical intelligence?) in The Fall. There were moments where I found myself laughing out loud, which certainly added variety to the method of story progression.\n\nThe art style and environment are also well done, with a persistent gloomy atmosphere, much in line with the overall feel of the game. The environment also plays a role in conveying the story, through simple observations from your character (named A.R.I.D). The controls took a little getting used to, but they weren't anything inhibitive. They were certainly different to anything I remember playing before, but once you're in the swing of things they end up being pretty intuitive. Overall, the game plays smoothly, looks good and above all else succeeds in telling it's story; You just need to work for it, is all.","August 6, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time it is servicable but several fights towards the end proved to be very irratable.\n\nWhile 90% of the puzzles are tricky but managable, the other 10% fall into the pit of bizare point and click adventure game logic where the solution seems rather arbitrary.\n\nThe next one isn't out yet.\n\nConclusion\n\nA short and tight story with inovative ideas that serve the story instead of just being innovation for the sake of innovation, a masterfully written story with clever puzzle solving, with the flaws in a few annoying puzzles and clunky combat only taking away a little from the overall experience.  All the frustrations I had with the final fights were instantly swept away by the story's brilliant conclusion.\n\nThis game is very much worth a purchase and I eagerly await the next game.

Interactive conversations that are similar to those in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim add a bit of character to your  gameplay. Artwork that looks like it came from a strange LIMBO sequel combined with amazing voice-acting and music makes the game immensely immersive. 10/10.","July 3, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome character development with the protagonist and the antagonist is a different but fantastic villain. A bit pricey for how short it is though. The atmosphere provides enough creepy aura to make the game have that horror game feel without actually being a horror game. The puzzles are pretty difficult at some points and have that "where do I go what do I do" helpless feeling which might be my only negative view of the game. However figuring out the puzzles after that frustration factor sets in is incredibly rewarding and makes you feel good about yourself. All in all I'd give it an 8.5/10, the only thing docking it points being the length of the game and the mediocre conveyance with the puzzles.","July 3, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat can be annoying at times, and some of the puzzles are a bit overly obtuse, but if you like adventure games that have a little bit of combat to them, this is a great one.\n\nThe atmosphere is very good and reminds me much of some of the best adventure games of the past. Surprisingly great voice acting and a well-contrived plot round out a good experience that is just about the right length.\n\nThe "to be continued" at the end is a bit odd and it's not clear what that would be.

I do think that The Fall is an amazing atmospheric adventure. The gameplay is more like a point and click adventure with action sections throw in. The combat is much more measuered than it is in your standard action adventure game. It feels good though. This is a game to be played with a controller if you have one. The story really hooked me in the begining. At the time of this review I would estimate I am somewhere between a quarter to a third of the way through the story. Once I finishi it, I will add my thoughts on weather or not I felt the story was satisfying.\n\nEdit:\nFinished the game, I was way off about how far through the game I was. The game is about 3.5 to 4 hours long.

ARID and her counterparts are surprisingly genuine, as well as supported by fantastic voice performances. This is not your typical android science fiction story, and the end result is utterly compelling. The unique blend of genres works incredibly well, without ever feeling as if it’s ever imitating the creator’s source of inspiration. There is an excellent balance between player exploration and tactical shooting; both of which are fueled by creative puzzles that think outside the box. There are still a few rough edges to iron out, but as this is the first game in a trilogy, I think an incredible foundation has been laid. The conclusion, will, without a doubt, have you on the edge of your seat. If you only buy one game this steam sale, make sure it’s The Fall.\n\nIf you would like to read my full review, you can find it here: http://gamecloud.net.au/review/the-fall","June 23, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a real pain to use. Upgrade screen also seems like unfinished metroidvania idea. Shooting does not work - it's not fun. It's easy and just serves as action filler between proper adventure sections.\nAdventure component works reasonably well.

The person inhabiting your suit is not responding and likely gravely wounded.\nYou take control of his body and have to get him some medical attention.\n\nMost games that toy with the idea of player agency and free will in a system where there usually is only one right path do it in the form of a plot twist. Would you kindly! Everything you've done has been controlled by an outside force!\nIn this game, though, the fact that you have no free will is stated upfront. You are a computer program guided by three principles: Protect your pilot, follow orders and don't misrepresent reality. As in many stories where an AI is governed by such laws, they clash: Protecting your pilot means defying orders, breaking protocol, outsmarting other AIs.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that story and gameplay go so well together.\nThe story is about an AI that explores the boundaries of its programming.\nThe gameplay is a 2D puzzle platformer where most of the puzzles involve outsmarting protocols and following the letter, not the spirit of a rule.\n\nThat's all well and good, but most prospective buyers will ask three questions: Is it fun? Does it look good? Does it sound good?\n\nWell, yes, yes and yes.\n\nAs I wrote above, the game is a 2D puzzle platformer with cover-based shooting segments. These "shooty bits" feel a bit tacked-on in the beginning, but become exciting and relevant towards the end. The puzzles strike a fine balance between being reasonably clever while still being rather common-sense. Giving an example would spoil one of the many cool puzzles, but if your first instinct when encountering a giant path-blocking spider is to shoot it, you're going to be fine. The only criticism I can think of here is the fact that some parts are a bit over-reliant on checking every part of the floor and the ceiling.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, especially considering the game was made on a budget. You won't find cutting-edge graphics here, but the colors and the lighting really sell the mood here. Heck, just look at the screenshots. The animations are fluid and beautiful to look at.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is the writing in combination with the voice acting.\nMost of the dialogues take on a rather creepy and monotone tone, because AIs sound creepy and monotone, but the occasional funny or touching line keep it from being boring. The characters are as well-rounded as you could possibly expect from machines that have to rigidly follow rules in everything they do. The written notes are believable and have exactly the right length to convey information and tone without being so long that you're likely to skip over them.\n\nI sincerely recommend checking out this game and I look forward to the next installment of the series.","July 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's not very long and there are definitely some small issues I have with it but I give alot of credit to this first time developer because he dished out what I would consider to be a top shelf game.\n\nGameplay is similar to any side scroller shooter you have encountered but the dev adds observation points that add a huge amount of atmosphere and story to this little game.\n\nIf I had one complaint it's that some of the puzzles will get you stuck if you happen to miss a single piece to the puzzle. I spent 45 minutes running through every level trying to find a cup once because I missed it in a pretty obvious place! Yes it was probably my fault but it would be nice if there was some sort of help or multiple ways to finish a puzzle in case this happens to someone else. I'm sure the developer will figure something out to prevent slowdowns.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone, even at the $10 price point. The game took me around six hours to complete.

While this trailer does somewhat sell up the game, it is by no means a disappointment. We'll talk more about the trailer in the story section, though. The gameplay of The Fall is one of a rather esoteric genre known as the Cinematic Platformer. Two sterling examples of this kind of gameplay are Another World/Out of this World and Flashback (the old one). However, if you remember particularly frustrating moments from the former example; do not worry. This game has no absurdly precise platforming in it. Truth be told, this game doesn't have much platforming at all, but that's perfectly fine; it doesn't need it.\n\nRather, the core of the gameplay plays more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game in which you will sometimes be able to cleverly figure out the puzzle and other times just spend five or ten minutes just rubbing objects on other objects to create success. Yes, this game does have some Sierra logic here and there, much to my dismay. Also, due to how dark the game's presentation is, it is sometimes more challenging to even distinguish what you need to be clicking on. You can only interact with objects by shining the flash light from your gun on said object, so you don't have to worry about accidentally using things over and over again, but considering how dark the game is, it sometimes becomes a task of flailing your light everywhere in a desperate attempt to find something that you can rub against something in your inventory. Yes, the repetition of the word something was intentional in that last sentence.\n\nMuch like Another World/Out of this World, there is some element of gunplay. Don't worry, though; your gun has infinite shots, so you won't be screwed over by that. You only really fight one type of enemy throughout the game, but once again; that's not that big of a deal. There are also some abilities that unlock as the game progresses, but not all of them are available by the end game. I was confused by this until I found out that this game was meant to be the first in a series. Considering that, it is in a way no surprise that the game's platforming and combat felt inconsequential at times.\n\nOverall, the gameplay isn't the most brilliant aspect of this game. The puzzles can be alright at times but othertimes completely obtuse; the platforming and gunplay are rather insiginificant at times; however, they do their job to keep this game from just being another walking simulator. 7/10.\n\nStory: I mentioned that I'd be talking about the trailer here, so I most definitely will be. The "Conform" trailer represents this game as being mainly about an AI's crisis of identity as it gradually gains more and more of a simulacrum of what we humans would call a true consciousness. While this is a core theme of the game, there is more to it than that. There aren't many charcters in this game; in fact, there's really only three characters including the enigmatic Caretaker. They all do their job serving the plot and the dialogue is really the main presentation vehicle of the themes. Just the way it should be in my opinion. I don't want to spoil too much, obviously, but just know that this game has some very excellent writing behind it, and if you've not already pored over the idea of the technological singularity, this will certainly be some very interesting philosophical material. Also this is part one of a series. The game does wrap up conclusively, but I'm very excited to see where the game goes from here. 10/10.\n\nGraphics: Again, the trailer could be a very big selling factor on this front. This game has an excellent art style, and the animations are all very very fluid, save for instantaneous turning around and all that. That's a minor detail, though. There also appears to be a sort of "light filter" always on whenever you're playing the game, which unfortunately doesn't have the greatest color depth (it looks patchy). That's a bit of a disappointment, but not too much of a mood killer. Obviously, this game doesn't need too terribly intense of a computer setup to run, so if you can run Windows 7 with Aero on, you should have no issues running this game. Apart from those two minor issues, I really don't have any other complaints about the graphics side of the game. Ther is the issue with interactable objects being hard to see, but that's more relevant to gameplay, since HUD elements appear showing you where the objects are whenever you run over them with your flashlight. Yet another example of why style trumps substance. 5/5.\n\nSound: There really isn't much in the way of music here, since it is all ambiant pieces. However, it's really good ambiance. This game has one hell of an atmosphere, and that is thanks mainly to the soundtrack. Excellent stuff. The voice acting does a fantastic job as well, eerily portraying AI constructs gradually gaining a semblance of humanity, be it intentional or unintentional. Yeah, there really isn't much else to talk about here other than the sound design and voice acting is top notch. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/10/5/5; cumulative score of 9.0/10. Definitely worth the $10 if you've got the $10 to throw down. Not much in the way of replay value, and the game is rather short, but the quality of the adventure more than makes up for it. Better to have a short, really excellent adventure than a long, doldrumic one.","September 2, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to give anything else away about the storyline so I'll just list the pros and cons:\n\n+ Excellent story about the restraints placed on AI that translates to a wider lesson about societal rules and constraints\n+ 2D but a rich, atmospheric environment\n+ A soundtrack that compliments the dark and artificial environment\n+ Very little actual combat, which is great because the story is at the forefront here\n+ Good dialog, solid voice acting\n+ Puzzles strike the right balance between simplistic and ragequitting difficulty.\n\n- Some of the puzzles don't really logically follow from step to step, so there will be a few moments of "Wait, what?"\n- Controls are simple but not as fluid or accurate as they could be. This is a minor concern since combat is a minor part of the game at best, and it's easy to get used to the mechanics\n- Too short. I finished the whole thing in just over four hours. However, at $10, that's decent value (and part 2 is in the works)","April 27, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DEVELOPERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE FINAL TWO PARTS ARE ABOUT A YEAR IN THE FUTURE.\n\nStill probably one of the better point-and-click style adventure games I've played in recent years. I picked it up for five bucks and got my money's worth. However, ten bucks is too much for what is, in the end, an incomplete experience.\n\nControl scheme is interesting but unusual, takes a bit of getting used to. Story and voice acting is excellent. Puzzles are generally logical but requires some pixel searching. Only got stuck on one puzzle requiring the use of a wiki (that stupid crying baby). There are a few moments of "Adventure Game Logic" though.\n\nThe general conceit is that the player takes the role of an Artificial Intelligence. As such, your actions are constrained to your directives. For instance, the player is not allowed to lie in order to solve what should be a trivial puzzle. This does mean that the moments of "railroading" in the story tend to make sense: they are the only action that the player can take given the directives they have.\n\nAbout the only thing that I seriously disliked was the combat. The control scheme is NOT conducive to side-scrolling mouse-and-keyboard gunplay. Given that an early upgrade allows for the player to evade gunfire simply by tapping a button, combat pretty much turns into a tedious stop-and-pop point and click affair. Combined with somewhat floaty controls and narrow, tight corridors, this can make for a frustrating experience.\n\nI generally didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs.\n\nArt style evokes "Limbo," with its side-scrolling black-on-white silhouetted style. Voice acting is well-done and evocative. Writing and characterization is generally solid.","October 30, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to complete my first playthrough in a little over three and a half hours. But what is there is pretty compelling.\n\nAt its heart, The Fall is an adventure game, complete with inventory puzzles and other bits of adventure game logic, gated by your character being a robot. There are some things you cannot do until you progress through the story and unlock more of ARID's features to safeguard her human pilot. The way the game forces these events to happen is pretty slick and my only complaint in this department is what should be a fairly weighty decision towards the end just didn't resonate with me when I had to make a choice to save ARID's pilot; or rather, my choice was to either go along with the game or sit there until I said yes. This false choice hindered the decision's weight and I wish there was more to it than that, but for a short indie game, I can't fault it for not having the insane choices of consequence ala the Witcher.\n\nThe voice acting from all the characters is fantastic, given that all the characters are supposed to be robots. It has a fair amount of "Another World" running around in its DNA and a little bit of Metroid's shooty bits, but a Metroidvania it is not. The combat is easy and responsive, and you really get invested in ARID's struggle to save the human inside of the suit. You get to watch ARID change and grow (in the short time you get to see her), but the ending does little to provide closure and, instead of feeling cheated, I found myself wanting more of this incredible little game.
