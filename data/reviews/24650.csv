If you are thinking of buying this then make sure you have one of the base games. Even though this works without it you will have more fun with the base game as you can open the surveyor and put other trains in to make your own scenarios.\n\nNone the less the scenarios built in are good but you should think about getting the base game for a more complete Trainz experience.","January 12, 2014","true","0.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

Literally nearly every yard would be almost completely empty except for the cars that you're going to pick up and use for your service.\n\nI'm only going to recommend this to people who like steam locomotives more then diesel, and don't care aobut displaying a false headcode, that doesn't really need to modify the sessions in any way.\n\nOh, that's another thing, editing sessions, normally if I don't like something, I'd make a fix for it which I'd like a bit more, then save it under a new game, with S&C, it doesn't let me do that.\n\nI don't know, I feel that I had more fun out of the Hawes Junction Demo compared to this... But if you're a fan of steam trains, try it, see what you think...","December 14, 2014","false","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
