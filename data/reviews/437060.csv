Although this installment does not have quite as many changes and improvements as the previous, it remains an enjoyable take on the genre that provides plenty of challenge for those who seek it, along with relaxing gameplay for the more casual-minded gamer.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610511826\nThis time around, we follow Tapa-tui’s leader and Bright Light as they venture off island to neighboring Tikku-ana where they begin a new adventure together.  Gameplay is relatively the same, consisting of multi-tasking activities as efficiently as possible while managing resources to complete specific tasks (build, gather, trade, etc.) in an effort to beat the clock.  The only real change is the addition of gold mines which offer coins as a resource.  All of the other series improvements are present including the ability to equip items that offer specific perks and the secondary bonus objectives for each level with additional challenges to overcome.  Granted, the game plays the same as MOAI 2, but that didn’t bother me much as I felt they got the formula just about right with the previous installment.\n\nAs the first Collector’s Edition in the series, we get a few neat extras including a Strategy Guide which gives helpful tips for each level if you find yourself struggling.  There’s also downloadable wallpapers and music tracks (something I’ve been awaiting for a while now), and additional levels available once you’ve completed the main story scenario. Unfortunately, there is no Steam integration for the achievements, which is a pretty big bummer.  But I hope this is remedied in the future as they really added value to the previous 2 titles.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610511881\nHonestly, I wish I could say more than I have, but MOAI 3 is essentially a continuation of MOAI 2’s story with the same great gameplay, but little more.  If you enjoyed the first two games, you will definitely enjoy MOAI 3.  However, if you were hoping the series continued to progress in gameplay improvements, you’ll likely be disappointed.  Still, I'd recommend it to fans of the series as well as newcomers who are looking to dip their toes into the time management genre.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for fans of the series as well as newcomers to the genre.\n\nNote - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the publisher.","January 29","true","8.3"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","62","68","2","1"

All these 3 games are point and click, resource, gathering, time management games, and each with a slightly differant story that progresses onto the next to follow, and they are really very interesting, fun and relaxing games to play. They are visually very appealing, stunning, very cute, colourful and very well designed. Im not so good with the timed part of the game, so I prefere to just play and enjoy at my own personal pace.\n\nThe game comes as a Collectors Edition ONLY at this stage, and what you get is a Step by Step Walkthrough Guide, some Desktop Wallpapers, the full Downloadable Soundtrack and many other extras included. Who knows maybe the developer will give future options for those that dont want all the extras in this game title, and separate them, so you can just buy the game as a stand alone.\n\nThe game also has  58  in game Achievements, which would be much better if they where Steam Integrated so we can share with our friends, and show off our game percentage %, these are very much loved for achievement hunters, and I myself enjoy getting them as well ;D, so i hope these lovely developers can make them Steam achievements.\n\nThe Game also comes with trading cards, emoticons and backgrounds, for those who love to collect them and craft the badges\n\nI feel the price is a fair and reasonable price for the game or you can wait for a better discount from a sale if you are short of cash, if you enjoy these game's very much please consider the work that has gone into these game's, including the walkthrough guide and the wonderful art, it does not disappoint and thats my oppinion whether I bought the game or not.\n\nSpecial Note : Key was provided by the publisher, for a very nice and honest review and that is what I have provided to the best of my personal abillity and I really enjoy this game as well\nThank you greatly for producing, making and bringing this lovely game to life Alawar Entertainment ;)","January 30","true","7.1"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","7"

I don’t know if you recall, but you are this hero who wanted to go around the world on his hot air balloon. . .  Remember, you crashed it on this lovely Island, you married the chieftain daughter, “Bright Light,” who you saved, and defeated “Miru” the leader of the underworld in the previous games. Now the population is expanding and all the Island resources are running low. The solution is to establish trade routes with your neighbours. However, it is not going to be as easy as you thought, especially as unexpected challenges arise quickly within your journey.\n\nMOAI 3: Trade Mission Collector’s Edition is a Casual / strategy / resources and time management game. You will start the game on the Island of Tikku-ana. If you are familiar with the first 2 games, well you probably know the drill. You will control a minimum of 2 workers and give them orders - to collect food (pond or plate of fruits), remove road obstacles such as trees, rocks, fill big holes or open treasure chests. You will have to build farming fields (food resources), quarries (stone resources), sawmills (wood resources), gold mines (coin resources) and more. Each time you built, upgrade a structure or remove an obstacle it will cost you specific resource (s).  The aim is to achieve all tasks in each level before the time runs out. It can be tricky at times.\n\nWhen you open a treasure chest, you might get some well needed resources or artefacts, but you could also pick up some special abilities to help you finish the level on time. Something like the “Sandals of Speed” which will move your worker from one point another faster. However, it will be for a limited time.\n\nIf you finish the level on time, you will score points and add whatever artefacts you found to your Backpack. Your hero can wear up to six artefacts and can gain an increasing percentage on the production of goods, speed and much more.\nThe game has 100 levels and each time you beat a level, you can retry the same level on a higher difficulty.  If you are stuck on a level, don’t worry as the game as a strategy guide available for you if need be.\n\nCute and polished graphics. The controls are point and click and easy to master. I really like the fact that you hover over the resources to collect them rather than clicking on them one by one. It makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Cute and polished graphics\n-	Nice story-line\n-	Fun and easy to play\n-	Two difficulties per level\n-	Stack of Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Repetitive\n\nMOAI 3: Trade Mission Collector’s Edition is a very good strategy / resources and time management game. If you are a fan of the series, you would not be disappointed. If you have never played this type of game, MOAI 3 is a good choice to start with.

It is the third game from the Moai series, which is developed by Alawar Entertainment and Toyman Interactive. The game has two difficulties modes which makes the experience more enjoyable for both casual gamers and more experienced players of this genre. The graphics are nice and combined with the calming soundtrack makes for pleasant game sessions.\n\nThe game continues the story from the previous ones, now with our protagonists to travel to the neighbour island, Mata-fiki, to establish trading relationships with their neighbours. Like always the hero is helping everyone in need along it's way and after a bit of a plot twist at the end of the story he manages to fulfill his goal. For game mechanics, they are similar with the ones from the previous games, the improvement would be the adition of gold mine.\n\nWith Moai 3:Trade Mission the series got it's first collectors edition. The additions which come with it are a strategy guide, extra levels after you finish the story of the game, some wallpapers and the game soundtrack.\n\nAs a side note, compared with the previous games from the series, this one doesn't have the steam achievements implemented, but has 58 in-game achievements.\n\nNote - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the publisher.","January 31","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mechanics are mostly standard for the genre: workers, upgrades, artefacts (spells), equipment and superficial primary stats; though there is a enemy-clicker element on later levels, with superficial tower defence. Visuals are calm and pleasant; sound design is fitting, with a lot of audio cues for states of progression. Level design is nice — despite repetitive nature of the genre, tasks and maps feel distinct and diverse. Later ones are also somewhat frantic and challenging.\nGame can be played in 4:3 but feels too much zoomed in. Native resolution in window is weird, but native aspect ratio seems to be nowadays common 16:9. So if you have 4:3 screen and can tolerate borders — i suggest you to play in windowed mode.\n\nStory somewhat relies on player being already invested in the characters (this is my first game in the series) and overall is toothless and plain, reminiscent of old RTS games, though with interesting moai theme. Which, on the other hand, means that it was really easy to avoid mistakes in the narrative. Names and descriptions of difficulty levels did caught me off-guard and cracked me up rather hard. Also i like that they did choose to use statues with hats and eyes.\nBonus campaign takes place after trade mission returned home and adds 13+12 of new levels to the main campaign comprised of 40+38 levels, about pacifying the volcano and dealing with damage.\n\nThere are in-game achievements, which for some reason are not tied to steam. Mostly progression-based, resource accumulation and optional mission-based. But "coconut thrower" is misleading and actually means the bandits from end-game levels, rather than the usual bandits.\n\nTrading cards feature characters from the game and have nice artwork; emoticons are utilitarian, some looks nice and fitting, while others are too small; profile backgrounds, on the other hand, are not very good, they are really blurry and it seems like they are pretty low-res.\n\nOverall it's really solid game in the genre, more focused on mechanics, rather than on the heroes and some thorough story.\n\nНемного раздражает то, что в игре от воронежской конторы нет возможности выбрать русский язык.","February 21","true","31.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
