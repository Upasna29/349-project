As a big fan of the series, I have played my fair share of titles and have become well accustomed to the usual order of gameplay. However, due to the character set up of Castle Malloy, the ending was quite open ended and either incredibly frustrating or strangely enticing---depending on how much you invested in the characters. Placing the mystery in Ireland also made for a fun change of scenery, and I enjoyed the historical myths and legends they worked into the storyline.\n\nGood Points: Great graphics, lots of interesting details to explore. A very large game map. Well developed characters, with intelligent and realistic dialogue as well as surprising emotional depth. A sufficiently creepy castle, and good sound effects. Detailed, and layered storyline involving not only a mystery, but a relationship triangle between three main characters, including two of the suspects.\n\nBad Points: Some of the tasks in the middle of the story drag. A very complex and time consuming final challenge. Could use more cut scenes to create a more cinematic feel and draw the player in.","December 28, 2013","true","9.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

This game, even on the Junior level, is very tedious. You will find yourself getting stuck, and making fatal errors over and over and over again. It will get frustrating. However, the plot and game play is very enjoyable. Some of the puzzles are a bit over sensitive, particularly the chemicals (you'll get to it). It may make you want to scream and the ending isn't as great as it could be, but overall I had fun and it took me twice as long to beat it then Nancy Drew: A Haunted Carousel.","July 17, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a variety of puzzles to solve as well as an interesting outdoor map that was easy to navigate. I think that this mystery was fast paced and interesting with a great ending and a detailed backstory for both the characters and the setting itself. I also thought it was fun that some of the areas you can explore are not revealed right away which helps build suspense and interest. There was the right amount of challenge and the puzzles didn't get repetitive. I would definitely recommend this game to both current fans of this series and to players who may just be starting.","June 20, 2014","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Haunting of Castle Malloy is one of my absolute favorites. Trust me when I say, i've played a lot of Nancy Drew. They are funny, entertaining, and so worth the 4 bucks they cost during sales! This one even has a bartending mini game. How many puzzle games have that?","June 21, 2014","true","20.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not nearly as spooky as the others, but the game areea was huge, and there were many games/tasks along the way.  Though this game had more games than usual, they weren't necessarily the best.  Overall, a bit tedious.  Fun, nevertheless.  Still, I prefer Captive Curse.","January 6, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was not as fun as the Captive Curse to me but mostly because the puzzles were harder.  I did end up looking up a lot of answers.They threw in some math and science, which is not my strong point, but I am happy I learned how to read Celtic runes, some Celtic history and *spoiler here* even learned about the periodic table and  other cool science stuff i won't spoil for you. One thing i love about the games, they  are good for stretching your mind as well as learning. The story line was ok, the characters kind of annoyed me but... i  did want to get to the bottom of what was going on. Also, This one was weird because you could actually walk around as Nancy when you were outside. The Irish theme was cute, i liked some of the irish themed puzzles/games. Overall  I enjoyed the experience and am glad i bought the game. I would give the game 4/5 stars.","November 10, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles seem overwhelming at first, and some of them are frankly illogical (and thus, difficult). However, Castle Malloy's atmosphere is enough to keep me coming back to this game. The score is fantastic, and I love the risks HER Interactive took with this game in terms of how the player is able to control Nancy. Some of the risks definitely paid off. Some didn't. But I'm so proud of them for trying new things.\n\nI recommend this game for fans of the series, but wouldn't recommend it for someone who has never played the games before. If you're interested in the series, I recommend checking out Sea of Darkness, their newest game (which is beautiful and atmospheric and just... yes), or one of the older games, such as Treasure in the Royal Tower or Secrets Can Kill Remastered.","June 13, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having to wander in pitch black darkness for half the game seems like a bad decision from the developers. The game could have been so much better if they did the graphics in the same high quality as they did the sound design.","December 26, 2014","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
