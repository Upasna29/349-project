I did buy my own copy of the game however, and wrote this review of my own accord.\n\nThink Payday: The Heist meets Hotline Miami, with some Diablo-esque gear system thrown in. That's really the easiest/simplest way to describe the game.\n\nControls are tight, gameplay can be challenging, and the skill system allows for a diverse set of play styles. Whether you want to be Solid Snake, the TF2 Engineer, or Rambo, the game has weapons and classes supporting that play style.\n\nThe game also records global theft amounts, and has systems in place to reward the playerbase as they steal more and more, creating a good system for community sense of achievement.\n\nYes, the game has bugs here and there, but the developer is very responsive, and often fixes bugs found with a good amount of speed.\n\nAll in all, Cash_Out is a great game to waste a few minutes (a single level or two) or a few hours on, enjoying yourself the entire time... except for maybe if you die on a career character after getting them through a couple hours worth of levels. But hey, just like Dwarf Fortress taught me, losing is FUN!!","December 22, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055879714/recommended/372970/","76561198055879714","✪TakeMeToYourDealer✪","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055879714/","262 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCash_Out is a randomly generated, top-down shooter where you must make your way through buildings loaded with guards, security traps and loot. You must make your heist as profitable as possible by grabbing money, valuables, and the big score you came for - a huge pile of cash.\n\nFor an early access game, I'm really quite impressed. The game has quite a lot of different mechanics, and the randomly generated heists make each one rather unpredictable. Some rooms are utterly filled with tripwires, cameras and motion sensors, and guards armed to the teeth, others are lightly patrolled. If you've played Borderlands, you'll come to find a similarity in the weapons system, in that almost no two weapons are alike, and all have different stats and attachments which will help you eliminate the guards in your way. You can have things like a Quick Accurate Revolver (with a laser sight on it), to a Cheap Powerful Rifle (with incendiary rounds), or an Adequate Kunai of Flight (electrified for more fun) with each weapon having unique stats such as accuracy, throwing speed, damage, and more.\n\nOf course, you don't necessarily need to go in guns blazing - You have stealth and the ability to hack, so you can sneak around and backstab the guards in your way, and hack the doors to the next room open, so that you can sneak past the others, or hack a camera to slip past unnoticed. You can use the shadows to get past guards without them seeing you, or even pick up objects such as glass bottles and throw them to create a distraction. It's all down to your own personal playstyle, as stealth might not work as well for you as using the guards as human shields and gunning down all opposition.\n\nEach heist allows you to find clothing, each which have their own different stat buffs, which can completely change the way you play the game. For example, the Leather Jacket will decrease the melee damage you take, Overalls will increase your damage with guns, Hacker Pants will heal you a little for each device you hack, etc. It's worth finding as many of these as you can and mixing them up to your own taste.\n\nYou can also find consumables, which include, but aren't limited to - Flashbangs, Gas Grenades, Ammo Packs, Bandages, Blueprints, and more. Each of these can be used in your heists to good effect, allowing you to gain an advantage on the enemy and make your heist a success.\n\nThroughout the heists you can find lockboxes, which contain random equipment and cash, which you can open with cash. (ingame cash, no microtransactions here!) Some lockboxes may require a key instead, or my favourite lockboxes, the Puzzle Lockboxes, which as the name suggests, has you solving a puzzle in a time limit to gain access to the contents. Should you not need a specific weapon, consumable, or piece of clothing anymore, you can always sell it in the shop in between heists where you can then use your cash to purchase upgrades for the stuff you do use, as well as new equipment. You also have the bank which allows you to deposit gear you want to keep.\n\nThe game has difficulty modes, with Easy being, easy, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, Hard, being an utter ball-buster. You can toggle perma-death if you wish, which means you'll lose your gear and character on death, to increase the challenge.\n\nThree game modes are included - Career Mode, where you progress through the heists and work your way up to the Big Score. Quickplay, which allows you to get right in to the action and choose any heist to play, or Arcade mode, where you play a never-ending raid which gets progressively more difficult the longer you last.\n\nYou also have different Character Classes, which include Health, Strength, Precision, Stealth, Balance, and Mechanics. Each one promotes a different style of play, from being a tank, to building various types of turrets. You also have two Global Skills which can be chosen no matter what class you are, and these skills offer buffs such as temporarily having an increased rate of fire, turning all ammo drops to medical drops, and the infamous Bullet Time. There are 18 different Global Skills to choose from, and each are all very useful in their own right.\n\nThere are a couple of issues however - pressing an arrow key (for me anyway) on the main menu causes the game to instantly crash. The keys are fine ingame however and can be used as an alternative to the WASD control scheme. There is also only one music track on loop ingame, and it can get rather repetitive.\n\nSo, to end the review, I would definitely recommend Cash_Out despite these two minor issues, as the game runs great otherwise and I've found it to be a lot of fun. It's incredibly cheap also (almost a heist in itself) and more content should be on the way in the near future (it is Early Access after all.) The developer is active in the forums and will answer any of your questions if you want to know more about the game or if you want to report an issue. Definitely worth trying out.","May 10","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got  a good box cutter, maxed it out, and now I one shot every guard I see, even though I attack so fast! And since I have the mechanic set maxed out, I have a turret that can kill a guard across the room in seconds. I wish there was a really hard mode where the place you were stealing from is huge, and you have to fight 8+ guards per room with a lot of health, And instead of taking the cash, you took loot. This would mean no loot on the ground besides basic guard loot (Nightstick, Gun, Riot Shield, Ect, Ect) Because the place you're stealing from has the best security precautions, so there aren't Diamonds and rare paintings on the ground.","April 18","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's more like Nethack meets The Binding of Issac, but not as good as either.\n\nSeems solid, but needs some polish.\n\nThe items were too crowded. In almost every room, when I finished they would be strewn with items. The interactions weren't seamless enough, nor was it clear what guns were better, so for the most part I would just stick with the guns I had, and only go for ammo and money.\nOn that note, you would automatcally pick up money, but not paintings or jewels. I assume this was a way to force to to sort through the stacks of items, but this was just too slow for me, and I would just ignore them too.\n\nIn this type of game, I usually play very fast, and very hecticaly. I really enjoy games like NOT A HERO, and Hotline Miami. I still think this game has potential, but it's just not as smooth, or as fluid, as either of those games.\n\nI would still reccomend this game, and I plan to keep playing, but I hope that the interactions are improved upon.\n\nEDIT-\nI have made a realization about this game. It is not like Hotline Miami, or NOT A HERO.\nInstead this game is very reminicient of The Binding of Issac, and Nethack. It is not a run and gun shoot 'em up, it is a rougelike.\n\nI'll point out the similaritys.\nIn 'tboi' you go from room to room, killing every room as you go. Once you enter a room, you have to fight all the enemys inside, or blow open the door to escape. When you reach the end, you fight a boss, and go on to the next floor.\nIn Cash_Out, you do almost the same thing, every heist is a floor, except upon reaching what would be the boss room, you instead have to fight your way back through all the rooms you just went through.\n\nIn Nethack, you go from floor to floor, killing monsters, collecting money, clothes, and weapons.\nAll weapons have stats. All clothes have stats.\nJust like in Cash_Out.\n\nBut Cash_Out is still lacking compared to those games.\nTboi has crazy items that radically change the game every time you pick one up.\nCash_Out only has weapons and clothes. No matter how unique a riot shield is, it's still just a weapon. And the clothes make stat changes, which is nice, but the game is still played the same. (on a side; the mechanics clothes are the exception.)\n\nIn Nethack, you had a greater goal than money and clothes. Enemys could be avoided, entire floors skipped in search of the greater goal of the amulet. It had greater depth, and puzzles to solve.\nCash_Out does not. Every heist is self-fufulling.\n\nAlso, i'd like to address the flaw with installing a stealth mechanic as heavily as it was.\nSteath is good for wide spaces, with many intricacies. You should be able too look ahead and plan a grand scheme. Cash_Out is composed of small rooms with ≤ 4 entrances. The enemys are generated on every room After you enter it.\nBasically, there is no planning ahead.\n\nPerhaps you could mitigate these probems by adding the ability to preveiw rooms before entering, and making a more complex floor plan than 'square rooms on an interlocking grid'","May 12","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I looked for days and found nothing that had what I wanted. Finally, I stumbled across Cash_Out and I feel all my wishes for a top down shooter have been granted. I seriously LOVE this game.\n\nThe sound effects are solid and kills are very satisfying. Music is great too and the levels are mapped out well even with the randomization.\n\nThere are perks, special abilities, custom clothes (a hat would be nice too but I will forgive this oversight :p) and you can buy a gun of your choice to start with (YAY).\n\nOver all this game is worth the money. Even in early access. I can't wait to see the final product.

This is the last straw! If anyone AND I MEAN ANYONE decides that I'm not good enough for them based off of faulty information retrieved from faulty sources (my dad, my mom, my dumb sister, or my teacher [what a ♥♥♥♥♥]) I will block you!\n\nThis is not a threat! It is a promise!\n\nYou see, as far back as I could remember people were always picking on me for the clothes I wore. "Hey, why are you wearing that dumb shirt when it looks so stupid!" they would say. When I tried to explain to them what my shirt meant, they only laughed harder. The filthy sows known as my "classmates" (ugh, it pains me to call them mates...) tormented me from day one, just because of my love for anime. I wore the same shirt everyday (It never got dirty, so I didn't NEED to wash it, OK? it's not like I DIDN'T WANT to wash it!) and it said "Dattebayo~!" on it. Any hardcore geek, nerd, or hardcore anime fan knows where this came from; if you don't know then stop reading right now, because you don't deserve to read what I have to say. This shirt was mocked by everyone. When I sat down at a lunchtable, the sows would bully me until either I got up and left or they got up and left. I always enjoyed watching them leave because I knew that they feared me, deep down they knew I could snap.\n\nYou see, I have a secret. I may look like the nicest guy you've ever met... but deep down I can be so ♥♥♥♥ed up... One time, my sister broke into my room and began to take money from me. The ♥♥♥♥ (as I like to call her) said that she needed it "for gas" but I knew that she was an addict and she was going to use the money to buy weed. I denied her the money and she got angry (like all addicts do when denied access to their drug) and she eventually began to beat me. I shielded myself from the blows and eventually gained control of the situation. She was kicking and screaming so I pinned her down on my bed. Sweat dripped from my face onto her quivering lips as we exchanged glances. Suddenly I felt an urge I never felt before. My heart began to race as I thought about the possibilities. I leaned in, and she tried to turn away but it was no use, she gave into my power. That was the day I finally lost the thing all my other class"mates" lost at their drunken parties... my sanity. You see, I hooked my arms around her torso, stood her up, and gave her an overhead belly-to-belly suplex onto the floor below. She immediately ran to my parents and told them what happened and threatened to take my computer away.\n\nMy computer is my life, and my "parents" know that. If you try to take my life away, I'll fight you to my last breath. I proceeded to run away, with my computer, far into the woods. Unfortunately, there are no power outlets in the woods so I returned about 15 minutes later. I told them "You see, what happens?! When you want to kill me, I can get away easily!" but they acted like they didn't even notice that I had run away. I was too smart for their little games though... they didn't fool me.\n\nWhere was I? Ah yes, Naruto. I have some major problems with this series despite loving it to death (I even married Sakura [yes, the actual Sakura from Naruto] this summer). First of all, why would Sasuke... hold up, my pizza rolls are done. brb","May 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 39 people (18%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","18","7","39","14","0"
