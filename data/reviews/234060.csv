Funny how picky we can be when it comes to specifics with regards to history in our war games! When Steam had a 50% sale recently just could not resist in spite of the negative reviews.\nThe gameplay info is definitely lacking for firsttimers and did not understand about capturing the towers...first game I was destroyed in short order. Then after watching the walkthrough video posted on youtube suddenly everything became much clearer.\nI will say this...this game has gotten a bum rap in my opinion from the masses...mostly those who will not buy it in the first place...my opinion there is a lot of good gameplay in this especially for the price point. Its not COH2 but also not the price. If you dont need a heavy duty strategy game but need something to kill a lil time give this a spin..especially if there is a repeat discounted pricing done.\nPersonally I have spent a great deal more for a lot less enjoyment.","December 4, 2013","true","8.1"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","55","67","0","4"

I did purchase this game and was very disappointed at first. I contacted the developer and made several suggestions because I do see a lot of potential for the game. A patch was released with some suggestions that I suggested including increasing the zoom level of the game and several other enhancements. The game is definitely worth the money now in my opinion for $15.00.\n\nThe developer listens and is making the game better and will be implementing more updates in the near future. If they make this game moddable, which I believe they will, and enhance the graphics a bit more (vechicle tracks) which I believe they will, it will be an outstanding fun WW II RTS game. The game is very playable now and fun to play. Once other enhancements are implemented it will be a best buy at this price. The maps look great and the game play is very good. I only play scimmage, so the AI is very important for me and its plays well.\n\nWhen it first came out no, but now I say yes, buy this game.","February 15, 2015","true","10.0"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","40","47","8","0"

Then again, in this day and age, where Triple A titles with Triple A price tags are left wanting, we tend to turn to the smaller titles for satisfaction at a more acceptable price.\nIf you hanker for a bit of tank-rushing fun, with an RPG element (upgrading weaponry and vehicles, though not pre-existing ones - a nod to reality) and advancing yourself in rank then you can enjoy this ;little title particulalrly for it price now at 75% off.\nThere have been some patches, including the ability to remap keys (but not mouse buttons), and some degree of options (resolution and Low-Mid-High quality graphics) but don't expect tank treads left on soil, dynamic shaows, HDR or bloom - this is bare bones WWII tank rushing.\nSome have compared this wioth "Order of War", which is not even close in comparison, or "Company of Heroes 1&2" (once again, not even close). I'd say more something from the now defunct Westwood studios' "Dune 2" in 3D with a storyline plucked from Eugen's "Act of War" or the never-to-be-equalled Massive's "World in Conflict".\nAll in all, I'd give this a solid 7/10 and for the price, particulalrly on special, it's a top time waster on the surreal battlelfields of an alter WWII timeline.","March 17, 2014","true","0.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","3"

I played two games.  Both multiplayer against the computer, the first time I lost, but only because I didn't have the game figured out.  The second time, I had most of the resources and a heavy defense.  Then eventually I had all of the resources, then I decided to wait out the oppenent and see if he'd lose his resources.  No.  The computer was getting more than I was.  It was throwing 10 of the most expensive unit at me every 2-4 minutes.  Then I would try and move my units to the computer's base.  And each unit chose a different route.  So my units would get picked off one by one as they were moving to the objective.  This game is not something I would ever recomend.

It plays smoothly with no bugs that I could find at all.  Yes, there are some minor path issues that make you manually control some movements but it didn't bother me at all.  Other RTS games go much deeper and offer more options but at almost ten times the price.  The levels aren't easy and it does take some thinking and skill to beat the campaign.  Again, for the price you can't go wrong here especially if you're between higher quality RTS games.  It took me, roughly, 30 hours to beat the campaign which is really great bang for the buck.  Graphics are good and the music is good.  Controls are excellent and the physics play out with a realistic feel.  I wish they would add more content to the game but they would obviously have to raise the price considerably.  If you're looking for a challenging, low cost, RTS and you're waiting for a higher level game to be released, I highly recommend this game.  I got it on sale for under $2.00.  How can you beat that?","December 19, 2015","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
