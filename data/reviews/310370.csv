There's a bench and a trash can where you begin.\n\nAs an old man, you are at the same street, only lonlier and more unforgiving. It's difficult to turn, and the bench and trash can are still there.\n\nYou can tell that the kid used imagination to cross the road, and you can tell that as an adult and old man, it becomes much more gray and realistic. It basically shows you perspectives, and about how each one can affect mood or emotions.\n\nAs for the gameplay, there's no shooting, no puzzles, no free-roam. It's just walking around. The Way of Life is a game about teaching, not providing an amazing gameplay.\n\nSo overall, this game was great. It instantly brought me back to my youth, and how I thought all of the lines at my school was lava, and that I had to jump over it. Once I grew up, I started to step on the lines like they weren't a big deal. The game shows the gradual progression of how innocence can turn into realism and logic over the course of everyday life. I think it was a great game, considering the people that made this only had 24 hours.\n\nI rate 9/10, great symbolism.","January 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 332 of 375 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","332","375","5","6"

In the 7 minutes it took me to finish it, I felt emotion like I never had before. I sniffled a bit at the adult and old man, the adult wanting to buy candy, but he can't because he is bound to his work. The old man, slow, weak, and nearly blind, ignored by society for his ailments. The child made me feel happy, like everything was going to be okay for the rest of my life. After finishing this game, I spent about an hour in my room alone. Wanna know why? I was re-thinking my life. This game is amazing, I rate 11/10.

And it's very short, you will see everything in like 5 minutes. But there is a chance that it will stay in your mind definitely longer. Why? Because it shows truth about life and human perception in 3 different stages of his life, what should enlighten you. And as you can see in many comments here, it does its job.\nBut I'm little surprised of all those very positive comments here. Maybe I'm just to old, but I don't feel enlightened. I don't see here anything revolutionary. It's just simple truth, nothing revealing.\n\nVERDICT:\nIt's free and it will take only 5 minutes of your life. You have nothing to lose. There is also very big chance that you will be enlightened in some way. So yeah, you should try it.\nBut on the other hand, it may appear, that when you will experience this "game", you will have strange thought: "why all of those people are so delighted of this?". Welcome in the club brother.\nAnyway, you should give it a chance, just to see how it will affect you.\n\nLike this review?

But this has nothing to offer. This review will contain spoilers if you want to play it before reading, but there isn't really much to spoil.\nThe boy's section, with really ill fitting music, just has you finding things around your apartment to show to your parents so that they'll switch from an awkward 'fighting' animation to an awkward 'hugging' pose. Then it ends.\nThe middle aged man's section is really deep because it's in black and white because his life is dull. So deep. (Sarcasm) You walk a bit until you go down an alleyway where there's a couple fighting. You can intervene and there's a really terrible joke of an excuse for a 'fighting system'. You click the icons with questionable effect for a while until an ambulance (?) arrives and the character explains that it was the right thing to do to intervene and society is bad if we don't intervene or something to that effect. Then it ends. Not really deep, thought provoking or well written.\nThe old man's section has you stumble upon a couple of boys fighting over a toy. You buy another toy for them. Then it ends. Probably something else you could have done here but there was seemingly nothing else around to 'interact' with. The controls in this section are PARTICULARLY awful, so I didn't fancy wrestling with the controls in order to try and see if anything else was hidden away.\nControls weren't great in the other sections either. The low FOV, which you can't change, made me feel ill while playing.\nWhole thing completely lacking in substance. Took absolutely nothing away from it, did not evoke much of a reaction besides mild irritation and illness. Only good thing I can say about it is I like the visual style.","August 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 126 of 164 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","126","164","8","3"

Go play CoD, why are you here?\n\nThat said, this game is about the reality of three characters, The Business man, The Old man, and The Child. Each starting off in the same place but with different views. Not what they're actually seeing but what it feels like, thus making it a reality for them. The Business Man  sees a busy world full of more people just like him, probably having the same routine: wake up, go to work, sleep, and again and again each day. Which is why in-game you can see a dull scenery. What  The Old Man  sees is the world getting faster and him slowing, he is unable to see clearly and far. He's constantly tired and needs rest for just walking small paces. The Child , now this one is my favorite. He sees things how he wants to see them, with such bright imagination he replaces cars with dragons, streets with lava, street-walk markings as pathways to get to the end of what others see a destination, The Child sees a journey, and the joy it brought to me of the child's imagination as it sends a clear message of how life should be to anyone really. Life should be one big long journey from when you are a child to when you are "business man" so that near the end of your life, when you ARE that Old man there should be nothing but a grin on your face with the only thought in your mind, "Worth it!"\n\nContinuously reading and studying in philosophy, psychology, critical thinking, occultism, mythology, religion.

A good game shows you the struggles of individual characters in an intelligent and subtle way. This game shoves them in your face. On one of the 3 levels in this empty game, when trying to show the injustices of being a bystander to a violent crime, the protagonist basically broke the fourth wall and said "Indifference is the cancer of society." Additionally, when trying to tackle complex emotional issues, the game takes the weight away from them with circus style music. When trying to get the character's parents to stop fighting, there was just the same damn loop of happy music when a man is shaking a woman violently in front of a child. The puzzles are sometimes blatantly obvious, other times impossible, and none of them were enjoyable in the slightest. I get that this game's not finished; it's still trying to be crowd funded, but from what I saw, this game needs a lot more than money to fix it, especially when I feel like they should be paying me to play it.\n3/10","December 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 110 of 160 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","110","160","4","1"

This game is not for those who want something that they can spend mindless hours playing, and the finished game will most likely not be like that either. This game is meant for those who want a new perspective on things, that will provoke them into thinking about what life is like. I'm earnestly looking forward to what the developers will include when the full game is completed.\n\nSpoilers below, avert your eyes if you haven't played the game yet!\n\nThis game attempts to emulate living, by providing three stages.\n\nFor businessmen, you're in complete control, but life is dull and boring, just doing the daily grind for your paycheck. You don't have any friends, just fellow humans all living the day-to-day life of corporate America.\n\nThe old man is nearing his end, and is losing the ability to even walk. He sways his head as he checks the road, the cars oblivious to his presence. A bench seems to emerge out of the fog, beckoning him to take a rest before he continues his endeavor.\n\nChildren, full of energy, see life, every day, as an adventure. He jumps with joy, hardly able to contain his excitement as he approaches Sugar Realm. But first, he must face the challenge of dragons, hampering every step up the treacherous bridge. One wrong move, and he could plummet into the lava below.\n\nI think that these perspectives, although stereotypical, give an accurate look into the minds of people and their outlook on the world. It really helps to go into this with an attitude of an open mind, restraining any expectations you might have.","January 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","55","72","7","0"

The game shows how different everyone is from a young age, for a child everything seems to be a challenge, turning every small detail into from dull to exciting, being a work in class adult it seems like all you do is work, this is how it seems to be and being an old person shows that everything seems to be a lot slower, having to take your time and rest often.\n\nThe Game overall is fun, good music for each character and nice colour schemes, I give this early access review a 7/10, I found that the little boy's perception was a bit hard to pass.\n\nSince the game was made within such a small space of time there isn't much I can disagree with, there is only a hand full of faults such as the child's perception with dragons, business man can glitch a little when bumping into people when seeing a space even though there isn't anyone there.\n\nthat's all the problems I found.\n\nDefinitely try this game and you'll probably get a better review out of it than myn.\n\nOculus Rift would be cool on this game as well!\n\nAddicting indie game.\n7/10\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","0.4"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","38","47","0","0"

It really makes you think about the struggles that people view in life. You first play as a middle aged man, life is dull, you are tired, and you need to go to work when you really dont feel like it. Overall, you are sick of everything. Then you can play as an old man, you are slow, you get tired fast, it is hard to cross the road without getting hit by a car. Life for you sucks. Lastly you play as a child, life is amazing! There are sugar mountains, a bridge over lava, and fire birds. For the child, everything is colorful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/recommended/310370/","quantizational","Quantization","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/","894 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Way Of Life is a free to play, first person, indie game currently in early access as I'm writing this review. It is an instanced adventure game where you play as 3 characters: a child, a business man and an elderly gentleman. Today I decided to give the game a shot in its current state and I have to say, even with the small amount of playable content available, I feel it has a really interesting story to tell.\n\nThe first thing to remember is that this game is completely free. The developers aren't forcing potential players to pay any money for the game although they do mention a few times that if you're interested in helping to crowdfund the final product, you can do so here: https://www.eppela.com/projects/5016-the-way-of-life?locale=en\n\nFrom the moment I laid eyes on this game I have been in love with the art style. The minimalistic theme works especially well with the type of feeling the developers are trying to deliver with their gameplay and it genuinely makes spending time in this game's world very relaxing and atmospheric. It should also be mentioned that the designers of this game were able to pull off this art style for a number of different moods. For example when you're playing as the old gentleman, the game becomes greyscale and gameplay becomes more lethargic, the camera less easily controlled, whereas when you are the child you'll find yourself in colourful environments, able to look and move far more responsively. Small touches like this help to create a far more immersive experience for players.\n\nThe Way Of Life's actual gameplay content is lacking. There are only a few scenarios and some  of these areas feel kind of stunted and unpolished. I also feel that the way you transport between levels, whilst seemingly clever at first with the use of non-euclideon looking spaces, is kind of blunt. One moment you're immersed in a wonderful world, finding out all about the character you are currently playing as, the next you are standing in a white room, surrounded by a volley of doors. Jarring to say the least. Another noticible issue that the game's text feels inconsistently written, as if the text was briefly translated from another language into English. On a more positive note, the way the developers expressed the credits to the game was quite unique, dedicating an entire room to a modelled version of each member of the team. When each member is interacted with, their team roles are displayed.\n\nBut what is this game trying to do? What is the purpose of this game? According to the developers, this game started as a project for a 48 hour Game Jam where the developers had 2 days to throw together any type of game they could based around the topic, "We don't see things as they are, but we see them as we are." This says a lot about the game and the topic really shows throughout a playthrough. As well as learning about your character and how he feels, you are also learning about yourself as a person. The game often allows you to decide what to do in certain situations and no matter what you decide the game always tries to justify your position on the situation so you never feel like you made the "wrong" choice.\n\nAudio wise, this game neither great nor awful, you will find nothing particularly groundbreaking here. The music is very relaxing to listen to but in some situations it felt somewhat like psuedo music that didn't really fit the situation. Without spoiling any story plot I will say I found it rather concerning that there was cheerful music playing during a serious case of domestic abuse. Thankfully this only happened in a couple of instances, for the most part the audio felt very natural and added to the game's minimalistic and relaxing atmosphere. As a whole, I feel that the music does remain true to the rest of the game's minimalistic identity.\n\nThis game performed perfectly on my GTX780 never once dropping below 60 frames per second which is quite impressive for an early access game created in Unity Engine. I should also note that I played the game on the maximum possible graphics settings with a resolution of 1920x1080. Although there is no in-game options menu the game comes with Unity's standard video settings menu before the game launches.\n\nOverall, I feel that this game predominantly succeeds in what it has set out to do. Obviously it isn't anywhere near finished yet but assuming the developers continue along their current path I must say I have very high hopes for this game. The game has already succeeded in creating its own identity and is absoultely captivating to look at. The minimalistic style of the game and non-intrusive yet conspicuous UI features fit together fluently and create a wonderful atmosphere that will provide you with the desire to explore. Whilst the audio in The Way Of Life isn't winning any awards, it isn't debilitating the rest of the game either and fits the game's atmosphere. The hour of content that the developers have released was genuinely enjoyable and I really hope that this game is able to fulfil its potential. It is definitely something I will be keeping an eye on and I do highly recommmend that everyone follows this game's progress so that they may play the complete experience when finished.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nTL;DR Version:\n\nGraphics - 9/10\n\nGameplay - 6/10\n\nAudio - 5/10\n\nReplayability - 7/10\n\nOverall - 7/10\n________________________________________________________________\n\nYou can find more of my reviews on my Steam reviews page or here at my blogspot: http://quantizationreviews.blogspot.com.au/","December 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","0"

Spoilers ahead (although it's about a 5 minute game, so I'm not really spoiling much).\n\nYou play as a business man who goes to his office (?...might be his bosses office, not sure). All the other people are leaving work and jumping off the edge, lol. Then, you play as an old man crossing the street. You cant keep your head from bobbing, and you basically have to try not to get hit by cars as you cross to the other side where all the other old people are. Finally, you play as a child who crosses a lake of lava to get to a sugar factory where a giant doughnut awaits.\n\nBased on all that, I would say the game is an observation of how your priorities change as you get older by demonstrating three clear phases. Basically, that is everything.\n\nTook me about, oh I don't know, maybe 5 or 10 minutes to play through it all. Closer to 5 minutes I'd say as I idled on the menu screen for a few minutes as well and replayed the first one just to make sure I wasn't actually missing anything....also I committed suicide once (which is a game obligatory act....in that I always do so once just to see, lol). btw...that ended in a white screen. If you happen to do so, just hit esc and it'll get you back to the menu.\n\nApparantly this was part of a game jam, and will feature more levels and such at a later date. Noit sure if they will charge for all that or not, but these first three levels are currently free.\n\nSo, rating this game? I guess I would give it about a 6.5 out of 10. It was clever, but there wasnt really much there either. Later, if more releases, I will try out the new content and revise this review as necessary.","February 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","20","26","4","1"

The geometric shapes and colors and uniquely different and it's a nice concept. However it could have been executed better. Since the game is trying to get across a deep and meaningful message, the use of lengthy captions that shove information in the player's face is quite ineffective. The "puzzles" in the game are either blatantly obvious or impossible to figure out (perhaps due to bad planning of the player's path and actions).

In this game you have 3 characters and you can play through each of their perspectives. You can tell it is the same place by the bench and the trash can at the start of each perspective. The point of the "game" is to cross the road. Each perspective has a different point of view of the road. The first character, the middle aged man, has his way of getting across the road as does the second character, the old man, as does the young boy.

The story is rather dull too. It tries to make everything sound super deep, but really it is just showing what we stereotypically would think about each type of character: middle aged man=boring work life, old man=struggling to do stuff/feeling weak, kid=life is an adventure. Really not very true stereotypes either as I know plenty adults that are unemployed, plenty of elderly people that are actually pretty active, and nowadays many kids ae less adventurous and just on their phones.

It takes less than five minutes to beat and, even after replaying to make sure I wasn't missing something, I am left disappointed.\n\nIn the artistic sense, it doesn't offer you anything more than a thirteen year old philosopher could. Youth is vibrant and imaginative! Adulthood is bleak and boring, with people pushing you around! Old people are tired, slow, and weak!\n\nIt offers nothing beyond this. Does life need to be this way? Must be. It's the way of life, after all.\n\nTechnically, this game was awful as well. The major struggle with the adult is avoiding people blocking the crosswalk. Well, just walk on the road - you now have a straight shot to the end in seconds. Kind of defeats the point, doesn't it? Even as the old man I noticed you can just walk through cars, as long as they aren't moving when you touch them. As for the child, you can literally just keep hitting the jump button while moving forward and make the top nearly every time.\n\nThis game is also not optimized for dual monitors. My mouse kept leaving the supposedly full screen.\n\nMaybe this game has potential to be more, as it is Early Access. But considering its current state, why is it even on Steam? Literally five minutes to complete. This is not even Early Access, this is just a waste of my time, hard drive, and bandwidth. Be glad they aren't charging for this.\n\nIf this won any awards, I seriously question the qualifications of those judges.","January 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","45","76","2","0"

I didn't find the graphics to be visually stunning.  And  I cannot recommend it.\n\nYes, I am bearing in mind that:\n1.  It's free.\n2.  It was made in 24 hours.\n3.  It's in early access.\n\nBut before playing, please note:  the synopsis does not accurately describe gameplay.  There is hardly any "exploring" or ability to fully interact with the environment.  Exploring indicates that your character can move off a beaten path and perhaps find another way forward (you can't), and full interaction suggests you can change the outcome of the game depending on objects or people in the environment that you contact (you can't).  At this early stage, it's very limited on what you can do.\n\nOf course the game is going to seem depressing and thought-provoking if we aren't given choices as to where we go or what we do--but that's not the actual "way of life."  Since the game is free, play. You just might be one of those lucky people who rethink their life through this 5-minute, visually lackluster walking simulator.\n\n0/42  (the meaning of life)","January 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","26","42","3","0"

I really am.  Or at least the product of a fifteen year-old kid who bought his first Dead Kennedys t-shirt just last week.  Try this plot on for size:\n\nA businessman walks against the herd, who try but ultimately fail to push him in the same direction they are all going in.  He walks through a doorway and passes a bunch of similarly signed doors before arriving at a final door marked "Office".  End of "chapter".\n\nAn old man plods his (seemingly drunken) way across a zebra crossing, rests on a park bench in the middle of two roads, then continues his perilous journey across a second zebra crossing at which he invariably DIES when a herd of cars - presumably occupied by the aforementioned businessmen - gets impatient and simply runs him down in cold blood.\n\nApparently there's a child as the third chapter, but I honestly could not muster up the strength of will required to get that far.  I can only bring myself to murder so many old men in the course of a ten-minute play session.

It is at this slow paced period that you notice many small things placed near you - the bench, the fact that if you stop infront of the car for too long, they will drive over you :(  You some how manage to reach your place.\nFinally. as a child you see the world as an imaginary wonderland.

The three levels here have a similar goal in mind: reach the end of the street.\n\nIt's a little buggy. Move around as the "adult" enough and you can walk off the end of the earth, never to return and never to head off to your occupation. Move the wrong way on the steps as the "child" and you fall off. I found that even on the first step, far away from the dragons, it was as if an invisible timer was placed on me. I just sunk. Make it on the step and immediately sink through the step. Or the game was making it so that I was constantly hitting to jump over and over and over rather than timing it to miss the dragons. Hit a step and instantly sink through since it didn't like how I landed! Oh joy! Oh sarcasm! Oh wit! It didn't feel like a game at all, rather more like a button mashing experience that made my nerve condition flare up. Not the game's fault I'm not healthy enough to play, of course. At least I got to the end!\n\nFor an early access and free look into the first three levels, I would have hoped to see more than five minutes, more than just the controls of long (and forcing the player to hold it down) walking and jumping. It's a bit too rough with the mechanics for me.\n\nMost importantly, I look for story. I have no idea what's going on here. I don't know if the three characters are all part of one person or they're different people existing in one world. Maybe that's not important? Maybe it'll be revealed later on?\n\nBUT! It looks pretty. It's a nice start.\n\nAnd it's free.\n\nIf you have five minutes (or more) to kill, go for it. It won't kill you. I probably would say skip a full version because the space wouldn't be worth it unless it was tweaked a bit more. Not something I'll personally be investing more time and energy into, but hey. It COULD be something.\n\n","February 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

The graphics are ok but faulty collisions together with the angular aesthetic give it sometimes a glitchy look. Controls are straightforward (you really only use E to interact with stuff), but what you can interact with, or which parts of which objects are clickable, is hard to tell and you may miss stuff.\n\nThe "story" itself is very simple - I would say way too simple to be really enjoyable (and I would go as far as saying it's simplistic for the child's point of view). This adds with a sort of minimalistic approach to the text (which is otherwise ok) and many grammar errors to make you feel a bit pushed out of the game. I couldn't relate to any of the thought processes the characters show.\n\nSmoothing out the navigation (especially for the old man, that gave me motion sickness) and adding more story and interaction, could make this an interesting story-telling experience. As it is, despite the low price of nothing at all, it's not really worth your time.","August 31, 2015","false","0.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

It might make you more grateful for the mobility and/or freedom you have currently.\n\nWith more thought and content, this would be a better game.

The kid's world is exactly how I remember it, always fun and exciting. The old age world is fairly believable, everything changed and we cannot catch up anymore. But the middle age world was physically uncomfortable for me to play and I wish never to end up like that. Adult life brings problems and hardships, yes, but it also offers far more wonders than what this game shows, people just don't want to catch an opportunity by the hair and open their minds outside of their office walls. Combine the kid's and adult's worlds and get the most of it while you still have time so you have some awesome memories to remember when you're old!","April 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

The Way Of Life is a choice matter game that depends on what you choose to show who you are and what you are like, for example, for one level, you are a Old Man at a market, you can choose either to buy your food, or to buy a toy for two children so they would stop fighting (As you can see in the gameplay teaser) The game still has a lot to be fixed and worked on. One problem I have is when playing as the old man, you move extremely slow, to slow honestly, if they can speed up the character a bit, that would be a bit better. But the game also has moments when you have to run away, or go after things you care or fear. The game itself really does simulate well how people think in the game. The art style is very unique and much more different than the previous builds before it.\nThe game has a well created soundtrack at the moment. The game doesn't have voice acting through out the game, but instead has text near the bottom screen. As I said before, I do have a lot of problems with some of the game's mechanics and such, but I also have a lot of things I love, and a lot of ideas I hope to see later in the game as future content. The game is of course indie, with about 5 to 6 designers of the game. From what I can see, the game is taking a while to be created, but again, that is due to the lack of workers, so you may have to wait a while for new updates or such.\n\nHonestly, I love this game to heart, and would love to see more from it and the creators themselves. But honestly, wait until the game is fully finished, or near completion to play it, due to having to wait for this game.\n\n-Changed\n\nP.S.\nThis game is really depressing, and does cause some emotions, or may to some people, but just for now, just know the game is a bit melancholy and if you suffer for depression and or Anxiety, this may make you sad.","May 28","true","0.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

This 3-7 minute story shows the different aspects of an average person's life, and how when you're an adult everything's serious and no fun, and when you're old you must still toil through the depressing every day life of an office worker, but when you're a child, everything is fun and exciting. Your imagination is limitless. Cars are dragons, concrete streets are lava pools, the white lines are steps to a kingdom, and a typical building is a great fortress towering above all else.

I’ve honestly played this game for so long now and have not regretted one minute of it. Every minute felt like a complete emotional roller coaster; had my ups and downs with it as it brought a complete emotional experience.\n\nGameplay\nRight, I want to make this completely clear. The graphics in this game are not ‘mind boggling’ in any way. They are just perfect with the whole game genre. This made me personally think about my life. What have I done to contribute to society like this game has? But that’s one side of the story. Now to the actual gameplay; at first it’s anxious and very slow. As time went on I started to get the feel (both physical and mental). The music really makes the game that bit more emotional. When listening to the soundtrack and ambience of the atmosphere you are almost bound to sprout a tear in your eyes. The soundtrack was playing with the string of my heart.\n\nLevel 1: You’re a middle aged guy/woman or whatever you want to classify yourself as (That’s what makes this game so good, You are who you are in the game. You make your own character up and you make those around you up as well). The whole objective is to cross a road; by doing so you start to evaluate your surroundings (as you would in real life) and start to gather information about everything. Now by this you might be thinking this is really easy but it’s not! There are people obstructing your path: People almost holding you back from achieving your main goal and this relates to real life; No matter who you are. There will always be someone in your way trying to make you not achieve your goal. After you have crossed the road you will be faced with a building. What makes this building so special is the fact the building is an ordinary building. It has an entrance point (A door obviously) Now when you go through that door. The objective is right in front of you. A few feet away lays another door. What this taught me is that you go through so much to open a door. Close that and you may be closer to opening a new door. In this corridor there are about 5 doors each left and right. The door we want is straight ahead (no options to pick other doors) which is rather good because this is now teaching us that not only do we other options in our faces but we are almost forced to go with an option\n\nLevel 2: You’re an old woman/man. Your vision has went statically like an 1990 television not connected to anything. Now this is what really got me. The music has changed to kind of classical. Which really does bring the atmosphere more alive, as of the last level there where a lot of people crossing that road obstructing your path to your main objective. What really makes this emotional is the fact that there is no more people. There are literally 5 or so people at the other end of the road. This teaches us how some people die younger than other. That few people rarely make it to being that old of an age. Now the movement speed the old entity presents to us is very slow. This made me think he has a walking stick because we are the ultimate creators to this creation. Slowly we make it too the zebra. What really broke me is the true fact that 6/9 cars will not stop for old people crossing the road because the sole fact that they’re really slow at crossing the road and some people need to get places. Now we can accept the fact if someone is in a real rush to get somewhere that they can take a sneaky 50mph sprint through a zebra crossing not waiting on an elderly person crossing acceptable. But not 2 thirds of people. So we make the chance after 6 cars have just sprinted their way past. Slowly and steadily I placed the feet of an elderly man onto the zebra crossing and was walking ever so slowly. I just gapped it when the other 3 cars started driving (What also amazes me is this is set in the future as the cars have no acceleration and they can break in a split second. Technology grows on us every day.) By this point we are in the middle of the road which is in fact split by an island of pavements. Enough to have a bench placed in the middle. Now as an old man we have to accept the fact that we will get tired and exhausted pretty quickly. So that is why the bench is placed there. We go and take a nap on the bench for a good 1 minute and can raise up again and go to the next zebra crossing. And again the passive cars theory (which I explained just a bit up) is applied. The futuristic cars theory is also applied (Explained a little bit above). So the 6 cars pass and we take a sprint of faith to make it to that same old building we opened the door up. Which too us is a huge achievement with the length of time it actually took us to make it there. That’s the level complete. What really does get me is the whole truth behind this.\n\nLevel 3: You are a little boy/girl. This brings back memories of when I was young and I was full of creativity and imagination. You’re set on an island isolated and surrounded by which seems to be lava. Now to the left of you is another island that is higher above lava level than your island. There is a bridge connecting between the two islands is a bridge. A well build bridge (Brings back the memories of your younger construction days living out in the middle of nowhere. Had to find something to do so building a bridge was a fairly common exercise where I lived). The whole objective was to cross that bridge into into the next island which had a house with the door concealing this huge pink donut. Now this teaches us that basically when you go through so much at the end of it you’re rewarded. Rewarded with a sweet. You may be thinking this will be easy but stop thinking this way: There’s something obstructing our path and almost knocking us off target to eternal oblivion. If we are not careful we will feel pain. Like those bad mistakes you made. Not being patient enough and receiving punishment but with another chance. This really broke me and I almost burst out in tears about this fact but anyway. As we pass the main objective and make it to the new island we are faced with a building and a huge door and as we approach it there is a big spinning donut. At this point we are so happy in life to achieve this goal of getting candy. Then we walk and the game is over.\n\nConclusion:\nThe best game ever. 10/10 for me.

It has an interesting style of art and how each character's view of the world is portrayed differently, perhaps even deteriorating as a person grows older, and so does their view and perspective of the modern world we live in today.\n\nFor an early access, this is pretty good. It has quite a bit of potential, and I'm sure that the themes that the game is trying to display can be advanced further and get more in-depth.","January 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes you see life with another eye. You can live one exact part of life, with 3 different point of view, A kid, An active, working man, and an old man. It is clearly well represented. The kid lives an adventure, the mid-age man just lives life like everything is a rock, depressing and tired. The Old man just lives it like a dangerous place, where he's weak. 10/10.","January 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But don'lt "sell"it as a game, even thos it is F2p.\n\nAn option in STEAM with the genre"tryouts"would be nice.  I think a try-out is not the same as alpha stage of a game,\nIn my opinion ... Alpha staged games allready should have tried out before even making them.  The concept is settled and game gets developpped.   Try-out  is more like concept thought sharing.

That should be a requirement in all games! It has an interesting concept and is quite unique. I enjoyed the different maps and features in each mode (for example you could only jump as a child, or the elderly man had trouble seeing so there was a delay in turning) But there are some things they need to work on before releasing it.\n\n1. The order is mixed up. As a game that is meant simulate the different perspectives we have throughout our life, it should be played in the same way we live our life, Chronological order! Yes the child level is the most exciting, so they left it to the end, but it doesn't have to be! Playing as adult then elder then child just doesn't flow well. Call me picky, but it bothered me. I hope they adjust this when incorperating more levels.\n\n2. For now, it is too easy. The most challanging level was the child level, and that was mainly due to glitches in the game (like towards the end of the bridge the charecter often became stuck). The game does not take that long to beat, due to the limited play area. I hope when they add more levels (I heard there was going to be 20 when all said and done) it makes it a more engrossing experiance.  In addition I agree with other reviewers that there should be hidden components, or at the very least alternate paths one can take (like the stanley parable). After all, life is what we make it, I think including choice in this game could make it one of the greats!\n\n3. The adult level is WAYYY too short. I understand the message behind it (all that an adult is focused on is work, there is nothing else important), but that could be displayed in soooo many ways, they need add more to this level than simply walking into the building, also it is too similar to the elder level.\n\nOverall (despite my critique above) this is a cool little game with a ingenious concept. I hope that once more levels are added and it is released out of early testing it will be even better. I am going to keep an eye on this one and reccomend everyone else does the same!\n\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(and more to come) And when all three cross the road they each go through something difference resembling their age. The boy finds himself jumping on a loose bridge with dragons flying passed and if he doesnt land on the white (of a zebra crossing) he will fall into lava.

Awful jump controls if it wants to pretend to be somewhat a plataformer. I went for the adult night just to discover a (reaaally) tedious labyrinth. And when i get used to it, the time runs out and I have to restart (guess? Nope.). The old man's camera controls are just awful. I use to configure the mouse to a quite high response, but here my arm just got f***** tired of trying to look around. Yes, yes, you can say "but they are trying to symbolize that being old sucks", ok, I agree, but making the playability suck because of that... well, it sucks. Sucks hard.\n\nI get it. It wants to be one of these "meaningful" games that are so popular nowadays (and that I really love, truth be said), but this seems like a interesting idea with a mediocre art, bad developement and bad scriptwriting.\n\nOkay, I should say, I didn't finish this "game", not by a long shot (hey, maybe is one of these that "have no real ending", how would I know?), but I felt it didn't even wanted me to. Maybe I didn't had the patience, but if a "game" needs so much patience for the chance of being enjoyable, I really don't see the point of it.\n\nI can't understand so many positive reviews. Maybe that "ending/s" that I didn't see is really, really awesome. Or maybe the devs have loooots of friends to upvote. I don't know. I don't wanna know. I only know that I wont touch again this game even with a 8-foot pole. Never.\n\nPros:\n- Well, the minimalistic art is... ok, I guess.\n\nCons (pretty much everything else):\n- The movement is awful. In the old man's case, it becomes painful.\n- The "world interactions" are made of three vague sentences (expecting to be revealing).\n- No options to try yo make the cons less cons.\n- The music is... pfff, annoying. Not per se, but it's not fully integrated with the image (it doesn't need to be, but unless you want to use it for something very concrete, it's the law). The second time I listen to the music of certain level I just want to mute it (but I can't, because, you know, no options).\n- I didn't pay attention to the sounds. I guess that that means they aren't that bad. But I'm musician and I've made quite a lot of analysis about image and sound, and if I didn't mind the sound it's because I was struggling with (again) the playability.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have spare time and don't have any other game to try, go for it, it's free. But staring at the ceiling while thinking about when you should take your next haircut is less of a waste of time than this.","June 2","false","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I played all the characters and all the available levels and checked all the available doors. The settings door has nothing behind it btw. I actually thought this game would be more of a coherent role-playing game, where I play as this guy from when he was a kid up to where he was an old man. I guess I still get that, but the layout is different, which isn't bad; it's unique actually. I like how the mirror and shower glass looks in this game, amazingly beautiful and creative. There isn't much to this game atm though. I know it's early access but it needs a bit more substance for each character imo; maybe have a storyline mode where you play out large portions/significant parts of the characters' lives. That'd be kool to see.\n\nGood work though, I like this game and expect great things from it :D","October 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Usually when I get into a game like this I get confused very easily. But once I replayed it I understood what the messege was. When you're a kid you think life is an adventure where you think that everything goal is epic from the first step to the last. As an adult you don't see that. You see how strict and gritty life really is. And then theres the old man who is ignored by society. This game deserves a medal for showing us how life really is.","January 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I highly recommend this game, not just for the main 'story' but also for the message that passes to you. I cannot thank more the developers of this game for bringing such obvious things on context.

You make it into his office, and you realize something. You just got old.\n\nYou realize that the skin on your face starts drooping and you need to get to the plastic surgeon clinic to fix this problem. But the traffic is equivalent to that of a highway, and you cannot rely on stoplights or crossing guards to help yourself, the poor man, get across this highway. But you feel exhausted, and need to sit down to take a sniff of your hallucination inducing wrinkle cream.

I played all the characters and all the available levels and checked all the available doors. The settings door has nothing behind it btw. I actually thought this game would be more of a coherent role-playing game, where I play as this guy from when he was a kid up to where he was an old man. I guess I still get that, but the layout is different, which isn't bad; it's unique actually. I like how the mirror and shower glass looks in this game, amazingly beautiful and creative. There isn't much to this game atm though. I know it's early access but it needs a bit more substance for each character imo; maybe have a storyline mode where you play out large portions/significant parts of the characters' lives. That'd be kool to see.\n\nGood work though, I like this game and expect great things from it :D","October 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

They're hard to explain, they have 3D geometric elements to them which makes it a little more interesting rather than just a flat basic color but still, over all very simple.\n-Animation: Again, very simple. You interact with objects but only words or phrases appear. If you happen to pick something up its practically floating and doesn't show an arm or hand holding anything. There's one instance where you can choose to help this woman and if you do it, this was where I encountered the most animation out of the whole game (AND IT WAS OPTIONAL!)... It's basically a fight scene. If there's NPCs that are doing the animation, they're doing one thing repetitively. Very simple and basic and nothing in this category was very good.\n\n*Sound: 7/10\nThere's 3 different people you can play as, (we will talk about this more in a different topic) but each one has different background music. They're nice and calming. There's no sounds for interacting with objects. There's no sound for when the person you're playing is thinking or talking. It's literally just the background music.\n\n*Hours to complete: 5/10\nI was able to complete this game playing all three people in 25 minutes. I was wondering around a lot because I had no idea what the hell I was doing and didn't catch on to what I was supposed to do for a good 10 minutes. So if you figure it out faster than I do, you'll most likely finish the game much faster than I did. This is a VERY short game. Each "level" is extremely short.\n\n*Story line: 9/10\nYou play as three different people in three different sceneries. A boy, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man. (All men?) You're supposed to get a glimpse of how each age group sees life. It's a very cool idea and I really like how unique it is. I just wish it was executed better..\n\n*Gameplay: 2/10\nThis game is weird. The concept is good, but as I stated above I just don't think it was executed well. (maybe in the future, updates will change my opinion?) When you first start up the game, you're in the middle of a white space with a circle of doors surrounding you that you can't interact with besides the ones that have signs above them. One looked like it should be settings? Well it had nothing in it. I didn't test any other door you could interact with after that besides the actual game one.. Once you go through that door you can see the three different people you can play as. The child sees the world in full color, your mission is to basically get your parents to stop fighting. You collect things through out the house and give it to them to make them stop fighting. Then that "level" is over. Next you do the middle-aged man. He sees the world in gray (other than the intractable objects) he had just finished work and you have to make it to the bus stop to go home to your family. Once you make it to the bus stop or help the lady in the ally way, that "level" is complete. Last is the old man. He sees the world in light pastel colors that are still dull? I'm not sure how to describe that one. Once you help the kids who are fighting over the toy, you beat the "level". I understand this is supposed to be a calm casual exploration game. But there's literally nothing to explore.. You can interact with random objects or aimlessly walk around. Idk I love the idea of seeing the difference between the age groups and I love the subliminal message of how we perceive the world.. But this could be a really cool game if it was done better.\n\n*Price: 10/10\nThis game is free. Which is good because I wouldn't spend money on this game or recommend spending money on this game.\n\n*Overall:\nI really didn't enjoy this game and this is the first negative review I have done. But I will still include who I would recommend this game to.. If I was going to recommend this to anyone..\nAnyone who likes:\n>Free games.\n>Short games.\n>Casual games.\n>Simple games.\n\n**Note: I'm very curious as to why this game has "very positive" reviews. If you enjoyed this game let me know in the comments why you liked it. Maybe there's just something I'm missing?\n***Note #2: Yes, I do know this is a DEMO/early access game.. But if this is how the full game is going to be.. I'm not purchasing anything.","September 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","5"

The ideas present are somewhat interesting, they've certainly updated the game from the “cross the street and cry over your tragic morality” game that it originally was. Now it's a “Cross through and cry over your tragic morality” game, with a few more features, like more than one to different character models and graphics. Really, it's not a bad game—it's just that I really am ambivalent to the whole thing. Nothing really interests me and nothing really offends me.\n\nI'm also not opposed to the themes or ideas in the game. That melodramatic cry over death stuff actually can be done really well, I'm a huge fan of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Charlie Kaufman's Synedoche, NY, which are are exactly in line with the themes of this game and I love them. But the game itself presents these ideas that I think require a bit more skill in terms of story development and game development. I think there have been games on this subject and I think they've been done better.\n\nMaybe you should give a shot if you really want. It's just that I can't find enjoyment in the game. Perhaps I'm looking in all the wrong places and the people who enjoy it are connected and touched by the game in way I can't possibly understand. I don't know, all in all this game is a very odd one for me, I really don't what to think about it. I just can't recommend it because I don't think I have a lot to say either in favor or against. Most games I can come up with a specific fault but not this one.\n\nI don't know, play it if you want. I just really can't come up with anything. It seems pretentious to me, but some people claim that it made them tear up and there are so many things out there that make me tear up even though people call it pretentious, so I know not to criticize something that affects certain people.\n\nJust do what you will and come up with your own opinion.","October 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","1"

I can't give this game a positive review though since it's more like a short demo of the play style.\nEven for early access I expect more polish though. This is like a PRE-Early access game. Controls are clunky, and of 30 possible doors only 5 can be used. (There’s 1 door for donations, 1 door for exiting the game.) This means there are only 3 quick doors to check out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2yk2tony/recommended/310370/","2yk2tony","Yk Tony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2yk2tony/","553 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game tries to be insightful about how one expiences life during different periods of their life, those being an old man, a middle-aged man, and a child.\n\nThe two main differences between these three gameplay segments are the graphics and the controls, which boils down to the kid controlling standardly and seeing pretty colors, the adult controlling the same but significantly slower, and the old man controlling like a drunken toddler.  The graphics also get less colorful as your character ages.  The only thing you do in this game is get from point A to point B, where either imaginary dragons, buisnessmen, or people that need to learn what a crosswalk is, block your path.\n\nThe game is only 10 minutes long, and in that 10 minutes, the only food for thought is immensely surface-level.  Yes, I understand that old people are slow and that kids are full of life.  I am fully aware that the color palette's descent into grayness is meant to portray how as one gets older, life becomes a mundane grind.  Like, no duh game, that's common knowledge.  It doesn't matter how stylized you make the graphics, or how you use the gameplay to send a 'message'; those just seem like a veneer to hide how shallow the game is.\n\nNow, this isn't to say that I don't believe that games can't or shouldn't be meaningful, there are quite a few good examples of ones that are, (Bioshock, The Talos Principle, Spec Ops: The Line, etc.) but unlike those games, this one uses its 'meaningful' message to hide how empty it is, to the point where the dev didn't feel the need to animate 90% of the game.  The only think I find interesting is how the gameplay itself portrays a message, but, once again, the message is so surface level that it barely makes a difference, which is a shame since the only other game I can think of that does that is Spec Ops: The Line.\n\nAll in all, The Way of Life is a game that uses its poor message to trick people into thinking that it's more important than it is.  It does some unique things, and I hope that other games take notes from it, but don't replicate its flaws in the process.  I think it's a poorly made expirence, even with its short length and nonexistent price tag.  See what you think of it for yourself, but this game is a 3/10 in my book, MAYBE a 4.\n\nDon't waste your time.","January 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I click on "shield woman" and I end up punching her?  WTH?  Very confusing.  Also, the game description says that if you make the wrong choice, the game starts over.  Obviously, that doesn't happen.  Again, confusion.  Why does his story end when he makes the "right" choice?  Maybe I still want to take the bus home after my act of heroism, but I can't.\n\nThe old man's story... FIX THE CONTROLS.  I understand that he walks slower than the other two, but why would he spin uncontrollably when merely looking right or left?  Intolerable!\n\nYou've made a really boring game with bad controls.  I don't even understand what you were trying to accomplish.  Three ways of breaking up completely different fights?  A grown man refusing to get involved because of the domestic abuse he witnessed in childhood?  A grown man jumping in and punching a woman in trouble because of the domestic abuse he witnessed as a child?

There's nothing to lose atleast, since its free. It's a very short adventure, has a nice art style, although is quite laggy for such limited graphics. It's not that my PC is weak, I've invested about $2000 in it. Besides that, there's not much content. The game is about seeing life through different perspectives. The child lives in fear and tries his best to make things better, but doesn't know how to very well. The bussinessman hates his job, and just wants to be done with it. The old man is easy going, but has his fears as well. I believe it is the same person, but in different times of his life.\n\nThe only reason I have 40 minutes in the game instead of 20 is because some of the nightmare levels are rather frustratingly difficult. It doesn't require my thought, only a lot of time on something I'd rather not do. I managed to complete the boy's nightmare, but skipped the bussinessman's nightmare, as it was even more time consuming and the old man's nightmare required you to complete a QTE. However, that QTE will instantly end as you die the moment you stop running. So I skipped that one too. Besides, the ending of the little boy's nightmare was rather weak for all the action that happened before.\n\nI'm assuming there's a deeper meaning under the game's picture, and I have made several observations about what some things mean, like the floating islands outside. I'm guessing that represents that the outside world is unfamiliar, but not scary. Either that, or the creators just wanted to limit the player's roaming space. Neither is bad, it's better than an invisible wall without warning. I preferred the second set of levels much more. You can either choose to satisfy those who have enough, whether it's you or the children with a toy, or to help those that need it more, like the homeless man.\n\nBack to the nightmare levels, it's frustrating that you can only speed up the text that is said, but not the little cutscene and 'start' button itself. There are no checkpoints, and it can glitch out on you.\n\nOverall I wish steam had either a number rating option or an "in between" rating. I think you should download it, but don't have too high expectations. Look at the nightmare levels once, but don't spend too much time on them, unless you want to. Then have a bit of fun with the "problems in life" levels.\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT TERRIBLLLLLLE.\nTHIS GAME IS NOT TERRIBLE.\n\nIt's a 5/10. It's not enormously fun. The nightmare levels really hurt it, along with overall length. However, it's FREE. It's made by just a few guys as well. Please don't abandon this game though. It has some potential to show people a touching story. But just don't distract yourselves from the story with all this QTE crap and parkour stuff. It just doesn't work tremendously. Minimize the QTE, less jumping. A little is okay, but you went all out and it wasn't so great.\n\nGood luck to the future development.","November 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

Most objects in this game are able to be interacted with. This game also shows that video games are not only for fun but they can teach a lesson and they can also show us that Video games can also be art and a way to express yourself so yeah. It's nice to know that there is a group willing to show what life has in store OH and let me say that THESE ARE ALL REAL CASE SCENARIOS. My final rating is a 10/10 since I had a wonderful time playing this game and that you should play it to it is quite decent.","December 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil.

Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.","June 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","2"

I know it says controller but I don't have one of those... so. yeah. Anyways, about the game, THE PEOPLE ARE SO SLOW! They move at like, 3 inches a second. The levels are short and end ubruptly, and most of them feel like complete wastes of time. I understand the message this game is trying to present but they way they try and present it makes no sense. The dream sequences are insanly annoying, the little kid helping his parents doesn't seem to make anysense because the kid was in a fantasy realm or some ♥♥♥♥. The guy in blue in the allie way, what even was that fight? All in all, if you want a actually good walking simulator get FireWatch, that actually has a good storyline and even a desire to replay it, unlike this game.

You see how life can be for someone in their three main stages of life. Childhood, where your imagination runs wild and you have nothing to worry about. Adult-hood, where everything seems plain and basic and you're just another office employee. Finally, the Old, where you're the least healthy and people tend to ignore you, making you feel unwanted. The game shows all three of those stages in amazing ways. The Adult-hood charater having other NPCs that look the same walking in the busy street, finally ending in an Office. The old man where people (the traffic) completely ignore you, you barely see and you are slow. The child, where the street is a bridge with dragons and lava.

Being early access, the developers do have time to address these issues, but at the time being I could not even bring myself to complete the game. Some sections were so easy and linear I felt a tad insulted, while others I'm not even sure are possible to beat. At the moment, I cannot recommend this game, but I hope the game's quality will improve before it's officially launched.\n\nI discovered this game bored in the car a couple months ago. I had nothing better to do so I opened the Steam app on my phone and scrolled through my "reccomended." As a huge fan of the whole, "games are art," movement, so naturally I got pumped to play this game, and I added it to my wishlist to remember to play it; and.... I completely forgot about it until today.\n\nI'll get what I like about the game out of the way first: the art style is fantastic, and I absolutely LOVE the CONCEPT of it. I can tell that the developers put a lot of planning into the CONCEPT. It feels thought out, and I can tell they had a passion for the CONCEPT. I'm not sure, however, if the same amount of joyous passion went into the actual game.\n\nThe game opens, and you are a disembodied consciousness floating in a circle of doors. 90% of them are blank and do not do anything, but I assume they are placeholders for future levels. The very first thing I noticed was that, office-building grey noise that seems to be present in the overworld of EVERY first person Indie game in the last 3 years. Stanley Parable did it, and it fit the aesthetic of the game well. In this game and almost every other game, it makes no sense. It's such an overused trope at this point, it immediately took me out of the experience. It would've worked a million times better if the soundtrack for the overworld was instead some sort of ambient, godlike seeming melody.\n\nSpeaking of immersion breaking as soon as the game starts, the camera starts focused on a huge, out-of-art-style banner ad to support the game on Kickstarter. Ugh. Don't get me wrong, I like crowdfunding. But when your overworld seems designed for the sole purpose of making people give you money, you're doing it wrong.\n\nThe world the game takes place in is so unbelievably...lacking. I don't know exactly how to describe it, but everything in it feels so artificial. NPC movements are choppy and on an infinite loop, and dialogue spoken by the protagonists is so handholdy and "slap you over the head" with its, "meaning." The game would be better without any dialogue at all, actually. The dialogue is just terribly written, and none of the characters even seem remotely fluid. The nail in the coffin however, is the looping music. I usually don't mind short looping tracks, but this game's music completely fails to add depth to the scene. Dramatic parts have the exact same loony carnival music that the happy parts do.\n\nControls are terribly glidey: every floor in the entire game feels like walking on an ice skating rink wearing socks and ankle weights. But I got used to this: what I could not get used to was the old man character's camera movement speed. It is SOOO much different than that of all of the other characters. I understand it's supposed to make his movements feel older, but it's just frustrating.\n\nI get the impression that the developers didn't want to fall into the trap of, "walking sim," narrative games, But the actual game parts shoehorned in are poorly done and boring. Quick time events, hidden object puzzles, and floaty platforming add up to make the game frustrating. Also, it needs to make up its mind on whether I can jump or not. Several levels allow me to jump when jumping isn't needed to beat the level, while on others *cough the old man's dream cough* I found impossible since the jump is completely disabled.\n\nI am almost tempted to back the game on Kickstarter, (I'm sure that's at least partially due to their obnoxious and immersion-breaking in-game ad for it) but I don't think throwing money at it will fix the game. I simply think it needs time for the developers to work.\n\nA MESSAGE TO THE DEVELOPERS: as I said earlier, I imagine you are planning to add lots of new content to the game, judging by the overworld. However, I hate to say it, but most of the content already in it is buggy, poorly designed, and written. I LOVE your concept for the game, and I want to see it succeed. But PLEASE remember, small amounts of perfect content is infinitely better than 20 more levels of what you have now. I would legitimately pay 5-10 dollars for this game with the amount content it has now if you were able to fix EVERYTHING I've mentioned here.","April 4","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

This games has a lot of potential, considering it's still in development. There's a few hiccups that need to be fixed, mainly the puzzles, but it's pretty good so far. It's definetly worth a play, especially since it's free at the moment. The art is beautiful and even though the actual game isn't very complex and it's very point-and-clicky, it has a really interesting story that really captivates your attention, especially if you're more into story based games.","May 27","true","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GregFirehawk/recommended/310370/","GregFirehawk","GregFirehawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GregFirehawk/","61 products in account","I tried this game for about 20 minutes, and in that time experienced more than enough to write this review. Right off the bat, one of the first things you will notice, is that the english in this game is pretty bad. While this is easily over-looked, it is still very annoying when setting the room. Now to describe the game itself!\n\nThis game uses a hub setting where all the levels are set in different rooms, each of which gives you several different scenarios. After entering the room you can choose whether to experience it as a child, adult, or senior citizen. This dynamic in itself is very focused on plot, but is used in a game which... has no plot? A questionable choice, but not a deal breaker. The real deal breaker is what happens after: Nothing! Let me explain. After choosing the scenario you will be teleported to the area you chose, as the character you chose. From there you can walk around and experience the situation. Often times it is pretty bland and lacking, and the couple of sentences used to describe it into a sensible situation are poorly written.\n\nAt this point it probably seems like a game with a poor setting, and their are tons of enjoyable games like that, but that isn't the bad part. The main thing that ruins this game is that it's pointless. After entering the scenario you walk, or fly, or whatever it asks. It feels very boring and unrewarding, and after doing it for about 2 or 3 minutes you hit a dead end. And that's it. There is nothing beyond that. All you can do is return to the hub from the main menu, and try a different scenario.\n\nThe gameplay consists entirely of walking, but unlike slender-man and other great walking games, there is no point to this one. The entire game is designed around a poorly written, meaningless story, that can't really even be called a story.\n\nOn top of everything it is extremely buggy as well, just FYI\n\nSo you have a game that:\n-Doesn't play well\n-Is glitchy\n-Poorly designed\n-Confuses the player with lack of instruction\n-Is POINTLESS and MEANINGLESS\n\nNow I'm not trying to hate on the game itself or its creator, I'm just stating facts. Assuming this was made by a single developer, or maybe a small group of rookies, it's actually a pretty good attempt. However, you can't just turn anything into a game. You need to put some forethought into it. Checking you writing is also very important, and this game clearly didn't go through any of the essential checkpoints of game design. Avoid if at all possible.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE BUY THE PAID VERSION!!!\nI can only imagine how disappointed I would be if I had paid for this.","June 4","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyXVI/recommended/310370/","FluffyXVI","FluffyXVI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyXVI/","654 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have no idea how this game has 79% positive reviews. The gameplay is boring, the text is disjointed and is extremely lacking in gramma, and the music is the most repetitive thing I have ever heard.\n\nThe character animations are atrocious and are just tiny snippets being played on loop. The result is a shoddy and awful look. I understand that the game has a certain art style - and I do enjoy how the visuals of this game are - but the lack of effort for animations makes the world feel boring as hell.\n\nThe gameplay is horrible and I feel like it's a long chore just to play this game. Everything is just walking and pressing E on objects to do things, with very little guidance along the way. Your characters also move slower than a tortoise with a broken leg, which I can understand might be intentional for the 'old' character, but it's still not a fun game to play.\n\nIt is apparent to me that the developers do not speak English as their first language. This wouldn't be a problem if the message of the game relied a lot on the text. 'I'm so tired my oldness' is one phrase used in the game. Seriously? 'Why my parents put me to bed' is another, and there are quite a few spelling mistakes that I have noticed.\n\nThe game is lacking in content. There are only two sets of levels which is pretty poor seeing that the game has been released on steam for over a year now. A six man development team is also a pretty large team for such a small game, and I would expect faster content to be made.\n\nThe message of this game? Eh, it's alright. They're extremely stereotypical. The kid is afraid of a monster. The adult is afraid of losing his family. The elderly man is afraid of dying. It's not at all fun to play. The nightmare levels are atrocious and are literally just walking away from evil thing. The other levels involve walking around a town, and trying to stop your parents from fighting. The horrible presentation of the game completely removes the good part of the game.\n\nIt's also annoying how the developers are constantly shoving the crowfounding things in my face. The game is poor quality and very unfinished.\n\nIf there was one good thing I could say about the game, it's that the art style is nice. That's about all the praise I can give. Horrible gameplay, lackluster message, the most repetitive music imaginable, and a complete lack of polish.\n\nDon't waste your time playing this half-♥♥♥♥♥ creation.\n\n","November 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyXVI/recommended/310370/","FluffyXVI","FluffyXVI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyXVI/","654 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have no idea how this game has 79% positive reviews. The gameplay is boring, the text is disjointed and is extremely lacking in gramma, and the music is the most repetitive thing I have ever heard.\n\nThe character animations are atrocious and are just tiny snippets being played on loop. The result is a shoddy and awful look. I understand that the game has a certain art style - and I do enjoy how the visuals of this game are - but the lack of effort for animations makes the world feel boring as hell.\n\nThe gameplay is horrible and I feel like it's a long chore just to play this game. Everything is just walking and pressing E on objects to do things, with very little guidance along the way. Your characters also move slower than a tortoise with a broken leg, which I can understand might be intentional for the 'old' character, but it's still not a fun game to play.\n\nIt is apparent to me that the developers do not speak English as their first language. This wouldn't be a problem if the message of the game relied a lot on the text. 'I'm so tired my oldness' is one phrase used in the game. Seriously? 'Why my parents put me to bed' is another, and there are quite a few spelling mistakes that I have noticed.\n\nThe game is lacking in content. There are only two sets of levels which is pretty poor seeing that the game has been released on steam for over a year now. A six man development team is also a pretty large team for such a small game, and I would expect faster content to be made.\n\nThe message of this game? Eh, it's alright. They're extremely stereotypical. The kid is afraid of a monster. The adult is afraid of losing his family. The elderly man is afraid of dying. It's not at all fun to play. The nightmare levels are atrocious and are literally just walking away from evil thing. The other levels involve walking around a town, and trying to stop your parents from fighting. The horrible presentation of the game completely removes the good part of the game.\n\nIt's also annoying how the developers are constantly shoving the crowfounding things in my face. The game is poor quality and very unfinished.\n\nIf there was one good thing I could say about the game, it's that the art style is nice. That's about all the praise I can give. Horrible gameplay, lackluster message, the most repetitive music imaginable, and a complete lack of polish.\n\nDon't waste your time playing this half-♥♥♥♥♥ creation.\n\n","November 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It actually takes 3 minutes to complete. Yes, of course it is basically a very early access game, but I think it could of become a bit more complete to get people excited. Good news is that they are working on it which is great.\n\nHopefully they mix up the gameplay, instead of just doing similar levels.\n\nGets a thumbs up because of the uniqness and potential.

How to start... This Game is really well done even though it sometimes repeats the soundtrack over and over and its not very long. It shows some things about life and at some points it brain♥♥♥♥s you a little bit even though its just a small game. it has very nice graphics and is totaly worth playing it. Sometimes i felt the same as the character and knew how its feels. SPOILER | As you played the boy and your parents where arguing i felt with him because my mom and my dad still argue very often and i know how it feels... SPOILER OUT\nMy favourite quote out of this game is " if you want this world to be a better, you must first start making it better yourself"\nThis Game really really gets to you and really is emotional.

And ohhhhh boy does this game fail at that!\n\nSo I've been following this game's development since the begining, I never donated to it though because when I saw it for the first time the funding campaign was already over. And when i played the first public version i thought "Huh, it's pretty bad but since it's so early in development then it'll most likely get better" And it only got worse.\n\nSo ya know how this game has an emphasis on STORY? Well FORGET THAT! There's no character development, the writing is EXTREMELY cheesy, overly-dramatic, and forced. The characters don't even have NAMES!\n\nSo if there's no story then what about the gameplay? Well I hoped you liked Superman 64! because the "Happy Dream" level for the child is LITERALLY SUPERMAN 64! (Just replace the weird cloud things with rings and there ya go!) Also i hate the term "Walking Simulator" (I prefer "First-Person Exploration") But this game only falls under the category of walking simulator. Especially for any of the old man levels, because one of the levels he has starts out with some forced overly-dramatic dialogue, and then you walk for (And I'm not even exaggerating here) 1 FULL MINUTE to get to this room where there's more crappy dialogue, and then you have to solve a puzzle that the game only ever-so-slightly explains. And the worst part about this is that it's a "3 strikes and you're out!" system, where if you mess up the puzzle 3 times the game kicks you out of the level and you have to start COMPLETELY OVER! And finally there's the *almost pukes* Quick-time events..... But I won't even go into detail about those.\n\nIs there really even ONE good thing about this game? Well luckily there is. The music is good. (Nothing amazing, just good) And the artstyle is ok, but like everything else it just seems lazy.\n\nOverall, this game is a steaming pile of smelly garbage left to rot in an alleyway somewhere.\n-3/5 (it's not a -5/5 because the music is decent.)","June 2","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

About 50 MB and takes about 3-5 minutes to complete.\n\nAs a child you have energy and crossing the street is presented in a way that makes it interesting and fun. You start on a grassy medow (sidewalk) that is occupied by a bench and trash bin. You cross the rope bridge (street) while dodging dragons (cars) in order to reach the donut (destination). The child tries to use his imagination to make life fun.\n\nThe business man has to make his way to work through the rush of people. He starts on the sidewalk with a bench and trash bin and has to navigate his way around the faceless people to his workplace. Once he gets to the entrance of the workplace, there is a candy vendor that reminds him of his childhood which he cannot relive. It is inaccessible to the businessman and he continues into a hallway surrounded by markless doors and at the end a door titled "Office." The business man does not appreciate his job and is just waiting for the day to be over with.\n\nThe old man is weak as ♥♥♥♥ and has to cross a street in order to get a to a door filled with other old people (death). He starts on a sidewalk with a bench and trash bin. Crossing is very difficult as the cars (life) pass by and stop at intervals. The player has to time his crosses and once he reaches the median, a barrier will tell the old man to rest for 30 seconds at a nearby bench with a trash bin. Afterwards the player will have to cross the final street and reach his destination (death).","January 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even the main menu takes a while to understand because it involves walking around an empty space and going into rooms to select what you want.\n\nThe game may have a deep premise but you can't think too hard about it because of all the dull gameplay you have to complete. Finding where to go and doing a scavenger hunt would be more fun if the world was more interesting and your movement speed was a bit faster.\n\nAnyway, some people might enjoy this game but I really feel like it was a chore to complete.\n\n(Also, I'm not sure what is up with the official Steam videos for this game. One video spoils 2/3 of the game and shows exactly where to go, while the other video shows some levels that were never available for me to play)","August 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The player is presented with the how a child, an adult, and a senior citizen veiw the world. This formula has been copy pasted time and time again. There is nothing interesting about and as soon as I saw this in my queue I already knew how it was going to go from the screen shots. While the gameplay tries to be a tad challenging to keep you engaged, it is ultimately quite boring. I felt no emotional impact from this game. The art style is nice but far from anything noteworthy. If this game took the same philosophy and put a twist on it, maybe it would have turned out better. For now, though I do not recommend you play this title. Hopefully it will have changed by the time this comes out if it isn't just running with the Early Access trend.","July 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The buisnessman shows a man going through life but being held back by strangers and barricaded from a nameless building. There are countless times where the strangers around you will push and hold you back but you gotta find a way through it all to reach the end goal. Or maybe you're an old person who's struggling through life sluggishly pacing towards a goal that's out of reach because the world is moving too fast for you which could mean that the cars are a metaphor for technology and the evolving world around them. Finaly, the child shows sign of youth and imagination with the whole "The floor is lava" with birds trying to knock you off.\n\nPersonally, I think that the birds are really the cars and how the child focuses on being inside of a bubble, he doesn't realise the traffic around him. All of them are set in the same scene with them all seing it differently. So deep but so short ;-;","June 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I don't know how old that person was, but there are some people at the age of 90 who lift weights and are athletic, it's actually quite depressing. How society forces the bent back walking stick old age home culture on Italian old people. In North Korea they make old people work.\n\nThat being said my favourite part of the game was the middle aged part donno why maybe it's because I am in that segment in my life. I don't yet have an opinion on the child part because it has no message other than a donut, sure if you were a typical child then maybe a donut is fine for you, but some children are smarter than that and have wider asperations.\n\nReview from a 22 year old male.

I played as an elderly man who attempted to feebly hobble across the street.

In real life, this means that some kid got sideswiped by a car on his way to the candy shop and just kept going and no one actually cared.\n\nTo top it all off, the last stage featured businessmen mass-suiciding off of a bottomless cliff.\n\n10/10 best game.","January 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The player is presented with the how a child, an adult, and a senior citizen veiw the world. This formula has been copy pasted time and time again. There is nothing interesting about and as soon as I saw this in my queue I already knew how it was going to go from the screen shots. While the gameplay tries to be a tad challenging to keep you engaged, it is ultimately quite boring. I felt no emotional impact from this game. The art style is nice but far from anything noteworthy. If this game took the same philosophy and put a twist on it, maybe it would have turned out better. For now, though I do not recommend you play this title. Hopefully it will have changed by the time this comes out if it isn't just running with the Early Access trend.","July 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The buisnessman shows a man going through life but being held back by strangers and barricaded from a nameless building. There are countless times where the strangers around you will push and hold you back but you gotta find a way through it all to reach the end goal. Or maybe you're an old person who's struggling through life sluggishly pacing towards a goal that's out of reach because the world is moving too fast for you which could mean that the cars are a metaphor for technology and the evolving world around them. Finaly, the child shows sign of youth and imagination with the whole "The floor is lava" with birds trying to knock you off.\n\nPersonally, I think that the birds are really the cars and how the child focuses on being inside of a bubble, he doesn't realise the traffic around him. All of them are set in the same scene with them all seing it differently. So deep but so short ;-;","June 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

To start with, you play as a middle-aged man with a job in an office. Next you are an elderly man following the same route that your younger self did, only a little bit differently. Finally you play as a young boy. What's interesting is that the boy's snippet is the most different out of the three. While it didn't bring a tear to my eye, it certainly made me think of how peoples lives change as they grow up. Do yourself a favour and try it. Don't like the game? You've only lost five minutes of your life so no big deal, but I reckon you're foolish to say it didn't at least make you think on it.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent story (or lack there of, it's your choice)\n\nCons:\n-The camera movement feels a bit sluggish\n-Lack of content currently (as it is Early Access, expect this to change)","May 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The child is looking at his perception of reality, being happy and that everything is good, while the Business man must go to work while he's being taunted to buy candy, and the old man who is fatigued and being ignored by the people around him. The Way of Life shows you how people of different ages look at their lives.\n\n\n10/10 Its free, quick to download and will most likely look back at your life.\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To start with, you play as a middle-aged man with a job in an office. Next you are an elderly man following the same route that your younger self did, only a little bit differently. Finally you play as a young boy. What's interesting is that the boy's snippet is the most different out of the three. While it didn't bring a tear to my eye, it certainly made me think of how peoples lives change as they grow up. Do yourself a favour and try it. Don't like the game? You've only lost five minutes of your life so no big deal, but I reckon you're foolish to say it didn't at least make you think on it.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent story (or lack there of, it's your choice)\n\nCons:\n-The camera movement feels a bit sluggish\n-Lack of content currently (as it is Early Access, expect this to change)","May 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"
