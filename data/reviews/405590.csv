Going into the game with high expectations is probably what has given me a very neutral feeling about the game. When the game opened up there were no options to change anything and I was stuck on a full screened weird resolution image with music blaring in my ears.\n\nThe game then is a platformer with a unique twist of controlling two characters at the same time. One character is the tank and the other is the damage person. The games movement can easily get confusing as you are assigned two different sets of controls from the beginning tutorials. With A+D (or arrow keys if you're an octopus) to move the characters left and right and W to make the big guy jump and spacebar to make the little guy jump. Then for defending with the big guy you click on the right mouse button and to throw the spear you click on the left mouse button. I adapted to this quickly though and after a few moments of failing quickly got used to the characters and buttons to use.\n\nThe game offered no resistance at all with enemies as you just hold the block button and throw spears like crazy. I will now list the positives and negatives of the game:\n\nPositives-\n+ Control of both characters is quite unique and difficult at first\n+ Music was very good, I enjoyed it\n+ Authentic Cave Paintings\n\nNegatives:\n- Enemies have been easy to defeat thus far\n- No options\n- Screen Resolution was weird\n- Game crashed sometimes upon start-up\n- Only six levels\n- Huge game size (3.7GB)\n\nIf there was a 'neutral button' I would click that but I am forced to click either Yes or No. Yes wins, marginally. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the art style and images from the steam carouselle, gamers who are not too bothered about the price and gamers who love platformers seeking a new challenge.\n\nI would not recommend it to gamers who have super high expectations (like myself), gamerswho find controlling two characters at once daunting and gamers who love to play around with options and settings. I have attached my preview video to give you all a better idea of the game without no major spoilers. (Just 15 minutes of me showing the game)\n\nAs always, thanks for reading! :)","December 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","5"

Hower with small enemies it can be pretty difficult to hit with a spear since you will quite often hit your friend in the back without being able to arc it upwards. With big enemies it's very easy to just stand there as nothing can get past the shield, and then just chuck a few spears. (Fighting the first "boss" the bear was very disappointing)","March 24","false","4.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Worth a look at, has a nice art direction, and for the price is not to shabby.","December 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/recommended/405590/","mijatodd","Waffles©","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/","254 products in account","For those wanting a video, I put it at the end.\n\nStone Tales is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Yellow Worm Studios and published by Black Shell Media.  It incorporates the use of two main characters with different playstyles that you usually control at the same time.  The plot is a simple one, where the two main characters must prove themselves to become warriors in the tribe and then save their familys from a rival tribe.\n\nThe games art style is very pleasing and designed to look like a stone age cave painting.  The minimalistic approach was a great idea.  I especially like the bumps and ridges that give the impression that you are playing the game on a cave wall.  The music is fantastic as well, a mixture of new age instruments with the older sound of what you think the cavemen must have made with their limited resources.  The gameplay is well implemented as the two play styles work well together.  One in the front guarding the one in the back who is chucking spears at the enemy.\n\nThe only problems I have with the game is that, mainly due to the coding in Unity, the game runs poorly when any other process is running in the background.  It made it weird for me to record, as the game keeps stuttering and dropping below 60 frames.  That being said, when there are no processes in the background the game runs smoothly.  The other thing is that the game feels very much like it was designed for someone to rage at.  There were many parts of the game where I could barely get past, and then I was confronted with another enemy in a difficult place, was killed, and set all the way back to the beginning.  The game feels like it was designed with someone pointing a camera at their face while playing for a Youtube video.\n\nAll in all, Stone Tales is a beautifully crafted game and I would recommend it to any who are looking for a new platformer to play.\n\nVideo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqXoZHFAvE&feature=youtu.be","December 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You control 2 cavemen on an epic quest; each has an ability that compliments the other. You move the characters forward simultaneously, but each character has a different button to jump. It's a real challenge at times!\n\nThis game reminds me of Brothers, but less advanced and adds a cool combat element to the mix. You use one character as defense and the other as offense. Each stage lasts about 20 minutes, so total playtime is around 2 hours. I didn't have any issues; I just would have loved some more content pertaining to the storyline.\n\nWorth $2.75-5; campaign is somewhat short but enjoyable! I'd grab this on sale!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

It has a great art style, and it seems to have a fantastic idea behind it. In this game, you control two cavemen as they travel through caveman times. You control them simultaneously, which means you need to seriously think about how you jump, and on paper, that sounds fantastic. Sadly, however, it doesn't feel polished. Jumping feels poor, attacking enemies floaty and hit detection poor.\n\nIt's a real shame, because Stone Tales has some serious promise, but it doesn't deliver. Maybe worth the £4.20 it costs on Steam regularly, but not more than that.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oq4hsPAr_Yg","December 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It has worked in other games, like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but in this game, the two brothers share the same movement keys, but have different attack and jump keys. The poor execution of this awkward concept along side some physics issues and lack of sound, makes this game seem like a project that hasn't been tested out well enough.","June 6","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
