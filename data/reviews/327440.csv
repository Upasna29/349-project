It's my own fault really, but I'm dissapointed. Looking at the screenshots, the game looks fairly good. Heck, it looks fantastic. I miss when games had such nice colours in them, and such visually enjoyable environments. Nowerdays, everything seems so dull in an effort to be more realistic.  Watching the trailer and seeing that you could pick up coins and stuff made it seem like this game would take some classic elements of videogames and that it could be a lot of fun. Sadly, even though I've only played through one full mission, I'm not seeing it.\n\nA bunch of people are probably already going to hit the thumbs down button on this review because it's negative, and they are fans of Avenged Sevenfold or something and can't accept the fact that they could be accociated with a bad product, but I am a fan of them as well. I'm not a hardcore fan of pretty much anything, but I enjoy their music, at least some of it. But you need to understand, I don't want to give this game a bad review, it's clear that effort went into this, as for how much though... I'm not sure.\n\nThe biggest problem, like it is most of the time, is just the gameplay. It's... well... there's nothing to it. Nothing to it at all. Do you like clicking the mouse button? Does that one thing alone make a game fun to you? Then I guess you might like this. But that's really all there is. There's no complex mechanics here for fighting. It's literally just pressing the left mouse button to swing your sword over and over, or the right mouse button to fire a quick magic spell. You can't even aim in this game, your mouse is used for clicking the buttons, and pressing "next" on the text boxes in the game. You do not, you CANNOT, actually aim with it. The mouse cursor is on the screen at all times as well, but that's not a big deal really.\n\nWhat is a big deal, is the fact that to actually hit an enemy, you need to walk towards it first.\n\nThis doesn't sound that bad, but when the only possible way to dodge attacks is to walk AWAY from enemies, this makes it practically impossible to avoid damage a lot of the time, unless you play the game as though you were a manual balloon pump, taking a single swing, moving backwards, and then moving in again to take another single swing, for however long it takes to kill a single enemy, which judging by the enemies in the first level, is about 5 seconds per enemy. With quite a decent number of enemies, combat becomes very boring, very quickly. If it was fun to kill enemies, this wouldn't be a problem. But it's not fun. There's hardly any feedback to your blows, and it just doesn't feel good smacking things around with your sword.\n\nWhy is it like this? Why is this game so utterly mind numbingly simple? Well, probably because this is a mobile port.\n\nYeah, a mobile port. Hopefully this made some of you turn away already, because you know how badly this usually ends up. Mobile ports of games don't really change the gameplay, and since they were made for mobile devices, they are generally VERY simplistic in terms of gameplay. Oh, and it used to have microtransactions, though those are not in here any more. Take that as you will.\n\nSo, what exactly does this game offer? It has fantastic visuals, that I can't deny, it has pretty good music from what I can tell, though not all of it really sounds like what Avenged Sevenfold would make. And the voice acting is... non existant. Punishment for death is pretty much non existant as well, as every time you die, you just respawn at a frequent checkpoint with no consequence. Seriously, not even more effort, as enemies do not respawn. Except for the bossses of course. And with no way to dodge attacks other then just... moving slowly... bosses can be somewhat annoying to a degree. As like I said before, you need to move towards an enemy to attack them, and cannot attack while dodging in pretty much any way.\n\nThe incredibly simple and obvious mobile port type gameplay is not something that can be overlooked, and leaves this as a very boring and occasionally frusterating game. It's a shame really. I did not have high hopes for this, but it looked good from the screenshots. It ends up being more of a chore than a fun game. If only it was a bit more complex, or at least made it fun to kill things, this could have been good... but alas, it is not.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

The areas are fun to explore, it's fun to scramble after coins showering out of chests, and fun to run through the spikey logs and acid spewing statues.\n\nThe repeatable bonus stages seem to be where you make most of the money so make sure to find the 3 bats in each area to open them up.\n\nEdit: I finished it on normal in about 5.8 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xevvy/recommended/327440/","Xevvy","Xevon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xevvy/","479 products in account","For those who've played the mobile version and are wanting to know what to expect from the Steam version, the answer is nothing more, nothing less. It's the exact same game in every way. There are no graphical options, the resolution defaults to your desktop resolution. The UI is still decidedly touch oriented, and gamepad support is lackluster requiring you to reach for the mouse every time a menu or pop-up box appears. You won't be playing this on your couch undisturbed. But it is a fairly smooth port that looks and runs about the same as its mobile counterpart. You won't be impressed, nor will you be disappointed.\n\nFor those who have yet to play it and want to know what the fuss is all about, the answer is not much. Hail to the King: Deathbat claims to draw inspiration from games like Diablo and Legend of Zelda, yet it sheds some of the most enjoyable elements of those games. All that awaits you here is a linear hack and slash with one button to slash, one button to shoot magic and movement keys. That's it. Equipment is limited to a weapon and items are limited to barely more than health and magic potions. Most of the levels share a similar design, typically a dark gothic appearance and consist of decent textures slapped on low-poly models and maps. The games story is decidedly lackluster and the only time the games music gets good are when an instrumental version of Unholy Confessions plays during the boss battles. Outside of that, it's Psuedo-Retro sounding tunes with Arin occasionally bashing his drums over the top. Hardly a terrible soundtrack, but a waste of what could have been a memorable one.\n\nA rebuttal to the common prasing of the games difficulty: The game gives you five lifes and makes you restart the level should you lose them all. Aside from that, there's no other real consequence. The game isn't hard by any stretch of imagination and offers but a gentle slap of the wrist for repeated failures.\n\nAll things considered, the games price reflects the game itself. It's only a few bucks. Feel free to dive in if you're curious, but be forewarned: there's nothing to call home about.","October 31, 2014","false","1.5"," 73 of 123 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","73","123","0","0"

But first, let me tell you, this game isn't like Skyrim or Dark Souls, so if you're looking for a "real" RPG like Skyrim, Dark Souls, etc, this game is not for you. This game is a nice port from mobile devices (iOS and Android), run smoothly without a problem on my crappy laptop.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple, move with WASD and clicking your mouse to attack and casting spell. The soundtrack is a bit funny, never thought they would make such song. xD Story is "good", not "epic". Anyway, never press esc button, otherwise the game will close instantly. The graphic is.. err.. whatever, it doesn't bother me so much.\n\nIf you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, and want to support your favorite band, buying this game is a must. But yeah, I won't push you to buy this. If you think this game is a piece of ****, leave it. But if you're not a fan and looking for a simple, adventure game, this game might good for you to grab.

Skill I have not used in a long time. You can tell it's made by a gamer for gamers. You need to be smart about how you attack and how you figure bosses out. Every level is different and a different game plan is needed, which only makes it harder. It's def not a normal FPS PC game.

Avenged Sevenfold, a fantastic Heavy Metal band composed of longtime gamers, decided that they wanted to write a love letter to the classic dungeon crawler RPG games they grew up playing. This is what  Hail To The King: Deathbat  is.\nThe game was made to play and feel like the classic dungeon crawlers, like  Zelda, Diablo,  etc. The graphics resemble those of the original Playstation, so some people may be disenchanted by the lack of graphical fidelity that today's gamers are used to. It's important to keep in mind that this look was done on purpose, and that it helps cement that fantastic retro feel. If you keep the right mindset, you might just be overwhelmed with nostalgia.\n\nEvery enemy requires a slightly different approach to defeat, the bosses especially. Beating this game is  not  easy and will require the player to get a good grasp of the game mechanics and enemy patterns. This is one of the reasons that this game is such a great homage to the golden age of RPGs; no hand-holding. This game will kick your butt unless you really commit to playing it well.\nThe controls are simple: wasd to move, left click for melee, and right click for your ranged magic attack, which can be charged for a large special attack that varies with the weapon one uses. The controls may seem button-mashy at first- and they kinda are- but this is not as unpleasant as one might think, because it gives all the more reason to really work at mastering the gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack is superb, and you'll have to play the game to appreciate it; not much I can say to do justice to an awesome band writing a video game soundtrack that melds 8-bit music with modern instruments perfectly. With every boss battle, a hit from the band's catalog will play in an instrumental version, accenting the change in dynamic and upping the energy for the intense showdowns.\n\nAll said, you don't have to be an Avenged Sevenfold fan to love this game. Try it. It's made for hardcore gamers and was created with the utmost love for the classics. Try it yourself, don't diss it because cynics like to say that a band can't make games too.","November 1, 2014","true","10.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/327440/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","(Review originally posted at www.apochs.net)\n\nHail to the King: Deathbat is a PC title that kind of surprised a lot of music lovers. The reason being? Subscience Studios had entered into a partnership with the Alternative/Hard Rock group Avenged Sevenfold to put out a game based on the Deathbat. The band also acts as the publisher of this title. Released the day before Halloween of 2014, it has quickly become one of the more talked about games available for purchase within the marketplace. But is this really a good game, or is it a better marketing piece that requires users to pay to experience?\n\nThe story to Hail to the King: Deathbat all stems from the legend of the group’s poor excuse of an Overkill knock-off mascot, The Deathbat. Well, at least that’s what they say. The game follows a king by the name of Andronikos, who banished the darkness from the land and kept his people safe until he was assassinated. He has awakened as a zombie, who is out for revenge against the one referred to as Dark Andronikos, the “new” ruler who appears as the original king in disguise that allows the monsters to roam freely within the kingdom. When you sit down and look at the game, this would make for a good stand alone title, makinh the fact that this is in association with the band Avenged Sevenfold really feelslike something tacked on for notoriety.\n\nHail to the King: Deathbat handles much like many PlayStation 1 and 2 titles, most notably games like Legacy of Kain with a top-down dungeon crawler vibe a la Diablo II on PC. You start off in one spot and make your way along the linear path to the end of the stage, sometimes having to solve small puzzles like standing on the proper pedestal in a certain order, or perform some kind of fetch quests like recovering certain gems to open up the next doorway and continue along towards the boss of the stage. For the most part it’s fairly simple, though some later levels can be pretty expansive, making the simple obstacle of the stage to advance far more time consuming than it ever needed to be.\n\nAnd, much like any Action title along these lines, there ‘s to be a certain pattern to attacking, but one that seems to be a bit delayed. Regardless of the weapon you are using, even with magic spells, your foe will be knocked back but require an extra second or two before another hit will do so again. If you’re not privy to this knowledge, you will end up having your ♥♥♥ handed to you more times than you want to admit to. Really, it seems more like an odd delay in queing damage than something deliberately installed in the coding for the sake of difficulty. Sometimes any additional swipes won’t even count, forcing you to have to pace yourself, or run around in circles like an idiot to avoid being hit while spacing out your attacks for optimal damage.\n\nThere are ways to help get yourself through the few stages that exist though, which requires a great deal of grinding. Coins are just as important to you in this adventure as health and mana end up being. Within the crypt, which is the game’s introductory stage, you can buy health and mana potions, expand how much of each you can have at one time, as well as buy new weapons. The costs don’t seem much at the time, but for one of the better swords that will maximize how much life and magic at your disposal, not to mention do a little extra damage, you’ll end up shelling out over four thousand coins. Considered the norm is one coin, once in a while finding chests or breakable caskets filled with gold coins valued at ten, you’re better off just hanging out in the early stages grinding away, not to mention exploiting the bonus stages that feature a treasure goblin you can take down for more money aside the lines of free cash in this levels.\n\nYou can also change who you play as within the game through the aforementioned crypt. As you progress and complete levels, you will unlock “friends” who are meant to aid you in the quest. These individuals are actually the zombie versions of the members of Avenged Sevenfold. Even if you’re not the biggest fan of the band, some of them do actually seem to have benefits you can use, such as quicker attack times, not to mention a change to the random one or two line voice overs like Andronikos’s constant “Wait, don’t I know you?” inquiry to random foes over and over.\n\nWhat’s more, there’s plenty of references to the band as far as the overall game design goes. The most obvious are the stages, which are all based around specific song names, such as “Bat Country”. There’s also song references in the bosses found throughout the quest as well, such as The Harlot, which comes from the song “The Beast and The Harlot”. Even the music is taken from Avenged Sevenfold‘s discography, touted as an original eight-bit score that actually just sounds more like a modern computerized version instead of that signature .midi format. Either way, fans of the group will definitely get a kick out of hearing these songs brought to interactive life.\n\nHail to the King: Deathbat is also a fairly short title. With grinding time included, you’re looking at maybe ten to twelve hours for a complete run through, making this a game you can hammer out over the course of the weekend. But, if you want some additional fun, there is a New Game + mode available upon completion. You keep everything you have already acquired as you go through the world with a different color scheme, fighting against enemies that have a little more life than they did in your first time through. With the right sword, health and mana maxed out, nt to mention remembering the proper attack patterns, and grinding for extra coins when necessary for additional potions and extra lives in the case you die, this new mode is still an easy run through. Of course there’s bonus stages you can unlock and pages to The Book of Mortals to be found, though neither seem to carry over if you take on the additional task.\n\nOverall, Hail to the King: Deathbat isn’t a bad game, but it’s not a great game either. There’s not a lot of levels, though some seem to go on longer than any real need, the hit detection seems a bit delayed, and a good couple hours of game play seem dedicated solely to grinding for gold in order to get what you need to reach Dark Andronikos. There’s very little challenge once you do get enough for a better weapon, not to mention maximize how much health you can have at one time. But, for a six dollar (US) purchase from the Steam marketplace, or less on other mobile device stores like Google Play, you get what you pay for: A good title you can plough through over the course of the weekend and have no regrets about.\n\nOverall score: 6.5/10","November 15, 2014","true","15.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It has that old school combat and movement to it.\n\nThirdly, I think the way they used their songs in this game was clever, u have "Unholy Confessions as the boss theme, u have the "Nightmare" chime sound when you open a chest and get a key, and many others. It works into the game great\n\nLastly, the difficulty is medium so thats good, its not too hard or too easy.  I find myse;lf running out of lives from time to time, or occasionally grinding for coins so I can buy a better weapon, but its not that necessary to progress through the game.\n\nOverall I reccommend this game, but i only recommend buying it if youre a fan of the band, or want something casual to play in your free time.

The movement and sword attacks feel a lot smoother than they do on mobile and you don't have your own fingers covering half the screen in this version. One of my only complaints is that the magic attack is almost impossible to aim in the PC version.\n\nThe cut scenes look pretty bad and dated on PC, but I suppose that's acceptable seeing as it is a mobile port (and a pretty cheap one at that).\n\nOverall, I'm pretty impressed with this game.

There are tons of references to songs and albums, playable characters from the band, and James "The Rev" Sullivan is a character in-game. Bear in mind that this is a mobile game that was ported to PC, so it's not of really high quality. Each map is different, and introduces new enemies. The gameplay is pretty solid, similar to Darksiders. However, the game's difficulty can at times feel artificial, as most of the difficulty stems from the lack of any real dodging. The only way to avoid an attack is to run the other way. The boss fights could also use some variation. I'm currently on the third map, and have faced the same boss four times. Three times it was the same mini boss as before, but with a different appearance and different minions, and the fourth time it was the final boss of the second map. I don't know about you, but having an area final boss the same as a mini boss is a major issue. If your a fan of A7X and want to support the band, pick it up! If not, then you could take a pass on this game.","October 31, 2014","true","7.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

It features as guessed A7X's songs in and some of their own 8-bit songs that can be hit and miss (my favorite is the level Wicked End song. Just damn) That being said you would think they would use the full library of their songs to its potentional and since this is the main selling point I will focus on it first.\n\nIt misses out using many of the bands tracks and during mini bosses you will keep hearing the same song (Unholy Confessions). I really wish they would have used their songs to the max. The songs are in no particular order: Nightmare, Wicked End, Beast and the Harlot, Little Piece of Heaven, Unholy Confessions, Bat Country, and Fiction. No Hail to the King, MIA, Sidewinder, Shepard of Fire, Carry on, Welcome to the family. Now while the song choices match the levels (each level is named after the song used in the boss fight, excludeing afterlife) they are just instrumental version of the song with vocals removed. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE nightmare, but I would have been blown away if they did all their songs in 8-bit format. seems like a missed opportunity to me. Regardless the soundtrack is a blast if your a fan and the actual level songs can be darn good (Bat Country and Wicked End are pretty good). Now onto the meat of the game, the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay in all honestly is lack luster.  W A S D to move, P to pause, and mouse 1 to hit and 2 for magic. The big burden that seems to hold this game down is it being a mobile port. Due to this it is rather simplistic. While simplistic might work on mobile easily, here it just feels boring. theres no real stratigy or tactics to the combat other than hit and weave away repeat till it dies. Theres no sprint, Stamina meter, dodge move, run, nothing. It just feels barebones and at times boring as you hack and weave an enemy to death. They do try to mix it up with giving your magic a secondary attack that changes with your weapon, but that just makes it easy to find the best weapon and never switch tactics.\n\nThe level design is standard with some varity of hidden goodies to find. The issue with some of the levels is most look very similar and ocassionaly on Unholy Confession i found myself lost for a little bit. If they added map of some kind as in the pause menu or an item pick up that would be helpful.\n\nThe secrets to find can range from easy to find to nearly impossible (how do i get to that damned chest in Afterlife?). The "secrets" themselves are some of the bands artwork such as City of evil cover and the bands logo.\n\nThe bosses range from interesting to frustrating. Certain bosses you just have to tank until either you or they die. *cough* Harlot *cough* other bosses can't be beat by the standard stab, stab, stab way and require some cunning moves to defeat which spiced up gameplay and made each boss fun on it's own merits. The final boss is not too tough unless you ran out of health items like me and tried to kill him on 25 HP.\n\nthe Graphics are not half bad for a mobile port. the art style works with the style the band has set up and stays consistant (one of my favorite map visually is Little Piece of Heaven)\n\nOverall for a band that decided hey we play games a whole ton lets make a sweet game and make it have some of our music they did damn good. They didn't stick to any of the bad mobile games trend and made a fairly difficult but fun hack n slash gothic 3rd person game. Good job A7X, but please next time you make a game have it be on PC and for the love of god add the full track list and maybe some 8-bit versions of the songs.\n\n8/10 not bad for a 5 hr game for around 4$ (currently)","October 31, 2014","true","8.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

I tried to point out the most important cons and pros.

I also beat the game to a 100%. Earned every achievement. So what can I say. This game is kinda hard to play at the beginning when you don't have so much money but later on it gets easier. When you have alot of money you can buy almost every item from the witch and you are pretty much unstoppable and then the game isn't so challenging but then again it's not so easy. Also, I think that it was too easy to get the Rev sword (but it was a nice idea how to get it) beacause the sword is overpowered and beating the nightmare mode with that sword was easier than beating the normal mode with a normal sword.  Awesome thing about this game is finding all the secrets hidden around the world and easter eggs. Also finding the final boss's weaknes on each level but mostly every mini boss has the same weaknes. Playing as band members ♥♥♥♥ing rules and using their special powers but again it's too easy to get the band members. This game is supposed to be a mobile game which is crazy because the levels in this game and the whole game together is so huge. IF YOU THINK THIS GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE DIABLO THEN YOU ARE WRONG. I see the similarity but both games are very diffrent.\n\nPros: - A7X references\n- Secrets and easter eggs\n- Bonus levels\n- Playing as band members\n- Awesome music playing in the background\n\nCons: - Pressing "Esc" exits the game without a warning\n- Too easy to earn the Rev sword and band characters\n- Cutscenes don't apply the changes you've made ( changing your sword or a character)\n\nOVERALL I RATE THIS GAME 9/10\nIt's super fun to play it. You are definitely going to like it if you are an A7X fan or an old school gamer.","November 1, 2014","true","36.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CallMeLongrod/recommended/327440/","CallMeLongrod","RevDrLongrod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CallMeLongrod/","58 products in account","This game is good, but needs to be reviewed objectively from two sides.\n\nAs a fan of A7X: The game is great. It's all about atmosphere, there are several references to the band that a seasoned fan understands, and even though the game play is linear its still easy to understand and the over all vibe makes up for it. It was on sale when I got it for for a buck ninety-seven, so very worth it.\n\nAs a casual gamer, there several things wrong with the game; the gameplay is linear and the combat gets repetitive, there could be much more variety for the "RPG" it's passed off as, and the story is decent but pretty generic.\nAside from combat being repetitive, it is often very difficult too. I've heard several interviews, and have the understanding that the game is supposed to be as hard as a classic dungeon crawlers, and it is, but the combat is fundementally broken. The magic, for example, has no reticle and I hardly hit anything. There are a couple good weapons to start with but there's no heavy RPG elements, like armour or character customization that make the game dynamic and replayable.\n\nOn the good side, I love the games atmosphere, it's everything I could ever want in a fantasy game. If you are a fan of Divine mythology type stuff, it's perfect. I also spent a lot of time on the mobile version, and I can safely say that this version is miles better, because of things like the character weapons being purchasable without real money, and dynamics of using a PC. So if you're not an A7X fan, but you like a dark, divine type of fantasy dungeon crawler, AND it's on sale for dirt cheap, buy it.","December 20, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenmicmarkey/recommended/327440/","kenmicmarkey","KenMicMarKey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenmicmarkey/","130 products in account","In Avenged Sevenfold's (well, really just M. Shadows) break into the gaming medium, we are given Hail to the King: Deathbat.\nIn HttK: Deathbat you play as a fallen king, Andronikos, hellbent on returning to his throne after the god of evil killed and replaced him with an evil twin.\nThe story, while laden with dark fantasy tropes and cliche's, is interesting enough, and while I never became bored with it, I don't feel that it is all that memorable.\n\nThe main character is supposed to come off as a cool and care-free badass, with cheesy one-liners included, which almost directly conflicts with the story, and makes him completely one-dimensional.\n\nCombat is simple as you only have two attacks; melee and magic, and your magic is based off of whatever your melee weapon happens to be at the time. Melee will be your main form of attack, but each weapon uses the same animations, no matter what style weapon it may be. The animation is fine for a sword, but it looks silly with anything that isn't a sword. It just looks weird when Andronikos is bashing the enemies with the handle side of the scythe. Magic, on the other hand, is ranged and very powerful, especially with some of the later weapons. You can charge the magic to do a more powerful attack, each charge attack is different, and the effects accompanying them are nice. While your magic meter runs out somewhat quickly if you spam the attack, your mana is easily recovered by simply standing near a mana fountain. However, the combat is too simple; each enemy is either affected by hitstun, knockback, or must pause for a moment to line up their attacks, and almost every fight plays out the exact same, no matter what enemy you're fighting: poke the enemy with a melee attack, run a circle, poke, run, poke. This strategy works on most of the bosses as well.\n\nControls are responsive and simple; they could easily be translated to an NES controller, as you only ever move around and have two buttons to worry about, melee and magic. On that note, you'll want to play with a joystick; I used a 3rd party (Rockcandy by PDP) Xbox 360 controller, as I found mouse and keyboard controls to be clunky, because all movement is assigned to WASD. There is the option to change the movement to different keys, but a point and click option similar to Diablo (which this game tries model itself after) would be nice. However, with a joystick, you have no menu control. You can pause the game, but you're still required to use a mouse to navigate the menus or use your equipped potion or item. I played on a touch screen monitor, so this wasn't as big of an issue for me, but it's still annoying and wasteful to drop one hand off the controller to do anything. You can switch melee weapons mid-fight, but you need to click on the icon with a mouse to do so, as there is no way to map these options to a joystick. It would be nice to have this option assigned to a face button, or even SELECT/BACK. But you won't want to use a keyboard as the game plays so much smoother with a joystick. It's an annoying and detrimental Catch 22.\n\nThe art style and graphics are well-done, but the Avenged Sevenfold logo of the Deathbat is EVERYWHERE. I know this is their game and all, but it's just too much. However, each level design is different, unique, and very well paced. All the levels with the exception of the starting area and world hub are based off of a song, and that song has been remixed to fit a neo-classical Castlevania style. More on that in a bit. There's plenty to find and do in each level, and while veteran adventure gamers won't find any of this to be completely new, I always wanted to explore every bit of it to find the games many different collectibles. But there are some parts where your path is obscured because of the environment, and these areas are very frustrating if there happens to be an enemy hiding where you can see. I hardly felt like my deaths were unfair or cheap while fighting an enemy, but a few of the many traps and obstacles contained within each level did. (I'm looking at you, falling rocks and rolling spike barrels.)\n\nThe soundtrack is very solid, but those who aren't a fan of Avenged Sevenfold's music probably won't find much to enjoy. Every level theme is a remix of one of A7x's songs, many to the point that it's almost a new song entirely. As I mentioned earlier, the songs are redone to fit a game, and they're done very well. They never become annoying or repetitive, and are almost nostalgic for those who enjoyed Castlevania. That being said, the music for the level bosses is whatever song the level is themed after, minus the vocals. The level bosses always have a little introduction with The Wicked End's interlude and bridge, followed by the level's theme for the fight. The mini-bosses are where I ran into a problem. The music behind every miniboss fight is always Unholy Confessions, and while I enjoy the song on its own, it quickly became repetitive the more I played, as every level has at least two mini-bosses.\n\nEnemies and bosses are plentiful, and there are unique mobs for every level, which make for a good variety of things to fight. Each enemy and each level lasts just long enough to enjoy, without ever feeling like they've overstayed their welcome. While the strategy to fight them never varies much, they're still enjoyable thanks to the different way each of them attacks. Once you learn the pattern though, each fight plays out the same way I mentioned above: poke, run, poke, and run. I didn't notice much variety to the mini-bosses, as it seems there are only two varieties: One that summons a bunch of adds and attacks directly, or one that puts up a shield, summons a bunch of adds you must defeat to lower the shield, and then attacks directly. You'll know when you find a mini-boss area, too. It's always in a large, empyty clearing that you can't walk out of once you enter, thanks to a barrier that erects behind you as you enter. Fortunately, each level boss is challenging and very unique, and each one must be fought in a new way.\n\nI hardly encountered any glitches or hiccups, except for one almost game-breaking glitch during the level, Babylon. I exited the game mid-fight against the first mini boss to return to The Crypt to buy some health potions, and upon my return found that the barrier that erects for each mini-boss fight had not disappered. I could not re-enter the arena to fight the mini-boss, therefore could not complete the level. I tried exiting and re-entering the game multiple times, and eventually had to lose all of the lives I had so the level would reset, and I could continue.\n\nAll in all, for a game ported from a mobile platform to play on PC, Hail to the King: Deathbat is a decent first game from Avenged Sevenfold. Avenged sevenfold fans will enjoy the soundtrack and art, and adventure fans will enjoy the gameplay. I can honestly say I'd buy a sequel if they were to ever make one. It gets a solid 6.5-7/10, and if the above issues with the controls, environment, and combat were addressed, the game would easily be an 8/10. Being a fan of Avenged Sevenfold will make or break the experince, but if you're indifferent about the band behind it, this could be a good budget adventure game for you.","December 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I won't bother going into the story of how this game was made, but it draws inspiration from such games as Legend of Zelda and Diablo. If you enjoyed those games, you will like this one. If you are a casual gamer, there's not much here for you besides the music. But I'll get to that.\nThe story has been called "generic" in reviews I have read, and I can see where those complaints come from, yet I did enjoy it myself.\nThe gameplay is not amazing for a PC game, but it was initially a mobile game, and from my experience I have no idea how anyone would play this on a mobile device. It requires too much precision that would be difficult to get on a small or even medium device. But, gameplay is smooth on its PC port, and it's easy to control.\nThe port itself is not what most people look for in a good port, but it did surprise me in some ways. First, it has no graphics options menu. In my opinion, though, I don't think it needs one. I could most likely play it smoothly on my potato [Windows XP that's probably older than you are] with little incident. It does not try to be hi-def or realistic. You play as a ♥♥♥♥ing deathbat, it's not going to be realistic. But it has the graphical style of some of the games it draws inspiration from, which is actually really well done. Second, it runs well. It does not feel like they rushed the port to make a deadline, because it is well optimized. Third, the options menu it does have is extremely extensive...for one thing. Controls. You can fully rebind the entire set, to anything you like, and you can bind a set of controls for a gamepad. All included. Granted, there aren't many controls for the game on its own, so this may not come as a surprise to many, but I was impressed by it.\nNow, more about gameplay. The map allows the travelling to several different areas (All named after A7X songs, which is awesome) that include different visuals and music, as well as music related to the theme of the area. Each level includes several boss fights, and each boss has a different fighting style and attack patterns that you will need to get used to in order to kill. It's obvious much time was put into this, although not enough to make it a triple-A title.\nThe Rev also makes several appearances, which are amazing.\n\nOkay, so if you want my final opinion, this game is amazing. The music is amazing. Everything about it is great. I have some small problems with some areas, like how some boss patterns are hard to avoid and some are hard to find out how to kill, but these all add to the overall difficulty of the game, and that is a good thing. I haven't found any glitches or bugs that break the game, and I enjoy seeing that for once as well. In the end, I'd buy it again.\nJust not for my phone. Don't do that.","November 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The N64-like graphics were definitely nice to see in the beginning, but after some minutes into the first mission, the game didn't even try to be good at all. Let's get this clear - I DO enjoy listening to Avenged Sevenfold and the music in the game is definitely a huge PRO for the game itself, but other than that, it's really poorly designed, in terms of everything. The story is not simple, it's close to absurd. The battle system doesn't feel good at all. The first bossfights made me smile, because - A simple way to kill them is to just run in circles around them and attack them, meaning pressing one button. You don't even need magic, though it's powerful. It's not declared to be an RPG but still it lacks some kind of character progression or anything similar to that. I mean, you collect coins and some other collectables to unlock pictures and such, but the only progression in this game seems to be purchasing new weapons. You can correct me if this changes at some point in the game. I don't mean to spread hate in any way or to just mindlessly bash this game - But even as a fan of their music (which at first made me ignore some of the game's weaknesses), I couldn't get into this game at all.\n\n+ Soundtrack is definitely worth listening\n+ N64 and PSX era fans might enjoy the graphics / design\n\n- No feeling of progress\n- Game mechanics (Battle System) are very poorly designed\n- Dull story\n- Inconsistent difficulty level (even during the first missions)\n- Gamepad compatibility doesn't work for all actions\n\nIf you like the game, I'm fine with that.

But you really won't have much fun.\n\nIt's... bad. The story is difficult to follow. It looks hidious. It has horrible shapes. Everything is just boxes and triangles. No round shapes. Tons of aliasing on the graphics as well. The cutscenes are ugly as **** The fighting is pretty bad. When enemies hit you, you get stunned for a split second. You have to spam attack and constantly move backwards and forwards to make sure the enemy won't hit you, or you will die really quickly. The enemies don't drop enough coins for you to both buy a lot of health potions (no regeneration) and get some decent weapon. The audio quality is low. Pressing Ecsape instantly closes the game. You can't die more than 5 times on a level, or you have to play it all over again. It's not fun at all. And I imagine Avenged fans who don't play video games ofren will be even more frustrated.\n\nOh, and these powerful premium swords they were talking about in the trailers? Steam has no in-app purchases like mobiles, so you can't actually buy these swords, extra lives, or extra gold.\n\nI have no idea what dev A7X hired to make this game, but that dev should lose the rights to make any game ever again. They are either very incompetent, or very lazy. If Avenged wasn't involved, this game would get absolutely no sales at all. It's like something from 2002.\n\nI really love Avenged and their music, but good graphics and working mechanics will always be a number 1 in video games for me.

Its really fun and addicting, its challenging with the life system, but atleast it does involve strategy because of the difficulty, not like many new games. I love this game!","November 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The music is awesome and the game is great! The only bad thing I have encountered in this game is that the mouse cursor stays inside the game at all times. Other than that, definately worth picking up! Avenged Sevenfold foREVer!","October 30, 2014","true","2.8"," 20 of 53 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","20","53","0","0"

The graphics are like n64 graphics (which I am ok with), but the least they could do is have voice acting! It only has w,a,s,d to move, p to pause, and mouse to use magic and melee. If you want a easy game that a 4 year old can play, pick this up!","October 31, 2014","false","0.6"," 14 of 46 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","14","46","0","0"

Such a great game, songs are brilliant. Especially if you are an Avenged Sevenfold fan. Which I am 100%. The guys have done a great job. Highly recommend to any Avenged or non avenged fan. Even if you don't like Avenged, I reckon you'll enjoy the game! It's pretty much like Darksiders!","October 30, 2014","true","2.2"," 15 of 49 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","15","49","0","0"
