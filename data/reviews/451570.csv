Yes, it is like a classical cartoony adventure game, but with modern HD resolution - that's the one part of 'Demetrios' I certainly liked a lot.\n\n* A friendly hero! Bjorn is a nice and common person I can easily relate myself too :)\n\n* A story is VERY long, especially against the background of most today's short games. Expect many travels and some unusual twists!\n\n* A lot of achievements! And they mostly refer to many optional tasks and actions - so that the game would become even longer :)\n\n\nCons:\n* Humor. In fact, that's what could be surprisingly defined as both the greatest advantage and the biggest shortcoming of 'Demetrios'. The game is very funny sometimes in the best sense of that word, but in other times it offers just too much of 'toilet humor'. At least, for my taste.\n\nStill, it is defenitely recommended to all adventure lovers!","May 31","true","18.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/451570/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","Demetrios – The BIG Cynical Adventure is a very vulgar, and very cynical point and click mystery adventure game.\n\nCheck out my Quick Review here: https://youtu.be/unmDbFqUwMg\nThis game is NOT for those who are sensitive, or easily offended, and it’s not for those looking for a serious game either. The gameplay was what you would expect from a point and click game: you spend nearly all of your time talking to other characters, clicking things, fetching items, and putting items together.\n\nAll of the story and dialog was told through text, and character text bubbles. The story itself started off as a mystery, trying to figure out who robbed you, and why. There were several actions you could take that led to either your death or imprisonment, but then you could just continue from right before making that choice.\n\nThe plot wasn’t that bad, but there were some very goofy parts that some people would probably consider gross or offensive. The game didn’t take itself seriously, and even at the end, the still game poked fun at itself. The main character was a total jerk, as expected, but a lot of the other characters were rude as well. There were just a few nice characters that I actually liked.\n\nThere were puzzles, and mini games throughout the chapters, and some were more enjoyable than others, but none of them really stood out as being great.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I knew it was going to be very cynical, since “Cynical” IS part of the title, but I did not expect it to be so vulgar. It’s not that I have anything against tasteless comments or behaviours, but jokes about bodily functions got old pretty quickly. Maybe I’m just too old to appreciate all the fart, poop, and puke jokes, but I could have used less bodily function jokes, and more sexual innuendo.\n\nPros:there are optional (cookie) hints you can find in nearly every room, and you can use them if you get stuck (point and click adventures have a habit of making me feel dumb when overlooking the obvious, so the hints were extremely helpful)\nexcellent audio control options to adjust individual settings\ncartoon graphics looked good, and there were no noticeable graphical issues\ncharacters were unique had their own expressions\nthe game ran very smoothly, and loading different areas was very quick\ncould consistently interact with objects, and pick up some without even knowing what they’re used for\nCons:much more vulgar than expected; the fart, puke, and poop jokes get old quickly\nsome of the comments may be found offensive, gross and/or cringe worthy (but some people may enjoy that)\nmusic was a bit repetitive, and there were a maybe 2 or 3 times where the music stopped playing until travelling to another area\na lot of very loud and obnoxious farting, belching, and vomiting sounds combined with the constant typing sound effect when text is scrolling (but at least you can turn the sound effects volume to near minimum)\nThe story was linear, and the game took me about 9 hours to complete. Once you finish it, there’s no reason to replay it, unless you want achievements.\n\nOverall, the game looked good, played great, and ran well, but the humour is not going to be appreciated by everyone. Some parts made me smile, and nod in agreement, while many other parts were cringe worthy, and made me shake my head. If you enjoy point and click adventure games, have a cynical sense of humour, and appreciate crude comedy, then check out Demetrios - The Big Cynical Adventure. There is a demo available containing the entire first chapter.","May 31","true","11.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","17","25","4","0"

For example at the beginning there's a TV in your apartment that's stuck on the cooking channel because you lost the remote. Under that is a NES looking console that the main character claims some salesman told him it was a "New, Next-Gen Console" and that he felt scammed. Beside that is a DVD of "Snow White and The Three Little Pigs" that you borrowed from Tom because you love cartoon movies, because they remind you of your childhood but when you see the cover it's actually an X-Rated movie lol.\n\n- It's fairly easy to get stuck in this game even with the included "cookie" hint system. I got the game early so I could not find any guides to reference to so I was a bit confused at what I was supposed to be doing at times.\n- I felt like there was a bit too much backtracking, and it takes a long while to make any sort of progress in the game, especially when dealing with the police officer.","June 2","true","5.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I personally haven't played those yet, so I will refrain from making comparisons.\n\nThe game has no voice acting, so you will need to do a lot of reading, but I didn't really find it tedious as the writing is quite decent. The game got a chuckle out of me constantly. So far there hasn't been anything absolutely hilarious, but the humour has been constant, which is good. The game has got quite a good mix of silly and clever jokes. Although most of the times it's a comedy game, there's still a little bit of mystery and seriousness in the story.\n\nThe art style is a bit above average. I think everything is pleasant to look at, and I never really thought anything looked ugly, but it isn't amazing. The characters and objects aren't totally refined. I don't think it will bother anyone, but it's worth noting. You won't exactly be playing the game for the graphics anyway.\n\nI really love the music in this game. It's strange, funny and sometimes even a little eerie. I've only been to the first few areas so far, and they all share the same music. It isn't a problem, because it cycles through a few songs within each area, but perhaps if you don't progress fast enough it could get to you. I'm hoping the later areas will have more different music.\n\nSpeaking of not progressing fast enough, that won't really be a problem, as the game does a very good job at keeping you from getting frustrated. In many point and clicks, you just can't figure out what to do next. This game will clearly tell you your objective. There's also a button you can press which will highlight every single clickable object on the screen, in case you missed something. Not only that, but every single screen in the game has 3 hidden cookies. Each cookie you collect, is an extra hint you can use in case you can't figure out how to do the current objective. These are two very nice options to prevent you from getting annoyed at the game if you just don't know what to do. Besides, collecting the cookies is fun. It's a little dose of hidden object games. It's also funny to hear what your character has to say about force feeding him each cookie.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun game if you're into point & clicks. There's a lot of funny dialogue to read. Most objects can even be clicked on multiple times for more text, and even interacting with them with a specific item from your inventory can sometimes trigger something funny. I enjoy the difficulty of the puzzles, and the fact that you have those means of help in case you are stuck.\n\nRecommended!","May 31","true","10.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","13","21","3","0"

Fans of point and click adventures will be delighted to see some fresh blood in the genre, with fantastically risky writing and art choices coming together for fun effect.  The game is driven by a ridiculous sense of humor that defies classification.  Many of the best elements of the "Leisure Suit Larry" games are reborn here, excepting that most of the stuff that put off female gamers has been replaced with stuff that would feel more at home in "South Park."  Amusing mini-games are sprinkled throughout, including an optional hunt for cookies in every scene.  Searching for cookies is especially fun, and finding them yields more jokes.  The cookies also serve as the currency exchanged for game hints, which is a wickedly clever design choice.  (If you carefully search every scene for cookies, you should need fewer hints.  If you only need a few hints, and the game gives you those hints in exchange for cookies, no one gets mad and ruins the fun with a walkthrough. )  The story is fun, but almost incidental.  The real treat is wandering around as these ridiculous characters, doing ridiculous things.  This game was a good time.","May 31","true","47.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The story, puzzles and minigames are mostly uninteresting and exist purely as the vehicle for jokes: this would be okay if the jokes were funny, but most of them aren't. There's an overabundance of toilet humour, and none of it is terribly inventive or novel.\n\nNonetheless, Demetrios was very obviously a labour of love for its developer, and I'll admit to being hard to please when it comes to humour. Maybe this just isn't my kind of game. If you really, really, really enjoy toilet humour and vicariously eating things off the ground, aren't sick of fishing minigames and can play it in French, then sure, give Demetrios: The BIG Cynical Adventure a go. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good story, interesting puzzles or sophisticated jokes.","June 3","false","8.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What I really liked about the game is that it's self-ironic and does not take itself too seriously. Bjorn is a really … unlikely hero and it's fun to listen to his comments and conversations with other weird people.

This game is sarcastic & filled with adult & cynical humor. It's very similar to games like Sam & Max in terms of came mechanics. It is just chock full of satyrical pop culture references, bathroom humor & a whole bunch of ewww factor. The pun-based humor alone will keep you flying through the chapters. I couldn't wait to see what was next! At the time of this review the game is not finished & I have almost 9hrs of play time. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, there is just really that much dialog and scene exploration!! Almost everything can be clicked on and give you a good chuckle (or a bit of a gag). This game is well worth its price tag and is exactly what indie development should be!! There are a few dialogue errors (grammer and such), at 9hrs in I have found 2. Which, considering the size of the game, is forgivable & may even be updated and fixed by launch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/451570/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTarget Audience:   Those who will ignore jokes that won't hit the mark, just to wait for the rare ones that do.\n\nSummary:\nDemetrios – The Big Cynical Adventure for me was a bad case of spaghetti strategy. It goes for a ton of jokes, almost a joke in four fifths of the items to interact with, and it will drown you in jokes that you may not find funny. It doesn't understand that a good joke looks great when you have serious or non-joking parts, to make the peaks of its humor look much better. Instead, what you get here is a long drawn out series of jokes that didn't do it for me, and it wasn't helped by some off the wall logic with some of the puzzles. Seriously, thank god there was a hint system, because I didn't have the patience to deal with some of the stretched logic here. Despite me enjoying the hidden object mechanic of finding cookies to get hints, ,and finding new ways of getting game overs that are actually collectables, it just couldn't get over the story and presentation. Now luckily for you, there is a Demo of the game. If you find the Demo enjoyable: I will say this is worth a purchase, as I find the first hour or so to be where the game is maybe the weakest. But overall, it just falls flat for me.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9jI04vWzGw\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe hidden object game with the cookies hint system is done well, and I enjoyed trying to find each cookie in the screen.\nThe game over system is fun, as you try to find ridiculous combinations to try to get yourself killed or make the game end.\nFor the price, you do get a reasonable amount of content in terms of hours played and the length of the story. There's a lot to interact with.\nColored highlight system does well to point out things and is easy to use.\nThe game has a demo for you to try, and it's probably of the weaker part of the game. So if you enjoy it, the game is probably up your alley.\nThere are jokes that do work, and it's usually in the small details.\nIt's all over the place, and yeah, that can work once in a while. It's off the wall.\nNegatives:\nThe jokes spaghetti approach has a problem: it's being fired from medium range. What I mean by that is: 3 out of 4\njokes can miss with every shot, and that can really get old with just the sheer amount.\nEven beyond that, some of the jokes are just.....bad. They don't work in context, they don't work out of context, and they just really can leave a sour taste in the mouth.\nAnd even beyond that, some of the jokes are really in poor taste. Look, I'm not going to call for them to be banned/changed, but a couple of them left me uneasy with their implications, and considering the game isn't really sending any message of any sort, felt like they were done for shock value.\nI'm not even sure what the games conclusion is trying to say. It seems like it's trying to make a point, but it failed miserably in doing that for me.\nSome of the puzzles have really really odd logical conclusions. You're asked to remember a lot of small bits of information, and you'll be using that hint system just to get through it.\nGame doesn't really teach you very well. That aforementioned highlight system was found accidentally.\nFor a game labeled “The Big Cynical Adventure”, I do question the cynical part. Of course some of the characters can be selfish at times, but it's clear that they are also good at the core.\nHonestly, I'm just not a fan of poop/fart jokes.","May 31","false","7.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroprincess/recommended/451570/","retroprincess","retro_princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroprincess/","16 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDemetrios - The BIG Cynical Adventure follows the story of Bjorn - a hapless antique dealer who finds himself at the centre of a mysterious adventure and a race against time to save the world. An Indie game funded by a Kickstarter campaign, Demetrios is a Cowcat production that is in the final stages of polishing before its release on the 31st May 2016.\n\nPlease Note: This review was written in advance of release day to tie in with the game's launch so there may be slight variations or improvements in the finished version of the game. Any updates will be recorded in bold as I find out about them. See full review at www.theretroprincess.com\n\nThe game is a point and click adventure game with puzzles and problem solving elements to complete. As a kid who grew up with text adventure games and point and click adventures, I was very keen to try a 21st century point and click.\n\nThe design is a clear and attractive comic book/graphic novel design that is consistent throughout. It makes for an interesting story telling style. There are few instructions but the interface is very simple and self-explanatory. the menus are very visual and show a useful percentage indicator of how much of the game you have completed. The controls are exactly as they should be - pointing at objects and clicking to either interact with them or put them in your bag for using later.\n\nLater in the game, you also have the option of using the arrow keys and space bar to play some of the puzzles. You have the ability to also unlock some amusing achievements such as eating rotten food or dying in the most ridiculous ways (the game over screens are tailored to the way you die each time which are good fun to "collect"). Items can also be combined to use in a different way if needed to complete a task. Occasionally, you also receive a trading card which are quite fun to collect and to read more information about the characters from the game.\n\nThe characters are a mix of mostly men, with a female "love interest" who later shares the adventure alongside the main protagonist, Bjorn. The characters are quite stereotypical in nature - slobby bachelor, dumb blonde annoying kid etc and can, on occasion, verge on the margins of political correctness. As the game progresses you encounter some innuendo, strong swearing and some clear misogyny which did wear thin sometimes as a female player. It's definitely for those with an open mind and content with some risqué humour!\n\nDespite a slow start to the game (the story has to be introduced and the characters set of course) I quickly found myself doing the old "5 more minutes" routine and losing hours absorbed in finding out what to do with a crow bar, how to combine items to make a cat toy, and how to use a graveyard to find shape sorter pieces. It's no easy task to keep this princess engaged in a game as I tend to have the attention span of a carrot. However it wasnt all plain sailing. Playing on my Mac, I had some stability issues that meant the game often crashed. Luckily there is a really strong autosave that regularly updates your progress. Edit: The game has been updated and the problem seems to have been solved! There were also a number of spelling and grammatical errors, owing I presume to the translation process from French to English. I think that during the final touches of the game, the  issues will definitely be solved and be no problem for the gamer on release day.\n\nI enjoyed scouring my screen for the "hint cookies" tucked away in each scene. This added something to do when you were considering your next move. Eating a cookie unlocks a hint for what you need to do next and are really useful for progressing in tricky sections. There is also a button to press to reveal everything that you can interact with in the scene which is handy for finding particularly well hidden objects.\n\nEarly in the game, some of the item intentions and combinations were a little vague or totally random. This definitely improved as the game progressed, through my learning the mechanics of the game but also the item intent was a lot clearer and meaningful. A point I found deeply frustrating was the need to click to advance every part of the dialogue. The comic book style meant that speech bubbles containing the text were small and therefore, in the longer character exchanges, it really stilted the flow of the story. I feel it would have been better to have extra cut scenes for these sections.\n\nThe game is visually engaging, humorous and challenging. It has enough content to make it feel enjoyable without being too onerous or complex. It was therefore nice to dip in to when my son was napping or in the evening when I wanted to relax with a cup of tea in one hand and the mouse in the other. I would love to see the early stages of the game have more puzzle based interaction such as in the last couple of chapters of the story (the graveyard and the temple are really enjoyable). I think this would help break up what is essentially just using items and following dialogue in the first chapter of the story. Highlights definitely include the ability to collect items at a fun fair by playing the games there, including being able to name your own racehorse. I can't tell you how proud I was of 'Horsery McHorseface' winning the race. Yes I'm a child.\n\nOverall, this is a game with a good storyline and some excellent interactive elements. Thought has been taken in the design with a consistent interface and feel to the game. The controls are simple and yet provide opportunities for extensive exploration of areas in the game. Items were plentiful and hint cookies could be used whenever necessary if you were not sure what to do.  There were very immersive sections in the game, but I think a few more interactive puzzles rather than just item manipulation would make the game consistently interesting throughout. A very enjoyable little game that provided me with 12 hours of fun and that would suit someone who already enjoys the point and click genre and has a good sense of humour without wanting an intense gaming commitment.\n\nMany thanks to Breton Fabrice at Cowcat for the opportunity to review the game.\n\nIt will be released on 31st May 2016 on Steam for $9.99. It can be played on Windows, Mac and Linux in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish.

Not bad for $9.00 (or Bjorn’s monthly income) and arguably worth the purchase.\n\nAnother selling point is how different the storyline is.

You will find cookies (3 per background) that you can "trade in" for hints if you get stuck. You don`t need to use the cookies but it will help you a lot.\n+ You can test the game with a demo\n\n+- Artwork is okayish but could be better in some situations (finer lining in some comic panels e.g.)\n\n- No synchronisation :/\n- music is repetitive (and a bit loud)","May 31","true","7.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

That's it, really. No, i'm not lying.\n\nPros:\n\nFart and bodily function jokes! For some reason people find this distasteful... It's a fart, poop, and pee joke... It's supposed to be distasteful. Never came across poop that was tasteful. Too much E.Coli, didn't like it\n\nStory! Yeah yeah, I put a real short summary up there, but I'm a lazy sod, so there. Read the other reviews for that stuff ;)\n\nArt! A little cheesy, but it goes with the game. Gotta appreciate a game where the dev is the artist.\n\nLength! And women say it's not that important, pssh.\n\nAchievements! It's been a while to come across a game that awards you for trying to find game overs.\n\nCLICK ALL THE THINGS!!! Seriously, so much stuff to click, so little time... Dunno why that's fun. I like that interactivity. Better than when you push all a person's buttons and they don't react.\n\nAnd minimal hand holding!! In a day and age where every damn game pulls your ♥♥♥♥♥ to every damn hole it dictates and tells you when to gyrate and plunge, this game just tells you where the holes and and when to gyrate... you best know when to do it on your own.\n\n\nNeutrals ('coz there are very little cons... unless you\'re uptight and can't take adult jokes):\n\nMini-games. They're not bad, they\'re good. They're not great.\n\nOffense! Because everyone has something to be offended by.\n\nlow replay value, because duh, it's a point and click adventure. Finish a mystery once, good luck trying to unsolve it to try it again.\n\n...yeah, that's about it.\n\nGreat game, 50/10 farts would poop again.","May 31","true","9.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I did receive this game for free, but that isn't the reason why I am giving this game a thumbs up.\nI'm enjoying the game, that is the most important aspect since why play something you don't like?\nI like the visual art style this game has, it's bright and the colors really blend well together.\nThe humor is quirky and makes you chuckle, but at the same time it can have those 'facepalm' moments which can be a little cringe worthy. That's how I feel about some of the jokes but that's just me.\nThe story so far is quite enjoyable. I have played for a little under 9 hours (at the time of writing this) and I'm only half way done! There are a lot of twists and turns in this game that makes you yearn to continue playing to find out what is going to happen.\nYou don't have to take my word for recommending this game, but you can definitely see my reactions while playing this game in my videos =) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678556826\n\n*edit- Removed an exclamation mark.","May 31","true","12.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is done by a one person developer team and the graphics are lovely and hand drawn.  It has just my sort of humour in it and it's made me enjoy playing a point and click game again.\n\nIt's a good storyline so far and it's worth getting just to see the delightful toilet at the start :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jo5Jn9Cq7s","May 31","true","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
