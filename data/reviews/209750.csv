I had hoped that this would help me reclaim the feel of that classic game, but instead it's like someone took the basic concept of the original and then put a "2003" era spin on it.\n\nThings that bugged me about this game instead of having cool music, it's the most generic electric guitar riffs you could imagine\nthe characters look like those "spittin image" puppets\naforementioned puppets will run through a standard talking animation while the voiceover plays\nall the charm of the original is gone\nloading times straight out of the PS1 era (seriously? How? Why?)\nthe bullet animation is really really pathetic.\nSome things I liked about this game At the minimum it plays a little like the original game\nThe Grenades seemed cool\nThere just isn't that much to love about this game, and a whole lot of little things to dislike (but not hate).  Imagine if someone told you to take this song by Mozart and somehow update it so that "kids today" would like it.  You could try to compose an original tune in his style, but instead you decide it's not worth the effort so you take Variations on "Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman" in a midi file and play it through a cheap synth.  Does it sound like Mozart? Well, yeah, but somehow it's just a cheezy version of twinkle twinkle little star instead.\n\nThat's how this game feels.  Cheezy.\n\nEdit:  Thanks to Kudi, there's a fix for the poor load times.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517468131\n\nI'll have to revisit this game and see if that changes my opinion of it for the better.

In fact I still play it every now and then as there are many free fanbased campaigns released for it. But let's get back to Cannon Fodder 3 here and now ...\n\nThis game is a fun game. It adds a little difference to the original Series which was way more tactical than this one here. This one here is at heart a top down shooter and should be played with wasd controls AND mouse simultaneously to get the most out of it. If you can forgive this you will have a very good time with a humorous little game that can get very frustating at times but thats exactly what i love about it.\n\nThough I must admit it instantly gets waaay more easy to accomplish if you don't play it like I play it ...\n\nThat's because I want to complete every mission without loosing one single recruit. If you play it the way it's supposed to, you get many checkpoints spreaded around each map of the game and enough cannonfodder (hence the name of the game) to replenish your squads strength. But you should keep in mind that your recruits get awarded if you play them well and they live long enough so they get better stats over time. And thats the key why I don't wanna waste 'em at all. Experienced soldiers can for e.g. shoot stronger, run faster or aim over a longer distance than greenbacks and enhance the gameplay to a great degree.\n\nAnother nice feature are the video sequences (though now I'm through with the campaign I have to say there is only the - very long - intro sequence ... I wish they'd done at least a nice end sequence to the campaign) and the overall humour of the game. It adds a fresh taste to the shooter genre and makes it much easier to consume than hardcore shooter games aiming to be most realistic. The video sequences in this very game here are even waaay better than the ones in the cd32 version (but there where many of them back in the days in comparison to only the intro in this game here).\n\nI personally think that this latest installment of the Cannon Fodder experience is a very good try to bring the game to a modern level. If you wanna play the original there is nothing that holds you back either but some reviewers may simply just dust their Amigas off, run whdload and play their original disks if they can't get up with this modern take.\n\nBelieve me: War has never been so much fun!\n\n:)\n\nThough if you're a real fan of Cannon Fooder you should know all parts of the series. (At least only then you will fully understand my latest sentence regarding fun and war ... ;)","January 14, 2014","true","53.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The game is horribly optimized (un-ending loading screens, without progress bars to let you know how long you're going to sit and listen to the looping, faux-metal).  Having played the original Cannon Fodder to death on an old 486 PC, I can barely believe the people that made this game have any clue what made the original so much fun.  I poured hours into mastering the original's levels, so that I could make it through with my entire squad alive, taking Jools, Jops, et al as far as I could.  Grenades and rockets were a valued commodity, and placing them just right on enemy buildings made combat an almost puzzle-like experience.  None of that was present in what little portion of this game I was willing to suffer through before quitting.  Originally excited to see that this was being made; then disappointed that I heard it wasn't good enough to spend $20 on; then excited to find it on sale for $1; and now, back to disappointed.","May 24, 2014","false","0.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

From securing a base, to acquiring a vehicle, you are in charge of your squad of soldiers in this top-down strategy game. I will admit I was surprised by just how much fun I had playing Cannon Fodder 3. Unlike games where you have to collect upgrades and survive waves, Cannon Fodder 3 allows you to travel around several different maps depending on the campaign you are playing, where you are given objectives to reach. The graphics are pretty basic, the music is on a loop, the dialogue is limited, and the AI seems fairly simple to beat. Overall this isn't a very challenging game, but I actually liked this game, so I'll give it a thumbs up.","May 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Wrong. If you've got any nostalgia for the original at all, you will be disappointed with this.\n\nThe low-rent intro sequence kicks things off and before you know it, you're awkardly shifting your troops around to an ill-concieved metal soundtrack while taking orders from a general who is clearly voiced by a British man sitting in a biscuit tin occasionally doing an American accent.\n\nWhen he's not talking, all you hear are your soldier's footsteps that always sound like they are walking through hospital corridors no matter what the terrain. Even the misison script is written by someone who must've left school when they were 12. Example: "There are six mission crates hidden in the area! See if you can find it!"\n\nNot to mention the multiplayer is Gamespy, which is no longer even active.\n\nCannon Fodder is easy to get right, but somehow these developers managed to get it so, so wrong. Presumably because they made it for a bag of chips, as that's the only excuse I can see for the poor production value.

Basic top down shooter where you actually control 4 soldiers simultaneously that regardless of the angle where you're pointing for them to hit a target, they will shoot way off target so you have to aim "above" or further away than the target itself. Tutorial is rather incomplete and carries over to the first level and controls are not really well explained either.\n\n4/10","March 16","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Load times are long, especially considering my computer should have zero problem with this game.  The controls feel bad.  The camera controls badly as well.  Graphics are bad.  Skip this game.  I'd have more fun playing the older games.","May 17","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
