See the man with no life!" the brochures will say, "So little life, that he spent over 900 hours playing through the Geneforge saga, Nethergate, Avadon 1 and 2, Escape from the Pit, and the second Avernum trilogy on the hardest difficulties!"\n\nMothers will shush their children and tell them not to look as they pass by, the occasional kindly priest or do gooder will sometimes throw a few coins my way and mutter prayers to themselves wondering how one could have fallen so far, while groups of teenagers and young men will jeer and mock, throwing old tin cans and bits of rock at my head.\n\nBut I shall sit serenely in my state of old school isometric RPG nirvana, my body covered in muck and spit, but my mind drifting outside of the cares of this world, pondering the time that my party was nearly wiped and I fought off a group of chitrachs with just my priest, or the time in Avernum 5 when I spent 20 minutes killing a wolf with 4,000 hp, or the time in Geneforge 4 when I repeatedly reloaded a giant battle to save all the Serviles because I couldn't bear to see a single of the cute little buggers get caught in the crossfire, or that bloody, ♥♥♥♥ing, redbeard boss fight (which, truth be told, I never did bother completing).  In short, while physically present, I shall have passed on from this world, lost in a realm a bit higher than the real, forever and wholly beyond the fray.....or at least until Spiderweb releases another game, anyway.\n","August 31, 2014","true","56.3"," 308 of 344 people (90%) found this review helpful 209 people found this review funny","90","308","344","209","17"

Details and depth are really nice with many easter eggs, rich with history and has a really good sense of humour.\n\nThe mechanics are satisfactory, got traits like fallout and skill point buy like MM's. It's sand-box'ish you can do your quests in any order as long as your party is skillful enough, travel anywhere if you have enough food in your bag, talk to everyone in game world provided you're not a Roman trying to find his/her way in a brigantes village. You can play both as Romans and Britons, they have slightly different stories.\n\nThis game totally amazed me, by giving me much more than i had anticipated, made me wonder what is missing in most modern games.\n\nIf you like 2D rpgs and can endure the mechanics like of Might & Magic, it will be a worthy purchase for its price.\n\n8/10 , at least","April 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","60","64","0","0"

Both offer a unique campaign and different gameplay styles which adds a lot of replayability. You control a group of various characters, typical rpg archetypes that have strength and weaknesses. The game offers a very good story campaign, despite the old graphics the game is very rich in text and dialogue. Furthermore it's very well written and quite atmospheric and just adds a lot to the overall enjoyability of this game. It might not be for everyone but I highly value the flavor texts and attention to detail.\n\nThe story itself is interesting and actually really unique, you party needs to fulfill various quests and venture into the unknown facing all kinds of dangers and delicate situations. The game is a grid based tactical rpg which is played in turns. The gameplay is actually quite smooth and holds up well to this day. You have access to a large overworld and visit various places to fulfill your quests.\n\nThe only downside of this game might be the outdated graphics but don't get me wrong it still plays very nicely and does not feel that clunky. It's definitely worth it for someone who values good rpgs with solid mechanics and nicely narrated storyline.","January 6, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's pretty old and doesn't have some of the improvements introduced in his later games but it's still really good regardless.  I really like the setting with the mix of historic and magical, at the time I had never seen anything like that and I still haven't seen a game that covers this particular time and area.  The game world is friggin massive with lots and lots of hidden things, and sometimes hidden monsters that will stomp all over you when you initially encounter them (come back later to see what they were guarding).  Being able to choose to play either the Romans or Celts is also really cool because the Romans have much better options in terms of raw military might while the Celts have more access to magical power.  There's also plenty of weird humor and the game doesn't alway take itself seriously.  I highly recommend this game if anyone is a fan of old-school cRPGs with a massive number of things to see and do.","October 6, 2012","true","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

You spend the majority of 10-20 minutes creating your party and fine tuning it the way you want, then you need to go and find the person who issues you your first quest. Then you go and do your quest, but you get stopped by numerous enemies who seem to be able to attack twice as often as you can. They don't do a whole lot of damage but it is still frustrating to be killed by a goblin who attacks twice as fast as you and you can't defend or anything. The movment and combat can be a little glitchy at times. It's not a bad game, it's not a great game. 7/10.","April 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Like many of Spiderweb CRPG's it is more a labor of love than a polished effort.  If you have played other of their games and like the mechanics you'll be fine.  I liked the choice between playing Celts and Romans quite a bit.  The problem with the game is mostly none of the tools you really need (which is a common issue with Spiderweb's games) are in the game.  The quest/journal is laughably bad, after taking a break for a couple months I got back into the game and it was of no use.  I had the choice between replaying the game which I had invested a fair amount of time in or uninstalling and walking away.   I chose the later with zero regret.\n\nIf it is on sale and you can tough through the multiple flaws, it might be tolerable.  Barely, but I would still not recommend it.","June 1, 2015","false","23.4"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","14","26","2","0"

In fact because of the way it is displayed it is not only not engaging but downright hard to play because of the tiny graphics.

However if you like Rome based games (the game takes place in Roman Controlled Albion (because England is not yet a thing) and that may appeal to you. I did not get far so I am not really saying buy or don't buy but beware that it may be unappealing because of the size of the game window and graphics within.
