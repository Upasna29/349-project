Don't let the Steam play time fool you, I've been playing this game for 7 years and it's a nice mix between simplistic and complex with enough moddability to make Skyrim take notice. The best way to describe the game would be to take Axis & Allies, make it far more indepth yet put it on an interface that even someone new to video games could understand.\nThis video can help newcomers with understanding how the game works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sser5Scn_Vg\n\nThe premise of the game, is you take control of one of the world's many countries during World War 2, by any country, I mean anyone from the Industrial Superpower that is the United States to tiny little old Ecuador, and try to survive the tumultous battles of World War 2. Now, this game, as the title implies, doesn't exactly follow the usual script and you're free to fight the war in whatever manner you choose. You can choose Germany, and decide to never attack Czechoslovakia in the first place and instead build up your industrial might so that you can bring down France sooner. Or you can focus military production purely on navy to surpass the Naval might of the United Kingdom... or you can declare war on everyone around you and try to survive an all out brawl.\n\nI love this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone who has been a fan of Geopolitical games, Axis & Allies, or even just a fan of Turn Based Strategy games. Plus for 10 dollars, how can you go wrong?","May 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 109 of 123 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","109","123","14","0"

I have only played a short time, but this game is so awesome I just had to come over to this screen and tell the world how awesome it is.\n\nIt's easy to pick up, fun and addictive to play, looks pretty cool, and honestly: it's really complex. There is A LOT that goes with this game. Not only does trade, diplomacy, and economy matter, but the game revolves around these aspects quite a bit.\n\nObviously being set during WW2, your job is simple: build an empire or outproduce everywhere (or both); every decision has a consequence, and I gotta admit, it gives the average person an insight into the functioning of nations today.\n\nWanna be an industrial power? You're gonna make less food; wanna field a large and powerful army? Hope you have financial reserves because guns aren't cheap.\n\nIt's a cool little game, and I have a feeling I'm gonna fall in love with it. I kinda already have.\n\nGet it.","May 19, 2015","true","3.5"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","38","47","2","0"

I have to say this is a very easy and fun game to pick up, If you want a quick and pretty fast game then this is it. It has depth and it's always fun to be Germany and bring the Reich back to power. Only thing I dislike about this game is that I wish it would have more events for major countries to choose from, Something like the non-aggression pact that was made with Germany and the USSR at the time would be good. Also when America joins the war I never really see them try and take the islands away from Japan. Japan is also kinda weak in this game because everygame I play Japan gets kicked out of their holdings in china :/ Other then these small things which can be changed by using the editor which is also very easy to use! I would say this is a great buy! Btw Muzzy lane if you this this review please make a remastered version of this! I would totally pick that up the second it comes out.

For i tend to play more as Germany, and most of the time i employ a similar stratagy; which is to bulid up industry, as to allow for mass production of primaraly tanks. But even though i make similar choices in my game play, the AI usially behaves slightly diffrently.\nFor somtimes the AI may field a primaraly defensive army, and other times it may field a primaraly offensive army; the same can be said about other countries foreighn policys.\nHowever what ever the AI does they always play a smart game, being tactically aware of every move you make, and doing there best to counter, resulting in a challenging game every time.\n\n\nAlso as for playing as the smaller nations it can be a struggle, for i have been recently playing as Canada and aside from the lack of raw materials, the small population makes it impossible to industrialize every one of your citys. But where others see this a negative, i see this more of a positive. for it trys to keep things historically accurate, by limiting smaller nations. However that being said i was still able to conquer Japan, all of Africa, and most of Europe as Canada. Mind you i did not accomplish all of this before 1945, but it does show it can be done.\n\nOver all i would recomend this game to all stratagy lovers, especially those who have playes Axis ans Allies, for this game has a very similar feel, for although it does not let you command individual regiments in a battle, its attantion to detail when it comes to the global map, and all of the little things such as city development, research, and resource management results in a rich but not overly complicated game play.","November 30, 2015","true","78.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","4"

If you wish to play as one of the major powers AND simply conduct battles for the various territories/zones (similar to Risk or Axis & Allies) then you MAY get some fun out of this. However, playing as any other nation OR playing a non-aggresive strategy as a major power is a waste of time. My major problems are as follows:\n1) Agriculture/Food:  I played games as Spain, Canada, Australia to see how it may be possible to become a major exporter of food to allies. To my surprise, as I increased the Agricultural capability of my zones/provinces I saw no appreciable increase in food production. Thinking that the problem was lack of infrastructure and roads, I increased that as well. Again, no change in food production to the better... things only got worse. In fact, playing as Canada and Australia - two nations that export billions in food... my nations were starving and I had to always import food from... Nazi Germany or USSR (who I was at war with).","July 29, 2015","false","43.0"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","6"

Here are some ups and downs of it.\n\nThe game really forces you to play as a major power. Don't expect to unite South America as Brazil, as I tried. The trading is fairly straight forward; put in a request for a resource and if someone offers it you get it, or visa-versa.\n\nThe combat goes by very fast, sadly. In my games, Germany attempts to invade France but France just wipes the floor with them and by 1941 it's pretty much just a cold war between Russia and the Democratic West - except not so cold.\n\nThe AI is very smart. They don't abandon their territory to go invade a distant neutral nation, like in other games. They will stay inside their territory until they need to attack, and reinforce their armys when needs be.\n\nI don't quite understand diplomacy; my assumption is that there's more to it than alliances and wars, but it doesn't seem to be so. Your diplomatic standing does, however, decrease when you invade stuff, but I don't know if there's a way to get it back up or not.\n\nIn conclusion, while I may not be a fan of this game, you may be able to see through the weak points of this game and be able to enjoy it, and for that, the developers were nice enough to provide us with a demo. Be sure to try that before purchasing this to see if this is something you might enjoy.","July 20, 2015","false","10.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

I have likes and dislikes with it but mainly likes.  It is fairly easy to learn yet has a lot of depth.  I like the military units being on the board and the look of them is fun.  Versus some games Ive shopped but not bought because it looks like more cards and numbers representing the units.   Im old enough I played axis and allies on the board game in the eighties and then the computer game in the mid nineties.  This game is kinda like axis and alllies but a lot more in depth.  It has a good grasp on monitoring your production of resources, which cost you money, while trying to not go too far in debt so you are effective.  Countries go in debt at times of war but the farther in debt you become the less effective you are.  You can research and then produce better units.  You must control an entire foreign country to reap all its benefits and even then there is a cultural penalty.  As far as tweaks I think that the culture penalty on production in factories would reduce as you upgraded the infrastructure and agriculture.  Lets face it a poverty stricken nation that was not producing enough food and goods to support its people and had lousy roads would eventually welcome your leadership if there children were well fed and they now had access and money for the latest goods.  Which at this time would have been a radio, electricity and a fridge.  Im old enough to have had grandparents who passed down stories of what it was like without these things we now take for granted.  They lived on the family farm which brings me to another possible flaw in the game.  At the time of WWII the midwest was full of farmers who were producing more than enough to purchase the old ford tractors so they were already fairly upgraded.  The thought of Kansas producing food at six units with updgraded agriclutute at  level 4 while many provineces in China are producing over 100 food per turn at level 3 is beyond me.  It is however a dang good reason to invade China no matter which country you choose to play as. Some numbers for Americcan food production Virginia 7 Tennessee 8 Nebraska 4,which Nebraska with Missouri , Kansas and South Dakota make up our wheat belt, these numbers are clearly too low.  Then Idaho is at 1 even when upgraded to AG production 2.  What about the Idaho potato???  Basically if a state or province isnt producing a seven you are throwing your money away by updgrading it.  California produces a large portion of Americas food so it does pull a 10 and 14 Northern and Southern CA.  As far as I know America has always produced plenty of food for its own population with a great bounty left to sale.\nThis game also has some alternate history variables.  When you set up your game you can scroll down to a variety of different options.  I didnt know this the first few games.  You can even play as the Confederates.  If you want to dominate the world though I think your only option is to take out much of the United States first then make peace with them so the factories you've taken will produce at full capacity.  If you dont they might crush you later for picking on a smaller country.  It actually makes a little sense because America didnt keep much in the way of a trained standing army until after WW2\nI at first had some problems with game setup.  I hit dont show me again on the invalid key code thing that really does nothing.  I recommend when u start your game just hit shift tab and close it then u will have to hit shift tab once more to get out of news about the game.  I also didnt know at first in the options menu, Before I repeat Before your game is started you can change screen resolution.  I have a brand new computer with 17 inch screen and I7 processor and the one that works best for me and my aging eyes is 1280 x 800.\nNothing is ever perfect but I have had a lot of fun with this game and it has a lot of replayability.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bubezleeb/recommended/371190/","bubezleeb","Agent Orange","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bubezleeb/","126 products in account","Not too many reviews on this game, so I'll give my two cents.\n\nINTRO:\nFirst off, don't be intimidated by the look of this game, it is surprisely easy to grasp the game's concepts in a couple quick play-throughs.\n\nI haven't played any other making history games.  I got this game, because I was looking for a 4x game based in WW2.\n\nInitial Impression:\nI would say this is a fairly complex game, offering a variety of mechanics that can be worked in different ways.  There are resources, economy/industry building, trade, military supply management, ,research, and combined arms tactics (infantry, tanks, planes, etc) - maybe I'm missing a couple...\n\nGameplay:\nI've played as the UK, Germay, and France thus far; and I've played about ten games at various easy and hard type settings.  If I had to describe the gameplay in a few short phrases I would say:\n-It feels like a race to assemble the best industry and militry possible before world war breaks out\n-resouce and supply management is very key, more so late game where your ability to fight can degrade\n-managing both the industrial and military side can either be very precise or very forgiving depending on difficulty\n\nAll in all, I would say that I have never felt the need to micro manage too much. Instead, I found my self skipping 5-10 or more turns in a row, until I accomplished a goal, and then tweaked my industry before skipping a few more turns.\n\nMilitary engagements are more complex and can happen very quickly if you are not micro'ing your units.  I ended up having to give a lot of thought on what units I attacked with and what units I used to defend my territory, in order to avoid stranding a unit or pushing my military beyond what my economy could support.  Of course, this varied with difficulty and nation played, since resource/industry matters quite a bit.\n\nI found research in the game to be important, but not the deciding factor.  The country that does the best, will also have managed resources efficiently and conservately pushed it's armies to conquer the enemy.  Consequently, it is very important to find ways to undermine your opponents' strengths, often by attacking their ability to collect resources.\n\nMultiplayer/Singleplayer:\nThere is a multiplayer mode, which I haven't tried.  And, I will say that against an AI opponent, I was able to abuse certain patterns to win at times.  For example, as Germany, I started out with a very weak navy and did not build one large enough to defeat the Allied navies at sea.  Instead, I was able to use bombers to destroy most of their ships in large packs, since bombers to dont return until all the units in a given tile are dead.  The AI kept replenishing the units, but in the end I was killing them faster.   A real person would most likely find ways to reposition their navies until they were ready to perform an attack.\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI've heard some compare this game to command and conqure, and I wouldn't say I disagree - mainly because this game feels a lot like a board game.  It's definitley more detailed than Risk.\n\nThe graphics are fairly bland, and there aren't action sequences.  I havne't checked into modding, but on it's own the game is pretty fun. In short, a good distraction from more intense games - it definitely is a beer in one hand video game.\n\nI would say that you should be careful running it on low-end machines, because in general it does seem to use up resources.  I played one game to 1000 turns and the game was just chugging away with noticeable lag.  In general, you should find that it runs well on most systems.  I had no issues with erros or crashing, so it seems like a stable game.\n\n\n\nTL;DR  If you like the idea of an imperialist style 4x game set in the action pack time of WW2, and are looking for something more like a board game rather than a Total War, then this game is for you.","December 31, 2015","true","134.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You will need incredible patience and strategy to even sit still long enough for this game. Now, past the patience and strategy, you need to be able to think quite a few steps ahead. Personally I love grand strategy games like this but unlike this, they tend to have better balance between supply and demand equality across the entirety of the game. However, this is not the case here. Only few, and I mean very few, countries can really balance this and keep their economy and trade up. Otherwise, you end up requesting more than offering as well as delve into debt pretty quickly. Thus, you end up being forced to play one of the preset countries instead of the other ones that are available. This forces pretty repetitive gameplay if you play through the entirety of the singleplayer 'campaigns'.\n\nThe Pros Clean and easy to use interface that is explained quite well during the tutorial\nPretty simple and doesn't have too many complex actions\nFun if played in moderation\nProvides a bit of surprise sometimes if you decide to change history a bit as battles are never set in stone (much like real life.)\nThe Cons Steep learning curve: (Unless you've played grand strategies before, the ability to balance supply and demand are a bit overwhelming)\nLoses its fun if played quickly (Just from playing a single scenario and looking through the others, I don't see much replayability after perfecting them.)\nDifficulty seems a bit off (I mean seriously, I play on the easiest to test it and I'm dealing with tanks on small island countries when I don't have access to tanks. I mean, really?)\nA Final Word      While I enjoyed my short time with the game, I have to be honest with my review. While I truly enjoy grand strategy, I found the supply and demand system on the international market rather ridiculous. Either countries will rise their imports tremendously and cause you to lose instead of producing surplus or suddenly lose all interest in your trade and cause you to lose money. Either way, you end up losing in one part and gaining on the other. While others may see this as realistic, I would rather have it be a bit more balanced. I mean, seriously, only the preset countries for scenarios and maybe two or three other countries can properly hold their supply and demand good enough to sustain their economy and their own surpluses. Past that, this is one of the easiest and simplest grand strategy games out on the market that I've played.\n\nThe Verdict      Despite its simplicity, I would only recommend this to those truly interested in grand strategy games. Those that want a game to waste time or to just occasionally play, I would not recommend this. On that note I don't recommend this to those with short amounts of patience, lacking good strategy or forethought, as well as all around time. A game like this requires time to play and really enjoy. However, to those that have played or enjoyed grand strategy or wish to really get into it, I truly recommend this game. It's easy to pick up and even easier to master (if you ignore the supply and demand system as well as the apparently higher tech nations you initially have to go to war with sometimes-even on the easiest difficulty) That said, I wouldn't recommend this to the general public that has no real interest in grand strategy but I wholeheartedly recommend this to the grand strategists out there looking for an easy game to pick up.","May 18","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

At this price its an absolute must. It hits the sweet spot between complexity and accessability whilst compelling you all the time to have "just one more turn". I can't really praise it highly enough. If you stick with it long enough to work out all of the information it presents you with you will experience a "Eureka" moment and be hooked.\n\nIn my opinion it actually surpasses the follow up title "Making history the calm before the storm". Think Axis and Allies on steroids but without adding any unwanted clutter. The thing just works....","April 30","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
