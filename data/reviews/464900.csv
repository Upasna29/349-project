I'd estimate a 4.5 hrs play time for a first run.\nArt: Good, lays out the puzzles nicely.\nMusic: Great, really sets the mood and is memorable.\nControls: Spot on, walking feels free and lining up throws is easy.\n\nPitfall Planet is game where you solve puzzles in order to collect gold. Most of the puzzles are about how to get from point A to point B. Effectively exploring the level and collecting the gold along the way. Sometimes there's boss battles, which are nice to highlights of the game. The difficultly curve feels natural, starting off easy and progresses to hard. The first half of game takes about an hour to finish, but the difficult puzzles of the second half, took about 3 to 4 hours (In my first play through).\n\nThe game is beautiful, the screen shots don't do it justice, I'm a fan of the clean and smooth surfaces. Each level has details in the right spots. There's a cute side story that give a window into the planet before the game's events. The sound track sets the mood appropriately. The songs are mostly chill beats I could hum along with and they put the pressure on for the action levels.\n\nI've played through the game solo. If you use the single controller option you can play both characters at once. To get the most out the game you should play with a friend. Being able to see the look of rage on a friends face when you throw them into lava, or onto a monster is priceless.\n\nOccasionally my brain misjudges how far apart platforms are from one another. And it can be hard to tell if there's an invisible wall to save you from falling off a part of the map or not. In general, it's pretty good about having safety nets where you'd need them.","May 4","true","22.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is great to be able to sit here and play with a friend with out needing another computer. The game in itself is beautiful in its own way. The soundtrack is calm and it makes for more relaxed gameplay. I hope the creators will make another one and other people will start making more games like this.","May 6","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was sad before playing that it was intended for 2 players strictly, but honestly, I had a lot of fun just playing it on my own :D\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and the game plays well on weaker machines. I definitely recommend this game.","May 9","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love that it forces you to play locally with a friend instead of allowing for online co-op, it really makes it special and is reminscent of going to a friend's house to play gamecube. Despite being a dedicated puzzle game it's pretty easy. 10.5 hours in and I've finished the storyline but haven't gotten 100% completion. Speaking of story, this game has next to none. A story is hinted at but never flushed out in the slightest. Pitfall Planet really excels in creating genuine experiences between you and a friend. Be it humor, triumph or frustration this best moments will be the ones outside the game itself. Overall it's well worth the ten dollars and you'll definitely get your money's worth in quality time with your partner despite a lack of depth or difficulty","May 10","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
