The story is fairly enthralling and while the characters are definitely cliché, I thought they were diverse and interesting enough, with the exception being the unquestionably boring main character.  It is far from perfect, but I enjoyed it, that much I know.  I think if you like games in this style, then you will probably enjoy it too; but if you’re someone who easily dislikes things that aren’t absolutely perfectly crafted, you may want to reconsider trying this.\n\nThis game is not like other X:COM games you may have played; rather it is a different type of game altogether that is simply set in the X:COM universe.  Evidently, this bothered many people; but I find it hard to understand why some people feel the core gameplay is so absolutely terrible.  The style of play is very similar to the Mass Effect series.  You combat in third-person shooter style, with the ability to use tactical pausing and to issue commands (move, target, use ability) to squadmates.  There is an XP and leveling system for both your main character and squadmates, with a handful of different squadmate classes to work with.  It certainly doesn’t have the most refined, expansive, and exemplary combat/gameplay mechanics out there, but I thought it was good enough and enjoyed playing the game.\n\nThe story is somewhere between mediocre and good.  I liked the atmosphere and setting of an alien invasion in 1960s America.  The narrative and characters are undoubtedly cliché at times, but I felt it was all intriguing enough to hold my interest as I played through the game.  Some of the plot developments do come out of nowhere, but ultimately I thought they actually helped to make the story more interesting.\n\nI didn’t experience any jarring bugs or glitches and I thought the graphics and soundscape were pleasant.  Some of the cutscenes had a grainy look to them even after I turned film grain off, but it wasn’t the end of the world— the in-game graphics were still crisp and attractive.  For me, the most egregious negative aspect of the game was the checkpoint autosave system.  I don’t like playing a game on a PC in this day & age and not have the option to quicksave and/or make multiple saves.  (You can, however, also load up the start of any level and continue playing from there, if you missed something).  But, to be honest, the checkpoints were extremely frequent and never really caused any true frustration.\n\nThe Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a decent game that suffered from overzealous people’s unrealistic expectations.  Not every game can be the best game ever or the best game of the year.  If you are someone who only likes to play a few games a year and wants them all to be absolute top-notch games, I can respect that and I will then suggest that you might not want to play this.  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a moderate-to-good game that will appeal to those who enjoy the style of gameplay it offers and who play enough different games that they understand they can’t all be the best but they can be good enough.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 5, 2015","true","18.0"," 273 of 324 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","273","324","12","4"

It received a slew of mediocre review scores which painted a pretty bleak picture. However, upon playing it myself, I have found the game to be incredibly enjoyable.\n\nYou are thrust into the shoes of William Carter --  an agent with a troubled past -- in the midst of an alien invasion. With the military essentially being wiped out and all communications jammed, it falls to the XCOM organisation to deal with the alien threat.\n\nAs an XCOM agent, you will spend much of your time in the undergound base: delegating mission assignments (where your fellow XCOM agents can gain experience), exploring, completing side missions and talking to the various personalities within the facility. Many comparisons have been made between the XCOM base and the Mass Effect Citadel, which I would say are apt.\n\nWhen you're done with the base activites, you can head out into the field. Most of the time you may choose between minor (side) and major (main) operations. The minor operations are fun little deviations, providing insight into what the people of that region have been through. You may happen upon individuals who have been infected by the aliens (this renders them basically catatonic) or dismembered bodies  scattered thoughout.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you lead two squadmates into battle, stopping (well, nearly stopping) time in order to provide them with orders. To me, it feels like Enemy Unknown, except in third person. Along with providing them orders, you level them up, allowing them to use new and varied powers. If you play it as a straight up shooter, neglecting to order your AI squadmates around, you may have a bad time. I believe this is where a lot of the negative attitudes towards the gameplay comes from. The AI needs direction or they will get themselves killed.\n\nA typical encounter would see you approach the enemy, getting yourself into cover and your allies. Pausing time, surveying the battlefield then deciding how to proceed. Perhaps you make your sniper cloak, move around to flank the enemy, then hit them with a critical strike? Perhaps you have your engineer throw down a rocket turret, which you then lift above cover to rain hell upon your enemies? Each battle is varied, giving you a lot of strategic options. This is something that I loved about The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.\n\nThe story goes from somewhat generic to "Wow, this is batshit insane!" As I made my way through, I became more and more engaged, to the point where I couldn't put it down.\n\nThe game does have its problems, but they are minor. If you have any interest in the XCOM universe and tactical shooters, I highly suggest you give this game a shot. It may surprise you.\n\n+Outstanding graphics and atmosphere.\n+The story takes some time to warm up, but once it gets going, it is captivating.\n+Great tactical battle interface. Ordering your allies around is pleasant and easy.\n+Good sense of progression. As you advance through the story, you and your allies level up, becoming powerhouses capable of taking on the most menacing of enemies.\n+The XCOM base and its personnel are well designed. It's nice to walk around talking to each of them and completing their side quests.\n\n-Lip syncing at times is woeful.\n-Voice acting can be hit or miss.\n-On higher difficulties, grenade spam can be a problem.\n-The AI are bullet magnets. If you do not tell them what to do (constantly), they will die.","September 8, 2013","true","24.8"," 603 of 762 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","603","762","0","11"

Both artistically and technically the developers did a good job making this game feel alive.\n\n+The game takes place across a series of locations each one unique in its own way. The game has a lot of good set pieces\n\n+Side quests are fleshed out and fun to play\n\n+ The game allows you to take 2 squad members with you into battle. You can customize your squad any way you like. There are four classes to choose from:  support, sniper, engineer, and commando. Each class has its own set of abilities and weapons to choose from. You pick whatever you want to suit your playstyle.\n\n+ The game has a wide variety of abilities not only for the main character but your squad as well. The abilities are varied for each class and serve a very practical purpose in battle\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe story starts off strong and is constantly building up to something...problem is, the story starts getting too convoluted for its own good. Eventually it gets so ridiculous it becomes hard to care about the story. By the end of the game I was playing it just to see the next setting.\n\nThe characters are also one dimensional and a bit stereotypical.\n\nThe game doesn't do a whole lot to change up the game play formula. Every side quest/main mission plays out the same way, kill lots of enemies, move on to the next area...repeat.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Your teammates are completely useless. First they don't manually use there abilities, you have to manually select them for them to use it. Some people may like this, I did not.  The second major problem is that they make very stupid decisions resulting in death. The pop out of cover at the wrong time and get shot at, move to locations where the enemies are, etc.   The third major problem is that they do very little damage, 99% of the kills will come from you.\n\nFor a game that is supposed to be a "tactical" shooter , there is nothing tactical about it. Because of the stupidity of your teammates the game plays out like a solo third person shooter. You only have teammates to choose their abilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor all the fun I had with this game, it does have some serious faults. I would have liked to see more variety in the gameplay and stronger A.I. I still think its worth playing especially if you like cover based shooters.","October 26, 2014","true","16.2"," 158 of 175 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","158","175","2","1"

I like third (and first) person shooters. This should have been right up my alley. The concept is, but the execution falls flat for me.\n\nMy AI squad mates are imbeciles: running in front of turrets, running INTO the explosion radius of grenades, etc. I guess maybe I'm supposed to micro-manage the crap out of them, but that's not very fun -- especially when I'm struggling with getting my own damn guy to actually go into cover, move around simple objects, etc. 90% of the game boils down to me shooting an alien, cranking off my healing power to keep my idiot squad mates alive, shooting another alien, running to revive a downed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that walked out of cover, shooting an alien, cranking off my healing power again...lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but it's just not for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/65930/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","The Bureau: XCOM Declassified was not well received by mainstream reviewers, but I personally enjoyed it a lot. Overall, it feels like a stripped down version of Mass Effect, but the combat stands out above other cover shooters. The game has a lot of flaws, but I encountered no bugs in the core game. The Hangar 6 DLC, however, would freeze briefly every few seconds and rendered the game nearly unplayable.\n\nThe Bureau's combat puts you in control of William Carter, a rather generic protagonist with a gravelly voice. Conversations in the game are carried out with a radial menu lifted directly from Mass Effect. The dialogue isn't terribly interesting, and some of the characters facial animations appeared to not actually be finished. Their mouths move with odd robotic motions, and their eyes look eerily dead. Carter himself, and some of the other core characters have much better, albeit repetitive animations. The story is forgettable overall, but moves the game on well enough. It doesn't come anywhere close to the likes of Mass Effect though, and the fact that the developers chose to base their game design so heavily on Mass Effect is unfortunate given the weak story. Even still, the combat made the experience worthwhile.\n\nCombat in the Bureau is at it's core a cover shooter in the vein of Mass Effect or Gears of War. It also gives you a pair of squadmates and allows you to give direct orders to them. The rookies you start with only have one or two abilities, as well as a command to focus on a specific target, and move to a location. Choosing where to move your squadmates is where the game gets a lot of it's strategic depth. You have to take into account how long they'll be exposed for, how far the nearest ally is if they need a revive, where the enemies are, how much protection the cover offers, and how easily they can use their abilities from their location. Overall it makes for a far more interesting experience than your standard cover shooter. Abilities range from dropping mines, shield domes, artillery strikes, and others.\n\nThe combat isn't perfect though. Your squadmates seem to move into stupid locations occasionally, either exposing themselves to unnecessary fire, going down somewhere difficult to revive them, or both. It's not quite clear why this happens, but it doesn't happen very often at least. The encounters feel somewhat repetitive, but they ramp up in difficulty at a good rate. The weapons are fairly standard for a cover shooter; human and alien variations of the standard rifle, pistol, sniper and so on. Enemies on the other hand provide a bit more variety, healing their allies, granting them shields, spawning new enemies, or even mind controlling your squadmates.\n\nThe graphics generally look good, with a variety of scenes ranging from idyllic small towns to metallic alien structures. Some elements though stand out like a sore thumb. An ugly low res skybox in one of the first scenes of the game is jarringly bad to look at in stark contrast to the cutscene that precedes it. Other elements like a destroyed tank with an ugly texture and a low poly model, or the abyss below an alien tower filled with an ugly brown fog that would have been acceptable years ago, but looks disappointing today. The rest of the game, however, especially the weapon reload animations look and sound good.\n\nThe Bureau's worst offense however, is sure to be a dealbreaker for some fans of the mainstream XCOM games. The only thing The Bureau has in common with XCOM itself is the aliens and the weapon types. Unlocking new weapons is done merely by picking them up off the ground rather than researching them. Dying only puts you back to the latest checkpoint, and while you can lose squadmates permanently if they bleed out in some difficulty settings, I'm fairly sure if you die yourself they'll be back with you at the last checkpoint.\n\nBy removing research, permadeath, and forcing the player down a linear path, I'm sure some players will deem the game unworthy of the XCOM title. While these issues did grate on me at first, it was the combat that kept me playing and enjoying every minute of it. Even though the story is just average, it isn't particularly time consuming like it is in Mass Effect. While I feel the game could have played more to it's strengths, it was still well worth the time and money while on sale. I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this game to fans of Mass Effect, though fans of the classic XCOM games or Enemy Unknown will not enjoy it unless they also enjoy a good cover shooter.","October 26, 2015","true","54.6"," 130 of 149 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","130","149","10","1"

I absolutely enjoyed every minute of this game, it stands on it's own in the franchise. From the convincing, immersive 1962 atmosphere to the gorgeously rendered and extremely detailed environments, it is immensely engaging and entertaining from start to finish. The tactical combat system is smooth and satisfying without being too easy, just the right balance of simplicity and complexity for me. I found the characters, especially the protagonist, to be realistic, believable people. Agent Carter is the quintessential tragic antihero with a scarred past, bad habits, and post traumatic stress disorder. A cynical misanthropist, but a man of the highest honor, we can't help but hope he finds redemption in saving the world. The expertly written story draws you in and helps greatly to suspend disbelief in an otherwise unbelievable nightmare. I would like to see this subject matter treated more in gaming, I think it is a richly complex, provocative and potentially horrifying, largely untapped genre. The Bureau is by far the best game to address it so far.","March 22, 2015","true","22.1"," 181 of 220 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","181","220","19","9"

Not just soldier xy.\n- soldiers who are not in your team can be on their own missions and level in these missions\n- all soldiers have ... "magic" :)\n\nWhat you have to understand is, that this is not a game where you run around with guns blazing.\nYou have to move from cover to cover, give your two teammates commands and use the special commands ("magic", whatever) as often as possible.\nYou have to manage your two team mages, THAT is your job.\nNOT killing as many enemies as possible yourself.\n\nIf you are one of these idiots who writes in Killing Floor or other Coop games things like "don't steal my kills", then you will hate this game because you are an idiot and idiots can't like this game.\nI do not say, that everyone who hates the game is an idiot, or that all idiots will hate this game, I just wanted to mention the possibility :)\n\nIf you did not understand the above sentence, don't bother to play the game. It is not for you.\n\nA little bit about the game and not about the mindless haters:\n\nIt is real time when you explore the level or do combat.\nBut all the time you have the option to pause the game and queue commands for yourself and your mates.\n\nBecause the game is not really paused but instead is running very slow, you still have to act quickly.\nSometimes one of your mates will attack the enemy in a mindless way, he will leave his cover and storm toward the enemy.\nWithout any valid reason.\nYOU have to manage them and bring them back to cover.\nYou have to use your men and their abilities, like decoys, to either just bring the enemy down with force or get your men in superior positions, for example you can flank the enemy.\n\nAll levels are in a way, that you CAN do it in different ways.\nAnd depending on your choice of mates and your own weapons you have totally different "magic" abilities and ranges of weapons.\nDepending on your weapon/ability choice you have to stay away from the enemy or you HAVE to close in.\n\nDo you want to use shields and shotguns? Or do you want to use sniper rifles and rocket turrets? Your choice.\n\nThe game is fun. From the beginning to the end.\nThe end is not drawing on and on and one like in other games.\nThere is a story and they did not kill the story to make the game longer.\n\nThere ARE moments when you want to eat your keyboard, because you did something wrong.\nMostly it is not the game but you, who is doing it wrong.\n\nThere are shortcuts to move from cover to cover, or to to jump over cover to be able to run towards the enemy or even to jump over the cover to use the cover from the other side which is VERY interesting in boss fights.\nBut if you are under stress, you make errors and use the wrong combination.\nThen you die and you hate the game.\n\nBut the game is really good, it is fun and it is not too long.\n\nIt took me over 20 hours to finish it, that is more than ok.\nI tried to do every mission and talk to everyone who wanted to talk to me.\nI checked the maps for schemata for better equipment and did not rush the game.\n\nI like the game.\nIt is NOT like XCom-Enemy Unkown, it IS a game of its own and if you can't understand that, then you will not like the game.\n\nIt has not the replayability like XCOM Enemy Unkown, because there are not so many choices where you would want to try the different approach. If you once decide to sacrifice someone, why would you save him the next time? The cirumstances are the same. I saved him! :) And the weapon choices are only choices for yourself. For you men it is more like, new weapon? Ok, use it.\n\nIt is not a sandbox game. It is not a openworld game. It is not multiplayer.\nIf you need these to be happy, stay away.\nIf you are a gamer and like good games with stories, get it and have a blast for 3 days.\nThen back to your long term games :)","May 25, 2014","true","22.9"," 483 of 650 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","483","650","0","7"

It's essentially a Mass Effect game without the plot choices (save for a few near the end). The squad controls like a Mass Effect 3 squad. You order them to cover and use abilities (like warp blast and lift...). There's a main mission hub where you talk to your companions with dialogue wheels. It's Mass Effect-lite.\n\nIt's pretty well made and the combat is engaging enough. I really enjoy the rare game that tries to capture cold war era America and I think The Bureau succeeds here quite well.

Though, the A.I. has some flaws (and i just played on a low difficulty, so maybe it might be worse on higher difficulties).\nIt plays like every other cover-based shooter, with the exception that you can give your 2 companions orders (there are maximum 2 you can take on missions with you). Opening up this menu will trigger a super slow-motion, giving you time to activate skills, place your companions on specific points on the map or heal yourself.\nYou also have to be careful/tactical as the characters won't take too much damage, so run&gun isn't the best option here.\n\nBetween missions you're always going back to the underground base of XCOM, where you can find some people to talk with, read some notes and do some smaller side-missions, which was a nice idea in my opinion.\n\nYou can also recruit different soldiers which have different classes and therefor different skills they will use, e.g. one can use a shield, another one can place a turret and the next one can make himself invisible.\n\nIf you're a die-hard fan of the old XCOM games, you might be dissappointed, as it is not the typical turn-based strategy game, but apart from that i found it to be pretty enjoyable.\n\nWorth a look if you like SciFi and tactical third-person shooters.","February 22, 2014","true","18.3"," 167 of 214 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","167","214","0","0"

Most people went into it thinking they were going to get some sort of polished up grid-style xcom team FPS and the reality is that while this game doesn't quite fall into that category, it isn't exactly the worst thing ever either.\n\nThe game itself has a fairly interesting storyline that fits in “ok” to the XCOM universe despite not making a whole lot of sense until late game. Most levels consist of you running from point A to point B and collecting whatever tidbits of information (if any) and special items/weapons in addition to killing anything in your way.\n\nThe combat is a bit frustrating at first as your cohorts movement commands are issued in a way relative to their position which makes using their abilities a bit difficult if they happen to be out of range. Also, they seem to be incredibly bad at dodging anything so expect to have to babysit them for the entirety of the game. As far as strategy goes, I managed to find a sweet spot with scout and commando but other class mixes are viable all the way until the last few battles (your experience may vary).\n\nOverall, the game came off as a bit tedious and I kind of sloughed through the last few hours of "level plus multiple respawns". Additionally the plot revolving around the main character (Carter) is pretty nonsensical and random which made it kind of difficult to get “into” the story. I would only recommend this game for diehard fans of XCOM who want to see another take on the popular franchise.","August 7, 2015","false","17.7"," 168 of 216 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","168","216","9","0"

After showing the ability to command, Carter is brought into the XCOM project to combat the new alien threat and keep it hidden from public domain.\n\nWhile the story has plenty of potential, filled with plot twists and interesting concepts that promised much however the abysmal animation quality and equally poor dialogue stomps on any attempts for the story to blossom. As your character speaks to others, it won’t take long for you to notice the constant repeat of three animations that just feel artificial, along with poor voice acting that simply changes tone every sentence making it impossible to take anything they say with any care. Plot holes run amok with many of the side quests, and dialogue not connected to the main focus of the storyline.\n\nThe Bureau tries to blend the turn based strategy of the XCOM series with real time cover based shooting. Promoting teamwork and RPG elements to overcome challenges works well on paper but poor execution through AI simply makes many of the strategy components redundant. Often finding my partners simply refuse to take any useful cover unless directly told to do so, however when they take position the poor AI simply takes over, soon making them move out of cover instantly. The AI will often struggle to perform basic tasks, watching myself go down right next to an ally as they simply stand on my face watching my hp slide down to zero.\n\nWhile enemies are based on those featured in previous XCOM games, within The Bureau they lack the identity and unique traits that made combat diverse, tense and tactical. As you progress through the game, enemies will remain the same except for an additional armor or shield bar with the word elite lazily thrown after their names.\n\nCharacter progression within the game is very limited, offering little combat customization. As you and your squad levels up you are given the choice between two new upgrades, often being the choice between duration and damage. This design has been taken from XCOM: Enemy unknown which worked fine within the game design however playing as a single character through the whole story, and only having two teammates with you at all times means characters simply feel too limited, with a maximum of three skills per class, you’ll soon find your preferred attacks and have no reason to add diversity to your tactics throughout the entire game. Skills are activated by bringing up a battle HUD, giving you access to your own and team skills, during this the game will slow down giving you more time to plan and consider your options. Though slowing down the game reduces the pressure, the game continues to play making many tactical attacks an impossibility. Many times I found myself trying to time my snipers critical strike with turrets and protective abilities however the moment a skill is selected it will begin to play out giving you little time to organize the ambush you planned in your mind, often resulting in a messy and inconsistent first attack.\n\nOne of the huge holes apparent within the game seems to be a lack of co-op within the game, the structure of combat and the storyline feel setup for two players. Situations where the main character become split up for short periods of time from the team, as well as the dependency on tight coordinated teamwork scream out for two player interaction. Many flaws within the game, specifically the unreliability of the AI would be overcome and none apparent with a second human player. With a second player the game could be incredible enjoyable and the fact developers missed this opportunity is a great disappointment.\n\nThe Bureau is definitely not one of the worst games available for sale, but simply tries to do so many things, it does none of them well. Barely meeting the line of mediocre in any aspects of gameplay giving it no identity on the market, and as such simply giving no reason to buy it especially at a full AAA title price.\n\nedit: Fixed typo.","December 11, 2013","false","11.9"," 605 of 850 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","605","850","0","10"

It's a bit threadbare, feeling like several incomplete ideas that have been rushed out the gate.\n\nRealistically, I suspect The Bureau was completed on a small-ish budget after lingering around in development hell for a few years. Something about the game makes it feel like it's ten years or more old, if it wasn't for some of the DirectX 11 effects looking so sparkly it'd be easy to think it was from the early 2000's. Many of the locations are bare and empty places, feeling like they've been built in a rush, and often with several such vacant sets stitched together without any combat or events to distract, assumably to give the impression of covering a lot of ground in a mission. Other areas have clearly had some time and attention spent on them, and the locations and missions waver back-and-forth on this attention / quality scale, leaving the experience feeling quite jarring. You'll wander from a well-realised street, strewn with debris, bodies and signs of previous life... into an area that feels like it's been imported from a PS2 game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game basically play out like Mass Effect's combat, or Mass Effect 3 more specifically. It's a cover-based shooter where you run around with two squadmates, you have abilities with cooldowns, can issue orders and give movement directions to your squad. Enemies come in multiple varieties, some with shields and some with armour, with a few enemy types creating interesting tactical choices (a unit that supplies shields to all other nearby units, for example, if taken out the shields drop and make the fight easier). Unfortunately, where Mass Effect shines in making you care for your squad, here they are just flat cardboard bodies waiting for you to pull their puppet strings. They also keep respawning in front of you whenever you cross through a 'loading door' (frequent area transitions where the game loads the next section as your character very slowly opens a door and looks left and right before giving you control again), which is a bit distracting.\n\nIn fact, I felt the game lacked polish in general. I fell through the level geometry and died twice in eight hours of play, once whilst just running down a straight corridor. Audio logs can be found and played, although walking away from them they fade until inaudible (if I have to stand still to listen to them, they may as well be written text!). The controls aren't terrible, but movement feels clunky and stiff, for example; when you run there is absolutely no strafing, not even in a limited fashion, leaving you to clumsily course-correct with your mouse as you charge forward. You also tend to pop in and out of cover randomly at times, especially if strafing in cover, and controlling your squadmates feels awkward (fortunately the game slows down time during this).\n\nMuch of the story is told over radio as you run between fights, although there are some cutscenes that deal with exposition. The game also uses a dialogue wheel, just like the Mass Effect series, allowing you to choose between being vaguely rude or agreeable, it's a nice enough touch, although it felt a bit redundant with such small scope for actual meaningful choice. Levels are basically linear paths that open into combat arenas, the main missions last 30 to 60 minutes each, with side missions from 15 to 30 minutes roughly (I only did a couple, they felt fairly pointless). The game isn't overly long with six main missions, the story is mildly amusing with some interesting characters (although the main player character really started to grate on me). The plot felt like it tried to raise the stakes too high a number of times implying that Earth has basically been wiped out and already lost by the midway point of the game, then later claiming it's not as bad as implied, which breaks the suspension of disbelief somewhat.\n\nImbetween the missions, the game flirts with the idea of being an XCOM-style strategy game where you pick missions and kit out your squad, but with only six main plot missions and (I believe) seven side-quest 'minor missions', it doesn't feel like there's a lot of variety or choice. The equipment feels limited, with only a handful of weapons to equip and the only other equipment slot being a 'backpack' which acts as a kind of modifier for ammo, health regen, or ability cooldowns.\n\nOverall, not a bad game, just not a particularly good one. It feels like it didn't succeed at being the mixture of genres it wanted to be, and it's not particularly good at being any ONE genre either. The plot is so-so, and the clunky and unpolished feel doesn't help. But if you don't mind all this and want a simple squad and cover-based shooter, this might entertain.","January 24, 2015","false","7.6"," 115 of 147 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","115","147","3","0"

I have mixed feelings about this game, allow me to break it down like this:\n\nThe Good:\n> Interesting story with an intriquing plot twist.\n> Enjoyable 1950's era environment.\n> Nice variety of weapons and equipment ("backpacks") to enable most any playstyle.\n> Graphics are decent, the game is built on the Unreal engine, its not current big budget graphics but I don't mind them.\n\nThe Not-So-Good:\n> They tried too hard to make a tactical squad based third person shooter with cover mechanics that feels very clunky. The cover mechanic requires you to sprint at a wall and basically super-glue yourself to it. This system doesn't seem to want to let you "leave" said wall if say, a grenade is thrown at you, which happens A LOT.\n> The story itself is rather short, you can power through it without any trouble in a couple hours.\n\nIf you are looking for a tie-in game for XCOM: Enemy Unkown, this is NOT it. This game has little-to-no relation to Enemy Unkown and contains none of the base management mechanics that Enemy Unkown has.\n\nSo, in short, this game is worth a look if you get it on sale or as part of a Humble Bundle, but I just cannot recommend buying it at full price. I would put it in the $15 game bracket. Its better than bargain bin game quality but should not command a higher price than around $15.","October 11, 2014","false","14.5"," 84 of 102 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","84","102","2","0"

You are Agent Carter, a cynical broken man thrust into the limelight after an Alien invasion now tasked as the tip of the spear against this new threat.\n\nThere are many elements and ideas drawn from the previous games but it is a strictly linear and pre determined experience.  You operate out of XCOM headquarters between the main story missions.  You have free run of the base and are able to go on minor side missions, perform investigations inside the base and sent agents out on missions on their own to gain experience and new equipment.  Sadly even though the base has vast Engineering and Lab sections, they are cosmetic.  You can't perform research on new equipment or ideas or perform autopsies.  The only way to get new equipment is to find it during a mission and the only way to learn about various elements is to click on one of the copious clickables in the world.\n\nCarter can bring two additional henchmen with him on a mission from one of the four classes.  They are all pretty standard tropes from other games but do add an interesting element to the game.  Do you go all out attack with commandos and snipers, sit back and dig in with engineers and support specialists or a combination of the four.  You can move henchmen around the battleground, conveniently littered with waist high walls, flank enemies and use the various abilities in conjunction with Carter's unique ones for a multitude of strategies. But...\n\nA warning: The friendly henchmen AI is some of the worst you'll ever see.  They'll jump out of cover, run left, run right, turn a full circle, jump over another wall landing right next the nearest enemy before coming back to you.  They need to be babysat at all times or they will be useless.\n\nWhere the game shines is in the fantastic recreation of cold-war early sixties America and the digital acting.  The influence of Mass Effect is obvious but still welcome and the story?  Well, let's just say it takes quite the left turn near the end!\n\nI'll give it 7.5/10 on the AAA scale of 7-10","January 8, 2014","true","16.9"," 118 of 154 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","118","154","0","2"

The Bureau brings nothing new to the table but is still mostly enjoyable. The 60's style is done very well, even though the sci-fi elements detract from the experience at times making it feel like a 90's or even 00's game. It doesn't mix the settings properly I guess.\n\nThe graphics are solid, nothing special, but not bad either. They get the job done, like most games. Same goes for the voice acting. The effects on the other hand are done very well.\n\nThe gameplay itself is hit and miss. There's no research to be done, so if you pick up an alien's weapon you can fire it right away. It's something I missed, especially after playing last year's Xcom. There are mini missions to be completed and agents can be sent on different missions to level up and gather gear. Those missions can not be played so it basically comes down to selecting which agents you want to go.\n\nEach agent has abilities that can be unlocked by leveling up. They're all fun to use and there's plenty of variation to mix things up during battle.\n\nThe battles play out in real time and with the press of a button time can be slowed down to make more tactical choices. Later on you'll have no choice but to use it as more and tougher enemies will be deployed. Without it you'll have a pretty hard time, let me tell you.\n\nAlso, If you're agents are down you'll have a certain amount of time to help them up. If you don't help them in time they'll die and you'll lose them forever. So it's important that you work together and manage them in the best way you can to prevent them from dying. Near the end of the game this becomes much less important because your other agents will be around level 4 or 5 already.\n\nThe Bureau is actually pretty lenghty. I finished it in about 14-15 hours on Veteran so I guess it can be completed in roughly 13 hours or so, if you stay alive the entire time. That's actually pretty decent in an age where most action (adventure) games can be completed within 7-8 hours.\nIf I had to rate The Bureau I'd give it a 7/10. It's frustrating at times, but fun enough to play and finish. The only issue here is the price, because even though there's plenty of content the game itself just isn't fun enough to pay full price.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","September 21, 2013","true","16.3"," 208 of 297 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","208","297","0","2"

Even as a serious X-COM nut I know the plotlines have always been 'meh' and after FiraXCOM was announced I was more accepting of this as a spinoff (like Command and Conquer: Renegade, which I liked). It was still a daft move to make the first XCOM game announced for years the one that closest resembles X-COM: Enforcer, the lowest point of the series.\n\nThis game however is a perfect example of what happens when you force a franchise into somthing unrelated. I like the 1960's and I like the Men in Black angle but by cramming in lacklustre combat and a horribly broken squad command interface into a game that was not designed from the start to be something different has hampered the game horribly.\n\nI said 'lacklustre combat' but I suspect that is being generous. 'Broken' is more like it. To squeeze as much as possible from the squad command gimmick the only way to do serious damage is by flanking the enemy. That in itself wouldn't be too bad if a) you weren't being constantly forced down linear pathways with little chance to spread your tactical wings and b) most importantly, the squad AI wasn't atrocious. I even tried getting them to stay in place while I flanked as they kept with the lemming act when I gave them the move command. What did they do? The followed me. There is no 'halt' command, before you ask. Add to all that bugger all ammo capacity and you'll spend the game running for a thousand guns just to take care of a handful of mooks.\n\nThe graphics are mediocre at best, the base command is even less than what you got from Mass Effect 2 (at least you could choose your research there) but the worst crime in my eyes is the plot. The 1960's was a troublesome time with not just the Cold War but rights movements for women and people of colour. Does any of this get to the game? There's one Soviet agent which is nothing more than 'you can recruit this dude to be a generic squad mate,' only a handful (2 on my admittedly amateurish count) of comments about one of the star agents being a woman and not a single sausage about the amount of black agents and scientists (Again, this is the sixties, that would have been huge and quite interesting). I keep thinking they missed an opportunity by not doing something like Expeditions: Conquistador; imagine if your squaddies had personalities. Likes and hates and all that jazz. Some are progressive and some are more traditional. Do you stick by your guns and rely on women and coloured folk despite the anger you'll recieve or will you bow down to social pressure and prejudice?\n\nBetween the lack of care for anything happening in the 60's and all the sci fi weaponry there is no reason this couldn't have been set in modern day, the eighties, or even in World War 2. It takes effort to make one of the most interesting decades in the last century that generic.\n\nAdd to that the most generic hero character ever (seriously, the guy is every bland hero trope imaginable; WW2 veteran, dead family, alcoholic, tortured past, gravelly voice, etc) and a plot that makes Independence Day seem high brow and it's a total loss on story as well as gameplay.\n\nThe tragic thing is when I look back at the original vids (the ones which sparked the public outcry) it looked really good; the old 'man in black' conspiracies mixed in with the Stepford Wives. That could have lead to some interesting investigative angles and could have created a properly eerie alien plot. If it was allowed to be it's own thing instead of having a brand name forced on it (a brand name not unfamiliar with being abused, admittedly) and not reworked time and time again for stupid reasons we would have had a much better game. For those who whine about the Devil May Cry reboot (which I say was solid), that was at least in the spirit of the originals. The Bureau reeks of the sort of soulless boardroom mandates that I would have expected from EA.\n\nWould I recommend it? It's better than the Syndicate Reboot, but then very little isn't. The word 'generic' appears in the above text a lot. That should tell you everything you need to know.\n\nQuick edit: Yes I know this is a 2K Games published title and not EA, that was a stab at the people who could turn Syndicate into a FPS far worse than Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (which had the excuse of being unfinished and rushed and was still reasonably fun) and the sort of people who looked at the Divine Comedy, social, theological and political commentary that it was and say to themselves, "Yes, this is perfect God of War clone material!" That's right; I am comparing the Bureau to EA's Dante's Inferno.","January 23, 2014","false","12.0"," 155 of 231 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","155","231","0","40"

Do not let the XCOM name fool you. It has nothing to do with the overall story. If anything this game makes a mess of the overall narrative of XCOM. The story is below average with one little unexpected twist but if anything it's more unexpected because up until that point you don't expect much after hearing all the character's dull droning and uninspired dialog.\nThe graphics range from sub-par to bland. Strange phenomenons appear all the time, from the shimmering hair of one of your colleagues that change from blond to brunette, all the way to identical twin guards that also bare a striking resemblance to a scientist you just passed down stairs.\nThe game play is standard cover-based shooting. You move, kill aliens, wave ends, then keep moving; sound like some real white knuckle action? If so, get out more. Sometimes you find an alien weapon and get to use it...that's it. No research, no testing, no means of duplicating the tech. You just have it now and so do your teammates.\nSpeaking of which, your A.I. partners are dumb as suicidal rocks. You give them orders, to which they either ignore so they can do what they want or they follow orders and keep following them regardless of whether or not they are about to die by continuing to obey. They rarely kill an enemy and are more of a liability than a useful asset. When they take too much damage they fall and you have a short amount of time to get to them before they die for good...not that you'd notice. More than a few times I had a teammate warn me I was standing near an alien-thrown grenade. I would jump out of the way while the A.I. teammate that warned me would sit there and get blown up.\nThis game was short. I beat it along with all the achievements on the first time around. The DLC mission "Codebreakers" was horrible. Not only is it an obvious mission that was cut out of the original product to make more money and incentivize pre-orders, it is the SHORTEST MISSION IN THE GAME AND ADDS NOTHING TO THE STORY!

This is not such a great game for everyone else.\n\nThe game plays like a straight B movie, at best.\n\nIt pains me that this game used the Unreal 3 engine instead of Mafia's II Ilusion engine, even though 2K Games owns the former. The differences are apparent and Mafia II came out 3 years ago. The game's facial animations are pretty lifeless, the lip sync is nonexistent, the anti-aliasing is somewhat noticeable, there are some texture pop-ins in the background in open levels, the fire/explosion effects are bad as well. It is ridiculous to still be playing with such graphics in Q3 2013, but at least the game allows you to get a 100 FOV which makes you see a enough of your surroundings,.\n\nThe overall visuals resemble some sort of a grainy pallet, as if you are watching the game through the lens of the late 70's camera.\n\nWalking around the Xcom base is one of the best highlights of the game, at least it seems so at first. Once you soak in the fact that most AI models are pretty much lifeless the feeling wears off pretty fast.\n\nUnlike in the Enemy Unknown you will have opportunities to sneak up on enemies and be able to set up mini-ambushes, although your element of surprise won't last longer than 2 seconds, the enemy will always know where you are, and why shouldn't they? There is always only one approach to beating the level. The levels are linear although they do provide for some flexibility with cover. And this is the first game that I have seen (since Splinter Cell Conviction) that allows you to switch cover diagonally.\n\nThe game loads the level as you progress - each time you open a door a new portion of the level loads while your character cautiously looks around, it's pretty clever.\n\nThe game is moderately easy even on the hardest difficulty wherein your agents DO get permadeath, however you can always reload the checkpoint and start over. That kind of defeats the purpose of the Ironman feature that Enemy Uknown had. But then again, Enemy Uknown did not feature the main protagonist. Or maybe it makes little sense to compare the two games since they have been in a parallel\ndevelopment for quite some time. If anything, this game's combat is closer to Mass Effect than anything. You can heal your squad in an instant, you can pull enemies out of their cover, zap the enemy's shield, set up turrets, use drones, except somehow you manage to do so in mid-twentieth century America.\n\nThe squad AI is so-so. Sometimes they are able to kill the enemy by themselves and sometimes they rush out into the battlefield and get knocked down and later bleed out if you don't rush into the hail of bullets yourself in order to try to save them - which kind of defeats the purpose of a smart squad especially when you are on the defensive - major minus. However, it does feel good when you send an enemy to outflank a turret while you get the turret's attention. Moments like that work in the Bureau's favor.\n\nYour squad mates are sure to run out of cover into the open when they are being flushed out with the grenades. And keeping them in line by rallying them to yourself does not work in the midst of the battle. However, all of this DOES push you forward to be decisive in your actions. Should you take a little too long to outsmart and outgun the enemy you are likely to lose a squad-made.\n\nAs for the enemy AI, well, 90% of the time they expose their heads from out of cover - so sniper rifle is essential, even with its 15 bullet ammo capacity. So even on the hardest mode all you need is one head shot to kill a medium strength alien.\n\nThere are a few things that bothered me. Some of the human tech you have from the beginning is way too advanced. Stealth? Automatic Squad Heal? Smart turrets? What's cool about the X-Com games is that you always faced overwhelming odds with realistic human tech at first - it's the way of the underdog. It's the challenge that counts. And that's what I expected to get from this game.\n\nThe game did not do a good job of building up the tension. The prologue mission has you killing aliens left and right. Your character is a natural right away. Okay, he fought the Japanese and then some Vietnamese, but still...\n\nSure there is a story: it tries to capture the step by step alien invasion across the US and has you traveling to various hot-spots and points of interest. Recruiting new soldiers doesn't cost a thing. So you may never run out of soldiers. What's nice is the constant dialogue between you and your squadmates - helps with immersion and everything.\n\nThe game is, by all means, playable.\nB for effort.","November 27, 2013","true","24.4"," 260 of 415 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","260","415","0","0"

You play as William Carter, an agent with the CIA, and command 2 other soldiers as you fight off an alien invasion.  The main draw of the tactical portion is the "Battle Focus" where you slow down time to give orders to your agents, executing movements and plans. There's some light RPG elements that accompany it, where you maintain a small roster of fellow agents and level them up, picking up abilities as they progress through the levels.\n\nLet's talk about the evil stepmother!\n\nEven when you ignore the XCOM stuff, the story is a mess (XCOM fans, read below, but spoilers beware).  It's very generic sc-fi stuff, but it suffers from some weird pacing and organization issues.  The characters have no personality to them, they're just scarecrows with voiceboxes.  Obviously, the bulk of the game is spent fighting, but even that has its issues.  The squad AI can act pretty wonky, and they require a fair bit of micromanagement.  Multiple times, especially towards the end of the game, I would watch one of my squadmembers try and fire at something below him and achieve nothing more than hammer the window ledge for a minute straight.  Enemy grenades are aplenty, and your squad members do a good job of diving out of the way, but this leads to issues whenever they dive into the corner right next to the grenade or decide to charge through enemy fire to get another piece of cover.  I was pretty active with assigning targets and using abilities, but in the beginning I was still scoring 95% of the kills myself.  As your agents advance through the ranks, they get more abilities which help them carry their own weight, but they don't become much handier with a gun.\n\nThe squad management stuff is also frustratingly vague- when you recruit a new agent, you can pick a background for them that gives some sort of passive bonus, but the game doesn't give any hard figures as to what it does.  You get a blurb, so maybe you'll get a vague idea of what the bonus confers, but sometimes you don't even get that.  This is also a problem with equipment.  Your agents get two pieces of equipment, a weapon and a backpack, and the backpack features a description of what it does but never gives hard values, and a lot of them seem to do the same thing.  For example, you'll find mulitple backpacks that reduce incoming damage, but a lot of these offer bonuses on top of reducing damage, but there's one backpack that only reduces damage.  Does it reduce more damage?  Who knows!\n\nAll this aside, there is a shiny nugget of Good Game underneath it all.  There's a small bright spot in the story that probably lasts for about 20 minutes or so towards the end that was waaaaay more interesting than anything else that had happened so far, but then they decide to throw it away and keep on marching ahead.  The Battle Focus portion has some control issues, but overall I was really impressed with the way plans were executed.  The agent creation system was really interesting, as well, and it was a shame that it didn't offer much more depth or give you much of a reason to use more agents.  I'm convinced that there's good ideas sprinkled about the game like breadcrumbs, and if someone could follow it, there'd be something beautiful at the end.\n\nI still had fun with the game, despite a long list of complaints.  At its core, it's a solid, if unremarkable, third person cover shooter.  While I have no desire to ever replay the game, and I'm going to uninstall it after this, I certainly don't feel as it was a waste of my time.  I would never encourage something to buy it, but I'd never discourage someone from buying it, either.\n\nWhat I paid for it: 12.50\nWhat I would pay for it: 10.00\n\nEverything in the review is based off of playing it on Veteran difficulty.\n\nFOR XCOM FANS:\n\nAs an XCOM title, the game fails miserably, both from a narrative and mechanical sense.  From a narrative sense, my first complaint is that XCOM is an international effort. I get that the game is a tie in, but I don't think I ever heard once the justification of why the organization is called XCOM.  The actual name of the organization is "Bureau of Operations and Command", and then they just start calling it XCOM.  There's also the timeline issue.  The game takes place in 1962, and during the course of the game you get all sorts of crazy, alien technology.  In 1999/2015, when the aliens come back, instead of just shipping over the technology/knowledge on how to beat them, I have to watch my Squaddies die brutal deaths all over the globe because the Air Force lost a Laser SMG in warehouse?  The Council only gets the barest of nods- if you have subtitles on, during the ending scene, someone with the name "Councilman" speaks.  Which, honestly, could just be a happy accident.\n\nGranted, a lot of this can be handwaved away with the word "Spin-off", which is fine.  They pretty obviously co-opted Sectoids into this, but if you were to remove them and all instances of the word XCOM, this would be unrecognizable as an XCOM title.  Which takes us to how the game fails XCOM mechanically.\n\nXCOM, for the most part, has been a game about overcoming insurmountable odds and crafting your own stories as you play through a game.  Yes, there may have been a Squaddie O'Malley in other people's games, but only your Squaddie O'Malley managed to kill two Chryssalids in a warehouse by himself before meeting his untimely end to panic induced friendly fire during the next mission.\n\nThe Bureau strips all that out.  Between the fact that soldiers are incredibly hard to lose- once they go down, there's a bleed out period where they die if they're not revived but you have plenty of time to bring them up. Between that, and the game focusing on characters that already exist, you just don't care about your agents. I still know the name of the 6 soldiers who went on my last Temple Ship Assault, but I couldn't even tell you the name of one of my agents from the game.  They were just "Level 5 Sniper I" and "Level 5 Engineer II".  By removing any tension, and making the player character a tough, disaffected badass who growls more than talks, it just turns into a shootbang gallery where fancy special effects happen sometimes rather than a tense, careful advance against enemies who are far more powerful than you.\n\nIf you came here for an XCOM title, I'd advise you to keep looking.","December 31, 2013","true","15.2"," 54 of 76 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","54","76","0","7"

Do not buy it until it is on steam sale (which should be relatively soon at this rate). Here are a few reasons why I say this about The Bureau: XCOM Declassified:\n1) The game is extremely buggy. I fell off the map into oblivion at least a dozen times for one reason or another. I even have a screenshot of it occurring and me simultaneously dying. Top this off with a few animation glitches, enemies not spawning or allowing you to progress, and you are setting yourself up for repeating some parts or entire battles in a mission.\n2) It has an autosave feature only. No option like in XCOM: Enemies Unknown for what kind of save system you want. This is atrocious when mixed with all the bugs in the game aforementioned.\n3) The game is disappointingly short. It took my crappy laptop longer to download the game than to actually play through it--and I completed every side/optional mission as well (My achievements are proof of that).\n4) Your companions/troops are utterly useless to you. I have screenshots that show just how little they actually contribute to the mission. Hardly any kills, don't know how to use cover effectively, die too often, and literally run into grenades after avoiding them due to a slight time delay in their detonation. It is unbearably annoying, and doesn't improve as they level up.\n5) After you get about halfway through the campaign, you just repeat the same tactics nonstop. This gets repetitive and detracts from the overall interest in the game. You defeat the enemies in the same methods over and over, and it doesn't leave you feeling like you accomplished anything truly.\n6) Getting anywhere in the base is simply a pain in the ♥♥♥. You cannot sprint inside the giant labyrinth that is XCOM headquarters, so it takes forever to go from person to person to talk to anyone for missions. Also, there is a decontamination room in between the lab and the rest of the base. While this feature is neat to travel through the first couple of times, after about 30 times you start getting really agitated/impatient, really quick.\n7) The storyline is not all that immersive for the player sadly enough. A few moral choices here and there, but in the end it is linear, monotonous, and unfulfilling.\nThese are just a FEW of the issues I have had with this game. It was not worth the $45 that i paid for it, but I hope some of the other XCOM games I received with the pre-order bundle prove to be more worthwhile. I give this game a rating of "an out of this world letdown". This is mainly for all the hype it received, especially in comparison to its predecessor, and by definitely not meeting any of those expectations. Go play XCOM: Enemy Unknown instead--it has an expansion as well which will be a better investment for your money without a doubt.\n\nEdit: Since some people think I was/am "too harsh" in my review and believe all reviews or critiques must have positive aspects in them, I now need to make the following statement:\n\nIf a game has a ridiculously overwhelming amount of negative aspects to it that far outweigh the scarce and miniscule amount of "positive" aspects within it, then they are simply not worth mentioning in a review. I played the entirety of this game to ensure readers that I make a THOROUGH review based on my impressions of the gameplay itself experienced firsthand. Most of the time my reviews tend to be positive even...however, this game was so insanely bad that I could not help but try to sway others to not waste their time like I did. Also considering I was one of the few people to pre-order this game based off of the beautiful game known as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I needed to make sure I got my $45 worth out of this atrocity, no matter how terrible it truly is and forever shall be. I hope you all enjoyed my review and I thank you for your time reading it and this comment :) Hopefully, you do not make the same mistake I did in purchasing this game at a high price.\n\nTL;DR: The game is incredibly bad. Do not purchase. Ever. Unless on steam sale (75% off or more only applies here). Do not feed them more money for it at full price. Hell, the Steam Store Score (triple alliteration ftw) for this game should give you an alert to how bad it truly is if nothing else...some people like it...but far more do not care for the game in comparison--and for good reason.","May 6, 2014","false","16.5"," 172 of 279 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","172","279","0","32"

The game takes place in the 1960's making the aesthetics and technology seen in this game very engaging and interesting.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I don't want to spoil anything about the story, basically you play as "Agent Carter", you're a member of a top secret organization that was originally intended to fight against the Soviet Union in the 1960's but a new threat reveals itself and you've been called to save the whole human race.\nwhile the story sounds pretty sterio-typical "save the humans, because you're a freaking super hero!" there were some very interesting twists and turns in the story, I highly recommend at least one play through on the easiest difficulty to at least see how the story unwinds.\n\nGame Play: As has been the theme, I started playing this game the wrong way. This game is more like a "turn based FPS", because you go into "strategy mode" which puts everyone in slow motion, and you give orders to your agents to do various attacks.\nThis is the first Xcom game I've played, but I've been told the games tend to be very strategy oriented, ergo this is actually a black sheep of the Xcom family. As far as black sheep go... I found myself enjoying the story. I've been trying to finish the hardest difficulty which has opened a whole new world of hurt, but that's not important right now.\nThe game is put in a 3rd person shooter perspective, but you will need to rely on your NPC allies, by giving them orders... flanking, upgrading technology, and various other things to take into consideration. The game is far more challenging than one might initially let on.\n\nAchievements: Basic achievement categories: Beat the game, Do this new thing ___ amount of times, Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, do this thing differently, buy our DLC to get 100% on your achievements.\nYes, this game requires you to buy the DLC, which as always, is very disappointing to see. but maybe someday I'll return to this game to get the DLC. But at this point I intend to try the hardest difficulty, if I can't beat it I'll call it good and pack it away and move on to another game, but I digress.\n\nPrice: The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is $19.99 I've spent 19 hours playing this game (10/11/14), I will probably put in about 5-6 more hours to beat the game again on the hardest difficulty (if I can make it), this game is worth its value, in my opinion. I got the game in a humble bundle, which I would recommend to anyone wanting to buy it, or at least wait for a steam sale of 50% or better.\n\nConclusion: This game seems to be best played by someone who likes a mix of shooter and strategy. I found the game interesting and fun to play, but as I've said, to many who have played other Xcom games this is a black sheep.\nI recommend this game to someone who is looking to play a different styled shooter game. You could play through the game using your own shooting ability on the easiest difficulty if you wanted, the story itself will take only about 7-12 hours.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update December 30, 2014:\nHere's the URL to see my review for The Bureau: XCOM Hangar 6 R&D","October 11, 2014","true","40.3"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","39","52","0","4"

Even story really - loose team-building part, replace Reapers with Outsiders, replace indoctrination with infection... few more similar changes... put the whole thing on 1960s Earth = Mass Effect Deja Vu.\n\nThe bottom line, if you are looking for an XCom game - you might as well pass.  If Mass Effect streamlined for combat missions and set in 60s sounds interesting - the game is more than worth the price tag.\n\nNote: Keep in mind the game really is tactical, on anything but the easiest difficulty expect to spend more of your time commanding the squad than pulling a trigger.","November 7, 2014","true","12.4"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","30","39","0","0"

I've seen far worst Agency like games than this, if anything it comes out on top of the list.\n\nSure, there are a couple of issues with this game though. Here are some cons, but, they are very small.\n- Hold shift for running and cover at the same time can get you trap from running away from the wall(cannot be changed).\n- You need to press shift again to vault over.\n- Scanning is pointless in this game as there is no encyclopedia, even for DLCs to look back at for info. Other than that it is for a steam achievement for main game.\n- Hangar 6 DLC AK47 and Micro Wave Gun is not updated or cannot be accessed for Main storyline, they do not exists in the main story.\n\nThere are some stuff you should know when you buy this game.\na. There are no secrets to unlock, so don't bother scrolling around unless you want to read all the letters.\nb. "Hangar 6" DLC is a prequel to the game and should be played first before Main story.\nc. Code Breakers is an optional "Operation" that should be bought when discounted. It is just an extra mission for Main game(was a Pre-order DLC). Very Short.\nd. You cannot scan documents or letters.\ne. Do not buy Light Plasma Pistol DLC. I do believe one of the DLC's come with it. I don't remember how I got it. But I could access it in main game. I don't even have the Light Plasma Pistol DLC.\nf. You do not unlock anything at all for playing highest difficulty other than one steam achievement.

If you do not know 3D vision check out NVidia's forum: https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/49/.\n\nWhat's the point of 3D vision? It changes the immersion you feel in a game. Characters are a bit outside of the screen and hallways in the game have a realistic deepth; that means it goes deep into your wall. It is like watching through your screen. It is something you have to check out yourself  as it is difficult to be explained. Do not make the mistake and compare it to 3D movies. The deepth and convergence is very different. It is more the kind of 3D you will see with the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive.\n\n-- Substance of the game --\n\nFirst of all, I have to admit that I needed quite some time to get into the mechanics. So I stopped playing the game after 4 hours when I first started it one and half years ago, knowing at this time however that I want to retry it again someday in the future.\n\nThis weekend it was this day and I got hooked this time and played through it in three days.\n\n-- What are the pros and cons? --\n\nPros:\n\n- Great atmospheric setting, great story, great characters, great voice-acting\n- Decent graphics with very good science fiction design\n- A great variety of coloufull lights\n- It's the 50s! Everyone in the game looks very classy\n- Rewarding and satisfying combat system\n- First playthrough around 20 hours\n- Replayability because of the combat system and different difficulties\n- Decent skill system\n- A lot short well-written readings within the game that give you some background information of the story\n\nCons:\n\n- AI of your squad:\n\n-->Let me explain: it might not be a big issue if you play on easy but it is going to be very frustrating on the harder difficulties; actually it was also the AI of my fellow combattants that stopped me from playing the game the first time. If you have the feeling a combat is too demanding change the difficult settings. It is possible during every fight.\n-->What's the issue? The AI sometimes is just not holding cover correctly. The combat system is missing commands about what the AI should do at a specific place you move one of your two characters. Sometimes it would just be better for your squad members to stay in cover and let you do all the hard work. But they always decide to get out of the cover and shoot the enemies, but not going back to cover in time so they brutally injured.\n\n- Level-UP system finishes for your main character at level 10 and for your squad members at level 5 - I could imagine a Game+ with more levels and maybe even more variety in skills\n\n- Dispatch missions are good to level up but not really fun because there is no interaction whatsoever\n\n- Story in the beginning a bit confusing\n\n***\n\n==> Conclusion: very atmospheric real-time strategy shooter with issues in the AI. Combat system is easy to learn and difficult to master with some very frustrating moments. Unique game in design and story.\n\n==> Rating: 8/10 (without 3D vision 6.5/10)","April 13, 2015","true","20.5"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","0"

It is like babysitting 3 year olds on the battlefield.  I issued them orders to stay in cover but like most 3 year olds, they start to wander into harms way.  The story seems okay, but it never truly engaged me.  There is no research to be done, which makes it feel more shallow than XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  The graphics are average to above average.

Here was a series that I loved with strong tactical strategy roots that had influenced the genre for nearly two decades... and it's newest release was going to be a third-person shooter.  I assumed that the game was a way to use the XCOM name to cash in on yet another Call of Duty clone.  Fast forward a couple of years and I realized that I was wrong.\n\nThe XCOM 2 announcement got me hyped up on the series once again and I decided that instead of playing through another war in XCOM: Enemy Within (which would've been a blast, even if it were my billionth war) I would try something new and actually give The Bureau a go.  It was a good decision.\n\nThe story in the game is enjoyable, though it gets a little weird and unexpectedly complicated toward the end.  Base building doesn't make an appearance in this game, however, there is an XCOM base where you spend your time in between missions and it is quite well done.  Different scenes play out as you wander through the base depending on events that you've experienced and choices that you've made.  For example, after defeating each new enemy type that you run across you can often see them being studied (in one way ot another) in your laboratory.\n\nCombat, the meat and potatoes of this game, is significantly more fun than I had been assuming.  You issue commands to your squad mates (who come in Recon, Engineer, Support, and Soldier varieties) which include utilizing the abilities that they possess.  These squaddies level up and gain new abilities on a skill tree exclusive to each class that is reminiscent of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  Two agents of the same class could use their abilities in different ways.\n\nThe feel of the combat itself reminds me of Mass Effect 2.  The cover system, the use of alien abilities (some which are very similar to biotics), and even the large variety of weapons to choose from in the game and their varying strengths and weaknesses.  However, it can not be overstated that the AI in this game is less than amazing.  You'll find yourself micromanaging your agents often as they can't seem to utilize themselves to be anywhere near as efficient as when you hold them by the hand and tell them what to do.  On a few occassions, I watched in horror as one of my agents moved away from an enemy grenade, only to realize that the best cover was were that grenade was and return to it to his imminent death.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game with plenty to offer that I recommend to XCOM fans and shooter/RPG fans alike.

When i saw it being compared to mass effect i was intrigued, but ultimately i was left frustrated by gameplay mechanics that are at odds with each other. The Bureau wants you to use its squad command system so much, yet stacks all the odds against you by forcing you down a linear corridor of cramp combat areas with practically zero room to make any worthwhile tactical decisions. Even when you attempt to move your AI partners to flank an enemy, half the time they just get downed almost instantly by pinpoint accurate enemy fire. Add to that horrible weapons with small ammo capacity yet a LAUGHABLY abundant amount of ammo crates littered across the battlefield. The combat is just not fun in ANY way, shape, or form.\n\nIt's a real shame because the story seemed to be pretty decent (minus the completely lifeless and uninteresting generic squad mates), but i just could not bring myself to push forward. I could forgive a game with solid and fun gameplay but a weak story, i would still have a fun time albeit with some regrets. This, however, is just a painful and frustrating experience.\n\n","July 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

The Bureau requires a good amount of tactical thinking, which really makes it feel like a true XCOM game. Lack of strategy, however, might make the game less appealing to some XCOM fans, but the majority of players will revel in the tactical gameplay.The Bureau builds up adequately on a lot of ideas taken from XCOM. As a result it is entertaining and generally true to the XCOM canon but its potential is, more often than not, half-expressed. I like the fact that it forces teamwork, has a great atmosphere and solid graphics. The aliens tend to attack with various and difficult to kill forces from the beginning - that's good as well. Unfortunately later on the magic kind of disappears - the story becomes silly, fights get easier and the interface irritates more and more. But taking all things into consideration, The Bureau is a solid, well made game.\nConsidering the game’s fraught development history and arguably ill-conceived premise, The Bureau is practically a best-case scenario.","July 15, 2014","true","136.2"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","45","71","0","1"

A mediocre shooter for the masses that bears the X-COM name without including any of the things that makes X-COM, X-COM. Mainly that missing element is depth.\n\nFeatures have been either overly simplified or cut entirely to fit the forced mold of a 3rd person cover based shooter. So you have no base building, researching or resource management. Capturing aliens is now a plot point, alien weapons can be used as soon as they're found, soldiers have a generic pre-assigned personality stopping you from making up your own backgrounds for them, and so on. Squad size is now also limited to 3 and the main character can't die. The level progression is also screwed up which means the game gets easier as you progress. There's no tactic to anything, just spam everything you've got.\n\nSo one wonders what was the point in making this game and calling it X-COM. You could argue that it's easier to move the game with brand recognition but I bet you the audience of this game doesn't even know or care what X-COM is. The Bureau was made by 2K Marin whose previous outing was Bioshock 2, a game set in the same time period, making alot of the assets feel reused aswell. The writing is mediocre and boring so I ended up skipping most of the dialoque as a result.\n\nThe Bureau is the bad of Mass Effect and Bioshock rolled into one.","September 8, 2014","false","8.5"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","35","53","0","1"

There is so many little details that wandering through your base after every mission always feels fresh.  Be it a simple npc chat or new props laying around, simply game feels more alive.\nSounds and music are top tier, reloading is so satysfying with that "bing" if you know what i mean. Music is also very nice to hear.\nAnimations in this game fluid and smooth. Its the first thing I always look at in the game, its animations of the characters. You can feel how your characters moves under the certain conditions, you can feel that *weight*.\nStory? Is not bad, it kept me entertrained through the entire gameplay, each character was memorable and interesing to talk to. And ending? Despite its missing a boss battle it was more satysfying with the multiple choices at the end. Not to mention that little secret which was really interesting and I didn't see that coming.\nTactical gameplay? Yes there is and its not bad at all. AI respondds properly to your orders, use cover efficiently and is not stupid. There is a little too much of micromanaging later in game but it pays off if you are a good tactician.\n\nYou have 5 classes, which 4 are only locked for your teammates and you can customize your 3man squad ( inlucding you and your own perk set ), there is definitely a lot of room for strategies. In my game I went with commando (aka tank) and engineer and I was suprised I was able to combine abillities several abillities together.\n\nFor example Engineer was placing a turret, but enemy was behind the cover. I lifted the turret up ( thanks to your psy abillities ) and it could fire while floating in the air. I could also order a commando to *shield* the turret with his abillities to make my turret stay alive for a little bit longer.\nThere is also a blind-shoot , where you can shoot blindly from behind the cover, and this is what XCOM EW could use. Blind shooting and combining several solider abillities together.\nNot to mention that when you issue orders , character talks and people respond to you. Its a small thing but I appreciate this kind of stuff. Games feels a little bit more alive.\n\nNow some minuses:\nThis game would be even better if you could manage your base, yeah you are leader of the strike team not the base so it makes sense. But maybe in the next game . . .?\nAI companions are getting stuck sometimes.\nNot many enemy variety, I was hoping to see some bugs\nSome items felt useless, especialy backpacks. There is way too many of them and I endep up using only the first one from the beginning through my entire game.\nconsole-port feel, a slight but still clunky sometimes. But play fine with the mouse+keyb\nA bit short for XCOM game? 15 hours? Its not bad but game could use more side-mission and improvent system for side-ops for your soldiers.\nFPS problems in certain areas and slow downs , and also phyX never worked for me because it was crashing my game always. Had to disable it entirely to play smoothly.\nMaybe this game was not worth at the premiere release but now? For few bucks? Definitely worth it, you can even replay it on the higher difficulties and try different setups/builds. Just don't buy DLC because they are useless.\n\nI would rate this game 7.5/10","January 30","true","14.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Not impressed so far, although I'll update my recommendation if my opinion changes. It's not that the game is terrible, but it gives lots of hints about the game that it wishes it could be, but fails to be. And I think I would like THAT game more than I like this cover-based third-person real-time-strategy shooter hybrid that can't make up its mind on what it wants to be and ends up second rate at either.\n\nThe things that the devs put a lot of effort and care into look/work great. Unfortunately, those things don't seem to encompass quite enough, and not in the most key areas. Examples: When you go into the AI-teammate command mode, time doesn't stop, it only slows down to something like 25% speed. The writing is... um, not the worst, but I'm bored of these people already and I only just met them. AI's kind of dumb early on, although supposedly later on in the game it stops feeling like escort missions and they actually hold their own.\n\nIt's not without its good elements. I like the setting itself; care definitely went into that, if not necessarily the dialogue. Where it's not a dark corner with fog and darkness covering up the extremely flat and featureless textures in unimportant corners and other corner-cutting measures, the world looks decent. The promise of what it could be/could have been is still a significant part, however.\n\nIt'd probably be a fun multiplayer co-op game, to be honest.

It's like the developers of Mass Effect wiped their ♥♥♥ with the extra funding they had from the ME series, and churned out a ♥♥♥♥ show of a game called The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.\nThis.  Is.  Rough.  The worst part is, you can often times see the potential this game has.  It's a game that WANTS to be good, WANTS to be a fan service... But it falls flat so, so early.  The main character is a boring, rude, monotone agent who constantly bounces between "caring", and "shut up, we have a job to do".  His "personality" actually adds to the overall failure of this game, I feel.  The cover system is atrocious.  You are either super glued to your cover, or you can't get into cover, on a game solely based around Third-Person Cover Shooting.  Like I said, Mass Effect with a pennies worth of funding.  That gets really infuriating when you're on the highest difficulty and some of the enemies advance to flank you, and you're bashing the multitude of buttons to get off cover and nothing is happening.  The abilities are boring and unimagitive...  Once again, comparing to Mass Effect, they pretty much ripped off the abilities.  Lift, Pulse Wave, Weaken...  Jeeeeeeeeeeeez.  The guns are all boring, with little personality in each one.  I could beat the game using the M1911 pistol, to be honest, since it seems to deliver one hell of a headshot.  In fact, most of the guns feel like they do NOTHING.  You're tickling a Sectoid with your Scatter Laser.  wat.  Running around the HQ QUICKLY becomes tedious.  You have to run back and forth, back and forth, etc. etc.\n\nPros:\nXCOM Lore\nA nice "old school" feeling... They did somewhat decent on that\nInteresting view into some of the aliens\nKilling an alien every now and then results in some funny physics\nDecent graphics and audio\n\nCons:\nTerrible controls\nBoring abilities and guns\nTedious legwork in the HQ\nSticky or repelling cover\nRepetitive gameplay to the maaaaaaaax.  Trying out new guns, new squaddies, or new ability combos don't add at to the experience at all.\n\n\nGo play XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, or any of the older XCOM's.

I went into it expecting a decent game that just used X-com names, and after all, it can't be worse than X-com Enforcer, now could it?\nWell, it can. Enforcer had its over the top, fast paced shooting with loads of weapons to amuse you. The Bureau has chest high walls to protect their chest high walls that you can sit behind.\n\nI only got about 3 hours in until I just plain could not play any more. With poor controls(Very obviously a console port that they didn't care enough about to make it work for PC), and absolutely awful AI. Several times have I seen the AI just run right into the open without any cover without any prompting whatsoever, and several more times did I wonder if the AI actually follows your commands or knows what end of their gun to point at the enemy. After some experimenting I found the answers to these questions.\n\nNo, they do not know what end of their gun goes to the enemy, and they do not understand 'go sit in cover here so I can flank them' either. And speaking of flanking, you will need to do it. For the first few minutes I wondered why the aliens had titanium skulls, but then I realised a headshot and a torso shot are about the same. You get a flat damage bonus if you flank your opponent though. Good concept - but it just doesn't work with the braindead AI and clumsy controls. It isn't actually explained anywhere either, so unless you're quick to figure things out you'll blow all your ammo on an alien who is 'in cover' but still sticking most of his head and torso out for you to shoot(And deal nearly no damage because of this 'cover'), get frustrated, and quit.\n\nThe story seemed interesting enough and I did want to see what was next, but I just can't justify spending more time on it than I already have. The story just can't carry the rest of the game and I can't really care enough to play further.\n\nOh, and the glass physics were pretty good.

In short words: If you like XCOM:Enemy Unknown and it's former, ancient games, you won't like this.\nIf not, you might like it.\n\nBeautiful graphics, but gameplay gets repetitive really quick, and the story stops getting interesting in the middle of the game.\nAnd the endings are letdowns. If it wasn't for a single good story part, I'd consider this 'wasted time'.\n\nThere's no research or reverse engineering - which is what XCOM has been about since always. All you have to do is pick up enemy weapons and that's it. Nerd note: Remember that in XCOM, alien weapons are rigged to self-destruct if the owner dies, only rarely they fail to self-destruct. Also, they have DNA scanners, so the weapons cannot be immediatelly used by a race different than the one it's programmed for.\n\nGameplay and dialog seems to have beem mimicked from Mass Effect, which would be a good thing if it didn't feel WAY too similar.\nXCOM base - which should be the most interactive and fun part of the game IMO - is just an interactive menu with sidequests, and nothing affects the game's ending. Even saving a fellow agent (which you can fail to do so) makes no impact in the game at all.\n\nThe mix of FPS, squad management in the field and tactical combat is very fun, however. Unfortunately, it gets repetitive quickly. And your squadmates are, like the plot, expendable.\n\nFor XCOM fans: while it IS fun to explore and see the XCOM universe in first person, you will feel tired and uninterested if you expect the same experience from other XCOM games.\nIt is also very weird how quickly things go south for humanity and how everything seems to fall apart in days, in comparison to other XCOM games.

Team management on battlefield is pain in d, the AI is way to stupid they can't handle them selves, just as soon they pop their heads out they get badly injured and yelling "WE ARE SITTING DUCKS HERE!", player constantly has to give orders in order to let them survive which is bulllshit, using abilities is what that devs didn't rethink before they actually implemented in game, i wonder if there were any beta testers but this idea is worst of them all so anyway enter battle mode by pressing (in my case it was "SHIFT") and pick something that you have to deploy for example towards the alliens, so picked ability should be easily to deploy right, just use mouse but NO! intead game thinks that it's person or character who is walking around thus you can't just simply deploy ability through objects and walls, you must avoid every object and every cover in order to deploy your damn ability which was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustration, what were they thinking.\n\nOverall, is The Bureau: XCOM Declassifed good enough to pick it up?

Shocking, I know. And therefore, I'm well-acquainted with a certain type of friend. Let me paint a picture here. He's always had your back, always been there when you needed him, but he has a couple of really, really painfully annoying quirks. For instance, remember that time a fly entered your flat? He just wouldn't shut up about it. It's always something small, something minor, but he ensures you pay the closest attention to it, regardless of how meaningless it actually is.\n\nWell, today I made such a friend in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Agent Carter is the kind of guy who's the first to let you know he won five bucks in the lottery, there's a strange car going by, or a slightly interesting sesame seed happens to be on his burger bun. How do I know this, you ask? Because that's the Bureau experience! Pass the 100th enemy craft in the past five minutes? Carter's right there, with an, erm, clever "WHAT IS THIS THING?" He always brings along two of his best friends who are personified in exactly the same way, fear not.\n\n"Biggles," I hear you cry. "We get it. He's lame. But a character does not a game make! How can you possibly justify this negative review on one thing?"\n\nWhat a rude line of questioning! I found Carter unlikable from moment one, making, as I play through, it very hard for me to find him sympathetic enough to NOT walk him into enemy fire if only so he'll stop talking for one bloody second. But, okay. You want more complaints? Oh, I was picking out the mildest one and hoping this review could turn out somewhat nice.\n\nI suppose I do have one nice thing to say: the plot has a few mildly compelling elements.\n\nErm, that's about it.\n\nReally? I have to do this? Fiiiine.\n\nLet's start with the most glaring sticking point: optimization. This game supposedly runs on Unreal Engine 3, which is a downright shame. I've never encountered an instance before where UE3 results in optimization this bad. It maxed out my reasonably high-end system despite looking like a 4-year-old console title. Even worse, despite this, it lags comparably to me on an early morning. I had to turn settings down considerably on a GTX 770 and hyperthreaded quad-core CPU to get the blasted game to stop stuttering. I could understand this if the title presented an interesting aesthetic or impressive visual fidelity, but it just... doesn't. It's going for 50s sci-fi, but missing the mark. A grain filter and some art deco font doesn't sell me on the concept, and that's all we have going here.\n\nThe gameplay sadly doesn't make up for any of this. It's the most very boring and generic of shooters, masked by a faux-squad-strategy "mode". Sounds cool enough, sure, but it just doesn't work in practice. The game doesn't actually pause, rather slow down upon entering its "command mode or whatever", which means you're often left directing the game's AI to do tasks while you sit behind cover simply to avoid getting hit. Your own squadmates fail to take cover on their own, leading to a lot of stop-start gameplay, with no real payoff. Even worse, the enemy AI is as clever as your team. Nothing here provides a glimmer of interesting challenge.\n\nI simply can't recommend this game. I'll finish it, I'm stubborn like that, and this is very much a first impression, but I can't see this game lifting itself out of the rut it's so totally committed to burrowing. Whatever elements it introduces from this point, it will remain a buggy, poorly-optimized, generic shooter-with-a-gimmick. And to make matters wor-\n\n"WOAH, SOMEONE DIDN'T LIKE SOME GAME."\n\n"WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?"\n\n"WHAT WENT WRONG?"\n\nOH SHUT IT, CARTER\n\nUPDATE 7/17:\n\nI did finish it. No, it didn't ever really get better.\n\nI enjoyed mildly the game's late plot twist. Though it was predictable, it was presented well.\n\nIn the interest of not typing another 4 paragraphs of vitrol AS I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO, let's leave it at "I didn't enjoy anything else, and the gameplay managed to get even worse."","July 11, 2014","false","15.6"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","23","35","0","2"

"oh his wife and kid burned alive in a fire, and because of that he gets drunk, so yeah".\n\nthe Story its self is once again generic and pretty mild. "go here, do this!" oh and aliens! another thing it suffers from is the fact that a lot of it doesn't make sense. so the 1950 X-com didn't tell the 2013 X-com "oh yeah, aliens? they exist. also they hate us." why does the 2013 X-com know  nothing about what happened in 1950? why didn't the 1950 X-com give the 2013 X-com all the info they got in the field? also what the heck is with the zombies?!  there are no chrysalids to be found, so where did they come from? later on you learn that they are "sleepers", a zombie like human the aliens can control but then we are still left with the question, why? we see that with this they can put sleeper agents in the governments of the world, but why do it to random civilians that just become unaware of whats going on around them? what do they have to gain by doing that?  during the game your squad members will "hot wire" alien doors. how do they know how to do that? have they already fought aliens and know how to hot wire their doors? why is none of this explained? even if they burned everything related to the 1950 X-com how would they hide all of the destroyed towns? the huge craters? the sudden end of hundreds of family lines? in the beginning mission the top of a mountain is torn into chucks and floats above it surrounded in blue light, how could anybody NOT see that?\n\ngame play itself is pretty annoying, almost all of it is hallway shooter kind of stuff, why not give us a more open-world? The fact that you can go into slow-mo and order your troops to do things gives it a little classic X-com feel, but in the end its like they didn't focus on the shooting game play, or the world. and that brings us to another problem, the World in this game. the world feels.... wasted. you know how Bioshock Infinite really made you feel like you where in a 1930s/40s world? with the Music and the surroundings? well this game has none of that. most the world is copy and paste, and the bits that aren't are covered in the stupid alien walls and buildings. and those things are 100% copy and paste. so in the end it makes a lot of the world feel like it was used over and over. to top it off there are invisible walls EVERYWHERE! "oh you can't jump over the crack in road sir! its too damn high!" one more thing, the weapons in this game sound and feel like pea-shooters none of them have that "bang" or "high pitched crack" to them. most people might not care about that but after coming from games like Battlefield 3,4 and Payday 2, it really is annoying.\n\nin a some-what hilarious outcome the game suffers from two of the annoying problems that Mass Effect had,  Your Choices in end they lead to a "good" or "bad" ending, thats its really, do this and you get a epic ending where lots of people live and everyone is happy, do the other and everyone dies... other choices don't feel like they changed much, and  guns magically appear in your hand during cutscenes, in the ME series we had the magic Avenger, in The Bureau: X-com Declassified we have the mighty M1-grand.\n\nin the end did any of us really expect a game that was killed and revived three times to be any good? didn't we learn from nuke-dukem? i feel like the game would be super epic if it was another turn-based game but set in the 50s. that would a great game. because this game is like taking Age of empires and turning it into a RPG/Third person game. and even if it was good the fans don't want a RPG or a third person game they want a X-com game! they want punishing turn-based gameplay. not this shooter crap.","April 19, 2014","false","15.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slashrawr/recommended/65930/","slashrawr","Slashrawr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slashrawr/","501 products in account","As of writing I'm only about 6 hours in but I feel compelled to write this review now while some impressions are fresh in my mind.\n\nBeing a long time fan of the XCOM franchise I approached this game with a fair amount of skeptisism. It turns out that skeptisism was somewhat unwarranted. While I'm still not entirely sure if the game belongs in the franchise but it's more than capable of standing on it's own.\n\nLet's get deal with it's weaknesses first; of which it's biggest by far are the clunky controls. They make movement particularly during combat a bit of a gamble. Sometimes you can't get into cover, sometimes you can't get out, sometimes you just find yourself popping out of cover and not going anywhere. I can't help but feel this comes as a result of it's console affiliation. The sprint button is the same button used to take and leave cover. Moving around corners while in cover is not performed automatically like in most games, it requires it's own keypress. Another weakness appears to be the friendly AI; they're just not terribly bright. While they seem to know when a grenade is thrown and move away, at least first, they often just rush straight back to where they were _before_ the grenade has gone off! They require constant babysitting. Sometimes they'll stay where they're instructed to, other times they'll just go wherever they please. The enemy AI aren't Einsteins either - they have a tendancy to run back and forth between two cover positions - but they appear to be more capable than the friendlies. They actually move from grenades for a start, and are capable of flanking when possible.\n\nNow for what makes this game genuinely good. Firstly the outstanding visuals. The models, textures, lighting are brilliant. The levels are highly detailed making it feel like ones really in old 1960s America. The immersion is deepened by small touches like photos, audio reels, documents and notes, my favourite being ones that instruct folks to ask specific questions - like what sound does a dog make or where someone was when President Johnson was assassinated - to aid in identifying disguised aliens - because they aren't able to reproduce a "woof" sound and they have trouble with distinguishing Human names so won't know that President Johnson wasn't assasinated. It's the sort of thing one could imagine actually happening in such a scenario. Great little touch! The story itself while not all that original is told really well through discussions with NPCs and the documents and audio reels all over the place. You get fed the story in small chunks and the underlying mystery is slowly revealed. The sound is top notch and the voice acting isn't half bad either.\n\nThe gameplay, now this is a bit a mixed bag. A key mechanic is the use of a "Battle Focus" mode which slows time to a crawl and allows you to issue orders to your squad. This is actually done extremely well. Moving a squadmate into cover shows the level of cover provided by that position - partial or full. Orders can be queued up for execution. They system works really well. Having said that I have a few qualms about it; I don't like the fact it just slows time down instead of pausing it altogether for example. At least it should be an option to do so. To use the main characters abilities you're required to execute them through the "Battle Focus" mode as well, you can't just push a button to do so. This is particuarly annoying when you want to heal your squad quickly, you have to open "Battle Focus", hover over the characters skill bar, click the skill or push the number associated with that skill. I would rather just be able to push the button. Back at base the player is given the choice of missions to run; the choice varies between storyline missions which must be completed at some point and side missions. Side missions are a great way to increase the XP of the player and his squad. And that brings me to another hit-and-miss part of the game; the RPG element. The player and his squad obtain XP through kills, XP translates into leveling up, leveling up translates into new skills and stats; the usual affair. That all works just fine. One can even customise their squads names and looks - a nice touch. What stands out though are the classes of squadies. Different classes afford different abilites on the battlefield. This works especially well and adds a fantastic dynamic to the game. Of course it's possible to specify the loadout of your squad but this is where I had a small issue; you get a selection of weapons which is all good and well, but nowhere are you told what damage the weapon does or what enemies it's affective against or anything. There is a shooting range provided at the base which I suppose one could aruge should be used for this but I'm not sure how accurate an assessment that would be. I would like to be told what range of damage I can expect and what distance it's effective over and if it's good for taking down shields or mechanical targets, that sort of thing.\n\nOverall, it's perfectly competent 3rd person tactical shooter set in a masterfully constructed world and set to an intriguing albeit unoriginal story. I would certainly recommend it.","April 3, 2015","true","25.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You buy.\n\nLonger version: When I bought this game I went into it noting the 'Mixed' status and numerous less-than-enthusiastic reviews, thinking it to be one of those games I could ignore for a while and then install and play when I was bored enough.  In fact I played through a number of other games before getting to it.\n\nI was surprised to find it both engaging and enjoyable.  A few people have said it has certain... similarities, shall we say, to the Mass Effect series and I'd have to agree.  It's a cover-based 3PS which involves a lot of hitting Space and going into slo-mo, issuing orders and flanking enemies.  It also has a radial conversation menu and various forms of pseudo-magical technology (most pertinently telekinesis and mind control).  Not only that but one of the squadmates' voices is done by Brandon Keener, who voiced Mass Effect's inestimable Garrus Vakarian (and he's not the only one; Courtenay Taylor, who voiced Angela Weaver in this game, also voiced Jack in the ME series - and there are plenty of others).  So that was nice.\n\nFrom a story perspective it has plenty of depth for what it is: a 60s themed alien invasion game.  This isn't Shakespeare and there's no point expecting it to be.  The whole story is based around giving you excuses to go out and shoot aliens and really, isn't that what you bought the game for?\n\nWhat the story doesn't have is complexity.  Don't bother looking for interpersonal nuances in this one because the conversation choices at most boil down to 'be nice' and 'be an a-hole,' with no difference in the outcome.\n\nYou can't choose your character - or, at least, you can't at first.  You play through most of the game as Agent William Carter, a generic gravelly-voiced white dude with a tragic backstory who at least lacks stubble.  Later in the game you get to make a choice between playing for a little as one of three other characters but there's no character creation (or, for that matter, character development) in this one.\n\nThe landscape is pleasing to me.  Sometimes you're in town, at other times you're in the middle of alien bases.  Sometimes it's both.  Wherever you are, though, the art style remains recognisably XCOM.  Running through alien architecture at eye level where normally you'd be directing a squad from above is definitely a novel approach.\n\nThe UI is a little cumbersome at times but, having said that, I'm not entirely sure how I'd recommend the developers could have done it differently.  It works, it gets you through the game and it's not enough to drag you out of the game so hey, I could handle it.\n\nMechanics are very simplfied in some ways - there is no research or XCOM base inventory, for example.  You pick up a weapon, you collect it for use by anyone in your squad who's trained to use that item type (anyone skilled in pistol use can wield a plasma pistol, for example, even if you've only ever picked up one of them).  There's no armour (though you can wear 'backpacks' and some of them do indeed reduce enemy damage).\n\nAnd this is the point: The Bureau is not like other games in the XCOM series and some people find that jarring.  If you want turn-based squad mechanics with research, base inventories and other stuff like that, go to a different XCOM game (or wait for XCOM2).  This is not what you're looking for.  This is something different.\n\nIf, however, you're happy to play a 3PS game set in the same universe (if much earlier) with a story that doesn't require you to make notes on what choices you've made, this is a good one.","January 26","true","18.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

This wasn't the case in my playthrough - I completed everything without a single agent killed. I suppose once you tailor your squad to YOUR playstyle, it will become much more managable. Sure, you have to micromanage your squad like all hell before the battle, but if you do things correctly, even the toughest battles are a breeze.\n\n....maybe I'm the 20% of people who actually enjoy the combat. Maybe.\n\nI suppose the negative criticism is also because some people are upset that this game isn't like Enemy Unknown. Sure, the game story/choices thing mirrors Mass Effect (there's even an "I should go" option), but the story itself, in my opinion, is enjoyable, even though it started to fizzle out in the end. Hell, even the combat system itself mirrors Mass Effect (crew placement-wise, pausable combat phase, etc).\n\nThe sidequests are fun (though I can understant that it's sort of the same thing over and over again), and 60s atmosphere is great.

Move to the next cover fight, move to next cover fight, etc. but without the tactics and strategy that makes the XCOM series a success.

Problem with that being that there are only token references to anything XCOM, with it becoming more and more obvious that it's a cynical cash-in the further into the game you get. Even if you remove the notion of it being an XCOM game entirely, the plot is absurd and extremely poorly-written, from the humans just "somehow" being able to hotwire alien doors down to the headdesk-inducing stupidity of the major plot twist. The main character is effectively "Gruff Growly McGrowlson" without any personality or noteworthy traits other than "he's a grizzled veteran." None of the other characters are interesting in any fashion, instead all being cardboard cutouts that exist purely to have NPC's around to move the plot forward.\n\nThe AI, both friendly and enemy, is incredibly stupid. It's not at all uncommon for your guys to run directly into enemy fire, expose themselves entirely to said enemy fire even when sitting "in cover," get stuck on things, and so on. You're constantly having to give them orders and engage healing just so they won't get themselves killed. Enemies aren't any better, though at least they throw grenades on occasion to try to flush you out.\n\nThe shooting mechanics are functional at least, but they're nothing more than that. The weapons themselves aren't satisfying to use, and the shooting itself is just your normal cover-based shooting that you've seen in Gears of War or Mass Effect... just completely unrefined and unpolished.\n\nThe game's riddled with glitches and other technical problems, some of which are hilariously nonsensical. For example: it's an NVIDIA-optimized game, yet turning on NVIDIA's PhysX functionality causes the game to crash every single time you try to play it, until you disable the feature. Tons of animations glitches, sound bugs, and so on pop up all the time. Sometimes entire lines of dialogue are missing entirely, as if they just couldn't be bothered to implement them due to time constraints or something.\n\nIt should be noted that this game started life as an FPS. More specifically, it started off as something that looked like a really crappy version of BioShock, yet was eventually retooled into what we have now, which is a garbage Mass Effect ripoff. There's no creative drive here. No soul. It's just a game that was cobbled together to complete a contract and be a cynical cash-in on the series' popularity. Except, nobody wanted it. Fans of XCOM want more XCOM. They don't want this crap.\n\nNeedless to say, the game is awful. Don't buy it. Don't even look at it. Just let it be forgotten, as it should've been in the first place. If this weren't branded as if it's an XCOM game, it would've been completely swept under the rug as "just another crappy ripoff."

This, on the other hand, is the poster-child for "Cheap Console Port" and the very definition of a "Cash Grab."\n\nIt's pretty obvious that someone was working on a random cover-shooter game when someone from marketing came in said "Hey, we just bought the rights to use the X-COM name!  So go and redo whatever you're working on to have some X-COM references in it, ok?"  In their frustration, the programmers then spent the last couple of months of development time spackling a thin veneer of X-COM over their product, rather than just finishing what they started and making sure it worked right.\n\nThe end result was a this embarassing mess: Like the unfortunate cat from the Pepe Le Pew cartoons, this is very obviously a completely different game that got a quick stripe of X-COM painted over it's back and now the marketing skunks are trying to convince us that it's the real deal.\n\nAlso, even a cursory look through the YouTube archieves shows a completely different game was originally planned - one that seemed far more interesting.  A game based on investigation, mystery, and uncovering secret plots.  Apparently that game got shelved, sadly, and instead they just pulled this game off the shelf and deceptively put it in the same box.\n\nLike I said, I'm not some "tactical purist" who thinks that an FPS X-COM is some kind of heresey.  I think it can be done.  I think it should be done.  Most of all, I believe that it can and should be done right.  Sadly, this game doesn't even come close to making the mark.

Don't expect a game similar to the turn-based tactical shooter XCOM games, it's a completely different game and to be honest it's in my opinion a weird decision to relate the game to the XCOM Universe. STILL, after playing a couple of hours I'm actually enjoying this game. It's challenging, different (in a good way) and once again your team mates can die in combat permanently. The story has a cool twist, interesting characters (the main character also looks and sounds alot like Charlie Sheen, which is actually a bonus for me!) and the combat system is very unique compared to other games in the same genre. I'm playing with a controller so I can't really comment on the consoleport issues altho i'm encountering some framerate issues from time to time but nothing that would disrupt the gameplay in a hard way.

In my 10 hours spent with it I've learned I was wrong. So far the combat has been incredibly satisfying. Lifting a Sectoid into the air and ordering a Sniper to use a critical strike to blow its head clean off its shoulders feels incredibly fantastic. I don't know how they did it, but it feels (to me at least) like an XCOM game. Graphically, the game looks good. Not great, just good. I must admit, I had no idea that there was PhysX suport and I haven't used it yet. The story so far has been alright. Nothing truly spectacular, although it does keep me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who you can trust. Squad customization is not nearly as deep as it is in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but it's there. So in short, I'm enjoying my time with the game a great deal. If you enjoy XCOM and are looking for a diversion, then I highly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloseEdge/recommended/65930/","CloseEdge","Bacon Milk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloseEdge/","126 products in account","Story: 9/10\n\nGreat start, Great twist, Great choice in endings. Not going to go too much into this because it would require spoilers. Let's just say the beginning is REALLY important to remember throughout the entire game. It's where the great twist towards the end started planting itself.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nA better experience than mass effect. Uses the same sort of control ( keyboard mouse/gamepad ) set up as Mass Effect franchise but it's more responsive and more action packed. Running is actually useful and you can do tight turns while running without the clunky stop and move turning mass effect had/s. Cover is useful here and needed. If you're not in cover you're dead, this isn't a run and gun. You NEED to tell your squad what to do. Management of your squad is your duty. This isn't made easy for you by having overpowered teammates.\n\nFlanking enemy entrenchments and positions is key to winning. Falling back and moving is the only way to survive being pinned down. If you've played XCOM: Enemy Unknown you'll be familiar with the systems in play here. I will say it is dumbed down at the beginning but the Infiltrator boss fight is when the game shows it's real design. Enemies do NOT run at you like idiots they take cover and try to get you to reveal yourself by dropping grenades and setting up flanking maneuvers. As you progress enemies get more aggressive, the shielded enemies have a tendancy of flanking your team and trying to strike from vantage points. Enemies with higher health are more likely to push and attack aggressively, while enemies with lower health pools tend to hang back in cover while pressuring flanks.\n\nGlitches: Not really a problem.\n\nI've seen a bunch of posts about this game being glitchy and in truth, I saw almost no glitches. I had 3 things happen that didn't really break the game. To fix them I just simply picked the "reload checkpoint" option in the pause menu.\n\n1. There was a sound glitch where sounds were sort of cut off as they were fading out. making it sound like there was a stutter in dialog or just simply dialog, music, or battle sounds being cut prematurely. reload checkpoint fixed this.\n\n2. Squad member got stuck inside of something while reviving. During a mission a squad member was stuck in a bookcase when he went to try to revive a squaddie and even though I was down a team member it didn't make a difference I still finished the fight and he immediately became "unstuck" and teleported out of the glitch on his own.\n\n3. This one didn't cause me trouble but I did have to "load a save" that was a couple of minutes behind my progress. I just lost about 3 minutes of progress and it wasn't even in a firefight but right before a boss fight. These gates are supposed to close and the way into the fight arena is supposed to be closed off. Well I spawned in a checkpointed save INSIDE the rubble. There's AMPLE checkpoints in the game and I never found myself "redo'ing" an entire fight.\n\nSound(track): 8/10\n\nThere's not really much to say about it, everything fits, from the 1960's music in the quiet streets of an overrun town to the creepy alien noises and loud bangs everything fits. The guns later in the game sound really good. Crisp reloading sounds let you know what gun you're using. Every gun's reload sound is different, some pop, some crackle, some wind up. You'll know when a squad mate is pinned down and can't attack, they're constantly telling you about their situation ( I'm pinned down! Need healing! I'm about to go down commander! We're being flanked! ) or asking for orders. They'll also yell out what they're using so you always know what's on cooldown ( Turret out! Cloaking! )\n\nLength: 5/10\n\nUnfortunately, this is where I am a bit disappointed. The game isn't that long to be honest. My first playthrough trying to do everything possible without outside help of any sort ( walkthrough, videos, wiki ) clocked in at 17 hours of gameplay. I didn't get ALL the base investigations but I'm pretty sure I got most of them, if anything I probably missed out on 1 or 2 at most adding something in the 15 to 20 minute range. This is the only thing that's disappointing about this game. Although all missions felt handcrafted and well made some weren't longer than 10 minutes ( side missions ) some more would have been nice.\n\nClosing this out, Yes I recommend it. The campaign was a blast with really awesome moments. Everything felt handcrafted not just another generic "this is where you fight, this is where you walk" sort of campaign. It was refreshing to play a game with such a different look at the genre. This game felt... Special. It's the only way I can describe it. The addition of the squad management was really a nice touch. Giving out the commands on what to attack and what skills to use made me feel useful in the game and didn't make me feel like I was along for the ride.\n\nAll engagements were engaging and I had to participate in the positioning of my squad which made me think more about my next step instead of mindlessly shooting at enemies that were running at me.","October 18, 2014","true","35.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Hard.\n\nOverview :\nThe Bureau is a TP squad based shooter and is 2K Marins verson for XCOM.  Originally in 2010 being a FPS with really nothing to do with the original games.\n\nThe Bureau now combines TPS and strategy elements together and tries to be somewhat similar to the X:COM people know and love.  The game is real time, but if you want to assign an order to a squad mate, it slows time down to a crawl, which is Marins way of giving some love to classic X;COM fans.  Similar to waht Bethesda did with FO:3 with VATS.\n\n\nPros :\n-Pretty fun squad based third-person combat (when it works).\n-Upgrade trees, while not amazing, are kind of fun to go through the first time.\n-It does take some thinking when faced with many enemies in a high difficulty.\n-It has enemies from from classic X:COM such as Sectoids, Mutons, and Outisders, etc, while also adding new enemies to the mix, though not many.\n\nCons :\n-Has annoying bugs, for example, when I play, if someone is talking and I look away from them, I can't hear their voice at all.  Even if I don't move away from them, but just look away.\n-Now I don't know if this is a bug, or a result of being unfinished, but if you tell a squad mate to go somewhere, many times they will move away from where you told them to be.  Many times, this has ruined strategies I had planned out because they got killed or something and I couldn't do what I planned.\n-it has weak ♥♥♥ graphics,\n-character models look awkward\n-voice acting isn't complete trash, but isn't good by any means,\n- it has weak story telling.\n\nSome other things to point out are the boss battles (in my opinion) were really lazy, the way you gain more weapons is just dumb, all you have to do is pick up an alien weapon, and then you have it for the game.  I liked X:COM EU's way of doing it where you actually had to research it and build it, THEN you get the weapon.\n\nLast words :\n\nI really wish they made this more like X:COM EU but with the TPS setting, but sadly, we got this.\nThis could have been amazing, but it really isn't worth $50 at all.  If you are okay with dealing with bugs and annoying design choices and you love TPS's, then maybe pick it up if you see it for like 30 bucks, MAYBE\n\nOverall, it's a weak, one time playthrough game with very little heart put into it.  Sad as 2K Marin made Bioshock 2 which I thought was a phenomenal game.\n\nThe DLC also sucks as well IMO, but I won't write another review just for that.\n\nI rate it a 4/10","December 3, 2013","false","18.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","3"

Why do the player's dialogue choices do absolutely nothing?\n\nControls: Sluggish.

It isn't like the other XCOM games, which is a welcome change. I like the leveling up system, and that you can customize Carter and your squadmates, though more customization options would have been nice.\n\nThe combat feels like Mass Effect, and has its own charm to it. I like the action mixed with having to use tactics. Battle focus is a neat thing as well if you want to know more about your enemies. Though sometimes the AI behavior can make combat a bit frustrating. It's pretty silly when I want to flank an enemy and I see my squadmate running towards me through the middle of the battlefield.\n\nThe characters and missions are, to my mind, interesting. The information you get through the dialogues and documents adds lore to the XCOM universe. And I actually really enjoyed the main story. It had a neat twist. I liked the occasional choices you could make, even though they were quite insignificant, it did make some difference in a few aspects.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of XCOM and doesn't mind the different approach!","June 4","true","29.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But several things (mainly the third-person-perspective and the combat mechanism) kept me from buying it then.\n\nBut thanks to the latest summer sale I decided to buy it and all of its DLC.\n\nEasy part first: the DLCs aren't worth it. One gives you an extra alien weapon, one gives you a short extra mission and the Hangar 6 R&D gives you a bit of a pre-story to the main game and some new - only (!) in that DLC available - weapons to fight through some simple 'survival' levels.\n\nA bit complicated is the main game. While in many other cases I have problems with the third-person-perspective, it worked well in this game. Also the combat system is working good and most time satisfying, but way to simple to fullfill the tactical needs of an old X-COM veteran.\n\nThe graphic, the sounds and the characters really helps to create the right atmosphere for the game and also the different settings for the missions making it fun to play, even with a too much repetitive gameplay. And that gameplay is also the biggest issue of the game. You walk trhough the 'tunnel' maps knowing nothing will happen, until you come to a 'battlefield' (easily identified thanks to the huge amount of cover for your men and the aliens), where you fight some waves of enemies and then continue to the next 'battlefield'.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me playing was the story, which had some weird twist and gets very unsatisfying in the end. But for me, the game was worth money and I didn't regret it any minute to have bought it.","July 16, 2014","true","18.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Unfortunately no matter what class your squadmates belong to they all share a similar characteristic between all of them, poo-brain.  Yes your squadmates have the worst case of poo-brain I have ever seen, its almost as if the brains from Futurama are invading Earth the same time the aliens are.\n\nNot only are your squadmates inheritly useless, the combat is very cut and dry and flanking seems to be non-existant when they drop boss mobs on you who will down any squadmate who decides he should run around for no reason, which is the biggest cause of stress in the game.  Your squadmates WILL NOT STAY IN COVER and need to be constantly ♥♥♥♥ing told to stay put or they will run around aimlessly getting downed.\n\nSo as for gameplay the game is terrible as its a terrible version of Band of Brothers.\nVoice acting is okay however the lip sync looks awkward as hell.\nGraphics are fine if thats why you buy video games.\nThe story is as good as good as it gets for XCOM games.\n\n\nTHIS GAME IS ONLY FOR THOSE OF THE DIE HARD FANS OF THE XCOM FRANCHISE AND ARE WILLING TO PLAY THROUGH A CHORE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE XCOM UNIVERSE.","June 24, 2014","false","23.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I'll explain.\n\nThe Bureau's play style is different from XCOM: Enemy Unknown, XCOM: Enemy Within and XCOM 2.  It's very similar to Mass Effect games in that you command where your squad members go and what they do.  It's a "third person tactical shooter experience with strategy video game elements" -Wikipedia.  One has to wonder if the developers where playing Mass Effect during its creation considering development began in 2006 and finally released in 2013.\n\nTo complete missions, you recruit agents from a list of different available classes, each with their own background training, and then take any two agents from your roster into the field with you.  As they gain field experience, agents unlock their special abilities known as perks.  At certain perk levels, you decide between specialisations.\n\nBeing a huge Mass Effect fan, this game brought a smile to my face.   It was a lot of fun and I couldn't stop playing it.  I finished the campaign in a week.\n\nQuestions you should ask yourself if you are considering buying this game are:\nDo you like alien technology?  Do you like special augmented abilities?  Do you like plasma, laser and lightning weaponry?  How about combo kills that are announced when successful?   Did you enjoy the Mass Effect series?  Do you like the genre of science-fiction?  Then you should play this game.\n\nI decided to buy The Bureau on a steam sale because I received my copy of XCOM 2 in the mail upon release from...an online store...and I like to play games in chronological story order.  I also bought XCOM: EW and EU from Steam as well and I'm looking forward to playing them next.  All of this, of course, is building up to play XCOM 2.\n\nAdditional thoughts and criticisms:\nGraphics wise, the game is par for the course for a game released in 2013, which is to say they're good even by today's standards.\n\nThe XCOM base of operations is highly detailed, roomy and there are plenty of NPCs to converse with between missions.  Scattered throughout, are also files to read, pictures to view and audio tapes to listen too; all of which adds depth to the story.\n\nThe voice acting is good, but I found the voice of Agent Carter, the main character you play as, reminding me a little too much of Batman's voice.  It made me laugh at times and took me out of the story momentarily.  Of course, it could be due to the fact that agents seem to be smoking non-stop throughout the game.\n\nThe other criticism I have is that there isn’t much of any ‘new game plus’ upon completion of the campaign, save for playing it over with different classes of agents.  Also, and unlike in Mass Effect, there aren’t choices you make that have consequences in the story line other than if you play on the hardest difficulty and one of your field agents die, they are dead permanently and you have to rely on your other agents to fill in and begin leveling up a new agent.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI finished the game wanting more missions to play.  I think that’s a good thing.  It was fun to play and I recommend it, especially on a Steam sale.\n","February 15","true","32.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If I had to sum it up in a single sentence, I would say this: "So much potential with so little delivery." The game's advertising campaign played it off as an ominous 60s' men in black (not the movies) style adventure, filled with espionage and intrigue. I expected to be redacting documents and cleaning up alien hot zones to conceal the truth from eyes not yet ready to know. Instead, what I got was a disassembled and badly reconstructed 'Mass Effect' (the first one) shoot-em-up with a thin 60s' veneer thrown on for good measure.\nI play games for the story more than anything else. The adventure. The experience. And while The Bureau has an intriguing overarching plot, what you experience quickly becomes a tangled mess of two dimensional characters, deus ex machinas and plot holes. In terms of whether or not you want to include it in the canon of Xcom itself, I would say: don't. It raises too many questions and leaves to many open boxes unchecked.\nMechanically and in terms of gameplay, I was not overly disappointed. Though reminiscent many other similar squad based games, the Xcom influence and interesting take on a tactical overview was certainly a plus. Though my poor PC found the game stressful at the best of times, I was still able to get a relatively enjoyable experience out of it.\n\nAll in all, it is a game with no personality but alright gameplay. As previously stated, so much potential. So little delivery. I would rate The Bureau a generous six out of ten.","December 13, 2013","false","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You can find little side missions by just looking around the main base which adds a very slight amount of things to do and the little notes and reports dotted around add to the story.\n\nThe missions themselves are also mixed, the gameplay is actually pretty intense sometimes where you actually have to plan out what you want to do next and how you want to approach a level. This is good and the squad is a good idea, I get a similar attachment to my soldiers in the actual X-COM games. The friendly AI can be beyond stupid sometimes however and just move randomly without orders into enemy fire and create loads of problems.\n\nGoing back to squads this is an element of the game I enjoy, being able to customise them (although limited) gives the soliders individuality and it's a small touch but changing their weapons and backpacks adds a little bit more strategy to an otherwise normal shooter.\n\nOverall the game's a bit generic in its gameplay but the styling is good and it certainly has its moments, I recommend this on sale to anyone who likes shooters and also the idea of the X-COM series.

With XCom – Enemy Unknown released and being a worthy successor to the series my initial rage faded away. So now that I don't have to treat The Bureau as a sequel but rather a spin-off, curiosity made me buy this title. And to my surprise I was quite pleased with the approach 2K took on the theme – at first.\n\nThe XCom setting is transferred into the late 1950ies with the USA suffering from anti-communist paranoia. The first abductions, alien attacks and UFO sightings are misinterpreted as a soviet invasion by authorities.\n\nIf you played any XCom titles you will get familiar with your enemies, weapons and abilities quickly. Also in the XCom-HQ, which you can roam and explore between field missions, you will find all the well-known departments like Engineering, R&D, Hangars and Infirmary. Merging the 1950ies with the XCom theme breathes new life into the franchise and works quite well. I liked to see my sniper wearing a vest and tie while aiming for a hostile commander or my Tech/Engineer wearing some ordinary janitor jumpsuit while blasting Sectoids into smithereens.\n\nDuring missions you control your own character and via the command interface, which significantly slows down the time and allows to scan the surroundings, you can issue orders to two additional agents. Even though it's a 3rd person view you will use well-known tactics you would use in the strategy games as hide and cover, flank the enemies and focus fire. Success heavily relies on the use of those tactics as well as yours and your agents special abilities like mind-control, critical strike and deploying additional equipment as turrets, mines and drones. So The Bureau actually is a tactical shooter and run and gun will get you killed.\n\nUnfortunately the game constantly prevents you from using these tactics. The missions are (as the whole game) heavily scripted and linear. Approaching a hostile encounter is always announced by a checkpoint save and a cliff, high boxes or another obstacle you have to jump off down into the battlearena. In the first half of the game these battlearenas are so small and the provided possibilities for cover so few, that you don't have much choice where to deploy agents and what tactics to use. In fact it feels like a longwinded tutorial.\nIn the second half of the game the battlearenas get much larger and you have a lot of possibilities to flank enemies and can diversify your tactics. Unfortunately your character has a very restricted area of command. So I have my heavy gear guy flank the enemy on the right side while sending my sniper to a vantage point. But as soon as I move my character and any of my agents aren't covered by the area of command anymore, they start closing in to me ignoring any enemies or any order given beforehand.\n\nThe poor technical optimization is the second major annoyance. Even though I have a decent gaming rig, I wasn't able to play with DX11 but had to turn down to DX9 and even then I had <30fps until I turned off the PhysX features. This game devours system resources without giving much back.\n\nBut even more annoying than the above-mentioned are all the inconsistencies of the plot. You will find dialogues missing, making some answers given by NPCs meaningless. And despite the story has a nice twist in the later part of the game, you will feel there are parts missing and obviously the world and the plot were meant to be more fleshed out in the first place. At least the german voice acting is quite good.\nFirst playthrough ~20hrs.","July 25, 2014","false","25.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

This game puts seemingly difficult RTS commands and simplifies them just enough to make the game play as smooth as possible.\n\nXCOM is known for it's suspenseful cinematics and storyline incorporating an unknown attacking alien species. The story unfolds with special agent Carter who rendez-vous with other members of the "Bureau" aka people who deal with alien affairs. He attempts to deliver a package to a general then suddenly the general is shot by another agent. Shocked, Carter quickly turns to the other agent ready to take action when she quickly points out the change in eyes and behavior of the general who was under alien mind control.\n\nXCOM fans will be familiar to the play area as it will give friendly reminders that you've sort of been here before. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling going from an RTS view to first person. The grid system sort of is there, but the command system is absolutely on point. By holding B (on a 360 controller), a command menu opens up and slow down times slightly as you make a selection of what to do. Player can choose from numerous actions such as move, pin down, and shoot while certain characters have specialized abilities. One character, for example has the ability to set up an auto turret while another can scope enemies with his sniper. The game is nothing short of exciting when it comes to game play as there can be a lot going on. Some players will like this as you will need to quickly command your troops where to go while ensuring you're doing your part to keep the enemy suppressed. Nonetheless, the command system is quick and efficient in it's means. Players won't have a problem designating commands. The shooting itself is alright with nothing exceptionally special and there is an option to scatter/throw a grenade. Any game that has that as an addition is greatly welcomed. There is also a melee feature players can use which is basic at best. It would have been nice to see them incorporate ways to capture aliens and maybe somehow incorporate what they did with Enemy Unknown, that way maybe you could upgrade or change your melee weapon. Basic movements are all there as you can take cover, roll, jump, and sprint. Although a little stiff, it's nice they put it in.\n\nGraphics make me feel like I'm PC gaming back in 2008 but don't interfere with game play. Pause menus are nice and user friendly. People actually move their mouths while they speak in game which I found a neat feature. Sounds are appropriate but aren't varied. I'd like to hear more ping sounds come off when I fire at the enemies cover.\n\nOverall a good game and would highly recommend it for those who seek a FPS / RTS sort of hybrid. I support it for this reason but cannot guarantee everyone will be satisfied with it's shooting/action styles.\n\nRating : 7.35/10\n\nScreenShots :\nAbout to issue a command\n\nOptions I have within the command menu\n\nI'm in the back with my other two partners in which one of them set up a turret.

Because soon enough these concepts will all just fade into the background and even though you’ll want to discuss them with NPCs, it’ll never come up as an option!\nMe: Oh… okay.\n\n----\n\nGame: Hey, look at all these unique NPCs, each with thier own unique personality. You know, if the combat reminds you of Mass Effect, then I bet it's just as important to invest in these characters like you do in Mass Effect. After all, I stress SUPER HARD that this game is about collaboration and teamwork under pressure. And the dialogue mechanics are eerily similar to Mass Effect!\nMe: I liked that about Mass Effect, Mr. Game, so I'll totally spend as much time interacting with NPCs between missions as I spend on the missions themselves. Plus, as I talk with them I learn more about my own characters' personality and grizzled past. I want to know more about the mysterious, hard-headed protagonist than just about any of the other characters.\nGame: Good idea! Dig up his story as much as you can. That way, you totally won't expect how that “I’m difficult to work with, but always get the job done" Clint Eastwood-style protagonist totally loses his effin marbles at the end and you have the play the last chapter as some omnipotent alien puppet-master taking possession of characters you never really care about.\nMe: I'm sorry, what? Wait, in that last chapter where are all those folks I spent the whole game learning about? The ones I DID care about?\nGame: I’m sorry, who?\n\n----\n\nGame: You captured an alien combatant! Hey, his attitude towards humanity is changing—maybe later he'll be able to join your squad. Wouldn't that be cool?\nMe: Hell yeah. I'll keep checking up on him between missions and help him on the road to acceptance as he matures as a character.\nGame: HA GOT YOU! Kill him. Like literally, I am making you. Do it.\nMe:    :’(\n\n----\n\nGame: Oh no! There's an enemy in your base, tearing it up! You better catch him!\nMe: Right you are Mr. Game! I spent so much time investigating all the different departments in my base, I don't want him to wreck any of it.\nGame: Right! Well then you better chase him through all these super interesting labs filled with neat experiments and devices and people, none of which were ever accessible to you up until now! Hurry and catch him!\nMe: Oh, wow these places do look really cool as I sprint through them. I'm excited to go back through here and interact with all this new content after I’m done with this chase!\nGame: TOO BAD LOSER. You will literally never set foot back in ANY part of your precious base after this current plot point is finished. GOOD DAY.\nMe:    :’(\n\n----\nGame: Uh-oh! Two characters are pinned down in different areas of the map. It looks like you have to chose which NPC you want to go help! Don’t worry, I’ll let you know now that someone else is going to help the character you don’t choose, so IN NO WAY is this an arbitrary way of making you choose which character is going to die.\nMe: Game... why do you hate me...","June 11, 2015","true","26.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","8","12","7","0"

Let's ignore that there is no strategic overview, no internal economy, no research trees, manufacturing, UFO combat, or any continuity in the new XCOM EU universe.\n\nThis game is, at its core, a bland cover shooter.  There are three hallways in this game that you fight in: Main Street USA, Rural USA, and Generic Gray-Blue Spaceship corridor.   Fighting in deep space, on an alien planet, or on an Earthbound Alien base?  Gray-Blue Corridor.  Travel 600 light years to an alien satellite?  Gray Blue Corridor.  Head into earth orbit on a spaceship that should really be called the Firestorm?  Gray-Blue Corridors.   That's all this game is - walk down a hallway, crouch behind cover, and shoot aliens while trying to keep your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI team mates alive.\n\nWhile it seems there is the potential for some deep tactical action in your engagements, the extremely short leashes that your teammates are kept on interferes with their ability to flank the enemy.  You can try to set up a recon agent to shoot from an elevated position, but if you move forward to get in range of your shotgun, the short leash that your teammates are on simply means they will move up to the front lines with you.\n\nWhen you boil it all down, the game is just dreadfully boring.  The combat gets old dreadfully fast when you have to spend most of your time just keeping your AI alive on the higher difficulties and outside of picking one of three ending narrations you get, no other choice you make throughout the game has ANY impact.","June 1, 2015","false","26.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The boss battles basically sum up to shoot, shoot, shoot, find another gun, shoot, shoot, shoot, dead. The customization of your squad is a nice touch but the "skill sets" you chose for each class are confusing and some of them overlap. The worst part is that the suspense of an ongoing alien attack performed by a highly advanced race decades ahead of you is killed when every level your killing whole platoons of aliens. On a positive note, a good time can be had playing this game, if you play in short bursts; the idea of this game is great but, this series wasn't the right game to impliment it with.

The graphics and art design are fantastic, as long as you get the game running well on your machine. In The Bureau, aliens invade Earth and the XCOM group sends their best to take on the aliens.\n\nCombat is very similar to that of Mass Effect 2 + 3 - but combat here is much more tactical, since you have way more control of your party members. In fact, it's pretty much essential to survive that you must use the tactical "slow-down" to survive. It's not a BioWare-style tactical pause here - it only slow-down time a bit for you to make orders. You may create, randomize, and recruit agents and their actual looks, class, and everything at your own will and desire. Though, the down-side is that you'll never really feel attached to your teammates - since they do not have personal "Loyalty" missions, to make you care about them; this isn't Mass Effect here. If there's anything besides the excellent art direction and setting that 2K Marin gets absolutely right with this game, it's the excellent tactical combat. One thing that is never dull here is the tactical combat - and this is certainly the best reason to play this game. If you liked the combat in Mass Effect 2 + 3 but wanted something a bit more tactical and have more control over your party members when in combat - this is the game for you.\n\nEven on Squaddie (difficulty #2 out of 4), this game is tough - and this is coming from someone who plays a lot of games - especially shooters. The game actually suggests difficulty #3 by default - which given how tough Squaddie often is, given the number of times my party died, had to reload a save, or lost a party member to "perma-death"; I'm not sure if the 3rd difficulty should be suggested as its default! "Perma-death" is in effect here - so if you survive a mission and one of your party members doesn't, they're gone from your game entirely.\n\n2K Marin did a fantastic job with storytelling & character development in Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den DLC, but doesn't do so as much here. Storytelling events that occur either are quite obvious as to what's going happen next (predictable!); and/or the big pay-off moments just aren't well put-together or is under-developed. By the time the game's story gets very interesting & has an excellent twist, which is somewhere closer to the back 1/4th of the game - it makes the gamer wonder why this sort of execution also didn't happen earlier, as well.\n\nBut, once this plot-twist happens, the game drops the ball again in another regard: by spreading out auto-save points, which can lead to moments of complete frustration when players have to replay long-winded shootouts. There's nothing wrong w/ grand, long-winded epic shootouts like these - but it could've used an auto-save, somewhere in the middle or before the game brings out the really tough moment - since the game does have difficulty spikes within some of these sections.\n\nWhat it all comes down to, is this: if you want a game with excellent art direction; an excellent setting; looks great in DX11 mode (if your PC can handle it); you enjoy 3rd-person shooting similar to Mass Effect 2 + 3; but you also want a shooter more tactical than Mass Effect 2 + 3 - then this game is for you and it shouldn't be missed. If you're looking for a game with great story and characters, most of the time - this is not that game. It doesn't always execute that stuff consistently. The Bureau could've been elevated to a much greater status, if it actually delivered more consistently on its character + story elements, since it actually does often try to emphasize these elements. Overall, when it's all said and done - The Bureau is a solid and worthwhile 3rd-person tactical shooter.\n\nFinal Grade: C+","February 12, 2014","true","18.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refity4/recommended/65930/","refity4","Drifter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refity4/","573 products in account","It's quite a fun game and yeah, it totally nails the cool B-movie 50's aesthetic - it looks really pretty, too. I actually enjoy the story, and you get to even wander around the base and talk to people and meet some crazy scientists and help them with stuff. Really, if it hadn't had the XCOM name attached to it The Bureau would've been (aside from the preconceived 3rd person shooter notions that are wrong) pretty decently received. Because it's actually a nice game.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe thing about The Bureau is that in order to enjoy any sort of victory, you'll HAVE to constantly be controlling your team mates. You can think of it in terms of babysitting (as some have who didn't like it) or you can treat the game as turn-based that happens to play out in near real-time (with pause).\n\nWhat I mean by that is that in a turn-based game you have to control each of your characters, telling them where to go and what to do each "move" instead of letting them do the Mass Effect thing of allowing them their own agency while occasionally ordering them to do a specific action. Also, this is not a game where you can hunker down behind a wall and peek out to snipe at enemies - anyone who tries that will get killed quick, you or your teammates (or the enemies). Always be moving.\n\nBecause of the real-time(with pause) gameplay mixing with the third person shooter aesthetic it can be initially confusing to try and mesh the strategy of one with the mechanics of the other, but so far it's been pretty darn cool. And hard. Mutons are no joke; tactical withdrawls while trying to flank a giant armored, angry alien is kinda crazy - especially when other aliens are all up in my place, too. I won't even start with the sectopods.\n\nThe battlefields are pretty nice, as well. They are large enough to allow you to actually flank or otherwise move around in order to get the drop on enemies (or the other way around, enemies occasionally try and get around you, too). Enemy AI is nothing to ooh and ahh over, but you generally have options in battle, which is nice, and it's usually a challenge.\n\nJust to reiterate, people want to play it like ME3 or Gears of War or some other third person shooter with some partner AI, while it should instead be played more like a legitimate strategic/tactical game where you're not a main character, but directly controlling all three on your team. If you rely on the partner AI to do anything for you strategically you're going to watch them fail and you're going to repeatedly lose - and then hate the game. You need to be treating it as a realtime w/ pause game of action chess or something to get anywhere with it. The gameplay might not be for you, and that's okay, but if you understand that it's not an ordinary third-person-shooter and you're okay with that, you're going to have a good time.","December 29, 2013","true","25.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

However, while this game isn't broken and it isn't terrible, there are just so many flaws that drag it into mediocre territory. After about 3 hours, I lost interest, and I simply wasn't having fun.\n\nThe biggest thing that frustrated me was the inconsistent characterisation on display, especially from the protagonist. He's painted as a noir-like loose cannon that gets the job done, but this is just frustrating - he  bafflingly switches from treating characters with respect to ignoring orders just because, and seems seriously shaken up by the loss of a character he's just met despite being grumbly and disaffected about everything. It's as if the writers couldn't decide who they wanted him to be.\n\nI also have a few issues with the combat which were individually not deal-breakers but were frustrating when added together:\n- Control is often taken away from the player for unplayable cut-scenes which add absolutely nothing to the game\n- Weapons lack impact, many enemies take a frustrating amount of damage to put down\n- Combat scenes feel like they drag on too long consistently, additional spawning enemies feel frustrating\n- Because there is no crosshair outside of aiming, bringing up the sniper scope doesn't necessarily point it at the enemy you were looking at. Add this to the insane amounts of time between shots and for reloading the sniper rifle, and one of the most satisfying weapons becomes one of the most frustrating\n- Cover mechanics more complicated than they need to be when it comes to rounding corners or leaving cover\n- Team mate AI is often bad. Engineers stand in front of their own turrets taking damage without moving. Your squadmates mindlessly hang around detonating mines. And they never seem to do any damage - they seem to fulfill more of a babysitting role. I understand that this is to make the player feel empowered but I'd at least like my team of crack professionals to be competent!\n\nThe tone of the game switches frequently - an audio log found in a university plays a professor reproaching his assistant for 'not following his intuition and relying on evidence'. Because that's what being a scientist is like....? And I seriously have to question why an institution that's meant to be the best of the best is so full of 'loose cannons who don't play by the rules'. If this is meant to tie in to any sort of X-Com canon, I've never considered my squaddies in other games to be dismissed alcoholics or police with a criminal history. It's a pity that this little thought was put into the setting and characterisation because the artwork is convincing and consistently impressive.\n\nI would have loved for this game to be so much more. I'd pick it up on sale if the above issues don't bother you much.\n\n","December 18, 2014","false","3.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","0"

The game essentially tries so hard to be 60s Mass Effect, but really only succeeds on the former front, in that it’s 60s as hell. Seriously, it’s the sole shining point here; The Bureau is inundated with shirt-tie-and-vest combos, classic cars, transistor tube radios, and chrome as far as the eye can see, which really injects the proceedings with a much-needed sense of atmosphere. Unfortunately, everything else solidly falls within the realm of mediocrity; the blandly-written protagonist is your typical gruff “tormented past, seeks redemption through fighting the new threat” archetype, and the gameplay that you experience through him is a weird, somewhat tedious fusion of third-person shooter and XCOM-style strategy.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the visuals and effects of the abilities themselves are quite cool (especially in the late game, where you get access to turrets and airstrikes), but you have to hand-hold the inept AI that utilizes them so much that, in the end, you’re gonna be spending 50% of the time shepherding them through every action via Battle Focus (this game’s tactical view), and the other 50% running around and reviving them because they’re so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fragile. Seriously, does the COM in XCOM stand for “Clothes Only, Men”? … (I’m so, so sorry.) Anyway, as a result there is a sort of franticness to the combat in that regard, but unlike its sister game Enemy Unknown, the management of lives is more frustrating than heart-poundingly tense due to the increased repetition and frequency at which “getting downed” occurs. In any case, if you end up purchasing this game (I personally wouldn’t unless it’s less than 7ish dollars), play on “Squaddie” difficulty or below, as there is less a focus on team micro-management, and more an emphasis on blasting aliens with space magic.","July 1, 2014","false","23.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I can understand the enemies carrying a slightly different appearance (like a muton the size of a small pickup truck, or a Sectopod with a Sectoid in it), but unless there's some glorious retcon later in the plotline, there's absolutely no rationale for why your team (at a very low level) gets abilities like Group Heals, Shield Spheres, or the ability to.... telekinetically(?) Lift enemies and allies by waving your hand.\n\nOn top of that, one of the classes gets the ability to... summon?  an automated laser turret, yet another piece of tech that the "real" X-Com games never had.\n\nSo, again, if they didn't call it X-Com, it might be okay...\n\nExcept for the squad AI.    They have absolutely no sense of self-preservation, or peripheral vision.

Rather than take the one additional step to the side so they could run behind reasonable cover, they vaulted the wall, and made it about two steps before the enemy cut them down as well.\n\n2.

Target dies, and suddenly one of the squad starts whining about healing, I look, and he is OUTSIDE, UNDER THE WINDOW, completely flanked.  The AI was so busy focusing on keeping Target A in the line of fire, it took cover in such a way that it left it's flank exposed, to the bulk of the enemies (which, BTW, both the main mass, and the target it was going after were accessible from the window cover)\n\nIncredibly frustrating, and just not worth dealing with.

(At least the German scientist made sense!)\n\nAnd the combat? What can I say, I thought it was a lot of fun. I could actually imagine playing a proper X-Com game in this style. To be perfectly honest, I think I enjoyed it more than its successful strategic sibling, but that's probably because I couldn't quite get into XCOM:EU's weird mix of detail and streamlining, which I know other people loved. (My personal favourite is X-Com: Apocalypse, so maybe I'm just weird.)\n\nIt's almost certainly not a game for everyone, but it's not a disaster, either. If you're in the right mood, it's a very solid experience. I don't regret playing it.","October 1, 2014","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But on its own merits I really enjoyed it. If it has a primary failing I'd say it's not enough.\n\nAlmost everything begged to be expanded on just a little more, from the aliens to the tech to the main characters. It felt like there should have been at least one or two more main missions, a few more side missions, maybe some more viable weapons, maybe another enemy type... you see what I'm getting at. The game left me seriously wanting more - not just "replay it" more (though I'll probably be getting around to that soon enough) but just more content. The feel of this game would have benefited greatly from 2K Marin having just a little more time and money.\n\nBut I still had a fantastic time with it. The weapons felt good, and upgrading to the alien weapons felt even better. The powers also felt great, and I never ended up regretting my choices. (Sure, they're kind of limited overall, but they're still fun.) Carter is well-built for holding and pushing at the enemy line, but can easily be played to sow confusion among the enemy's numbers. Your squadmates all had solid power choices as well, with each class fairly well balanced to its role and begging to fit different playstyles. I stuck mostly with the same squadmates throughout the game, as well as the same equipment, but am already considering how to change stuff up for next time. Nearly all the kills will still fall on your shoulders, but judicious use of your squadmates' powers will make it a lot easier - the Support agent's shield bubble is a lifesaver, and everyone else is full of ways to keep the enemies off your flanks or help crack a defensive point.\n\nI'm not much of a third-person/cover shooter player, but really, if this is a POOR representative of the genre, then I definitely need to play more. I'm not totally certain I'd buy this full price, but that's mostly because of financial considerations. I got it on sale and it was well worth what I paid.","September 18, 2014","true","25.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Instead of a table top strategy game, pushing units around, and dealing in percentages with a combat system reminiscent of old school Fallout, now the game runs in real time, with a third person over the shoulder view for what is really another shooter. The movement and cover system is akin to the Gears combat movement system. In fact, I'd call it a Gears clone if it didn't have the obviously superior ability to issue orders to your squad - something that franchise sorely lacked.

A lot of the negative reviews come talk about the bad AI, but I never had huge problems with that. Sure, occasionally they'd leave cover for no reason or do other stupid positioning things, but it was never anything game-breaking, just an occasional minor annoyance. My one main problem with the game was that when you go into tactical mode where you're giving orders to your team, it doesn't paus the action, just puts it in slow-motion. This can lead to issues with trying to set up combos or time certain things correctly, because by the time you're done giving orders, the enemy might have moved or your first operative will have already started doing their action. But once you get used to the timing, it stops being really noticable. The story was pretty good, and I enjoyed getting to choose which classes to take into the field, therefore completely changing up how you fight in battles. This isn't anything like the other XCOM games, but if you go into it knowing that, then it's a fine game on its own.\n\nSo my conclusion is, this was a decent game that doesn't deserve all the negativity it got. I don't know if I would have paid full price for it (and I didn't, because of reading the negative reviews), but if you can catch it on sale, it's definitely worth it if you enjoy third-person, squad-based shooters.","November 25, 2014","true","25.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Like many, I'd just finished playing XCOM - Enemy Unknown and was hungry for a continuation of that. While still set in the XCOM 'universe', it's a very different style of game and many of the negative reviews will be because of that, which is unfair to what is actually a pretty good game. They've made a brave attempt at making a game which isn't a guaranteed money maker, and I think they've done a pretty good job. I love it when developers don't paint by numbers.\n\nIt's a third-person shooter not dissimilar in gameplay to Mass Effect, though set in the swinging 60's (with a very 50's feel), you have 2 squadmates who you give commands to during Battle Focus (slo-mo), as you work your way through linear mission levels. Personally I'm not fussed by linear levels - I'll take them over non-linear ones which just give the illusion of choice to fill out gameplay time.\n\nThe game itself is fairly short if you just go through the main missions, though if you're a completionist doing all the side missions and exploring the base properly, and going after achievements, you'll get roughly triple the game time to about 20-25 hours.\n\nThe graphics are good, and the scenery and level design excellent. They've clearly put alot of work into quality over quantity, and I actually feel bad about not standing around too long to just look at what's been put into it, especially mid to late game. However, if your computer's falling behind on the ol' hardware department, you might find your framerate dropping noticeably in areas.\n\nAliens are what you would expect from an xcom game, and I found the later game to get a bit easy due to a strong compliment of abilities. Still, I enjoyed all the combat, and if you're having trouble with your agents chasing after you when you try to flank the enemy, just manually move them to cover first so they aren't in follow mode.\n\nThis game's not for everyone. Some will find the pace a bit slow, especially in the base, but honestly the game is 80% off at the time of writing this review (£2.99 ..$4.43 at current rate), which is an absolute steal for the work that's gone into it. If people reviewed the game removing both their expectations, and personal preference for what games they like, and instead based it on the quality of the game itself for its genre (which is what reviews should be based on, not personal taste), then it would be somewhere in the positives for sure.","December 22, 2015","true","34.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It pushes several of my happy buttons, from the XCOM branding, to the Cold War paranoia, to the retrofuturistic aesthetic. This could have been the ambitious first entry in a new spin-off franchise... but unfortunately, nearly everything in the game is marred by a clear lack of polish.\n\nI could write about the outdated interface (no mission objectives onscreen or all the other nice little UI touches we've come to expect over the last 20 years), the poor level design (lots of railroading and impassable waist-high obstacles), or several other issues, but by far the worst offender is the combat system. Instead of a fluid, enjoyable experience like Mass Effect 2 or 3, the tactical squad combat is clunky, poorly explained, and extremely unforgiving. It's the heart of the game, and it simply isn't fun.\n\nOverall, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified isn't a bad game... just a mediocre one.

It attempts bring the infamous tactical combat series to the console with Mass Effect inspired squad-based real-time battles. It utterly fails as a PC game and shames the XCOM title.\n\nWriters attempted to push the envelope in a few areas: two major characters include a gay Australian medical doctor and a senior female agent who struggles with the patriarchy of the era. Unfortunately, there is still the trope German scientists and the uncreatively written, guilt-driven by typical lost-love protagonist. The main quest develops much too fast, introducing new characters and pivots before the lead agent has sufficiently investigated the story or the player can understand justification for the last plot twist. The non-combat ‘investigation’ missions teased early on in development were never realized.\n\nCheckpoint saves, specifically before [skip-able] cutscenes break the games flow. For large battles, this is very demoralizing as failure to defeat a large end-boss means playing through waves of weak enemies ramping up to the climax that you've already seen several times. Combat is at its best when it clones gameplay that we've already seen in BioWare games. Special abilities distributed amongst your always-leveling squad are over-powered compared to level design which teases tactical flanking but is never effective at harder difficulties.\n\nSeveral weapons and items are under-powered and the player has no motivation to explore strategies with them, others (e.g. the blaster launcher) are all-but-required for taking down large enemies. The 'equipment pack' modifier to soldier abilities doesn’t hold a candle to mother XCOM’s soldier customization options. A total conversion of the XCOM:EU for the 60s era would suffice better than this poorly executed attempt at a prequel. Not only would I recommend not buying this, I'd avoid playing it too.","September 27, 2014","false","17.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I read many nay-saying reviews about this one but picked it out of the sale with all DLC for under a fiver on a whim. It was well worth it!\n\nGeneral tactical game mechanic is almost exactly the same as Mass Effect 2/3, slightly better actually. 2 team members to order about, picked from a roster of crew that you can customise to suit your play style, the typical classes like engineer, sniper, support etc - its by no means perfect, you can't strip out its console friendly interface roots but its generally okay.\n\nAs with any tactical shooter as soon as your AI team mates think for themselves your like WTF are you doing? and when they are not thinking for themselves your like WTF are you doing? Dammed if they do or don't pretty much all the time, baby sit them, go here-stay there. I didn't have any huge problems with the AI other than them running into enemy fire and randomly jumping out of cover to smash a window or something. Mass Effect 2/3 covery-style system and err... 'powers' like lift, push are almost plagiaristic but acceptible given the way they are presented. Certian commands appear to be missing, such as if you would like a squad member to fall in but leave another one on a position, the command simply doesn't exist. There is no 'hold fire' and there isn't any automatic use of 'powers' option for AI, you have to think for everyone, all the time in battle.\n\nThere is a big problem with the issuing of orders, when in tactical mode you become sort of like a ghost and everything is in bullet time. You are able to issue orders to your squad but in this mode however you are still restrained by walls and barriers. So to place a mine or call a fire mission in to that critical location you have to 'move' there as a human would, like down some stairs and around the wall... you can't just move the cursor there and click go. Its definitely to do with this title being a console port and you can work around it but its very, very annoying.\n\nVoice acting, plot, atmosphere - authentic and brilliant, its XCom but probably not as you know it. You don't really need to be a fan of the series to play this, its a bit off piste - The Xcom theme is there with some alien name drops, tech name drops and a bit of background but its heavily diluted. The plot at the end it gets a bit... erm, out of hand probably the best way to say it - still hugely enjoyable but not quite what I thought.\n\nAs I got it under a fiver in the sale with all DLC I suspect it'll be there again, next time its there I'd get it if you're looking for a pretty decent story to sink into for a bit with a few tactical elements thrown in.\n\n[EDIT] Hanger 6 DLC\nYou get to play DeSilva which is a character in the main story that unfortunately isn't built in enough, but this DLC changes that. Worth it if its 'included' probably adds about 2-2.5 hours if your embracing  all the dialogue and reading all the documents as well as the missions.

The repetive "Pew Pew" gameplay, the upscaling enemies having no skill on the easiest difficulties and picking up a random gun on the field and instantly aquiring the knowledge on how to use said weapon(don't forget shooting down an alien spaceship with your Colt M1911!). Besides that, I really like the concept of the game, just the way they did it.\n\nFirst off, the base, i don't know if it's just me, but i got lost so many times in the base, i would always be at the weapon range when i meant to go to research, the amount of people in the base was not preportionate the size, and the people on duty, just looked like they were "derping around".\n\nWhen i started combat it felt like Cod+Mass effect gameplay, so it was pretty much 3 guys hiding behind a car taking potshots at aliens who were stupid enough to poke their heads around corners.\n\nThe troop system is interesting, with a 3 person sqaud going out leaving the 20 other guys back at base doing nothing because all the other missions are done. The only way you can get everyone to a good enough level is by sending everyone on a side mission.\n\nThe story is filled with "many" oppurtunities to get to know the game, but it's just a bunch of talking and Agent Carter doing weird hand motions while he talks. Also the plot twist about the suitcase makes no sense, and it doesn't give any explanation as to how agent Carter got it. Also how it's only concentrated on the US and we have no clue about the rest of the world(Could make for some great DLC). There's not much about Carter's past except for the random flashbacks that he get's.\n\nThe game is in no way similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown at all with the style of the enemies, and the 1960 US styled. Of course this is on purpose to give a different view, but there needs to be more about how tense the cold war made everyone in the US besides that one cutscene at the military base.\n\nAh the DLC, the first DLC is just a pay-to-win thing where you get a cool gun at the beginning of the the game, the other 2 DLCs add some content which add some more to the story, but it doesn't really resolve the glaring story problems that already exist.\n\nOverall, if u enjoy CoD and was able to like the story, and the Mass Effect Gameplay, then u will have a great time with this game","October 17, 2014","false","14.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

I had such high hopes for this game that I preordered it, picturing tactical combat against all the classic X-Com enemies. Basically, I wanted to be the soldiers I was sending to their doooms in Enemy Unknown. What I got was basically all the most boring parts of Mass Effect's combat system, and a story that couldn't be more forgettable. Combat isn't tactics, it's patience. It is incredibly hard to die, and if you do your completely replaecable squadmates will usually be able to revive you. Enemies take forever to die, most boss fights devolving into you running around looking for ammo as your teammates slowly tick down their gigantic health bars. The ability to customize your companions is very limited, you can only change their guns and add an enhancement item that reduces damage, cooldowns, etc. Oh, and you can change the color of their suits.\nThe story doesn't make you feel any sort of emotion, it's just Mission X and Agent Y, mixed with a 60's thematic and sci-fi cliches. The X-Com headquarters is kind of neat, but once you realize there is nothing to do there it loses some charm. Maybe it gets better in the last third of the game, but I have a hard time believing dessert will be excellent after spooning down so much gruel.\nAs I said, I was very high on this game based on the trailers and the excellence of its strategy counterpart, but there is nothing in the execution of this title that backed up that promise. Of my 6 hours, I don't think I had fun for more than 5-10 minutes, and I don't think I will ever play it again. I bought it at ~50 dollars, and a month later it was on sale for 19.99.   That is not an accident.","October 18, 2014","false","6.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Overall, it's not a bad game, but I felt that I should warn anyone considering picking this game up. Best way I can describe this game is, it's like playing Mass Effect 2 with the first game's horrible horrible AI companion. I've had them randomly get up and run straight at the enemies or get out of cover for no reason. The combat areas are pretty well designed (some pretty big) giving you a chance to flank the enemies however, there seems to be a leash between you and your squad which makes it hard to set up some strategy because they'll randomly get ported to your location and sometime in the middle of the battle out of cover.\n\nTwo things I liked about the combat in this game, and I hope we see it in future games like this, is the ability to tell your squad exactly where to go and the ability to queue up actions. Once you start unlocking more abilities for your squad, the game defnitely gets better. There are some cool interaction between different class' abilities. If you can put up with the horrible AI, you might enjoy the game.\n\n","July 29, 2014","false","23.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I'm typically an FPS/TPS kinda guy. Even ME I didn't play very strategically but just ran around taking cover and blasting (and reviving). I was afraid the action in The Bureau would be off-putting, too "removed" (too tactical) for my tastes. (WHERE'S THE ACTION?)\n\nAnd I must admit during the first encounters,  it seems counterintuitive when, as soon as you enter a battlefield and things heat up, instead of jumping in and lining up shots and chucking grenades at aliens, you actually STOP the action and begin giving orders to your AI companions instead. This sort of play is old news for strategy fans. But since this is (at least in part) a straight-up over-the-shoulder TPS, freezing the action isn't necessarily what you'd be looking for or expecting.\n\nBut giving it time and coming to some modicum of understanding regarding the mechanics of it all, it works quite well. The game is actually surprisingly tense as a tactical affair, but also requires some twitch moves too when it comes to the over-the-shoulder shooting involved. In a manner of speaking, unlike a typical FPS or TPS which requires you only pay attention to yourself and that's it (most of the time), here you have to spread your brain out, allocate it into several different areas--keeping your guys alive, making sure you are using their abilities to maximum effect, constantly readjusting their positions, while also getting well-placed shots in yourself in real-time. In essence you are playing multiple third-person characters all at once. Neat and actually challenging.\n\nOf course, this kind of gameplay lives and dies on how well-behaved your AI companions are--and this facet of the game is a little hit and miss. When the action resumes after you give orders, they don't always go precisely where they are told (I've had guys hop a fence and stand directly in enemy fire instead of hiding behind the fence as I ordered them to), they ignore some orders outright, they charge in of their own accord (in essence mucking up your plans, which is, of course, on purpose--the game's way of just complicating things). But I'd say, 85% of the time, they do pretty well. I've seen worse AI companions...much worse.\n\nIt's worth noting that the game is buggy too--it has crashed on me twice, but luckily not in the middle of anything important. And in another instance, I wandered around an empty battlefield after a fight was over in slow-mo as Carter held the walkie-talkie to his head....and no one was saying anything. After 3 minutes, finally the dialogue started up and the game continued. Uhhhh. Also, there are some sound issues with sound effects disappearing (some of which can be fixed by playing in simple stereo and not in any kind of surround sound). The animations can be a little stiff at times--this is especially evident when characters are talking. Lip movement is definitely challenged here, unfortunately. But you get over it. The characters approach being caricatures for the most part (although some attempt at depth is made)--but the game is using 1950's-60's sci-fi as its source material, so you can't ask for heavy melodrama a la The Last of Us. That said, I DO LIKE the fact that this game is NOT a goofy send-up or parody of the old-school sci-fi trope. No, the game takes itself dead seriously (narratively speaking), which always is a winner in my book. After all, this is potentially the end of the world for God's sake.\n\nOn the up side, the visuals are sharp-as-tacks (I'm playing in 2560x1600 at ultra settings), beautiful use of color, though some of the far-distance backgrounds are poorly painted/pixelated, which wrecks the immersion a little. Seeing massive alien structures plopped down amidst a sea of wheat in rural America in the late 50's, basically tearing a farmer's field in half, is my kinda thing. Seeing the classic small-town corner soda-pop store decimated by alien blasts and black goo and surrounded by bloody teen corpses wearing poodle skirts and argyle sweaters--yeah, it's all there, and very cool.\n\nIf you are an FPS/TPS single-player type of person, and if you started getting a tad bored toward the end of Wolfenstein: The New Order, then give The Bureau a go if you are looking to expand your repertoire--and your gaming brain--a bit.","August 25, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Story seemed to be going okay, as far as I played.\n\nCons: Just about everything else.  Notably the AI is absolutely terrible.   The game is designed around you controlling two partners that are supposed to help you fight.  They don't.   They simply disobey your orders at every conceivable opportunity and are mega-suicidal to boot, often breaking cover to run TOWARD the grenade.    Also notably bad is the UI.  Clearly was intended to be another badly ported game made only for controllers.   The UI to give commands requires you to navigate a checkpoint around obstacles and through mazes for every command, even when its not a line of sight action.    Frustrating is the best word for it when you can't even pause the game entirely to issue the orders.\n\nJust doesn't work.   After watching my 10th squad member in a row, move away from where I told him to set up cover, I finally uninstalled it and dropped it into the trash category.    What exactly is the point of a squad level tactical game, when the AI refuses to do as its told?\n\nIf it hits a steam sale at some point, maybe it might be worth it then, just don't set you expectation beyond "terrible".    A game should be meant to be challenging because of the content, not because the player is fighting with the game mechanics.","January 24, 2014","false","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ostensibly I paid less than a dollar for this game. So it's hard for me to make a judgement call on value with this, since even the worst game that you play for two hours and only cost you 33 cents, well... you've got your money's worth.\n\nLet me continue by saying that this game is a steaming pile of dog ♥♥♥♥. The controls are rubbish, the graphics options are nearly non-existant, constant fps problems, the animations are laughably bad (the lip syncing is actually pretty hilarious, It's like watching a poorly dubbed movie), and to cap it all off... The most egregious problem.... It's boring.\n\nIt had such a promising premise. 1950's alien attack conspiracy government shizzwa, capped with an rpg system over shooter controls. But it's clunky. Everything works but it feels incomplete. Floaty movement, bad AI, shooting that doesn't care where your crosshairs are situated, and the constant stream of dialogue that makes you stop in your tracks while you listen to them talk about stuff that you already know (because you were there when it happened).\n\nI can forgive a game that doesn't have a great story but plays well. I can even love a game with a wonderful story and sub-par gameplay. The fact that this game feels like they weren't even trying?

But the game has a serious flaw in gameplay. No matter what you order your soldiers to do, 4 seconds later they do again what they want. And doing what they want is mostly running directly into the open field and die in enemy fire. Even if they don't do that, you'll be constantly wondering, where your soldiers are, because 1 second after your ordered them somewhere, they run off to some stupid place.\n\nThat reduces all tactical gameplay to absurdity, you'll end up repeatedly playing every level over and over again until you occasionally beat the enemy or until you get tired of giving your soldiers new orders about every second to prevent them running off and dying.\n\nThe statistics reflect the problem, kills by me: 45, kills by my soldiers: 2.\n\nHey developers, did you ever test this game before you released it?

Donald Draper never joined Sterling Cooper to work as an ad man, he remained in the army and rose through the ranks. Eventually recruited by the CIA, he becomes involved with The Bureau, and helps fight off an alien invasion of Earth. Thats this game in a nutshell: Donald Draper shooting aliens.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, at first. The Third person shooter + squad combat is neat on the first mission, when you get agents with all their abilities unlocked. But then it takes that away and you have to -slowly- level them up again. Gameplay is largely the same, fighting the same 2 aliens over and over again, except when they occasionally throw in a muton or sectopod battle. Also, one of the big bosses froze up on me and just sat there as my squad gunned it down. Long set peices showing off the devestated cities lead up to cover based combat sections in a predictable pattern. For some reason, there's more ammo than you can carry in the areas without enemies.\n\nThe characters suffer from a bad case of rubber face, and the shot-reverse-shot dialogue trees become tedious very fast. Which sucks, because apparently a bunch of content is hidden in the speech you go through in the base.\n\nIt's a cool game in premise, but it doesnt quite live up to what it could have been. A few tweaks and a little more though into varying gameplay would have gone very far in making this better. Although it is a totally different game, XCOM Enemy Unknown does a better job at Squad based alien killin fun. I got this in the Humble Bundle, so its okay for the price, but I wouldnt recommend buying this game straight up, unless it's on sale.","July 13, 2014","false","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wasn't terribly interested in buying it based on the poor review scores it received.  I decided to pick it up on a weekend sale based on a friend telling me they enjoyed playing it.  All I can say is that I'm glad I did.  While I understand where a lot of the reviews are coming from, the story at the end goes batshit very quickly, especially with unexpected and uncharacteristic responses from the main character due to what's happening in the story.  Also the mechanic where you get punished more for partial success than for failure in that if an agent dies and you succeed, he stays dead.  But if he dies and you fail, you start up at the last checkpoint.\n\nThat being said, the combat is pretty awesome.  It feels like it's taking a page from Mass Effect 2/3 combat but also combining it with a bunch of X-COM: Enemy Unknown's tactics/aesthetics.  It's a pretty game, although my computer struggled with DX11 a little bit, so I ran standard.\n\nI plan on playing it again on a more difficult setting.  On normal it was an alright challenge.  I managed to finish the game without losing any agents, though there were times that I'd fail encounters outright multiple times before completing them due to managing my team better.\n\nSPOILER(ish)\nThe one thing I did and also very much did not like about the story, all at the same time is that very near the end they give a very good explanation for the 3rd person perspective and the slow down time mechanic of battle tactics.  If you played it, you'll definitely understand what I'm getting at.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to fans of Mass Effect 2/3 combat.  For X-COM purists, I hear it's a tough pill to swallow regarding canon, so take it with a grain of salt perhaps?","February 3, 2014","true","20.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Overall, it feels like a stripped down version of Mass Effect, but the combat stands out above other cover shooters. The game has a lot of flaws, but I encountered no bugs in the core game. The Hangar 6 DLC, however, would freeze briefly every few seconds and rendered the game nearly unplayable.\n\nThe Bureau's combat puts you in control of William Carter, a rather generic protagonist with a gravelly voice. Conversations in the game are carried out with a radial menu lifted directly from Mass Effect. The dialogue isn't terribly interesting, and some of the characters facial animations appeared to not actually be finished. Their mouths move with odd robotic motions, and their eyes look eerily dead. Carter himself, and some of the other core characters have much better, albeit repetitive animations. The story is forgettable overall, but moves the game on well enough. It doesn't come anywhere close to the likes of Mass Effect though, and the fact that the developers chose to base their game design so heavily on Mass Effect is unfortunate given the weak story. Even still, the combat made the experience worthwhile.\n\nCombat in the Bureau is at it's core a cover shooter in the vein of Mass Effect or Gears of War. It also gives you a pair of squadmates and allows you to give direct orders to them. The rookies you start with only have one or two abilities, as well as a command to focus on a specific target, and move to a location. Choosing where to move your squadmates is where the game gets a lot of it's strategic depth. You have to take into account how long they'll be exposed for, how far the nearest ally is if they need a revive, where the enemies are, how much protection the cover offers, and how easily they can use their abilities from their location. Overall it makes for a far more interesting experience than your standard cover shooter. Abilities range from dropping mines, shield domes, artillery strikes, and others.\n\nThe combat isn't perfect though. Your squadmates seem to move into stupid locations occasionally, either exposing themselves to unnecessary fire, going down somewhere difficult to revive them, or both. It's not quite clear why this happens, but it doesn't happen very often at least. The encounters feel somewhat repetitive, but they ramp up in difficulty at a good rate. The weapons are fairly standard for a cover shooter; human and alien variations of the standard rifle, pistol, sniper and so on. Enemies on the other hand provide a bit more variety, healing their allies, granting them shields, spawning new enemies, or even mind controlling your squadmates.\n\nThe graphics generally look good, with a variety of scenes ranging from idyllic small towns to metallic alien structures. Some elements though stand out like a sore thumb. An ugly low res skybox in one of the first scenes of the game is jarringly bad to look at in stark contrast to the cutscene that precedes it. Other elements like a destroyed tank with an ugly texture and a low poly model, or the abyss below an alien tower filled with an ugly brown fog that would have been acceptable years ago, but looks disappointing today. The rest of the game, however, especially the weapon reload animations look and sound good.\n\nThe Bureau's worst offense however, is sure to be a dealbreaker for some fans of the mainstream XCOM games. The only thing The Bureau has in common with XCOM itself is the aliens and the weapon types. Unlocking new weapons is done merely by picking them up off the ground rather than researching them. Dying only puts you back to the latest checkpoint, and while you can lose squadmates permanently if they bleed out in some difficulty settings, I'm fairly sure if you die yourself they'll be back with you at the last checkpoint.\n\nBy removing research, permadeath, and forcing the player down a linear path, I'm sure some players will deem the game unworthy of the XCOM title. While these issues did grate on me at first, it was the combat that kept me playing and enjoying every minute of it. Even though the story is just average, it isn't particularly time consuming like it is in Mass Effect. While I feel the game could have played more to it's strengths, it was still well worth the time and money while on sale. I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this game to fans of Mass Effect, though fans of the classic XCOM games or Enemy Unknown will not enjoy it unless they also enjoy a good cover shooter.","June 28, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It definitely takes the franchise in a different fork (more mission and story driven than strategy) but the strategic aspects aren't completely absent and at later levels if you have the difficulty up you actually need to control your agents and position them if you're going to survive.\n\nThis is coming from someone who played X-COM and Terror From the Deep on the Amiga back in the day and loved the hell out of them, and I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has an LA Noire sense to it, with intrigue and loads of sideplots and stuff you can do if you wander the base and talk to people. I didn't particularly care for any of the X-Coms after Terror From the Deep aside from the X-Com remake, so if you're like me and you like the first two X-Coms and don't necessarily need a heavy squad-management and base builder sim, give it a try.\n\nMy only lament is that any gear you want you must discover in missions, some of them completely optional. There is no 'research' beyond what the storyline demands, so the game loses some of the greatness of being able to research and retrofit the alien tech as you recover corpses and such. While it's something I missed in the game, the fact that once you salvage alien technology in the field X-Com can reproduce it for all of your agents is cool.\n\nI'd like to see a sequel to this game made with some more rpg elements like more skill branching, more skill levels, and research and development. Everything else I found to be quite refreshing, especially the timeline which hearkens back to good old Cold War era paranoia, Area 51 and 'the end of innocence'.\n","August 28, 2013","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Holy ♥♥♥♥ where do I begin, how about gameplay. It plays like a bad, uninspired Mass Effect, the only cool feature being the slow-mo that comes up when you're selecting which skills to use and deciding where to put your AI partners. Theres not much in the way of team management outside of combat. Your AI partners by the way are essentially blank slate goons whose skills and appearance you can customize, and they show up in cutscenes, and thats about it. No dialog aside from stuff they yell in combat. Equipment wise all you got are guns and backpacks, and there are about a thousand god damn backpacks, all with different bonuses, but after you get the straight damage increase or defense increase ones you probably wont bother experimenting, because the bonuses themselves are pretty lack luster. You get most of those backpacks from side missions you send AI dudes to go handle solo so they can get a free level up.\n\nStory wise it's a mess. Without getting into spoilers the gist of it is a "SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE ALIENS" plot like you'd expect, but aside from the angle of the mass cover up, it's pretty forgettable. Speaking of forgettable, I honestly cant recall the name of the protagonist, he's that bland. With a backstory of "SOLDIER/AGENT BADASS" you'd think they'd think of something more interesting that "He's seen some ♥♥♥♥". There are side plots that are straight up dropped, there are moral choices that dont actually matter (aside from one I think, and its not even one at the end) and the general theme of censorship and "NO ONE MUST KNOW" is pretty much not there aside from the occasional dialog snippet from NPCs. You dont burn or hide evidence yourself, its more or less just an alien murder ride from start to finish. The game tries to connect itself with the Enemy Unknown/Within game, I wont go into spoilers but it doesnt do it very well, and there are a lot of "What" moments.\n\nThe setting is Americana/Cold War, and while you can sort of see it in the levels and loving on characters, the actually COLD WAR, even though it would be rightly overshadowed by the wide scale alien invasion, only comes up like twice.\n\nAnd besides all that, heres some nit picking!\nWhy are there audio logs everywhere? EVERYWHERE.\nHow does everyone already know the names to each of the alien enemy types? Theres never any "What do we call it?" moments, its just "MUTON! SECTOPOD!"\nWhy does the artillery skill work indoors?\nWhy does this game try to force itself into the EU/W story when it doesnt want to be consistant?

With comm blackout, information is slow to trickle in, but it appears the nation's military had been crippled, and only XCOM, a command setup to take control in case of full war, is mankind's last hope.\n\nAt its heart Bureau is a tactical shooter where you control two other agents to deploy where you want them as well as deploy their special abilities, such as sniper hit, deploy turret, and so on. As the senior agent, you have abilities too, and you'll get more as time go on.\n\nGraphics are quite good and the desolation in the middle of 1960's America is quite evocative. Agents were wearing suits and appropriate hairstyles, esp. the ladies.\n\nThere is also quite a bit of dialog, with choices you have to make (and they will affect the outcome, at least a little) a bit like Mass Effect series. Talk to other people in the base, for additional clues, expositions, notes, and whatnot that tells you more about the people you meet. Characterization is quite nice.\n\nManaging the agents during a sort of "Matrix-like super-slo-mo" mode known as "Battle Focus" is the key here, where you place the agents at vantage points so they can engage the enemy effectively is key. Flanking is often the best way, as are using the environment such as explosive barrels (yes, that too).  As agents gain "rank" they also gain special abilities they can deploy. The key is to deploy them at the right place at the right time, and that's your job as commander.\n\nThe Aliens are nicely animated and sprints into and out of cover and will attempt to flank if possible. However, they are not very bright can can be outsmarted. Later you'll run into bosses, like Mutons and Sectopods (walkers), though most are just Greys. There are occasional elites and commanders. Commanders are tough as they can give shields to other units, but that just makes them vulnerable to strikes when they do that. Add drones, turrets, and you can be in a tough fight.\n\nThis alternate history is a lot of fun to play in. It is highly recommended if you like the genre.","July 26, 2014","true","35.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The set up is very similar to XCOM tradition, choose a location and attack the enemy.

It's Really Not That Bad, For What It IsGenre: 3rd Person Tactical Shooter\nDeveloped & Published by: 2K Marin and 2K Games\nPlatform support: Windows, PS3 and Xbox 360\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy purchased by myselfRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nPreamble\nThe Bureau has had a troubled history. It spent a long time in development hell, changing studios and the game’s design multiple times. Though its 1960s aesthetic was the only thing that stayed consistent during this process. It was originally titled “XCOM”, a first person shooter with some tactical play. It was originally intended to be the focal point of the series’ reboot. The reboot of a beloved turn-based strategy game with mechanics that had become legendary by this point and time. (Yeah, it doesn’t take a genius to see where 2K might have gone wrong). The response to “XCOM” was severe dislike, leading to the game to be pushed back into the shadows of the public eye. Instead, XCOM: Enemy Unknown was released by a different development team and became really successful. Potentially leading the series to a new and bright future. The FPS “XCOM” wasn’t anywhere to be seen and there was much rejoicing. A year later, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified stepped from the shadows. In all of it’s glorious 1962 aesthetic, 3rd person tactical squad based action. It largely got mixed or negative reception. So, the question becomes: did The Bureau justify that reception? Well, let’s find out.\n\nTurn-Based Tactics Combat System\nThere’s no turn-based strategy here. There is a tactical commander’s view that let’s you order your squadmates where to go, when to use abilities and on which alien/enemy targets. A large chunk of your game time will be spent going from combat spot to combat spot. As a whole, the combat is simply ok and it works. It has its satisfying moments now and again but it’s not the most exciting. Especially if you’ve played games in this genre before. However, one thing that I did like were some of combos you could make with different classes. Though I felt like they barely scratched the surface with class synergy and I’d like to see more useful combos in the future. Oh, I didn’t mention this but there are four classes in the game. Commandos (your bruisers), Engineers (deploy turrets and mines), Recon (Snipers) and Supports (medics). Each class has their own distinctive abilities and weapons. The weapons are reasonably weighty with a good amount of impact and firepower to make them all enjoyable to use. The cover system is a bit sticky and unwieldy at times. Far too often, I’d find myself trapped in a spot with no good way out. Or my agents would often find themselves in similar situations.\n\nStory and Characters\nIf there is one thing I can say about The Bureau, it’s a story of conveniences. Somehow I’m supposed to believe that an alien invasion of this size would be kept secret from the public. The only reason I can buy this is that it’s the 1960s and communication was severely hampered. That somehow, I’m supposed to believe that an alien we captured becomes our ally in a quick heartbeat. Somehow, I’m supposed to believe that we can capture alien weapons and items with the “Venn Brace”. Which I can only assume is a magical tool we carry on our arms. (Where did that Venn Brace come from again?). A lot of this is either swept under the rug or just goes by you so quickly I think they’re hoping you won’t notice because SHINY.\n\nDLC Thoughts\nI didn’t play the DLC and from what I can see, they don’t seem worth paying or plaything them. One is a gun pack, the other two are short uninspiring missions. I can’t help but feel like these were possibly cut from the final product to be sold as DLC. I didn't feel any particular compulsion to pick these up.\n\nPC Settings & Optimization\nThe Bureau has a lot of graphical settings. There’s a reasonable amount of screen resolutions to choose from. Windowed mode, v-sync and film grain that can be turned off and on. It also supports up to 120FPS if you’re wanting that. Field-of-view is supported from 65-100 degrees. Any larger changes have to be made in a .ini file. PhysX is featured in the particles & clothing and can be disabled. You’ve got texture, world, shadow and effect detail sliders as well as anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, decal persistence, ambient occlusion and screen space reflection sliders. For the most part it’s a pretty decently optimized game. Though I did have several areas of combat situations where the framerate dropped pretty hard. A DX11 mode also exists that makes the game look somewhat better. However, it’s an incredibly costly mode for not a lot of gain which I couldn’t get it to run at a stable framerate.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt’s a good thing that 2K didn’t lead their reboot of the XCOM series with The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Not to knock too harshly on the developers, but this would have killed the franchise dead. Now? I actually kinda want a sequel to this. A good sequel that stays with these developers, doesn’t get passed between multiple teams and doesn’t go through development hell. I think they have a good foundation started, but could use some more work to flesh everything out.\n\nAs for XCOM Declassified currently, well, it’s just not that bad. It’s got a pretty good story and a decent enough combat system. It does try to be XCOM though it does lack many of the features of XCOM. There’s no research, no base(s) management, you can only command two other squadmates, it’s got less customization and less of the XCOM experience than it should. But for a 1960s take on the XCOM universe from a different perspective, I still kinda like it. It’s got a story with some pretty unique twists and turns, a pretty diverse cast of characters and seventeen hours of enjoyment.\n\nRead this review and others on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","June 13, 2015","true","17.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With comm blackout, information is slow to trickle in, but it appears the nation's military had been crippled, and only XCOM, a command setup to take control in case of full war, is mankind's last hope.\n\nAt its heart Bureau is a tactical shooter where you control two other agents to deploy where you want them as well as deploy their special abilities, such as sniper hit, deploy turret, and so on. As the senior agent, you have abilities too, and you'll get more as time go on.\n\nGraphics are quite good and the desolation in the middle of 1960's America is quite evocative.

It definitely takes the franchise in a different fork (more mission and story driven than strategy) but the strategic aspects aren't completely absent and at later levels if you have the difficulty up you actually need to control your agents and position them if you're going to survive.\n\nThis is coming from someone who played X-COM and Terror From the Deep on the Amiga back in the day and loved the hell out of them, and I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has an LA Noire sense to it, with intrigue and loads of sideplots and stuff you can do if you wander the base and talk to people. I didn't particularly care for any of the X-Coms after Terror From the Deep aside from the X-Com remake, so if you're like me and you like the first two X-Coms and don't necessarily need a heavy squad-management and base builder sim, give it a try.\n\nMy only lament is that any gear you want you must discover in missions, some of them completely optional. There is no 'research' beyond what the storyline demands, so the game loses some of the greatness of being able to research and retrofit the alien tech as you recover corpses and such. While it's something I missed in the game, the fact that once you salvage alien technology in the field X-Com can reproduce it for all of your agents is cool.\n\nI'd like to see a sequel to this game made with some more rpg elements like more skill branching, more skill levels, and research and development. Everything else I found to be quite refreshing, especially the timeline which hearkens back to good old Cold War era paranoia, Area 51 and 'the end of innocence'.\n","August 28, 2013","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With the exception of the setting and mobs you fight, this game has virtually nothing in common with XCOM.\n\nFirst off there is no research or crafting of any kind.  This was one of the staples of XCOM, that you had to collect alien tech and research it quickly to keep up with the alien escalation.  In this game, the aliens conveniently leave weapons lying around for you to find.  Once found they can be equipped on every squadmate capable of using the specific type of gun.  No manufacturing required either.  Thus, two of the main features of an XCOM game (R&D) are eliminated.\n\nSecond, your squadmates are utterly braindead.  Seriously, they will stand there getting shot it the face while yelling "commander what do I do?"  Often after you tell them to move to full cover, they will inexplicably run out of said cover right into enemy fire.  This requires constant babysitting by you, breaking up the flow of the real time combat.  Their special abilities are somewhat useful, but you'll find that most of the mobs you'll have to kill yourself, as they apparently cannot shoot the side of the proverbial barn.\n\nTalking to people at HQ is someone annoying.  You cannot run inside the base, forcing you to walk to everywhere you want to go.  Frequently you'll have to move from one side of the base to another in order to proceed.  Then when you do get there the animations are a bit "robotic".  The voice acting is fine, but everyone you speak to looks like they just got the body 10 mins ago and are still trying to figure out how to work it.\n\nThe game map allows you to pick missions, but unlike previous XCOM games there is no pressure to pick the most pressing.  Before, you'd only be able to deal with one threat and have to decide which one is more pressing.  In this game, no problem the aliens take their time and you can beat the missions one at a time at your convenience.\n\nFinally, the main protagonist, Carter, is possibly the most unlikeable character in gaming.  He has the stereotyped "angry guy who lost his family but blames himself" backstory.  Yet, he never tries to redeem himself.  Pretty much he starts the game an a-hole and just continues being an a-hole.   At one point, he does something so stupid you want to reach into the game and strangle him.\n\nOverall, this is a half-baked attempt to cash in on the resurgence of XCOM popularity.  Even if you're not a fan of XCOM games, there are far better squad-based shooter games out there.  If you do love XCOM I'd strongly suggest skipping this game.

But I believe it has enough to be liked.\n\nThe first thing that the game has going for it is the noir theme, such an amazing atmosphere, and good voice acting (although the face animations are not up to par with the dialogues). The setting, 1963 IIRC, is spectacularly used to breathe fresh air to the game. There are a lot of little details that really help to build the X-Com world. Also, those are the key elements that save The Bureau from being just a complete rip-off of the first Mass Effect.\n\nThe whole squad tactical FPS combat is not as bad (some combo between abilities are actually really fun and easy to pull off) as long as you don't mind micromanaging (pausing all the time to give instructions to your teammates). Even so, your teammates will do stupid things, like ignore cover orders and never use their abilities. It's not terrible, but it is frustrating. In fact, you can argue that by the end those AI mistakes are the real difficult level, since by the end of the game you become really powerful and destroy your enemies by using just a little bit of tactical awareness.\n\nIn general, the plot is well handled, the atmosphere is amazing and everything else is Mass Effect 1 with some minor changes.

Любите посидеть и поразмышлять о своих действиях, придумать какой нибудь план для победы над врагами ? Если да -  эта игра не для вас. Бюро представляли как тактический экшен, но самой тактики там кот наплакал, да же на самой высшей сложности игра не заставляет тактически думать, всего по одной причине - тут самые идиотские напарники! Им плевать что вы отдаёте им приказы, им нужно лишь несколько вещей - Высовыватся из укрытия, когда по ним стреляет куча врагов; Стоять на одном месте и пялится в прилетевшую гранату; Выбегать на босса с криками "ВАААААГХ" и пасть смертью храбрых за несколько секунд. Если бы игра не позиционировалась как тактический экшен, я бы не так сильно обращал на это внимание. На удивление, враги действительно умно себя ведут, действуют сообща, закидывают гранатами (Ваши напарники даже этого делать не умеют) и обходят с фланга. Геймплейно игра превращается в обычный шутан, аля Gears of War, где всю каманду тащит на себе игрок. На тяжелом уровне сложности, пока не появятся мощные способности - это просто мука. Во всем остальном игра хороша - отличнейшая графика; хороший саундтрек; и отличнейший сюжет и атмосфера. Очень правильно разработчики выбрали время действия игры - редко нам дадут поубивать пришельцев в 60-е года. Что касается сюжета, он никак не удивлял практически до самого конца игры, но то что я увидел под конец, действительно очень и очень сильно порадовало.\nРекомендую всем ознакомиться с игрой, только не ждите тактики от неё и все будет хорошо ;)","September 26, 2013","true","16.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I wasn't expecting a great game, but I hoped the Xcom theme could provide some entertainment. I regret my decision.\n\nThere are some moments when The Bureau feels like it has the potential to be a good game. There are a wide range of classes and abilities to choose for your squad members, which lays the groundwork for deep tactical combat. You have some freedom to choose which order to play side missions. Most of the familiar Xcom aliens appear, and the campaign lasts an impressive 15 hours.\n\nHowever, all this is completely undermined by some of the worst friendly AI I've seen for a long time, which prevents the combat from being enjoyable. In theory, you can slow down combat at any time and give orders to your two squadmates. In practice, they don't care about your orders. They will run away from cover at random times, leaving themselves vulnerable to attack, frequently resulting in them getting incapacitated. The player then has to quickly revive them before they bleed out and die permanently, which of course means you take massive damage trying to save them. The poorly placed checkpoint only save system didn't help my frustration.\n\nEven when they are alive, your squadmates rarely do anything useful. I refer to my screenshot where on one mission I got 95 of 104 kills. Every mission had a similar theme. I only started to feel comfortable when I'd got some squadmates up to level 4 (max level is 5), and gained powerful abilities like the laser turret and the hologram decoy. Plus every level up increases health, so the AI would stay alive a bit longer. But that is a case of too little, too late.\n\nI might recommend a game with poor gameplay if the story was entertaining, but the Bureau fails this too. Its a prequel set in the 1960's, but the continuity doesn't even make sense. During the course of the game you'll gain access to laser and plasma weapons, flying drones and psionic abilities. Meanwhile you'll encounter Sectoids, Mutons, Sectopods and Ethereals. But when the present day Xcom strategy game starts we don't have information about any of those things, and this is never justified.\n\nFurthermore, the dialogue is poor. Sentences feel like disconnected lines, instead of flowing like a natural conversation, more a fault of the script writers than the voice actors. Lip syncing during in-engine cutscenes is awful and distracting.\n\nMy advice would be to skip The Bureau and just replay the other Xcom game(s) again.","January 9, 2014","false","15.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Set in a parallel 1950s america, with many levels seeming to take place in the stereotypical midwest small towns popularised in so many UFO abduction stories, the player takes the role of a Secret Service agent tasked with delivering a mysterious artefact to the head of 'The Bureau', an unknown and oft-ridiculed section of the US government.\n\nAttempting to provide history for the X-COM project as present in the firaxis game, The Bureau toys with themes of sexism in organisations, loyalty, and the importance of self...all with the ham-fisted bashing on a keyboard one would expect of most popular shooters. It takes itself and it's cheesy encironment with far too much seriousness and not enough self-awareness to really make the slightly B-movie plotline work.\n\nI was actually impressed with the announce trailers for the original 'XCOM' first person shooter, and thought that while not an 'X-COM' game, it could have been an entertaining and uniue exploration of clandestine UFO investigation from the point of view of a squaddie or corporal. The numerous rewrites and alterations of the project's lifespan, and the apparent dusting under the rug after the success of Firaxis' 'XCOM; Enemy Unknown' have hurt this title.\n\nIf the pre-order bonuses were still available, I would suggest buying this game only for the X-Com complete pack as a pre-order bonus. Unfortunately, without that particular enticement, I can only suggest to avoid this game unless you feel an unhealthy urge to open plot holes and experience painfully obvious twists in storytelling.","January 23, 2014","false","12.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The environment they create is excellent until the characters speak.  Dialog tends to run on about less than important information.  Base management is virtually non-existant and the gameplay itself in tactical mode is mostly redundant and boring.  This game fails to create strategic value or tactical tension that is the hallmark of the X-Com series.  This is indie developer quality at best and worse, indie games tend to be more fun! Nothing about this game is great other than the environment and I would argue the gameplay actually takes away from that heavily.  The other thing is the game runs heavy on even high end systems for no discernable reason.  It is likely that the time to properly optimize this game was never made.  The best correlation to system demand is X-Rebirth which is simulating an entire universe of things happening per frame.  How The Bureau requires and equal amount of processing power is beyond me.  The AI isn't good at all.  Bypass this title entirely.  Even on sale for 10$ it isn't worth it.  Buy some DLC for XCom: Enemy Unknown or Within and have hours of entertainment.

Noire, Mad Men etc.) but I also found out it wasn't a strategy game like "X-COM: Ememy Unknown"... I was very skeptical at first, however after playing it for a couple of days now, I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed and my earlier skepticism was completely wrong, this truely is a great game!\n\nThe visuals are absolutly marvelous, so much detail put into almost everything, the games style really captures the 60's era beautifully, as well as the sci-fi elements, all executed perfectly, beatiful and surreal at the same time. The sounds were also top notch, from the perfectly tuned soundtrack to the subtle ambiance of computers humming in the background, distant battles and leaky pipes, gun fire and explosions, the pew pew pews of laser cannons and the screams of Grey's being splattered on the battlefield, it all truely sucks you into the gameworld.\n\nThe combat is much better then I expected, a great merger of 3rd person shooting and tactical strategy feel very comfortable, lots of skills/perks and 2 partners to issue orders to at any time, a little bit of management thrown in for good measure and lots and lots of skillful headshots and well placed grenades fill the action quite nicely, I was never bored, the difficulty was just right, unlike "Enemy Within" which could be hellish at times.\n\nLastly is the story, overall it was quite good, had a great start, good pace, very strong arc.... then sadly fizzled at the end, I was a bit confused on the complete 180 the main character pulls in the last 30 minutes of the game, didn't make sense to me, besides that tho, it was quite good, lots of notes, photos, recordings and characters to interact with to enrich the backstory.\n\nIn the end, I had a great time with "The Bureau" not quite sure why all the negativity towards it, I was a little skeptical at first but I'm glad I gave it a chance, one of the better games I've played all year, a great little mix of X-COM meets L.A.

The story finally starts to get a bit interesting, if uninspired, and gameplay actually becomes quite frenetic and challenging. It requires battling through mediocrity to get there, though.","October 28, 2014","false","13.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

It may not feel like an XCOM game but sure as hell had a good time playing this game. A lot of the reviews you read for this game are all mixed, some hate it and some love it. The storyline is very straight foward and a mega plot twist at the end, good gameplay and combat. On my first play through I beat the game on the second hardest diffuculty with out changing it at all, and only had problems beating 2 missions so play the game on a hard diffuculty because its pretty easy. Theres Perm death so if your squad dies then thats the end of them, but I had no problem with Perm death. The gameplay is very fun with variety to kill enemeys and ways to get through squads of enemeys, with 2 different types of wepons, alien wepons and human wepons. (Human wepons have better acuracy and alien wepons have more damange) The game was insanly repeditive but still a great game. Dont buy the DLC for the game cuase there way to over priced except for the hangar DLC.

Even with the mediocre storylines they XCOM games were fun because they had solid gameplay and high replayability. The Bureau doesn't have any of these. It's very linear with little to none RPG elements and side missions. It lacks the feel of "progressing" when you play the story.\n\nGameplay is much simpler than Enemy Unknown--more like a shooter, it has a faster pace but it was dumbed down too much and it struggles between an action game and a strategy game.\nYou can have (only) 2 companions and you can give orders by slowing the game down. Command screen UI is simple and useful enough but it has a few control issues when you play with keyboard/mouse.\nYour squadmates' AI is c**ppy, they just die when you don't give them orders for 10 seconds\n\nPros:\n-60's theme with aliens and conspiracies\n-Nice atmosphere\n-Simple UI and command system\n-Fast gameplay is good if you want a shooter game\n\nCons:\n-Fast gameplay is bad if you want a strategy game, it's oversimplified and dumbed down\n-Upgrades and progressing are weak\n-Story isn't so exciting\n-Teammates usually become bullet magnets and die if you don't command them\n-Devs made the worst lip-sync ever in gaming history\n-It doesn't have the good part in XCOM: Enemy Unknown where you build a good squad and try to protect all of them against powerful alien forces\n-Many audio problems\n-Doesn't have much replayability value\n-Repetitive after some point\n\nI think The Bureau's potenitals were wasted and it became worse and worse in long "development hell" that involved multiple studios. If you didn't play any XCOM games before, you should buy Enemy Unknown, not this. If you're a hardcore XCOM fan, it'll probably be a disappointment for you.  If you're looking for an action-TPS, you can find better games in Steam. Worth a try only if it's on sale.","July 20, 2014","false","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are fantastic but not the framerate, nor is the fluncy of the controls. It plays a lot like Mass Effect 3 but it doesn't have that game's slick controls. The controls also isn't very intuitive, especially regarding grenade throwing and the battle HUD. The AI isn't terribly smart and likes to die a lot due to silly moves, and the gameplay is fairly difficult even in Normal.\n\nHowever, I like the game settings, and being XCOM you're treated with a huge feast of alien graphics. The base is the equivalent of The Citedal on Mass Effect 3, albeit without much interaction with NPCs nor does it have as much events. You can send your squads to seperate missions while you handle the main ones, and it hits me as such a good idea that I wonder why Mass Effect 3 doesn't do this. Then there's the gameplay, which again plays a lot like Mass Effect 3, but one thing that it handles well is cover. In ME3 it can be difficult to know whether you managed to send your squad to cover or just standing before it, but this isn't a poblem here. You can even issue a chain of commands for them to execute sequentially, which is a huge plus.\n\nTry this out before judging it. It is flawed, but still a must have for XCOM fans.","July 15, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AOLetsGo/recommended/65930/","AOLetsGo","AOLetsGo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AOLetsGo/","304 products in account","The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a third-person squad-based tactical/cover shooter recommended for its excellent atmosphere and storytelling - as long as you can look past some really glaring gameplay, technical, and franchise continuity problems. Broadly, this is an XCOM game set in the 1960s, and stripped of all strategy elements in favor of a hero-driven storyline and real-time combat elements. Does it work? Sort of. Is it fun anyway? Yep.\n\nIf you haven't played XCOM before, the basics are pretty simple: Earth faces an invasion by hostile and technologically superior alien forces. An American secret government agency (XCOM, or here, "the Bureau") scrambles to confront the threat. Unlike the XCOM strategy games, here you control a single character - Agent Carter, a prototypical troubled hero, as he leads three-man assault squads on guns-blazing missions through numerous portions of the alien-infested USA and beyond, spending time between each mission trooping around the Bureau's secret underground headquarters uncovering backstory.\n\nAlways remember, this isn't XCOM like you know and probably love. It's not a strategy game. It's a single-player shooter campaign that is almost entirely linear and provides little or no replay value. The campaign is broken down into six major combat missions, each of which takes about an hour to play through. There are also about seven minor combat missions (depending on DLC), which take 20-30 minutes each and pop up at defined points along the way. The remainder of a 15-20 hour playthrough consists of time spent at the Bureau's base between each major mission, during which time you can chat with a few NPCs; manage your roster of agents; and discover ever-changing expository info-drops (recordings and texts). Completing investigations unlocks "dispatch" missions, which are essentially NPC missions  that allow you to level up agents that you don't take with you on Carter's missions. That's it. There is NO STRATEGY ELEMENT: if you want tech research, base building, tight budgeting, and intel ops, play the real XCOM.\n\nThat said, the game does a few things right. First: world-building, both stylistically and through story-telling. As for style, it's the 1960s - the conversative '60s that wish it was still 1945. The stars are the guys that thought the Vietnam War was a really good idea. They are the suits, the G-men, with top-secret files, fedoras, cigarettes and flasks, helicopters and machine guns. They run the country, keep civilians in the dark, cover up their mistakes, torture their prisoners, drop untold billions into weapons R&D, obviously discriminate against women and minorities, and, of course, work to save the world. They'll be darned if they're going to be licked by some bug-eyed aliens. This is fun, the way Mad Men is fun, largely because people used to have some frickin style, despite their many other faults.\n\nBeyond style, there is also a pretty great B-movie sci-fi story underlying everything, if B-movie sci-fi had better special effects. The missions themselves have a lot of memorable story moments - the first major mission in a sleepy college town stands out for me, as does a later mission involving a dam - but the story really develops back at the base. Through talking to other Bureau staff and perusing the numerous photos, short texts, and recordings, you really start to get immersed in the effort to fight the alien threat. Which is great.\n\nThe other thing they did right was the game's combat. It is FUN. I was blasting aliens, and I really, really like blasting aliens. As a third person tactical/cover shooter, its mechanics will be familiar. They are stolen almost entirely - and pretty successfully - from the Mass Effect games. Cover is easy to handle, and the camera is solid. The mission setup is "arena" staging, meaning you run through basically linear levels, going through empty parts that build atmosphere, and arriving at areas that are set up for game combat, with lots of ammo lying around, cover to hide behind, and enemies waiting to get blasted. I played with a gamepad, DX11 with Vsync enabled. The controls felt a little soft at first but I eventually got used to them. The graphics are very nice and my machine stuttered a little bit when things got really hectic, but this did not detract from gameplay. The fights felt really kinetic and hectic but not out of control, with solid enemy AI at the higher difficulties, fast pace, and a sense of danger. Good stuff.\n\nBut all was not perfect. The squad combat, sadly, kind of sucks. Backing up a moment, you take two teammates with you on each mission. There are four types of soldier to choose from, with each class having a few unique abilities to unlock. There is minimal customization: you can decide which weapon to give them (which isn't very helpful, because each class can only use a few of the available weapons, and you always just want to give them the best one you've unlocked), and choose them a bonus buff (a bizarre "backpack" mechanic). Not great, but fine for what it is. In the field, you have control over where your mates set up, and where and when they will unleash their special abilities. You control them via a popup rotary menu that slows time - all very Mass Effect - and it is SO CLOSE to not sucking. The problem is your squaddies are suicidal idiots. They don't stay where you put them, so flanking is practically impossible. They get killed constantly unless you keep them behind you. AND they don't do much damage. So you basically babysit. The game would have been better without them, frankly. Nonetheless, once you figure out how to manage them combat goes back to being fun - just a little more broken than it should be.\n\nThe problems really start up once you get back from missions and have to wander around the base, which is about a third of the game. Notwithstanding the story elements and a couple of nicely atmospheric rooms, the base really feels sterile. I think this is because they felt compelled to render it in 3D and it suffers from the same problem a lot of 3D environments have - it's really hard to make them feel alive. Most of your time there is spent walking (annoyingly, sprinting is disable in-base) from place to place. This is BORING. Then, when you find somebody to talk to, you are forced into a dialogue prompt setup that again is stolen from Mass Effect, but this time badly. There are dialogue options, kind of, but it is totally pointless because it has no larger impact on the story, and there is really just one conversation that the developers want you to hear. The "investigations" that characters give you consequently end up feeling like pointless make-work, rather than fun story elements. Also, the lip-synching is comically bad, which is a shame because the voice acting is actually pretty good. Perhaps showing my age, I found myself wishing for the TCS Tiger's Claw from the first Wing Commander game. Just put the people I need to talk to in front of me and let me click on them! Something more streamlined and not 3D would have been a daring move and probably would have saved the otherwise poor base situation. Oh well.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the continuity thing. The idea is that this is an XCOM origin story. So there is a massive alien invasion, with basically the same tech, and mass deaths worldwide, and the government makes huge strides toward understanding it all, and (sarcastic spoiler alert here), wins (duh), and then in the "future" XCOM games nobody has heard of any of this. There is some hand-waving about blacking out the files and misdirecting the public, but... really? It's unfortunate that they had to shoehorn the XCOM stuff into what would have been a perfectly fun game (probably more fun) without it.\n\nAnd that's it. Verdict: a memorable and entertaining once-through adventure with some flaws that probably get more attention than they deserve. I largely enjoyed the game, despite its flaws.","July 24, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

THIS. IS. NOT. XCOM.  It has the name and some of the elements but ultimately it's a huge disservice. This is the game that when it was announced and it's game elements revealed, the fans of the franchise threw up in their mouth a little bit and promptly told 2K the exact texture and flavor of it. They still proceeded to pour this puke flavored goop into a sack with the X-Com logo roughly hand drawn in fecal matter.\n\nTL;DR Version:\nAll fan-rage aside, this is a small squad, real-time, cover based, third/first person shooter game with a super slow-mo system for giving commands and using abilities. One of those horrid fusions between fast paced action and strategy that always feels forced and awkward made worse by terrible controls. It has a linear and gag-inducing story with some side missions for plot add-ons with unlikeable, unengaging characters.\n\nThe mechanics:\nThe controls are clunky and difficult to be precise with since this is a badly done console port, but even if I had a controller for my PC they would still be obnoxious. The movement and area targeting cursor is more like an entity in that you have to 'jump' the off map elements or steer it around objects like a drunken water buffalo to get it where you want it to go. Individual unit targeting is done with a visually jarring 'thermal view' from your character's point of view that is annoying to use and confusing when enemies overlap from your forced perspective. They clearly favored style choices over a useable interface.\n\nYour NPC team mates are rather suicidal and often entirely unhelpful.  They never stay in place when sniping or providing suppressing fire and you have to constantly re-issue move commands. I found myself shouting "NO YOU NINNY, GO BACK WHERE YOU WERE!" at the screen in frustration several times as I try to flank the enemy like they teach you to do in the tutorial phase. They are also distance-leashed to your main character so if you get too far away from them they break cover and frequently get splattered by a turret or hoard of enemies coating their position in plasma fire.  Alternately when you want them to move, they're slow to comply and take the worst possible path unless you stage their movements out step by step and even then, (!!!) they often still shove their stupid faces into the barrels of enemy weapons.\nThey have this LOVELY habit of bum-rushing giant aliens that promptly curb stomp their squishy heads into red paste rather than using the sniper or assault rifle they're equipped with from range, no matter their behavior settings.\nThey also love to dive on to grenades as if they were at a belly flop competition event, which if it saved you or your other NPC, might make sense, but usually just makes you spam the revive command at the other one if they didn't get taken out as well. Their combat abilities are laughable unless they are targeting something weak or using their special skills. You spend half the game at least either reviving them or being revived yourself, so it made sense that that mechanic was as terrible as possible.\nYou're limited to 2 of these chuckleheads on a mission, thus forcing you to choose which skill set you want with you, often depriving yourself of tactical choices more appropriate for the battlefield. Meanwhile, the rest either are dispatched on non-playable missions to gather resources, NPC's, or unlock new weapons just so they appear to be useful instead of waiting for one of your more frequently used characters to die.\n\nOn the subject of weapons, your squad mates are limited to a single weapon type that 'fits' their 'class', just so they can shoe horn weapon skills in rather than allow you more customization of your squad to your tastes.  You are constantly out of ammo and you're locked from going back to pick up any you skipped before the next fight.  Despite combat being the main focus of the game, you refuse to carry more than 3 clips of ammo and enemies frequently take at least one full clip to kill, even with the sniper rifle, as you have to break their shields, take down their armor and THEN you can shoot them in the head.  Your NPC's bring unlimited ammo but refuse to share with you of course.  You're forced to comb the battlefield to pick up more from downed enemies, but often you end up swapping to a less desireable gun just so you can kill something. The random ammo boxes sprinkled around are usually in inconvenient locations, forcing you to dive out into the kill zone to retrieve. The combat is reduced to 'attack the weak spot for massive damage' in most cases, especially boss fights with a tedious cycle of hiding in cover between volleys of spam fire and waiting for it to power up and expose it's tender bits.\n\nStory:\nThe main plot is just bad. There's a 'zombie' element that is slightly creepy, but ultimately bland, unsatisfying and inconsistent. The use of the 50's time period was made worthless by using modern day slang in the dialogue. While every character is voiced, the conversation trees are irritating to navigate, often making you listen to the main character say the same thing several times just to hear all of the choices, fortunately you can skip it, but if you're not careful you'll have to repeat the conversation AGAIN if you accidentally skip one you wanted to hear. There was an annoying blend of too much exposition and not enough.  Things you wanted to know more about were left vague or skimmed over while trivial elements were expounded on at exhaustive length.\nThe aliens were bad mockeries of the original concepts in some cases with a few new additions.  Sillicoids went from being tough, rocky tank-class monsters to fart-joke comic relief dispatched with a single punch and generally just used as an annoyance or a 'Boo' scare during cut scenes. Mutons went from being numerous foot soldiers to single huge, plodding, damage-soaking monsters that walk at you in a straight line and again eat up all your ammo trying to kill. In the place of Muton foot-soldiers you now have a new race of aliens that are the majority of your opponents and come in many different flavors of annoying; Cloaked, minion-summoning, shield buffers, and snipers as well as just grunts with guns.  Sectoids went from intelligent, psychic, physically weak 'greys' to more comic relief, even to the point of having them thrown out as target practice at the shooting range. The worst was still the Etherials. Used as a plot device somewhere between "Gaia" type entities and possession-demons rather than their former glory as the very powerful psychic combatants.\n\nI got this game for free and generally treated it as a satire on the X-Com franchise. I have no interest in replaying it again, unlike the original and the newer remake, the story and mission choices are limited and uninteresting and have little relevance or impact on the plot. If you want a good game, buy the remake or get the original. I never want to see a sequel or DLC for this game. I advise against paying for this X-Com decorated vomit-bag.","September 4, 2014","false","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I actually enjoyed it a hell of a lot.\n\nMy first experience with the XCOM franchise was the 2012 game, which I also enjoyed a whole lot. I would say that The Bureau is a fairly accurate translation of XCOM into a 3rd person shooter. You can give commands on the field, cover is very much essential as is position on the battle field. Even the way missions are seperated into side missions and main story missions, giving the game a similar pace to XCOM (shorter missions taking anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, and the longer ones up to over an hour). Of course in depth this game differs from XCOM in that you will not be maintaining the base yourself, doing research, your boss does that. You simply go out and shoot dudes and command the field and ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe games weaknesses mostly revolve around the plot in my opinion. It's suprisingly good in parts, but does get ridiculous at times. It crosses the suspension of disbelief line a few to manty times.\n\nBut the game has a lot of strengths that I don't think it was given enough credit for. The shooting feels great, the weapons are really cool, and the field commands just make you feel powerful and responsible for your squad. The setting is also fantastic, a really slick "Mad Men" vibe.\n\nSo give this game a chance. It is the XCOM experience for people who might not be into hardcore strategy games, and that's ok. Get it on sale!\n\nAlso: It works on Nvidia Shield","January 2, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Characters seem too chopy at some points, and too stiff at others. Aside from this if animations don't really bug you too much the dialog and V.O.s were done rather nicely and do set some justice to in game cinimatics.\n\nGameplay is rather tricky to get the hang of if you aren't into Tactical TPS games. you controll your two NPCs as well as yourself and must utilize all the teams abilities and each classes strengths and weaknesses to guide them to victory. that being said by themselfs the NPC's are rather useless as stated earlier. but given you can practically controll their every move it makes for interesting game. Another mechanic that's rather interesting is agents, you must keep a "roster" stocked of agents all starting at level 1 and choose weather to rotate them, send some on npc only missions, or pick favorites and take only them at all times, as a tactics based game though you are also given multiple classes to used based on the missions and can even swap them out mid mission as needed. adding to the system is deaths, a consiquence to not coordinating your agents and keeping them alive is once an agent is down, he is gone. reguardless of level and abilities thus leaving you only to choose another agent to take his place.\n\nStoryline to this game is rather immersive. you can find info on NPC's and current situations laying around, and get side missions. The main missions all of course tie in as any storyline based game should. but getting into it is rather touch and go. they start by throwing you right into the start of the invasion and piece the events before it as you go along. but after getting past the beginning it smoothens out as you play through the rest.\n\nOverall though I belive this installment to the XCOM series was done rather nicely. given the time they had i belive it could have been slightly better but as it stands is a pretty strong release and in personal opinion a great game to play. I would deffinately recommend giving this game a shot if you're into Tactical TPS'.","January 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are fantastic but not the framerate, nor is the fluncy of the controls. It plays a lot like Mass Effect 3 but it doesn't have that game's slick controls. The controls also isn't very intuitive, especially regarding grenade throwing and the battle HUD. The AI isn't terribly smart and likes to die a lot due to silly moves, and the gameplay is fairly difficult even in Normal.\n\nHowever, I like the game settings, and being XCOM you're treated with a huge feast of alien graphics. The base is the equivalent of The Citedal on Mass Effect 3, albeit without much interaction with NPCs nor does it have as much events. You can send your squads to seperate missions while you handle the main ones, and it hits me as such a good idea that I wonder why Mass Effect 3 doesn't do this. Then there's the gameplay, which again plays a lot like Mass Effect 3, but one thing that it handles well is cover. In ME3 it can be difficult to know whether you managed to send your squad to cover or just standing before it, but this isn't a poblem here. You can even issue a chain of commands for them to execute sequentially, which is a huge plus.\n\nTry this out before judging it. It is flawed, but still a must have for XCOM fans.","July 15, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AOLetsGo/recommended/65930/","AOLetsGo","AOLetsGo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AOLetsGo/","304 products in account","The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a third-person squad-based tactical/cover shooter recommended for its excellent atmosphere and storytelling - as long as you can look past some really glaring gameplay, technical, and franchise continuity problems. Broadly, this is an XCOM game set in the 1960s, and stripped of all strategy elements in favor of a hero-driven storyline and real-time combat elements. Does it work? Sort of. Is it fun anyway? Yep.\n\nIf you haven't played XCOM before, the basics are pretty simple: Earth faces an invasion by hostile and technologically superior alien forces. An American secret government agency (XCOM, or here, "the Bureau") scrambles to confront the threat. Unlike the XCOM strategy games, here you control a single character - Agent Carter, a prototypical troubled hero, as he leads three-man assault squads on guns-blazing missions through numerous portions of the alien-infested USA and beyond, spending time between each mission trooping around the Bureau's secret underground headquarters uncovering backstory.\n\nAlways remember, this isn't XCOM like you know and probably love. It's not a strategy game. It's a single-player shooter campaign that is almost entirely linear and provides little or no replay value. The campaign is broken down into six major combat missions, each of which takes about an hour to play through. There are also about seven minor combat missions (depending on DLC), which take 20-30 minutes each and pop up at defined points along the way. The remainder of a 15-20 hour playthrough consists of time spent at the Bureau's base between each major mission, during which time you can chat with a few NPCs; manage your roster of agents; and discover ever-changing expository info-drops (recordings and texts). Completing investigations unlocks "dispatch" missions, which are essentially NPC missions  that allow you to level up agents that you don't take with you on Carter's missions. That's it. There is NO STRATEGY ELEMENT: if you want tech research, base building, tight budgeting, and intel ops, play the real XCOM.\n\nThat said, the game does a few things right. First: world-building, both stylistically and through story-telling. As for style, it's the 1960s - the conversative '60s that wish it was still 1945. The stars are the guys that thought the Vietnam War was a really good idea. They are the suits, the G-men, with top-secret files, fedoras, cigarettes and flasks, helicopters and machine guns. They run the country, keep civilians in the dark, cover up their mistakes, torture their prisoners, drop untold billions into weapons R&D, obviously discriminate against women and minorities, and, of course, work to save the world. They'll be darned if they're going to be licked by some bug-eyed aliens. This is fun, the way Mad Men is fun, largely because people used to have some frickin style, despite their many other faults.\n\nBeyond style, there is also a pretty great B-movie sci-fi story underlying everything, if B-movie sci-fi had better special effects. The missions themselves have a lot of memorable story moments - the first major mission in a sleepy college town stands out for me, as does a later mission involving a dam - but the story really develops back at the base. Through talking to other Bureau staff and perusing the numerous photos, short texts, and recordings, you really start to get immersed in the effort to fight the alien threat. Which is great.\n\nThe other thing they did right was the game's combat. It is FUN. I was blasting aliens, and I really, really like blasting aliens. As a third person tactical/cover shooter, its mechanics will be familiar. They are stolen almost entirely - and pretty successfully - from the Mass Effect games. Cover is easy to handle, and the camera is solid. The mission setup is "arena" staging, meaning you run through basically linear levels, going through empty parts that build atmosphere, and arriving at areas that are set up for game combat, with lots of ammo lying around, cover to hide behind, and enemies waiting to get blasted. I played with a gamepad, DX11 with Vsync enabled. The controls felt a little soft at first but I eventually got used to them. The graphics are very nice and my machine stuttered a little bit when things got really hectic, but this did not detract from gameplay. The fights felt really kinetic and hectic but not out of control, with solid enemy AI at the higher difficulties, fast pace, and a sense of danger. Good stuff.\n\nBut all was not perfect. The squad combat, sadly, kind of sucks. Backing up a moment, you take two teammates with you on each mission. There are four types of soldier to choose from, with each class having a few unique abilities to unlock. There is minimal customization: you can decide which weapon to give them (which isn't very helpful, because each class can only use a few of the available weapons, and you always just want to give them the best one you've unlocked), and choose them a bonus buff (a bizarre "backpack" mechanic). Not great, but fine for what it is. In the field, you have control over where your mates set up, and where and when they will unleash their special abilities. You control them via a popup rotary menu that slows time - all very Mass Effect - and it is SO CLOSE to not sucking. The problem is your squaddies are suicidal idiots. They don't stay where you put them, so flanking is practically impossible. They get killed constantly unless you keep them behind you. AND they don't do much damage. So you basically babysit. The game would have been better without them, frankly. Nonetheless, once you figure out how to manage them combat goes back to being fun - just a little more broken than it should be.\n\nThe problems really start up once you get back from missions and have to wander around the base, which is about a third of the game. Notwithstanding the story elements and a couple of nicely atmospheric rooms, the base really feels sterile. I think this is because they felt compelled to render it in 3D and it suffers from the same problem a lot of 3D environments have - it's really hard to make them feel alive. Most of your time there is spent walking (annoyingly, sprinting is disable in-base) from place to place. This is BORING. Then, when you find somebody to talk to, you are forced into a dialogue prompt setup that again is stolen from Mass Effect, but this time badly. There are dialogue options, kind of, but it is totally pointless because it has no larger impact on the story, and there is really just one conversation that the developers want you to hear. The "investigations" that characters give you consequently end up feeling like pointless make-work, rather than fun story elements. Also, the lip-synching is comically bad, which is a shame because the voice acting is actually pretty good. Perhaps showing my age, I found myself wishing for the TCS Tiger's Claw from the first Wing Commander game. Just put the people I need to talk to in front of me and let me click on them! Something more streamlined and not 3D would have been a daring move and probably would have saved the otherwise poor base situation. Oh well.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the continuity thing. The idea is that this is an XCOM origin story. So there is a massive alien invasion, with basically the same tech, and mass deaths worldwide, and the government makes huge strides toward understanding it all, and (sarcastic spoiler alert here), wins (duh), and then in the "future" XCOM games nobody has heard of any of this. There is some hand-waving about blacking out the files and misdirecting the public, but... really? It's unfortunate that they had to shoehorn the XCOM stuff into what would have been a perfectly fun game (probably more fun) without it.\n\nAnd that's it. Verdict: a memorable and entertaining once-through adventure with some flaws that probably get more attention than they deserve. I largely enjoyed the game, despite its flaws.","July 24, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Teammate AI is a mess with them choosing to take cover in front of enemies or keep running around doing nothing unless you decide to issue commands for them every single second, thankfully this gets slightly better once they level up and can take more damage, and once you level up a few times in which the game becomes a total cakewalk. Other than that the combat is alright and can even become ~~intense~~ sometimes in harder difficulties.\nThe storyline is a mess; outside the twist near the end it's very disjointed with the game assuming you know things you haven't been told yet (your character acts as if he knows these things too) and some characters vanishing two levels from the end of the game and never being mentioned again.\nLike I mentioned before the entire game plays and feels like Mass Effect but set in the 60s (there's even a base you can walk around in and talk to people after missions). I liked the art style a lot and it kept me playing until the end, but the game itself is kind of a mess due to it being stuck in development hell for 5+ years. Even so it's not Aliens Colonial Marines/Duke Forever horrible garbage, just average. If you think the setting looks interesting and want a slightly strategical third person shooter (think Brother in Arms and Mass Effect as previously mentioned) buy it when it's on sale for u$20 and you'll have fun. Hopefully it'll get a sequel in the future that fixes the issues it has (but it bombed so it won't).","October 15, 2013","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every now and then, the game threatens to pique your curiousity with its story, but that generally gets dropped quite quickly, lost among the extremely padded gameplay.\n\nThere's only really three positive things I think I can say about the game. The first, not many of the OBLIGATORY OBLIGATORY OBLIGATORY action sequences that we've all played in a dozen different games, and really the worst are wave-survival segments and boss segments. The game, aside from the boring third-person shooting and waist-high wall clinging, generally does its own thing. Additionally, at first, the game seems to have drawn a lot of inspiration from Cold War thriller novels and films, and create an identity for it. The third is that the game seems to tie into XCOM: Enemy Unknown much more than it needed to, although much of this is shallow. Unfortunately, the game uses neither of these positives very much, and contributes very little to the experience.\n\nI must mention the major bugs and technical problems I also experienced. Sometimes, when you go through doorways, the floor hasn't spawned yet, and you fall under the map. Yes, THE FLOOR DOESN'T SPAWN, and it happened during every mission I played after the first one, and quite frequently at the base. Similarly, issues like doors not opening when they're scripted to (because heaven forbid they trust the player to open a door), or entire combat sequences being skipped over because the enemies don't even spawn. The game is fortunate to have a good checkpoint system, because you're going to be doing it often for how often these bugs occur. As for other technical issues, the game runs really quite poorly, embarrassingly so, with the framerate often tanking to below 10 FPS, whereas my system can run games that are significantly better looking without experiencing the same issues. Audio cuts out occassionally, especially during cutscenes. Many of the key commands have inconsistent responsiveness.\n\nJust don't even bother playing this game. Its not even a game that is spectacularly bad that you can get entertainment from it that way. Its just a woefully boring, padded slog of mediocre third-person shooting that every now and then a more interesting game comes to the surface for about a minute and then disappears for another hour. The only reason anybody remembers that the game exists is because "XCOM" was attached to the title. This is 12 GB of memory that can be put to better use elsewhere.","July 2, 2014","false","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I honestly can't believe people pay 50 or 60$ for titles like this. And this game is yet another example of why buying a new game is a bad idea these days. They are usually disappointing at best and garbage at worst. Then <6 months later they'll be -50% off anyway. This one has been out no more than 1 year and it's 1$ on a Humble Bundle right now, which is exactly how I got my copy. I'll admit that I didn't even want this, I wanted Darkness 2, but I thought I'd give this a fair shot since the developers downright handed me this game. So I started playing it. At first I thought this game was merely mediocre, but after playing it for a good hour and a half, I realized in just how many ways this game isn't something I should have ever bothered with. I should have just given the key away to some stupid kid on the forum that'll desperately play anything he can get his hands on. This is a game people will no doubt fight over like starving hungry bums on Steamgifts now while the rest of us sip our tea and play better games.(Or my case, waste time reviewing it)\n\nBut I was actually surprised about a few things with this title. Shockingly enough, the camera for third person is actually in the middle of the screen. Despite getting almost everything else wrong(including right stick invert turned off by default), they got this correct. So why can't everyone else? You can actually use cover and see around it very well, because the damn camera is where it's supposed to be. Also I was shocked to actually see partners THAT CAN DIE. Ya. Wow. And they do damage to enemies. Why is that other games can't do these very simple things? All of these are things I complain about in other reviews. I also liked the fact that you wear a fedora hat in the game. It takes place during the 60s, when people actually wore suits and decent hats. Since I'm the only Human on Earth that wears one of these in this age of silly baseball caps, I find it amusing to see these kinds of things. I love historic eras, it's as close as you'll ever get to time traveling. Now if only I could get myself a nice round car...\n\nBut that's where the list of things the game had going for it ends. There's plenty of glitches or bugs to find. Animation is weak, characters are stiff, voice acting doesn't do the game any favors(Carter sounds like Batman for some reason), and I can't say the story is anything special. Environments are acceptable, but that's it, nothing special, especially when they are extremely linear. You only ever have 1 tight path to take through a level, with every other route clearly blocked, which I always find boring. They then glow things like doors, as if you could ever get lost in a game where there is only ONE possible path forward. I feel like a rat being herded through a table maze that only has one path to the end.\n\nThe main reason to do this(linear game) is to make the game very immersive or have a lot of scripted events... but the game doesn't have much of either. Not much happens other than you running into another pack of aliens. Speaking of lack of immersion, there isn't much to be had when characters are expendable card board cut outs that will regularly die and be replaced. Rather than focus on a cast of selectable crew that could have had unique personalities, dialogue, or stories... they opted for the route of having every squad member being nearly identical except in class and gun. So the immersion of being with a squad just isn't there. You can actually edit their name and face too, which buries immersion as much as possible, I'd say. So they aren't people, they're just units. It would have made a lot more sense to have real crew, rather than units, with them unable to permanently die as to prevent you from running out. Or maybe they get injured if they die in a mission then you have to wait for them to heal? Enemy Unknown has the same problem with units and counterproductive excessive customization, but that's an RTS, where you play an imaginary commander from overhead, not an actual character in the game. I found it more acceptable in that game to be able to make your dream team. But this is not the same kind of game, and you can only run with 2 partners, so I question why they copy what was already a detriment to a previous game into their newer one where it makes even less sense.\n\nWhat really kills this game though is the partner system. In my mere 1 1/2 hours of gametime, I've seen them do some of the most stupid things I could imagine. They dive into enemy formations for no apparent reason(then die), refuse to use any special abilities without being directly told(uh, why?), and most notebly, stand around being shot rather than adapt or move. They are VERY stupid, not acting at all like the trained or experienced soldiers they are supposed to be. They tend to deliberately die in the worst possible areas, as if to make you fail because trying to revive them there is suicide.\n\nHaving good partner A.I. for a squad combat system really could have sold this game... but it's not here, so the exact opposite is what we got. Aliens have the same problems, but they are expendable units of limited intellect not even their owners care about, not people with intellect, like your partners. In other words, for enemy monsters, zerglings, robots, or whatever, dummy A.I. doesn't really matter. They're expendable, they come off an assembly line with numbers, no one cares if they die or not. They win purely by outnumbering you, and their owners will simply keep sending more until you lose. But with actual Human soldiers, you expect some kind of brain cells or independant thought, which you don't get with the partners you are burdened with in this game. They expect to just go willy nilly like a complet tart in battle, to hell with the consequences, then when they die, it's your problem. They are nothing but a frustrating chore to have, almost making you wish you could just Bioshock 2 this game as a Big Daddy and run it solo. I still stand by the fact that partners SHOULD be able to die, but don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean they can then get by with garbage A.I. - Partners in Gears of War from 2006 were better than this. Just thought I'd mention that, 2013 game.\n\nI do not recommend this game. If you really want it, go get it for 1$ off the Humble Bundle or some other really cheap sale. This really is a lazy sloppy title no one cared about, abysmal, basically shovelwared onto the market. Enemy Unknown is at 20$ tier on Humble Bundle, while this NEWER game is at the 1$ tier, not even a year after its release. What does that tell you? I don't personally know how well this game released, but seeing it now, I assume it got panned pretty hard and is now in a lot of trash cans. It is now going to mine as I am uninstalling after posting this review. I seriously doubt I will touch this again anytime soon.","July 21, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Audio cuts out occassionally, especially during cutscenes. Many of the key commands have inconsistent responsiveness.\n\nJust don't even bother playing this game. Its not even a game that is spectacularly bad that you can get entertainment from it that way. Its just a woefully boring, padded slog of mediocre third-person shooting that every now and then a more interesting game comes to the surface for about a minute and then disappears for another hour. The only reason anybody remembers that the game exists is because "XCOM" was attached to the title. This is 12 GB of memory that can be put to better use elsewhere.","July 2, 2014","false","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a old school X-Com fan since childhood it's nice to play a more cinimatic and story driven version of the series. Sure it got a lot of slack for being "First Person" when it was first announced, what it molded into is more like Mass Effect... not nearly as big of a epic sci-fi story, but the gameplay isn't all too far off.\n\nThere were moments where a cinimatic would play and I would think to myself, my goodness this would make a great movie.\n\nI'm playing it on the lowest graphical settings (my computer can't handle the newer parts I have sitting around), and it looks great. I can't wait until I can play it with my 5830, ramp those graphics up some and lose the visual tearing I get.\n\nSo far I really enjoy it, was well worth the price it was on sale last week. If it goes up on sale again soon, or you have the money and are a fan of the series like myself. I highly suggest this title.","December 19, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THIS. IS. NOT. XCOM.  It has the name and some of the elements but ultimately it's a huge disservice. This is the game that when it was announced and it's game elements revealed, the fans of the franchise threw up in their mouth a little bit and promptly told 2K the exact texture and flavor of it. They still proceeded to pour this puke flavored goop into a sack with the X-Com logo roughly hand drawn in fecal matter.\n\nTL;DR Version:\nAll fan-rage aside, this is a small squad, real-time, cover based, third/first person shooter game with a super slow-mo system for giving commands and using abilities. One of those horrid fusions between fast paced action and strategy that always feels forced and awkward made worse by terrible controls. It has a linear and gag-inducing story with some side missions for plot add-ons with unlikeable, unengaging characters.\n\nThe mechanics:\nThe controls are clunky and difficult to be precise with since this is a badly done console port, but even if I had a controller for my PC they would still be obnoxious. The movement and area targeting cursor is more like an entity in that you have to 'jump' the off map elements or steer it around objects like a drunken water buffalo to get it where you want it to go. Individual unit targeting is done with a visually jarring 'thermal view' from your character's point of view that is annoying to use and confusing when enemies overlap from your forced perspective. They clearly favored style choices over a useable interface.\n\nYour NPC team mates are rather suicidal and often entirely unhelpful.  They never stay in place when sniping or providing suppressing fire and you have to constantly re-issue move commands. I found myself shouting "NO YOU NINNY, GO BACK WHERE YOU WERE!" at the screen in frustration several times as I try to flank the enemy like they teach you to do in the tutorial phase. They are also distance-leashed to your main character so if you get too far away from them they break cover and frequently get splattered by a turret or hoard of enemies coating their position in plasma fire.  Alternately when you want them to move, they're slow to comply and take the worst possible path unless you stage their movements out step by step and even then, (!!!) they often still shove their stupid faces into the barrels of enemy weapons.\nThey have this LOVELY habit of bum-rushing giant aliens that promptly curb stomp their squishy heads into red paste rather than using the sniper or assault rifle they're equipped with from range, no matter their behavior settings.\nThey also love to dive on to grenades as if they were at a belly flop competition event, which if it saved you or your other NPC, might make sense, but usually just makes you spam the revive command at the other one if they didn't get taken out as well. Their combat abilities are laughable unless they are targeting something weak or using their special skills. You spend half the game at least either reviving them or being revived yourself, so it made sense that that mechanic was as terrible as possible.\nYou're limited to 2 of these chuckleheads on a mission, thus forcing you to choose which skill set you want with you, often depriving yourself of tactical choices more appropriate for the battlefield. Meanwhile, the rest either are dispatched on non-playable missions to gather resources, NPC's, or unlock new weapons just so they appear to be useful instead of waiting for one of your more frequently used characters to die.\n\nOn the subject of weapons, your squad mates are limited to a single weapon type that 'fits' their 'class', just so they can shoe horn weapon skills in rather than allow you more customization of your squad to your tastes.  You are constantly out of ammo and you're locked from going back to pick up any you skipped before the next fight.  Despite combat being the main focus of the game, you refuse to carry more than 3 clips of ammo and enemies frequently take at least one full clip to kill, even with the sniper rifle, as you have to break their shields, take down their armor and THEN you can shoot them in the head.  Your NPC's bring unlimited ammo but refuse to share with you of course.  You're forced to comb the battlefield to pick up more from downed enemies, but often you end up swapping to a less desireable gun just so you can kill something. The random ammo boxes sprinkled around are usually in inconvenient locations, forcing you to dive out into the kill zone to retrieve. The combat is reduced to 'attack the weak spot for massive damage' in most cases, especially boss fights with a tedious cycle of hiding in cover between volleys of spam fire and waiting for it to power up and expose it's tender bits.\n\nStory:\nThe main plot is just bad. There's a 'zombie' element that is slightly creepy, but ultimately bland, unsatisfying and inconsistent. The use of the 50's time period was made worthless by using modern day slang in the dialogue. While every character is voiced, the conversation trees are irritating to navigate, often making you listen to the main character say the same thing several times just to hear all of the choices, fortunately you can skip it, but if you're not careful you'll have to repeat the conversation AGAIN if you accidentally skip one you wanted to hear. There was an annoying blend of too much exposition and not enough.  Things you wanted to know more about were left vague or skimmed over while trivial elements were expounded on at exhaustive length.\nThe aliens were bad mockeries of the original concepts in some cases with a few new additions.  Sillicoids went from being tough, rocky tank-class monsters to fart-joke comic relief dispatched with a single punch and generally just used as an annoyance or a 'Boo' scare during cut scenes. Mutons went from being numerous foot soldiers to single huge, plodding, damage-soaking monsters that walk at you in a straight line and again eat up all your ammo trying to kill. In the place of Muton foot-soldiers you now have a new race of aliens that are the majority of your opponents and come in many different flavors of annoying; Cloaked, minion-summoning, shield buffers, and snipers as well as just grunts with guns.  Sectoids went from intelligent, psychic, physically weak 'greys' to more comic relief, even to the point of having them thrown out as target practice at the shooting range. The worst was still the Etherials. Used as a plot device somewhere between "Gaia" type entities and possession-demons rather than their former glory as the very powerful psychic combatants.\n\nI got this game for free and generally treated it as a satire on the X-Com franchise. I have no interest in replaying it again, unlike the original and the newer remake, the story and mission choices are limited and uninteresting and have little relevance or impact on the plot. If you want a good game, buy the remake or get the original. I never want to see a sequel or DLC for this game. I advise against paying for this X-Com decorated vomit-bag.","September 4, 2014","false","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Being saying things like "THIS IS NOT XCOM!" and things like that. I myself was underwhelmed when I saw gameplay footage of it. It looked like a boring third person shooter to me, and I was really dissapointed to see that this was what had become of the first-person XCOM game we all saw trailers for.\n\nHowever, after buying and playing it myself, I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. The combat is pretty standard fair for third-person shooters; it's the squad-based tactical element that really makes this game shine. Deeper than I thought it would be, ordering my squad to flank enemies and throw out turrets and mines while ordering my sniper to higher ground under the veil of his cloaking ability has an unexpected, yet very satisfying, satisfaction to it. And the squad tactics are VERY necessary; the enemy AI in this game is intelligent enough to put up a really tough fight sometimes, with one enemy flanking you while another tries to keep your attention by chucking a grenade with the intent of mearly flushing you and your squadmates from cover instead of endlessly spamming them. Mutons and Walker charging your position while drop pods bring in reinforcements to support them, and drones floating high in the sky successfully flanking you and healing the Mutons and Walkers just when you think you have them beat. Every arrangement of enemy forces, whether it's comprised of frontline fighters like Sectoids and Outsiders, long-range support like Outsider Elites and Rocket Snipers, heavy hitters like Titans and Walkers, or a combination of them all; every possible arrangement forces you to incorporate different strategies, and change them in the blink of an eye if an enemy you forgot about suddenly downs a teammate, forcing you to decide whether you should risk reviving them or let them die and start from the beginning with a brand new recruit. There is no clear superior weapon in this game either; you'll find yourself going back and forth between alien and human weapons very often, with neither being particularly stronger than the other, but merely different enough to suit certain situations better. All these factors add up to a game that is surprisingly deep, and very satisfying to play through.\n\nUltimately, this game is one of those games where the advertising campaign for it did it no justice. As it is currently $20 as of the time of writing this review, I'm confident in saying that is a PERFECT price for a very engaging, occasionally janky game. Don't believe the naysayers. Pick this game up and enjoy the tactical, conspiracy-filled universe of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.","June 1","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's barely even an XCOM game, because mostly, it's a third-person shooter.\n\nYou start out as agent William Carter, who is an XCOM agent. After an alien attack hits the world, he and his fellow allies try to stop them, by going on dangerous missions that involve life-or-death skills.\n\nOne main reason I like this game is the time period it is set in. It is set in 1962, where the U.S.S.R and the U.S are under defcon, in the game and in real life back then. I REALLY like games set in the 1910's through the 1980's.\n\nThe second reason is that it's a third-person shooter. I really enjoy shooter games that get the player in depth.\n\nThe third reason is that the devolper is 2K games! :D\n\nThe graphics in the game are pretty neat. The only problem I have with the graphics is that there are some "lazy spots" in the game that are blurry, and or not very graphic. Also, those cars look very familiar... maybe from Mafia II?\n\nThe story is complicated but at the same time it is very robust. I think it is very appealing and very interesting. I mean, who comes accross a game every day that makes you play as a secret agent who fights aliens to save the world, but at the same time trying to avoid conflict among his co-workers? Wicked cool.\n\nThe gameplay is very mediocre. It gets VERY easy during the start of the game, and what I mean by VERY easy is that it is WAY too easy at the start. But during the end, the game knocks your balls out by giving you a VERY large array of Mutons and Elite Scouts and crap.\n\nThe AI is HORRID. First of all, they never really help you, so if you're on the part where you're trying to get to Mosaic, they don't do jack SH*T, making you shoot ALL of the 100+ aliens that are attacking the F*CK out of you. Sometimes, they even deliver a few shots on you and wound you badly. AND DO NOT CHOOSE NIGEL AS A TEAMMATE. HE IS THE WORST ONE OUT OF THE BUNCH.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't rate this game as bad of a score as a 66. I really wonder why the reviewers were so contempt.

But they're too stupid to be of any use if you don't micromanage them constantly, breaking the flow of combat. They die quick, and since their AI is bad, they often get out of cover to die in a few shots. The Bureau is a frustrating and poorly designed game that is more likely to infuriate than entertain, sadly.","December 17, 2013","false","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Instead, you get an X-COM style game in a non-X-COM time period.

Set in the 50s, It pits the protagonist and two squad-mates against an alien invasion with WW2 weaponry until you can capture the weapons of your foes. Your squad mates can be different classes, and develop cool powers over time, which should allow for different play styles, but sadly there is little motivation to swap between your favorite (and most experienced) soldiers most of the time. Graphics are cool, power implementation is cool, and you can "bullet time" at any point in combat to decide exactly what your squad does (and positioning as well as skill management MATTERS) but the time does not go SO slowly that you don't have to think fast to avoid trouble (cooking grenades, sudden flanking) -- combat is fun and really makes you think... I drew satisfaction both from pitched battles and finding clever solutions to situations. The story is engaging, in a genre where there's been enough retread over the same types of mysterious baddies this game has a novel take on the enemy -- they are both worthy of wanting to understand, contempt, and fear. Types of enemies are QUITE varied, too.\n\nThe Bad?: Game is pretty linear, though tries not to be. Squad size a step back from every other Xcom game. No research or Alien Autopsy (which is arguably one of the cooler elements of Xcom) though there IS some alien interrogation.\n\nOverall, a pretty spiffy game that is fun to play and has a cool story and it's own flavor. Both different enough to be novel, and familiar enough to please the Xcom fan. No regrets here, great squad-based 3rd-person tactical.","March 2, 2014","true","37.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has no drawback, where the others are, less damage for more ability uses.  Destroy armor on armored targets, but less range of ability.  Disable enemy shields, but less ammo.

Your AI team mates make terrible decisions, forcing you to micromanage them which derails the pace of the game. The interface is clunky and the game crashes frequently.\n\nThey want the game to be semi-tactical but they don't give you any options to do that outside of issuing orders. None of the gear you get has stats in any meaningful way. I.E. you'll get one piece of gear that says it increases critical hit damage, but then gives no clue as to how much compared to another piece of gear that does the same thing. You also lose all of the cool meta play of how XCOM is run except for in a few forced ways.\n\n*****Possible Spoilers*****\nProbably the worst part of the game is the writing. The voice acting is fine but the dialogue is cliche after cliche. The characters act inconsistently. In one scene you'll go rogue and in the next chew someone out for doing the same, then support someone else for going rogue in the scene after. The choices people make are unbelievable, including allowing agent after agent to disobey orders.\n\nThe internal logic of the game is busted. For example in the opening mission you're paired with a guy who can throw out laser turrets even though XCOM hasn't gotten that technology yet.

I was a bit surprised, expecting something a little more like the previous XCOM game, Enemy Unknown.  The setting looked quite promising, at first.  I even snickered a little bit in the first mission, when I picked up an 1962-vintage M14 battle rifle to shoot aliens with.\n\nOf course, it has the obligatory cover system which seems to be required of any run n' gun game of this sort, but only some manage to execute effectively.  Does this game?  Well... sort of: considering the fact that some other games' cover systems can manage any maneuver with nothing more than WASD, the direction you're looking, and the Spacebar, The Bureau seems to go more for a style where each little variation on "jumping from cover to cover" needs its own key.  Good, I suppose, if you've had trouble getting the more "intuitive" cover systems to do what you want, but for me it breaks up the action a little too much.  "Okay, I need to get to that desk which is a bit ahead of me and to my left.  So, I hold Left, and press... V, I think, and then..."\n\nA bit of a learning curve on the cover controls, though, is not a game-breaker.  It did, however, all fall apart for me eventually.\n\nPretty soon after you've gotten a taste of "how to shoot" and "how to not get shot," you're presented with a big, steaming pile of a squad command system.  The Bureau has you giving commands to your agents, not too unlike Enemy Unknown did - apart from the fact that you *are* also one of the agents.  What you end up with, then, is a game where you play a real-time, but dumbed-down version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, in between bouts of playing an okay-but-not-amazing third-person shooter game, using a clumsier version of the dynamic pause squad-command system from the Mass Effect trilogy.\n\nSo, if you *liked* XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or the Mass Effect trilogy... don't play this.  If you like the XCOM series enough that you simply must at least *try* The Bureau, do yourself a favour and at least wait for a sale, which will reduce the sting if you end up being as disappointed as I was.","May 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have no idea why they decided weapons should be picked up in missions (instead of researched or built at your own pace) and nothing should have a clear representation of what effects are provided.  Does this backpack (your only other piece of equipment besides weapons) provide more damage resistance than that one?  Who can say, because the game sure doesn't.  More on the management side could've been a bit of a boost to gameplay as well.\n\nThe story is utterly disjointed...suddenly it will present information that I'm seeing for the first time as though I should be well versed in it.  It's poorly paced, characters can be a little bland and cheesey, all of which could be okay if the overall storyline and gameplay were more interesting.  As it is, it's just downright confusing at times.\n\nAll in all, it's an okay game.  I'm just disappointed that for whatever reasons (be it bowing down to exterior pressure, excessive development time, too many changes of direction) it feels like it could've been a lot more.  From the review, it probably sounds like I think it's a bad game.  I don't.  It's just passable, and it's not something that I would imagine that I'd ever pick up again after my first play-through.","July 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The way I see it My skyrangers in the 60ties were bells helicopters while the vanguard invasion force was flying craft that suprisingly enough looked a lot like my skyrangers in 1999. Most aliens were using laser weapons in the sixties with a couple plasma prototypes for the crack troops, well guess what weapons you already can research at the beginning of the 1999 invasion... (lasers duh, gotta work for plasmas) The way I see most reviewers bi**ing bout how come most of this tech never worked at the latter invasions? well E115 is naturally an unstable element, and it does get used up, and there is no natural source of it on our world, srry, no gas no ride.\n...kk game, tactical combat better than that in Mass Effect (if u know what you are doing). Shooting gallery a lot worse than CoD, never buy it if ur expecting to go rambo on thar alien hineys, u wont, ur chances are slimmer than doing the same in ARMA.

The whole game is pretty much cutscene after endless cutscene, half of which suffer from some bug in the sound so you get to watch but have no idea what is going on. And you finish one cutscene just to be thrown into another, absolutely no gaming required. Just watch a cartoon. The whole thing is on rails, so you move through mazes of landscape just to get to, you guessed it, another cutscene. In between moving from cutscene area to cutscene area, you do come across nice little rooms with aliens, and you get to take a few shots, throw a few grenades, issue some orders to your NPC allies, but wait; they tend to either ignore your orders or follow them and then do their own thing, getting killed. And yet you can still survive the encounter, to get to the next group of cutscenes.\n\nIf you waste money on this trash you'll get a buggy cartoon made up of cutscenes.

Not great, but not bad either. The gameplay reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins (in terms of the squad command) mixed with a cover-to-cover 3PS. Its fun for a while, but ordering around your squad can be a nuisance. They like to run to random places and get cut off, then go into bleedout. Not a big deal on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties, if they die, they die for good. Gameplay score 8/10\n\nThe story is interesting. It was pretty good up until the final few missions, then it took a nose dive. The very end brought it back a little, but the fact remained that the twist at the end made no sense with the rest of the story. I won't spoil it any more than that. Story score 7/10\n\nThe graphics are really good. Better than XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Not top notch, but still very good. Graphics score 9/10\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid 7/10, mainly because of the stupid plot twist.

While this game is by no means original, borrowing from other games like Assassin Creed: Brotherhood and Mass Effect, it doesn't attempt anything it is uncapable of executing. There are some story line based elements, such as characters not facing the people they intend on talking to in what intends to be an immotional scene, one would think that this detracted from the experience. It only did so minorly. The mechancis of this game carry it. Only at the end when they throw you in a room with wave after wave of enemy did I ever feel that the game was being unfair, however I only wiped once. Any time I had died prior It had been my own tactical fault for playing the game for what is is not: A FPS. As the game proceeds, I found more and more fault with the team pathing AI, and sometimes in the later levels where the terriegn is more complex, I found I needed to baby sit thier movements, but the majority of of the time they handled fine.\n\nIn Summary I would recomend this game, especially at the price it is at present.","August 24, 2014","true","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/65930/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","First off, I have absolutely no experience with the XCOM franchise, so I can't say how the plot stands with the other games, or how faithful the universe is.\nBesides, I haven't played a tactical TPS in a long time, which means that I may overlook some aspects that avid players of the genre look forward to.\n\nBut here are my general thoughts. I'll try not to be too detailed, since AAAs have such a bigger scale compared to what I'm used to playing.\n\nSo. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a tactical third person shooter, set in the 60's, in the first alien invasion of Earth. The best of the best are united in the XCOM to fight this invasion, and cover it up to protect the population.\nYou'll go through several missions (some minor, some major), and you'll get to know the people you're working with between each, in the base.\n\nYou have a squad of 3 people (you, and 2 AI partners), that you have some control over, during the fights. There are different classes in the game, and with each come different skills to aid you in battle. Some are support focused (providing shields, damage buffs, etc.), engineers (focus on tech, turrets, etc.), artillery (with long range deadly shots), you get the drill.\nEach of them can be leveled up to rank 5, and you go as far as rank 10. With each rank you choose 1 of 2 perks (sometimes, 1 of 1... tough choice, there).\n\n\nLet's start with the presentation.\nIt's a AAA game, and that's very clear. Everything looks really nice, and it felt the theme surprisingly well, with the lighting effects giving the game an old sci-fi feel! Other parts of the game looked more generic, unfortunately. But overall, it certainly looked great, with good particle effects, lighting, and physics.\n\nThe music also fit the theme very well, both the 60's feel, and the sci-fi. Unfortunately, it was very far apart. I don't feel like they've used the music very effectively, specially in the tense and emotional moments, the music in those was simply underwhelming.\n\nOverall, it didn't really feel as unique as it could have. As a AAA, it did very little to standout, despite being pretty good aside from that.\nOne thing it did well in the beginning, was portraying the time setting well, using posters, and even the conversations with the different people.\n\nMoving on.\nThe gameplay started out pretty good, but the probems soon started to reveal themselves. I chose to play in Commander Difficulty at first. The problem with that, was the friendly AI. They died within 4 seconds of the start of the fight. And I'm not exaggerating!\nIf I sent someone to revive them, they'd just stand in the middle of the shots and would die as well. And that was pretty much the experience. That kind of challenge wasn't welcome at all. I spent way more time trying to keep my squad alive than fighting!\nSo... after about 5 missions I decided I had enough with it, and turned it to Veteran. I died twice in the whole game after that. Once in the last mission, with throws wave after wave of enemies after you.\nThere's just such a big discrepancy between Hard and Very Hard... that's not a very good balance, in my opinion.\n\nCommander mode could have been really strategic and tense, if the AI was worth something.       Unfortunately, it was really bad. And you could see in the end, comparing their kills to yours. You alone did about 95% of the job, so yeah...\n\nOther than that, it wasn't bad. You had several different weapons at your disposal, different enemies had to be taken out in different ways (not too different, but a bit different nonetheless), the skills lead to some nice teamwork... I wasn't bad!\nIt was not spectacular, but I was fairly enjoyable.\n\nAs I said before, between missions, you'll be in the Hub Area. Here, you can talk to the scientists, engineers, pretty much everyone, and get their view on the invasion. You'll also know why they're there, and what they're working on. That was cool. It didn't blow my mind, but it's good that it's there, if you feel like exploring a bit more.\nThere are also Notes, Photos, and Audio"Logs" spread out, during the breaks between battles. These also give you a bit more insight into the world, which is always good!\n\nSomething that really bothered me though, was the Audio Logs. You had to stand near to listen to it. ... Why? The whole point of audio logs is to keep the player exploring, while being presented with the backstory. And they managed to screw it up, and have you stop your playing to listen to it... It makes no sense! Might as well give you a note instead of an audio log... I don't understand.\n\n\nThere's not much else to say about it, really. The cover system works fine, for the most part. One complaint I have, is that you can't roll into cover! That's really important, in my view! You can roll out of the way fine. But if you roll into cover, it doesn't connect, so you'll stand up, fully vulnerable, after rolling. And you'll take unnecessary shots. I don't see why it's not in there either, but oh well...\n\nI may seem overly negative about the game, for a positive review. The fact of the matter is, that it mostly functions very well. The gunplay is solid, movement in fluid, combat involves some level of tactic, while ordering your squad members, ...\nIt's not a bad game at all. It's simply not a very good one either, and for full price, I definitely do not recommend it. But if you're curious about the setting, or you're a fan of XCOM, I don't see a problem in getting in a sale, or something along those lines.\n\nThe character interactions, though, were really bad in my opinion. And so was the way they handled the ending.\n\nSPOILERS HERE.\n\nSo, while you were playing with one character for the whole game, learned about his intentions, played his role, they decided to switch things up. In the end, you had to choose another character to control. (You're an alien controlling them,  basically) You had 3 choices that were not very well explained. Nor well executed, with the past they set up.\nThe new character played exactly the same way as the previous one! You go from a badass field agent to a scientist who barely every fought, and they have exactly the same abilities and skills! It makes no sense whatsoever! And they also expect you to make the choices you've made with the previous character, as if they were the same... Depending on the character you choose, you'll get a different ending, based on each person's ideals, and that was good. But aside from that one cutscene in the end, it felt a very shallow choice. And even before that, there was ONE seemingly important choice... Well, it was just a cameo. There was no choice at all, it was all an illusion. And a pretty bad one. Oh well.\nOverall, I expected more. But for the price at which I got it, it was a fine game. Won't change the world in any way, but it was enjoyable.","July 20, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In this game, you're regularly taking down 50 or more with 3 people. There's really not much strategy to it, either. Your teammates are dumb and require constant instructions on where to go, and you'll find yourself more often than not just going to do everything yourself, because it's faster. It tries to incorporate a little bit of strategy by allowing you to do extra damage via flanking your enemies, but that's about as deep as it gets.\n\nOverall, this is dull, uninspired, and feels like a B-movie version of the worst Mass Effect game.

The ability to slow down time to a near stop, and chose where your men go and abilities to use was well thought out. I'd even go as far as to say it was much smoother then mass effect. The aliens in this are okay, you can tell they rushed the game horribley. Where in the old games you would ♥♥♥♥♥he slow invasion picking up strength as time goes by, you face several mutons and a mechtoid in the first real mission. The missions are cobbled together with barely any reason at all. One moment your being told theyre posioning the water, the next your assaulting one of their command spires. The upgrade system is just as bad, with abilities gained with experince. This would be a good thing, were it not for the fact you suddenly get the ability to throw a sentient blob at your foes that they were using for several issions before. They were clearly going to make you research them, but that was cut and the only thing left of it was 2 scientists goofing around and trying to test some things. They also hyped up the whole, your soldiers will die if they bleed out and don't come back. This was very sadly implemented, with them going into the bleed out state several seconds into a battle because they decided the cover you told them to go to wasn't enough against the muton making it way towards them. which you would then have to go and revive them, during that animation you will become invulnerable, and with handy timing can avoid even getting killed by a mechtoid point blank. Compared to you allies the alien AI seems like the terrifying force it's meant to be, but only because they can actually stay in cover and actually listen to their commanders.

The idea of a squad-based third person shooter as an installment of XCOM is interesting, but ultimately it's poorly executed in this game...a pale reflection of Mass Effect.  Better AI, a bigger diversity of weapons, and more interesting passive/active abilities would've been a significant boost.  As it is, the game is quick to master, and as there's little else in the way of gameplay, it begins to make the game feel repetitive.\n\nThe  RPG elements provide hardly any depth, the items ultimately seem like nothing more than skin changes.  I have no idea why they decided weapons should be picked up in missions (instead of researched or built at your own pace) and nothing should have a clear representation of what effects are provided.  Does this backpack (your only other piece of equipment besides weapons) provide more damage resistance than that one?  Who can say, because the game sure doesn't.  More on the management side could've been a bit of a boost to gameplay as well.\n\nThe story is utterly disjointed...suddenly it will present information that I'm seeing for the first time as though I should be well versed in it.  It's poorly paced, characters can be a little bland and cheesey, all of which could be okay if the overall storyline and gameplay were more interesting.  As it is, it's just downright confusing at times.\n\nAll in all, it's an okay game.  I'm just disappointed that for whatever reasons (be it bowing down to exterior pressure, excessive development time, too many changes of direction) it feels like it could've been a lot more.  From the review, it probably sounds like I think it's a bad game.  I don't.  It's just passable, and it's not something that I would imagine that I'd ever pick up again after my first play-through.","July 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The ability to slow down time to a near stop, and chose where your men go and abilities to use was well thought out. I'd even go as far as to say it was much smoother then mass effect. The aliens in this are okay, you can tell they rushed the game horribley. Where in the old games you would ♥♥♥♥♥he slow invasion picking up strength as time goes by, you face several mutons and a mechtoid in the first real mission. The missions are cobbled together with barely any reason at all. One moment your being told theyre posioning the water, the next your assaulting one of their command spires. The upgrade system is just as bad, with abilities gained with experince. This would be a good thing, were it not for the fact you suddenly get the ability to throw a sentient blob at your foes that they were using for several issions before. They were clearly going to make you research them, but that was cut and the only thing left of it was 2 scientists goofing around and trying to test some things. They also hyped up the whole, your soldiers will die if they bleed out and don't come back. This was very sadly implemented, with them going into the bleed out state several seconds into a battle because they decided the cover you told them to go to wasn't enough against the muton making it way towards them. which you would then have to go and revive them, during that animation you will become invulnerable, and with handy timing can avoid even getting killed by a mechtoid point blank. Compared to you allies the alien AI seems like the terrifying force it's meant to be, but only because they can actually stay in cover and actually listen to their commanders. (Yes they have commanders.)\n\nThis game should be passed at all costs, for no reason should you buy this game. The dl is half ♥♥♥♥♥ from the one I played. Code breakers, which was one mission and then I returned to worrying about the invasion and completley forgot it even happened.

Having now played it, however, I am pleasantly surprised.  It's a totally different game from the other XCOMs I know and love, but somehow it still captures much of the same feeling.  The tactical combat is a little confusing and clunky at first, but by the end of the game it's second nature.  The 60s-noire vibe is also a refreshing change.\n\nThe bottom line is that this game is NOT like the other XCOMs in terms of gameplay so if that's what you want you will be disappointed.  It IS a creative re-telling of the XCOM story in a cover-based squad TPS set in the cold-war era.  It's pretty linear with the only hidden features being special 'packs' and dialog/story details.  However, the story and dialog are good enough and in terms of game mechanics it's one of the better cover-based shooters I've played.\n\nTakes 15-20 hours to beat the game based on difficulty and exploration.","July 11, 2015","true","18.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is not a terrible game, HOWEVER it is not worth $30, maybe $10 - $15. I luckily got it in a Xcom bundle for a good price.\n\nThe game has it's ups and downs with a nice leveling system (however limited it may be) and the choice of what two allies you bring with you is cool (Engi, medic, sniper, ect). The game is a nice 1960's Mass Effect third person strategy game. You give commands to your team members while also taking to the field and shooting aliens.\n\nThe story is good, you're escorting an item when things go wrong and an alien invasion starts. You join up with a secret military group and fight back in an interesting dispatch soldiers to some missions while fighting in other missions. Without giving away too much I will just say that the game has a fantastic mind blowing twist towards the end that I did not see coming.\n\nOne negative I found with the game is the friendly AI that you bring with you. I started on the highest difficulty and at first had no issues as I was able to give basic orders to my allies, ie take cover and support me, but you need to be very specific with where you want your allies to go and what path you want them to take. If you are not you will end up seeing your ally run right through the crossfire being mowed down in seconds. Also sometimes though it seemed random, your allies would run back to you after completing a task, very infuriating when you're taking on a spider machine with 5+ aliens and you're waiting for your ally to complete their flanking order you gave them only to find them standing next to you. I ended up toning down the difficulty so I could complete the game while still enjoying it.\n\nI also ended up just bringing two engi allies with me because i found being able to deploy two turrets and two land mines very useful and effective. Moreso than the other classes with my playstyle.\n\nI do believe you should buy this game, just at a lower price.\n\nGood gameplay\nEnjoyable story\nFun leveling and side quests\nDecent length (didn't drag on)\nNice variety in weapons\n\nAnnoying AI\nCould do with more enemy variety (only about 5)","December 16, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/recommended/65930/","senorsantiago","(PoA) ¿Señor Santiágo?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/","666 products in account","While no particular aspect of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is earth shattering, the overall experience is quite enjoyable and makes for a solid addition to the fairly niche tactical shooter lineup.\n\nGiven the fantastic games that get made by 2K, it is strange to me that their development process can so frequently be described as problematic, as was the case for 2K Marin.  This title had some interesting features planned such as detective work and stealth based gameplay, but those unfortunately got cut as the game underwent repeated revisions and delays.  It sounded promising.  As is, The Bureau fails to inspire much passion but nonetheless contains plenty of fun and is without question worth a play.\n\nI have to admit I was very excited about The Bureau prior to getting my hands on it, and even now have a certain amount of bias favoring this one, because of:\n60's Cold War Setting\nAction Shooter w/Squad Based Tactics\nScifi Theme  I love speculative, historical fiction.  I loved the Brothers in Arms IP and was ready for more such action, and of course like everyone, I love convincing science fiction.  The Bureau delivered in some regards and not others.\n\nThe story expands upon what's already established by previous titles in the IP.  The plot had some clever ideas that I liked, and some that baffled, none of which I can describe without spoilers, so I won't go there.  I didn't play the classic series back when it came out in the mid '90s, so as story and gameplay go, I - unlike the core fans - am blessedly free of the urge to decry any deviations from what made those games great.  My impression is that XCOM is one of those rare IP's that just doesn't need an overly involved story; it is enough that aliens are here wreaking havoc on Earth and humanity must pull together to survive and conquer.\n\nCombat is fun.  It didn't get old before I reached the end, not even after I attempted a new playthrough on the Commander difficulty.  On standard difficulty you can play it all tactical, all shooter or anything in between.  It all works and satisfies.  Putting around the base between missions is okay and rewards the player with bits of background story and unlockable side missions.  Most of the campaign is linear, which is fine by me.  The bugs were few and far enough between that they don't merit mention.  The visuals with graphic settings maxed are excellent and the audio does its job.  My only technical complaint is that the actual movement and placement of your agents (and targeted abilities) with the ground cursor feels a bit console port.  You use skills and reposition often in combat encounters, so this might get tiresome.\n\nI don't have the DLC's and have no knowledge of Hangar 6 R&D.  My thoughts on this game included how a cooperative or competitive mode might work: the player pauses to access skills and issue squad orders in a tactical mode.  So, instead of being able to pause and use that interface indefinitely, start players with only a few seconds of the tactical mode but reward them (jointly in co-op, individually in competitive) with extra seconds of tactical time for skillful play (flanking and exposed attacks, environmental kills, combo and skill kills, etcetera).\n\nAfter finishing the game, I went and read some major reviews.  In my opinion they're a bit unfair.  My advice is to judge the game on its own merit and decide for yourself.  It may or may not feel like an XCOM title but at the end of the day The Bureau is an entertaining, fun and brief experience that I recommend to anyone who shares the tastes I listed here.\n\nTIP: Avoid Rookie difficulty; it is trivial and will bore you.\nTIP: Don't jump straight into Commander difficulty - instead get a feel for the mechanics first.\nTIP: Once you are at Commander, remember the game punishes even slight deviations from ideal tactics.  You will consistently have to use everything at your disposal including skills, environment, rapid repositioning and your own sharpshooting.  If you don't, be ready to restart checkpoints a lot..\nTIP: If you're digging the story and setting, there are side activities to hunt down in base and also letters and audio clips both at base and in the field.  Plus, if you stand near people they will have some funny conversations.","July 18, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music fits very well with the theme and setting - it is appropriately intense whenever the action calls for it.\n\nThe controls are fairly straightforward, and the tutorial mission is great at helping you understand both the controls and how to issue orders to your squad without being too long or too boring. The learning curve is moderate, however, the game can be extremely unforgiven in the commander (hardest) difficulty. There is permanent death if your squad members are downed and not revived in time on commander difficulty; furthermore, reviving them only stabilizes them - meaning they are out of combat until the instance is cleared of all enemies. I am playing on this difficulty, and have had many situations where I had to slow-play and defeat all the enemies on my own. Your squad members are heavily reliant on your orders, especially in the harder difficulties.\n\nThe story is pretty good, and there is a lot of extras provided in the form of audio recordings and files if you choose to look for them.\n\nThe gameplay reminded me a lot of Mass Effect, down to the very first muton power you unlock for your character - lift. The feedback is very good, showing the enemy's health at the top center of the screen, and having large grenade icons warning you of the blast radius. During battles, you can go into battle focus, which slows down time to a crawl and allows you to issue your orders. There is a range where you can order your squadmates to move/do actions, which I found to be very nice. You can have two weapons equipped at a time, and you will slowly unlock new equipment (the first being a bag that increases your headshot damage). You may have only 2 other active squad members at a time.\n\nCover is extremely important, as the enemy will try to actively flank you and can become very aggressive. Most combat instances will have a few ammo drops to refill your weapons, and explosive barrels are littered in many areas to help you kill mobs of enemies quickly.\n\nAs you gain experience, you will level up and can choose different perks for both you and your teammates. There is a decent variety of customization - you can change every agent's clothing color (pretty basic), and their background changes the type of perks that can be unlocked. You can recruit new agents, and when you do this you will be given an option to choose both their class and their background (ex: engineer class with technical expertise, leading to faster cooldowns on abilities).\n\nThe XCOM base is not as explorable as I'd like, but it is still fun to walk around and talk to people - or read the extra content like agent dossiers.\n\nThere are a number of side missions for you to play and unlock more mutons. Completing these help you gain levels and increase your psychic arsenal to defeat the alien invaders.\n\nVery good game, especially if you are a fan of the series.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","July 23, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A more recent comparison, and this is fairly obvious based on the UI and such, is Mass Effect 2/3's combat (but again, with less focus on the protagonist killing everything himself).\n\nIt's a pretty good-looking game (it's UE3 with fairly pretty lighting, and a really solid aesthetic direction), and I've only run into a couple of minor bugs (a flying enemy got stuck under the level a couple of times because they were spawning behind a tall wall and attempting to go under it) - performance and stability are solid on my system. It's a good port, too, with lots of video options and a good FoV slider (it's dumb to have to mention this, but hey, modern gaming).\n\nI really don't get why it got the review scores it did. It's a really polished, fun title in what is admittedly a fairly niche genre, and to cap things off, it has one of the more intelligent war plots I've seen in video games (yes, despite being a game about the 1950s FBI fighting little grey men). It's also fun seeing what are basically levels from XCOM: Enemy Unknown translated to third person.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of tactical third-person shooters, I can only recommend this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajun_ramble/recommended/65930/","cajun_ramble","Mammon's Ultramontane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajun_ramble/","136 products in account","I recommend this game, but only under specific terms. As anyone with a working understanding of what XCOM is, this one only counts as an XCOM game under similar terms. If you want deep tactical combat and a sense of existential dread fighting back a cybernetic, mindfraying enemy ages ahead of humanity, this is not the game for you. The combat amounts to skulking around and shooting heads poking around cover and making sure all your crazy ill-begotten alien abilities are in constant cooldown. I'd be surprised to see if someone in the credits took credit for designing these levels, because there's almost no incentive to even try to play strategically--you'll win by getting killed a lot and hoping you won't die the next time you respawn at the checkpoint just behind you.\n\nNot a lot going on with it mechanically. It's enjoyable. It's plain. It was on its way to being a top-grade squad shooter, then never articulated itself past the poorly-aging mechanics of games like Freedom Fighters and Republic Commando.\n\nSadly, if it's lore you want, you're likely going to be left wanting. The game fleshes out the XCOM universe with fleeting moments of coherence, almost like the devs knew what they were doing was only wearing XCOM clothes and never going to breach into full-fledged canon. Conspiracy theorists may take issue with that proclamation, but yeah well so what.\n\nThere's one specific thing this team got really right. If you're old enough to know what Man's Life magazine is, you're going to get some nostalgic chills when you take in the game's hypermasculine adventure-pulp vibe. Bad game or good game, there's a campy satisfaction in playing as our leading man--Oklahoma-born, corn-fed, brick-chinned Central Intelligence Alcoholic William Carter against deathray-wielding moon men, wearing his best plum-purple tactical sweater on black ops deployments. If your hat gets shot off in a firefight, it's gone for the rest of the game.\n\nThe atmosphere is, in the early moments of the game, breathtaking. The insidious quiet of landing in these freshly-ravaged towns is stunning and sobering. The moment I first entered XCOM HQ and strode past a bunch of brass wearing pinstripe slacks, suspenders, sleeves rolled up, smart ties and slicked hair, smoking listlessly on tabletops watching radio intel slowly etch onto churning paper printouts, I was completely hooked. It felt like I was somewhere whole and real.\n\nBut really, in this game, the aliens' perfect, inscrutable plan of attack is to make sure all their ranking officers at the frontline are wearing elaborate, glowing, Please Shoot Me First armor. Checkmate, says Jeff Goldblum. The game is a sickly, sci-fi-obsessed child of Cold War-era American exceptionalism without the heart to go too far down the satire path, but this is not the platform for a foreign policy ethics essay, so pass along, nothing to see here.\n\nDevelopment hell doesn't always kill everything, and value survives in this little curio of a shooter. Hear the chilly, blurry radio feedback in your headphones when you enter Tactical View to take out a pod of flanking Sectoids. Just listen to the earnestness with which one of your squadmates asks, in the middle of a burning forest, "We're gonna make'em pay, right boss?"\n\n"Yeah boys, we're gonna make'em pay, all right."","April 7, 2015","true","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The whole game is pretty much cutscene after endless cutscene, half of which suffer from some bug in the sound so you get to watch but have no idea what is going on. And you finish one cutscene just to be thrown into another, absolutely no gaming required. Just watch a cartoon. The whole thing is on rails, so you move through mazes of landscape just to get to, you guessed it, another cutscene. In between moving from cutscene area to cutscene area, you do come across nice little rooms with aliens, and you get to take a few shots, throw a few grenades, issue some orders to your NPC allies, but wait; they tend to either ignore your orders or follow them and then do their own thing, getting killed. And yet you can still survive the encounter, to get to the next group of cutscenes.\n\nIf you waste money on this trash you'll get a buggy cartoon made up of cutscenes.

Those who expect a sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, will be extraordinarily disappointed with The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.\n\nThis is not a turn-based strategy game. This is a squad-based third person shooter. There is definitely strategy involved with selecting the proper soldiers (two squadmates to assist you at a time) with the appropriate weapons and knowing how to manage their abilities in order to conserve the most ammo, maximize opportunities for kills, etc.; but it's incredibly different from the previous entry to the XCOM series.\n\nBut change is not a bad thing, anyone interested in the (albeit fairly cliche at this point in time) concept of an alien invasion in the midst of a futuristic-styled 60's era, will enjoy The Bureau's story. It throws a few interesting twists to keep it from being entirely cliche, and overall executes the concept it goes for, perfectly.\n\nWhile XCOM Declassified is definitely not for everyone, fans of alien sci-fi with an open mind to change for a series, who are willing to learn how to properly manage their soldiers (there is a bit of a learning curve and frustration in the beginning), will certainly enjoy this game. Especially on its frequent dirt-cheap sales, it's impossible to go wrong. Buy this game.","March 14, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love enemy unknown and grew up on terror from the deep. This is nothing like these, expect a cover tactical shooter that is driven by a narrative akin to the series. Life forms from somewhere else have arrived, and they are terribly aggressive and we apes (sorry creationists), being the busy little warriors we are are now tasked with overcoming a dominant invasion force by doing what we love--killing stuff with noisy things.\n\nThis is a story-driven XCOM shooter. It was refreshing to play as the agents themselves and the story was good enough to keep the player going. Fighting enemies in real and slowed time makes mutons much more menacing. You also can't count on a team of snipers as your squad will always be three people. Fights are exciting as maps are well arranged to encourage scattering your team to flank, support, or divert enemies. I would recommend keeping the difficulty up high as lower levels allow for easily exploitable AI. At one point I was dropping teams of five monsters in a couple seconds mainly through well placed powers and team members.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't much in the way of variation in outcomes so don't expect anything quite so dynamic.\n\nWorth a single run through but I do not feel compelled to replay it.\n\nI'd give it a 6.5 out of 10, fun but borrows too much to stand out.","November 5, 2014","true","25.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jschildress75/recommended/65930/","jschildress75","jschild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jschildress75/","350 products in account","I know this is a very controversial game, hence it's mixed reviews. My son was all into XCOM and I picked this up for him during a Steam sale and he seemed to love it, quickly finishing it and it's DLC. It took me a while, but finally through the magic of Steam Family Sharing, I decided to give it a go. And honestly, to my shock and dismay. I liked it. No, it's not XCOM the strategy game. No, it doesn't seem to follow the established "lore", such as it is. But if you can approach the game as a tactical rpg-lite squad shooter with a decent story, I think you'll be impressed. For hardcore XCOM fans, think of this as an alternate universe version of XCOM or treat it as it should be, it's own thing. Now onto the review!\n\n+/- Graphics, being built on the Unreal engine, are pretty good. It has some nice particle effects, models are pretty good, and a decently variety of both enemy models and settings. It very much has the "Bioshock" look to the UI and world, while art direction pulls a good 50's vibe and flavor to most everything. Weaknesses are mostly confined to poor facial animations and sometimes stiff looking movements, but overall the game has a clean and consistent look that works really well for the game.\n\n+/- Story and voice acting is played upon very heavily in this title, far, far more in this title than any previous XCOM game. There are multiple NPC's and your own character that are all developed decently well, if not anything exceptional. You can tell they were heavily inspired by the Mass Effect school of Story but they never quite reach those heights. Most dialog is decently written and spoke well, but while enjoyable, there is no top tier level story telling to be had and much of it feels like it contridicts much of what is presented in the XCOM game. Purists might cry foul and let what is presented distract them, but again, pretend it's an alternate version of the XCOM universe and enjoy the more personal ride.\n\n+/- Combat and powers are obviously the main focus here and this is what drives most people batty. One thing I've learned playing through this entire game is that moving your squad mates is mostly an exercise in futility. Just save yourself some pain and let them move themselves. That doesn't mean you don't coordinate them because this is not a game that you win  by playing it as a shooter. Do that and you WILL cry. Powers are everything in this game and using your teams varied abilities is paramount to winning the game.\n\nUsing your abilities will greatly slow down time (but not pause), allowing you to choose both your and your teammates abilities and their targets. In this respect (opposed to moving your teammates) the game works very well. Nothing is more satisfying than being pinned down by a sniper, Lifting him out of cover, and focusing fire to take them out quickly. Or taunting an Outsider, which makes them focus on one character and advance, right into a mine dropped by an Engineer. Realizing you can queue up multiple attacks helps you power attack the most dangerous enemiese quickly. I spent much of combat making sure everyone's powers are constantly being used AND upgrading them in a manner that fit my playstyle greatly improved the flow of combat and made the game more enjoyable. I will warn you, as at the start of the game, when you have few abilities, that the game is much more frustrating as the gunplay is at best, competent. This is not a run and gun game - that will kill you fast. Cover, flanking, short bursts, grenades, and abilities will win fights. Nothing else.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but if you like more tactical FPS, something that's a little different, and something with an interesting 50's take on XCOM, I'd recommend it. You can get it cheap regularly during steam sales and for those sale prices, it's highly recommended. Final score - 3.5/5","January 9, 2015","true","18.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A lot of familiar monsters are on view, and familiar weapons too. The plot is at least somewhat interesting, with a lot of choice about what missions you perform when.

You can send them to catch the bad guys in a crossfire, or tell them to revive you when you take too much damage. It offers some intriguing possibilities, but the control scheme can be a little bit too finicky.

A CIA Agent turned X-COM Agent. The game's start is well paced, it isn't an hour long mission which gives you the details in one whole package, instead, it is phased in little cutscenes throughout major missions and through your own exploration of the surroundings. The game is very similar to Bioshock Infinite in the way your companions behave, the gunplay and also the collectable notes, audio logs and the image which appears on the right hand side of the screen, similar to the way the audio logs do in Infinite.\n\nThe collectables are easilly noticable and have little actual challenge to them, however there are a lot you can miss if you just run and gun through the missions. The AI support you have are actually quite good from my experience, I had read many reviews claiming the AI were bullet sponges etc, but for me they were well placed during combat and only got injured through my own fault in dealing with enemies. The game uses a system which allows you to control what you and your teammates do during combat. For example, moving them behind cover and marking a specific target. The game also has customisation for your character and teammates, so you can get attatched to your team and then watch them die... But, luckily that didn't happen to me. And if you want to break away from the immersion of a full scale alien invasion... if you can really get immersed in that... and customise your teammates to have 'fabulous' (for lack of a word) colour schemes such as Pink, Purple, White and more Pink!\n\nThe gunplay is great, each weapon has a different leve of damage or recoil and the sound isn't just reused throughout. The only issue I have with the guns is that later on, picking up a laser weapon is the easy way out, as it is just running around after the enemy collecting ammo afterwards, without that fear of running out and having to push back to collect more.\n\nThe maps for each level is also a brilliant feature, as far as I saw each map is unique and has lots of different routes and ranges of cover to make each fight unique and to also really allow each player to have his own tactics played out just perfectly, in my case that was send a sniper to flank whilst myself and my other teammate stuck behind cover keeping them distracted. The enemy AI is at times silly but they do take cover and pose a threat should a teammate down and need reviving, the capatilize on errors such as a lack of ammo too, pushing forwards when you don't expect it. This being my first XCOM game I can't really say if the enemies are the same but I can only assume so. In addition to this being my first XCOM game, I would recommend watching or playing Enemy Unknown before saying it isn't as good as Declassified, as from some gameplay I have seen, they look quite different.\n\nThe Bureau doesn't follow the usual turn-based style which other XCOM games do, which allows for much better, flowing combat and tactics. However, this takes away time to think  about what is happening as sometimes I found myself going off my plan to cope with enemies.\n\nThe game features quite a few cutscenes, some of which are in HD, some are in SD, which at times can be quite confusing and annoying as it doesn't look and sound as good. But I managed to get used to the cinematics in the lower definition, the game itself has brilliant high quality level, gun and character designs, with nice little touches on things like hats, ties and cloth which sway in the wind, get shot off in the case of hats and also get knocked around when you pass by or shoot through.\n\nOverall, The Bureau for me is a huge success, thoroughly enjoyable and exciting at all times. I never found myself bored and found the story gripping and suprisingly well written. The multiple choice system allows for a unique knowledge of each character, (If you go through all the options in dialogue with them.) and the games ending is well done as well. I would say behind GTA 5 on console, (Hopefully PC soon!), The Bureau is my favourite game I have played in this year, and last since we are very early into 2014!\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who liked the Mass Effect or Bioshock series and to anyone looking for something else to play.","January 26, 2014","true","8.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Declassified I found was much more interesting when I first read about it in a gaming magazine. It WAS supposed to be a pulp sci-fi suspense story played in First-Person, however several happenings in 2K forced its re-purposing into the 3rd Person shooter we have here.\n\nThe game does manage to hold onto the pulp 60's sci-fi style, unfortunately it quickly gets buried under all the shooting and with that becomes almost irrelevant. A sad thing, in my opinion. For I enjoyed the early previews of the original project, even IF it being an FPS. I did hope that the writers would have managed to create a good suspenseful story to cover the somewhat generic feel of the FPS, it was a bit naive to think that in retrospect. Since the only thing that runs the games industry these days is the AAA's and they only care about money and I could argue that the game is partly bad because of that.\n\n\nHowever, to the game.\n\nSadly under performing and uninteresting, I did not hold much hope for it. Given what I've heard about it, but to finally see and play it.. Urgh. The game is a good example of a good concept ruined, it does manage to be a decent enough precursor to the XCOM series as a whole, but it does it so badly. It's almost not worth mentioning.\n\nThe games story managed to underwhelm me and I now understand why that certain mission ended rather abruptly, the "pop a cap in ye  ♥♥♥  " part, to quote a man more articulate than me.\n\nThe game suffers from AI problems, namely the AI team-members being complete idiots. Unless you give them the order to take cover into a specified location, they might walk right to the enemy and get downed. Most of my crew died due to that fatal flaw in their brain development. Otherwise the fighting is O.K and that's pretty much it, I can't for the life of me tell you a good combat mission the game had.\n\nI feel like my time has been wasted, there is no reason for the game to be this dull. It feels like the developers just up and quit halfway through after the project was re-organized.\n\nI cannot say anything more, for my head is starting to ache from thinking about this.\n\n\n\nXCOM Declassified gets a D.\n\nFor it fails to be interesting in every aspect, the story is dull and uneventful, the action is boring, nothing eventful happens for the entirety of its runtime. A sad example of spoiled possibilities.","May 27, 2015","false","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It isn't as good as others in the genre but with a few twists here and there it doesn't drag down the enjoyment. The characters, an important part of these kinds of games since you will be talking to them so much, are only passingly enjoyable and many of them don't have enough going for them to make them memorable. Some of the main characters are fine but they aren't as good as the ones in other games.\n\nThe setting is a refreshing change from the norm of today's shooters. The clash between olden day America and the futuristic alien architecture is pleasing to look at as you see the destruction between the two. I liked the clash so much that I was a little disappointed when it changed to primarily alien bases later on in the game.\n\nThe graphics are nice, using the unreal engine 3 to a great extent. Character models look nice and the effects are fun to look at. The game has additional Physx support and so cloth and particles flow smoothly. I have AMD so I couldn't really use it. The graphics aren't spectacular to look at, but I enjoyed what I saw.\n\nGameplay is fun and challenges you to direct your team to victory. I played on the hardest difficulty, commander, and it wasn't too difficult once I got a handle on things. You can't take too much damage in this game, and unlike other games health doesn't really regenerate and you can't heal too often. This forces you to use your squad to its fullest capacity instead of going Rambo and doing everything yourself. The abilities are useful and directing your team in slow motion, since the game doesn't pause when you plan out your actions, is engaging and enjoyable.\n\nThe enemies are a little boring as many of them are just humanoid soldiers that don't act any different than any other game. The bosses, on the other hand, are fun and challenge you in tough fights. Things like Mutons, Sectopods, and Gunships become even scarier as they soak up damage and force you to rely on your team's abilities to slow down, damage, and distract the enemy. It really gives you an accomplished feeling when you can plan and take one down without anyone getting really hurt.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone on the fence on getting it during a sale like I did. It may not be the best of its kind in the genre, but you won't really have a bad time while playing it.","July 5, 2014","true","19.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You must fight off an alien invasion to 1960ies earth and unravel the mysterious forces at work.  You command a squad of agents with different specialties and you and your agents can be leveled up with different abilities and buffs as the game progress.  You can control your 2 allies on the field (very similar combat to Mass Effect 2 & 3) by placing them in different positions and assign powers to use.  The powers are fun and vary from bio and machine allies, bombs, turrets, mind control, levitation and more!  Combat is fluid and fun and the best part of the game.\n\nThe setting feels like 1960ies America, or at least what the movies describe as 60ies America, and I really enjoyed the ambiance from the visual appeal of a town, college or rural area.  There are lots of aesthetics thrown in like old TV screens, lab equipment, diners, cars,  etc that really capture the feel of 60ies living.  Unfortunately your squad and other characters you interact with are wooden and bland.   However you are able to make choices in conversation and there are a few interesting twists near the end that your choice will have some impact on the story.  For a sci-fi invasion angle, I enjoyed the story, it’s just that the wooden NPC’s drag it down and take away some of the immersion created by the set pieces and combat.\n\nI hate to review a game in the context of another, but my advice is if you have played Mass Effect 2 & 3 and loved it, you need to play The Bureau as it’s the closest thing to more Mass Effect.  On its own the Bureau has enjoyable gameplay, solid atmosphere with a fun campy story that is brought down by bland characters but is still a worthwhile light RPG experience, plays great with a gamepad.\n\nFYI – if you have an AMD graphics card turn the physics options off to have a high frame rate.  Otherwise X-com Declassified is a looker even on mid-level machines.","October 4, 2015","true","18.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Think of Mass Effect in XCOM universe but not that polished. The AI is somewhat dumb and you have to ordered it most of the time.\n\nThe first part of the game is annoying because of your squad's AI, many times I almost gave up on the game and thought to bury it in my backlog. But once you finished a mission or two and you leveled up a bit, the game kinda grow on you. I suggest that you turn down the difficulty to easy in the first part of the game then just turn it up again when you leveled up a bit and got some laser/plasma weapon.\n\nOverall, its an ok game. Not great but not bad either. IMO, its worth the time that I spent on it finishing up the game and the 3.99 euro that I paid for it.","February 8, 2014","true","26.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It doesn't quite make the mark.\n\nThe combat system has the potential to be better than what's found in Mass Effect with more opportunity for tactics with positioning, traps, and area denial abilities however they gunplay is unpolished and lacks the visceral feedback a headshot should have.\n\nThe controls lack polish and the ability pathing system often gets stuck on certain edges and often times require awkward positioning to hit the intended marker.\n\nBackgrounds and scenery range from pretty damn good to foogly and character models feel dated and jarring inside of cutscenes. The ingame engine looks far better than the cutscenes which leaves one to question why the bawls they decided to not use the better of the two.\n\nVoice acting is well done though the dialogue lacks oomph and can come off as droney due to the dull characters. Sound and music miss their cue more often than not and when they function properly, lacks presence. Sound effects are missing from many scenes or muted for no apparent reason and some select recordings are overly loud.\n\nPacing of the story was actually decent until they hit a jarring "PLOT TWIST!" moment and everything went into rollercoaster super fast action mode and not in a good way. It is like skimming through half of a story when it was just starting to get good.\n\nThe Bureau lacks tries very hard to do what Mass Effect did but it lacks the interesting characters, budget, and polish to pull it off. XCOM has very interesting lore that this game somewhat tapped into via the scientists with their wacky inventions or the technology strapped to your character's arm and back. Sadly, good characters, story, and dialogue are almost non existent leaving the game feeling bland and average at best.\n\nStill, the combat abilities of this game are interesting and hopefully expanded upon in other games.  Third person shooters needs something else to do besides hide behind a wall and shoot once in a while and The Bureau's crack at it is a good start.","August 23, 2013","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It may need a bit of refining but still solid, tactics is very important. So yes, I'd recommend this game if you come in with tempered expectations, this is not an X-COM strategy game and it is not a typical 3rd Person shooter, and it is not an RPG even if it has dialogue trees and side missions, it's a mixture of all these things.

Once I started play tho I was pleasantly surprised. The game is obviously very visually amazing but they didn't waste all their time on that and leave you with a shallow piece of crap.\n\nThe plot is very well written and engaging and better thought out, imo, than the one used for XCOM Enemy Unknown. While there is no grand strategy element to this, the way you handle your 3 man teams has an excellent amount of tactical play to it. The time dilation used keeps the game going but allows you a certain level of precision for giving orders and using special abilities.\n\nDespite the fact that the overall plot will remain the same, there are numerous choices within the game that will affect how events play out. This gives the game a surprising amount of replay value. I also recommend the Hangar 6 DLC which gives even more life to the game and fleshes out the story even more.","April 23, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The review scores have been unfair to this gem, its worth having for a few reasons,\n\nits a hybrid RTS so that will turn people off a bit, its a shooter, with stats like fallout and you give orders to squadmates to use abilities and skills like you do in mass effect, they still can fight on their own but its all about tactics.\n\nthe game takes place in retro 50s land, a great change from the futureish style seen today, classic weapons, with aliens lasers make up your equip, and backpacks are kinda like your magic, the more backpacks you find the better skills you can get, one back may give you better armor attack, others may help you take damage.\n\nstory is pretty good, i wish it was more in detail but still good enough, you have a base that changes as you progress threw the game, areas change as they are used, you can read files, listen to audio records etc.\n\nif you want to know the game is kinda like mass effect, spec ops the line,ressistance, a bit of killzone, and rainbow six all at once, its not a "easy" game, your not meant to take tone of damage, and on the higher settings it can get extreme if you don't know what you are doing, but once you do its natural. I do rec you play with a controller eg exbox, or emu pad, because it makes giving orders etc alot easier.\n\nthe missions are LONG, its been a while since i said that, a few of the missions have been 1hr to 2hrs long and that may throw off some people that want to sit and finish a game fast...but nothing is stopping them from saving and picking it up later, the world has interactive dialog, you may see a ? on the ground next to a body and get detail about it or comments.\n\nI say buy the game, i don't understand why it got a lower score other then sheep reviews or lame shallow people wanting a game they can beat and discard......but its  a rough gem, and if you overlook it's faults, and give it a chance it will grow on it, 4/5","April 25, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had to see for myself, to form my own opinion and try to make out what they were talking about. So, here we go...\n\nAliens are invading, and contrary to the trailers the gameplay is absolutely nothing about concealing their presence. It's about shooting them.\n\nOn the surface it's a 3rd person action game in a Mass Effect style but with a much heavier emphasis on tactics.\nHowever, in reality, the tactics aren't that important. You'll need to use the tactic interface a lot, for sure, but any flanking manouvers or other fancy movement will just get people needlessly killed. It's much more efficient (and easy) to just sit as far back as possible while spamming abilities and take potshots at the evemy, while keeping a secondary heavy weapon on hand for the occasional close encounters.\n\nAnd this is a bit unfortunate.\n\nThe game seems designed for all this tactical depth, but it never encourages you to actively use it. I played on Veteran (2nd highest difficulty) and the above listed method worked great for pretty much every fight in the game. The story elements, while functional, don't really serve any other purpose other than to ferry you from one mission to the next. There's audiologs and a few minor puzzles to solve if you want to, but ultimately much of the game feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nBut despite that, and some inconsistencies/glitches I stumbled across, I still don't regret playing it. It's nowhere near as great as the turn based XCOM:Enemy Unknown, but it's still a fun romp while it lasts.\nThis is a decent game, and if you like the Mass Effect combat style you'll find plenty of entertainment here. There's not enough variety in it to warrant a purchase at full price, but on a sale? Definitely.\n\nJust keep an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.","August 26, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has most of XCom lore I can think of. Except for explanation why present-day XCom has no idea about these events. Even though in the game they specifically said that whoever have that knowledge is either dead or with XCom already. So that plot hole is pretty much only bad thing.\n\nNow to good parts. FIrst of all - they explained aliens structure properly via dialogs and not mumbling of an alien in the end of a game. That's cool. In fact they even explained why this game is in third person view.\n\nGameplay is probably one of the most solid gameplay I've seen for a while. AI is amazing! They constantly try to push you into the open and ♥♥♥♥ you with plasma/lasers. So u have to use your full arsenal of guns and abilities.\n\nGraphics - m-m... it's a game which I think most likely was targeted for current gen consoles. And it wasn't made by Naughty Dog or DICE. So don't expect mind blowing graphics. It's only good.\n\nVoice acting will bring ya into that era of movies from 90s where main character speaks with crazy action hero voice while constantly croaking.\n\nI'd give it something like 8/10 and recommend to buy and play it.

To me the third person shooter made me feel like I was playing 'Red Dead Redemption' without the crazy fast lock on mechanic. For the stradegy potion of it well, it was awesome, I mean I really haven't ever played any XCOM games but the ones I have actually tried have been somewhat boring for me. Don't get me wrong, I love stradegy games, but I just haven't ever really been a big fan of turn based stradegy.\n\nThe game features a captivating storyline that may or may not keep you on the edge of your seat, I mean come on who doesn't like space and aliens?\n\nIn this game you'll get a squad on every mission, all having their own abilities just like in any XCOM game. You can customize the character's name, class, suit colors, and face. I do wish you had more to work with on the clothing portion of every character. But I won't take off score just for that!\n\nEach character you can arm with pretty much any gun as long as it's related to that specific class. For example, the support class starts with an M14 rifle, he can only use guns related to that so he is NOT able to use sniper rifles or shotguns.\n\nLets dive in to the enemies, some are weak, some are strong. The weak ones you can just blow off your shoulder, you could run into a group of them and you may live. But in time you will start facing repair drones, and some aliens even have armor that you have to shoot off of them to even start to do damage to them. I thought the game was too easy until I got to those guys. Now, it's a descent challenge. And I like it.\n\nI love the story and gameplay. 9/10","January 13, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is solid, the strategy elements make it fun as long as you baby sit your teammates. Throw down turrets, lift enemies out of cover, sniper shots, stim buffs, it's got a nice variety of classes and skills, making most builds useful.\n\nThe graphics are top notch, with support for DX11 and very cool eerie atmospheric environments and events. This game could have easily been a triple A epic, but in the end falls short of the hype to forever be destined to only be decently average experience.\n\nThe story, unfortunately is all over the place, the game can't decide if it's a linear action heavy popcorn flick, a deep choice driven narrative, or a half-baked open sandbox rpg and just ends up with a sort of muddled, forgettable plot with everything thrown in. I have a feeling many cutscenes were endlessly revised by the devs.\n\nIf you love the xcom games, then you'll probably hate this game, but if you like Mass Effect, then pick this up and you'll have a weekend rental ... errr whatever steam's equivalent is, sale price, yea ... thats it.","June 6, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I understand that this XCOM game is not like the others in the series as the point of view is different and there are no turns but it really is worth playing. You still however can assign tasks to each of your team mates. The game is more of a first person shooter unlike the previous XCOM games but it trutly is an amazing game. I'm in chronic pain and sitting for even an hour is hard so sitting for 6 is normally impossible for me but I was so enthrolled with the gameplay and story that I was able to ignore my increasing pain. Normally in games I don't really care about the story, my main interests are the gameplay and the graphics but with The Bureau I actually listened to every converstation and cut scene and went around reading all of the paper work left on desks. I have beat the main game and am now working on the DLC (this by the way is also really good) but I really suggest people try it out. I'm not sure if there is a demo but if there is give that whorl..

Unlike Enemy Unknown, the Bureau is more like a rewritten story of how XCOM came about. Despite many reviews criticising it for being too rigid and not really an enjoyable experience, I feel otherwise.\n\nIn my humble opinion, The Bureau storyline was splendidly written. Never once did I feel a sense of boredom. The gameplay can be cruel too, one wrong move and bam your created teammate/AI dies. Perhaps most people won't feel the lost but for me it did. When my AI died in one of the later missions I felt the full brunt of the impact, as I had to resort to using one of my lower level-ed AI in his stead. However that gives the game realism and in that sense the player have to make each and every decision wisely. On a side note, the gameplay(3rd person FPS) reminds me a lot of GRAW2(Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2).\n\nAs for replay value, it really depends on individuals. I probably would give the game another go and try out different classes but at the same time maybe not. Please pardon me for sidetracking, but I couldn't finish Bioshock Infinite, although it was spectacular I felt that it was overhyped, and not really my type of game whereas Dishonored had me engaged. Therefore as I said it depends on individuals!

Once I started play tho I was pleasantly surprised. The game is obviously very visually amazing but they didn't waste all their time on that and leave you with a shallow piece of crap.\n\nThe plot is very well written and engaging and better thought out, imo, than the one used for XCOM Enemy Unknown. While there is no grand strategy element to this, the way you handle your 3 man teams has an excellent amount of tactical play to it. The time dilation used keeps the game going but allows you a certain level of precision for giving orders and using special abilities.\n\nDespite the fact that the overall plot will remain the same, there are numerous choices within the game that will affect how events play out. This gives the game a surprising amount of replay value.

The review scores have been unfair to this gem, its worth having for a few reasons,\n\nits a hybrid RTS so that will turn people off a bit, its a shooter, with stats like fallout and you give orders to squadmates to use abilities and skills like you do in mass effect, they still can fight on their own but its all about tactics.\n\nthe game takes place in retro 50s land, a great change from the futureish style seen today, classic weapons, with aliens lasers make up your equip, and backpacks are kinda like your magic, the more backpacks you find the better skills you can get, one back may give you better armor attack, others may help you take damage.\n\nstory is pretty good, i wish it was more in detail but still good enough, you have a base that changes as you progress threw the game, areas change as they are used, you can read files, listen to audio records etc.\n\nif you want to know the game is kinda like mass effect, spec ops the line,ressistance, a bit of killzone, and rainbow six all at once, its not a "easy" game, your not meant to take tone of damage, and on the higher settings it can get extreme if you don't know what you are doing, but once you do its natural. I do rec you play with a controller eg exbox, or emu pad, because it makes giving orders etc alot easier.\n\nthe missions are LONG, its been a while since i said that, a few of the missions have been 1hr to 2hrs long and that may throw off some people that want to sit and finish a game fast...but nothing is stopping them from saving and picking it up later, the world has interactive dialog, you may see a ? on the ground next to a body and get detail about it or comments.\n\nI say buy the game, i don't understand why it got a lower score other then sheep reviews or lame shallow people wanting a game they can beat and discard......but its  a rough gem, and if you overlook it's faults, and give it a chance it will grow on it, 4/5","April 25, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Would have been nice if the alien weapons were different than your own; other than just being, "Lasers" but I don't find that to truly spoil the game. The weapon variety is good and again, I didn't find this to spoil the game. The CGI sequences look great, I enjoy the voice acting and the game overall feels fleshed out. At $12 on sale for a $50 game, it was a no-brainer-purchase. Highly recommended.","January 25, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In traditional XCOM, the entire game is played from a tactical point of view, giving orders to a unit of soldiers fighting against the alien menace. In the Bureau, you play as the commander of a squad, participating in combat as well as using a pretty unique "Battle Focus" system to issue orders.\n\nThe actual issuing of orders is a bit tricky at times - the soldiers don't always do what you want them to do.  However, once you get used to the goofy little nuances, it easily becomes the most compelling and interesting feature of the game.\n\nA lot of people will tell you that this game isn't XCOM or it's some kind of abomination.  Those people are known as idiots.  This game was always intended to be a spinoff - If you're looking for something truer to the original experience, you're looking for XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  It has all the flavor and intrigue of XCOM, but again, it's a spinoff - it has a non-traditional gameplay style.\n\nIt's my opinion that this is good. Others can disagree, but I don't actually care what they think.","January 25, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're looking for a turn based experiance of squad VS. mobs of alien hoards you may have come to the wrong game but...\n\nI really enjoyed The Bureau.  It might not be in the traditional spirit of previous Xcom games.. and feels like a mashup between Mass Effect and Gears Of Wars, but it really seemed to deliver.\n\nThe Burearu is a game about the struggle of a classy detective and his squadmates against inhuman odds.  The action is live and every order you make counts.  The combat is full of tension and adrenaline, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  If you're a fan of the Xcom lore and don't mind a deviation in gameplay style I'd definately recommend XCOM declassified.\n\nIf you are in it for the turn based mechanic however, I plead with you to wait for the next xcom title, as the active third person shooter gameplay may not be up your alley. It is quite polished and I can not think of a single complaint to make, but it does not follow the gameplay tradition of the games of the series that game before it.\n\nThat said, I have played all of The Bureau main campaign before writing this review (save for the post final boss content) and am 100% satisfied with the game save that I wish it was a little longer.","January 29, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought that the game was going to be an uninteresting third person shooter, but I quickly learned that this is wrong. The games setting for a start is very good, the game is set in the 1960s so that already sets it apart from the many third person shooters on the market. The games levels feel often detailed, it seems like a lot of work was put in designing the levels. The game has a feeling of the "Mass effect" games, so if your into them you might like this. The squad system feels OK but is serviceable you can customise soldiers and their names etc, it doesn't feel as detailed as "XCOM Enemy Unknown." I think that the game got mixed reviews due to it being a part of the "XCOM" series and it not being the same style as previous games, however, you should not listen to these reviews as the game is of a very good standard.","April 26, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is different to the other entries in the XCOM series in that the game does not play like an RTS game or feature an isometric view, and is instead played as a standard cover shooter with an over the shoulder view. Does this make it a good game? Yes.\nWhile hardcore fans will of XCOM will find this change of formula jarring, I personally found this formula to be a unique technique and a fresh flavour specific to the XCOM series. While the game plays a bit more like Mass Effect this time around (you can pause the game and command your team mates via a command screen, such as ordering them to move or use special abilities, etc) , it still feels like XCOM, as you still have to take strategic care in how you enter combat situations. I liked how you had to be strategic in how you placed your team mates, and how you must constantly adapt to combat as enemies flank you and draw you out of cover. This made for a tense and enjoyable gameplay experience, and is definitely a must on the harder difficulties. Unfortunately, the AI of your squadmates leaves a lot to be desired, and you will definitely get frustrated by their lack of competence.\nYou will also get frustrated by the generic and often boring characters as well as the lacklustre plotline; this is standard alien-invasion fare, and anyone else looking for a riveting science fiction story will need to look elsewhere. I rarely find moments of the plot interesting, except for the rare dialogue encounters with the aliens themselves, which were a joy to behold. However, none of the other characters offered much in the way of development and voice acting, and I found them bland and uninteresting.\nThe graphics are quite nice, and lots of love and care have been dedicated to the lighting and detailed environments in the game. Many of the details in this game are quite nice, and this game looks extremely good when cranked up to max settings whilst running on DX11.\nIn short? The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a unique yet unusual entry in the XCOM franchise, and is a reward to fans of tactical shooters in general. Despite the occassional stumble in gameplay, incompetent team-mate AI and a lacklustre story, The Bureau is a solid game and I recommend it highly despite its flaws. I give this game a 7.5 / 10.","January 8, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Once they can figure out how to work A.I. a bit smarter without creating a robotic uprising ending in the near extinction of humanity, games like this will get drastically better. Not having your allies shove their faces into bullets will be a great addition to most games. The cursor thing is still my biggest gripe though. I know you can increase the range of abilities, but that only partially fixes the problem. The cursor movement in this game needed a bit more love. The looks, sounds, and most of the voice acting were all great to experience if you just weren’t ripped back into reality when your cursor wouldn’t do something properly. Having the live action fights and a 3rd person shooter aspect were a nice way to change up the XCOM series.

Therefore, don't bother with lower difficulties since those don't give any incentive to playing the "commander role", because you can pretty much solo everything.\n\nThe story holds a major twist that's actually brilliant and excellently done with in my opinion, very, very good voice acting, and a nice '60s theme to pack everything into a nice, enjoyable package.\n\nIt gets repetitive after a while, because of low enemy variety, that's true : the game's biggest problem right there.\n\nAll in all, disregard the metascore and have fun.","September 23, 2015","true","33.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I quickly noticed it isn't worth more than $15 due to one main thing: the intelligence of your teammates. If it weren't for your teammates doing bonehead things often, like instead of, when ordered, relocating to behind a wall they go in front of it and get ♥♥♥♥ing shot down instantly, this game probably would have gotten much higher scores from critics. So far, in only the second mission that I have played, the sound glitched out half way through a mission and I could weirdly only hear a few sound effects and the sound kept doing a static glitch in and out that I have never heard before in a game. Even after restarting the game, the mission was still sound-bugged. Thankfully, the next two missions I did were not. The auto-save function during play is done kinda poorly. Whenever it autosaves, which is often, it does a hard lag-lock stutter for a second. Something else that is very annoying, sometimes my graphics settings revert back to default when I launch and I have to change them back and restart the game.\n\nThe Difficulty - There is no middle ground in the difficulty, there are four choices. It's like do I want to play just above noob mode or just below get murdered instantly mode? No medium difficulty is inexcusable in any game. especially this one, and here is why:\nYour ♥♥♥♥ing teammate AI is some of the dumbest AI I have ever seen in a game. On the 3rd difficulty, veteran, they just get downed instantly in fights forcing you to go pick them up and then YOU get downed. But you have no choice because if you lose a guy that is a high rank that you have been working on for a long time, he is gone for good. And even if you command them to go to a certain spot, they will still eventually randomly reposition, meaning they stand up and take massive dmg from enemy fire while taking the stupidest route possible to their next cover, ignoring the cover they could be using to get there. But this does not always happen, thankfully. If I had known that when your teammates die they are dead permanently, I would have seriously rethought buying this game. There is nothing on this earth more frustrating than losing something you worked hard for because of the AI being the dumbest AI I have seen in a very long time in a game. Why even have perma-death when it would be stupid to accept it when it is a far superior idea to just reload a checkpoint? The only way to combat this is by setting the difficulty to level 2 out of 4. If you tell your teammate to reposition, they do not always do it intelligently. I told my guy to move to a new spot and assumed he would use the provided cover, which there was plenty of, to work his way to the spot. No. He stood up and ran across the middle of the battlefield, took massive dmg, then was downed at his new spot instantly. Having literally no choice but to run and pick him up so he didn't die and I lose him for good, I ran to pick him up and was also downed because while reviving you are exposed, and it was mission fail, restart at checkpoint.\n\nTo be fair, playing on veteran mode is entirely possible, it is just not fun at all because of how the developers decided to make your teammates ♥♥♥♥ing stupid bags of sh-t. And when it is time to gear up before a mission, there is zero point whatsoever in taking more than two seconds to know what backpacks to have your teammates wear since they are stupid as f-ck and will be often taking dmg when they should not be: A PACK THAT REDUCES ALL ENEMY DMG like the Guardian Pack! The fact that they give you the option to give them other packs is a slap in the face when you can/should only choose the one I said. And their skill trees have choices, lol. Again, if you have any brains, you will choose the skills in their trees that are going to best help them survive longer, and if they have none of those, choose skills that aim to help support you in whatever way possible or get a different squad mate.\n\nBesides all of this ignorant programming done by blindfolded starved caged confused monkeys headbutting/jumping on typewriters, the game is actually really fun provided you are playing on "squaddie" difficulty and nothing higher, unless you are a pretentious liar who says "no man it's fine I enjoy it on the highest difficulty you just need to get better". Keep lying to yourself, queer.\n\nOn a more positive note, the whole idea of a 3rd person shooter in which you can at any time hit space bar and give orders to your teammates (which is the only thing that keeps them alive) and everyone has cool down timer skills is a great idea and when your teammates aren't doing stupid sh-t and ruining the fun, is a blast to play. When everything is going well, I find myself having a great time. The skills are cool and fun and the weapons are your standard fun fare, plus alien energy weapons which are cool and fun to use so far. It can sometimes depend on the situation, but if I had to give someone one tip about this game and one only, it would be take a short or mid-range gun like a assault rifle or shotgun, and ALWAYS keep a sniper rifle as your secondary weapon, especially if you are trying to play in veteran mode. Every head shot you can get with it, regardless of the mode you are in, is a precious thing that can turn a battle from total catastrophe and losing teammates, to a decisive victory. Yes, the sniper rifle is that important, provided you have good aim and get lucky and your dumb as rocks teammates haven’t gotten downed by the time you can snipe anything. Giving orders to your squad is very simple and intuitive and they perform what you want the first time, so no re-issuing orders are needed.\n\nThe sounds are great (minus the God awful glitch I encountered on only the second mission) and the graphics are above average, except when textures are still filling/popping in and it looks like minecraft for a few seconds. That does not happen often though, thankfully. The best part about the game are the effects which are done quite well. The mission structure and upgrade system is done well also.\n\nVerdict:\n\nBuy this on sale and only on sale for $15 or less. The single and only reason to avoid paying more than $15 is because the developers did not put enough care and time into making your teammates act intelligently. Instead, they are some of the dumbest AI teammates I have ever seen in a game. And that takes what could have easily been my score of 9/10 for this game and smashes it over the head with a bowling pin into a 6/10 like Daniel Plainview did to Eli at the end of the movie There Will Be Blood, which is what you will want to do to yourself after fussing about with your sub-human intelligence level AI teammates.","May 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a great, well-written story, taking place in a very detailed and atmospheric US 60's world. Even though at first the protagonists of the game seemed to be very clyche (the smoking, drinking, I-don't-give-a-♥♥♥♥ anti hero, the I-have-to-do-what-has-to-be-done commander, the ice queen female agent and, oh, don't forget the immigrated Nazi scientist), during the story they appear to be diverse and deep characters, with their own past, problems and motivations. Due to their interactions, the story holds some big surprises during the last third of the game...\n\nAnother big plus are the battles: All missions are unique, with scripted events, discoveries, ambushes, some horror atmosphere and a great design. I enjoyed them much more than the unpersonal, repeating missions of X:COM Enemey Within. Nevertheless, this is a subject to your own preferences. You also have to use a lot of tactic in this game, however, the action is much more intense, as your squad is right in the middle, while explosions, bullets and laser beams are flying right around you. The agents have interesting abilities, and even the developing super powers of the main protagonist are logicallay explained during the game.\n\nA lot of people critizise that the research part and the autopsies  are held very simple in the game. Well, you are playing a SENIOR AGENT, not the BASE COMMANDER, so personally I would have wondered if I would have decided what research comes next, which alien we will cut first wide open to look after his bowel and so on. Therefore, you can talk with the scientists in the lab about their progress, watch them testing and developing new weapons (with some hilarious scenes) and interogate an outsider personally, having the chance to build up some sort of personal relationship with him (or you can beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him).\n\nTo make a long story short: If you are looking for another turn-based X:COM strategy game, with all the typical elements of this series, like research, base building, autopsies, and all other base commander's responsibilities, you will not be happy with this game.\n\nBut if you want to enjoy the beginning of X:COM through the view of a senior agent, if you are happy to play through an intense and well-written story, if you want to interact with interesting characters and you like action, though tactical battles, and all that in a very authentic 60's setup, you really should give this game a try!","May 9, 2015","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is different to the other entries in the XCOM series in that the game does not play like an RTS game or feature an isometric view, and is instead played as a standard cover shooter with an over the shoulder view. Does this make it a good game? Yes.\nWhile hardcore fans will of XCOM will find this change of formula jarring, I personally found this formula to be a unique technique and a fresh flavour specific to the XCOM series. While the game plays a bit more like Mass Effect this time around (you can pause the game and command your team mates via a command screen, such as ordering them to move or use special abilities, etc) , it still feels like XCOM, as you still have to take strategic care in how you enter combat situations. I liked how you had to be strategic in how you placed your team mates, and how you must constantly adapt to combat as enemies flank you and draw you out of cover. This made for a tense and enjoyable gameplay experience, and is definitely a must on the harder difficulties. Unfortunately, the AI of your squadmates leaves a lot to be desired, and you will definitely get frustrated by their lack of competence.\nYou will also get frustrated by the generic and often boring characters as well as the lacklustre plotline; this is standard alien-invasion fare, and anyone else looking for a riveting science fiction story will need to look elsewhere. I rarely find moments of the plot interesting, except for the rare dialogue encounters with the aliens themselves, which were a joy to behold. However, none of the other characters offered much in the way of development and voice acting, and I found them bland and uninteresting.\nThe graphics are quite nice, and lots of love and care have been dedicated to the lighting and detailed environments in the game. Many of the details in this game are quite nice, and this game looks extremely good when cranked up to max settings whilst running on DX11.\nIn short? The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a unique yet unusual entry in the XCOM franchise, and is a reward to fans of tactical shooters in general. Despite the occassional stumble in gameplay, incompetent team-mate AI and a lacklustre story, The Bureau is a solid game and I recommend it highly despite its flaws. I give this game a 7.5 / 10.","January 8, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

I actually genuinely liked it. It isn't the best game I have ever played, but it is really well done.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics are incredible - character animations, locations design - everything works for the atmosphere. I just wish they added some elements destruction, such as destroying chairs and tables.\n\nThe game itself is third-person shooter with covers and tactical pause during which you can give orders to 2 your companions. There are different companion classes, and they have different skills. I constantly used such abilities as put the turret or use critical shot during my playthrough.\n\nThe story starts very slow, but closer to the end it runs so fast and is full or different twists and revelations. Sure, it has lots of cliches, but it isn't that bad. There are even three different endings depending on your choice.\n\nAll in all, the game is above mediocre thanks to very well done shooting and giving orders mechanics and thanks to great graphics. 7.5/10","February 9, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once I started play tho I was pleasantly surprised. The game is obviously very visually amazing but they didn't waste all their time on that and leave you with a shallow piece of crap.\n\nThe plot is very well written and engaging and better thought out, imo, than the one used for XCOM Enemy Unknown. While there is no grand strategy element to this, the way you handle your 3 man teams has an excellent amount of tactical play to it. The time dilation used keeps the game going but allows you a certain level of precision for giving orders and using special abilities.\n\nDespite the fact that the overall plot will remain the same, there are numerous choices within the game that will affect how events play out. This gives the game a surprising amount of replay value. I also recommend the Hangar 6 DLC which gives even more life to the game and fleshes out the story even more.","April 23, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do rec you play with a controller eg exbox, or emu pad, because it makes giving orders etc alot easier.\n\nthe missions are LONG, its been a while since i said that, a few of the missions have been 1hr to 2hrs long and that may throw off some people that want to sit and finish a game fast...but nothing is stopping them from saving and picking it up later, the world has interactive dialog, you may see a ? on the ground next to a body and get detail about it or comments.\n\nI say buy the game, i don't understand why it got a lower score other then sheep reviews or lame shallow people wanting a game they can beat and discard......but its  a rough gem, and if you overlook it's faults, and give it a chance it will grow on it, 4/5","April 25, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even on a PC with integrated Intel graphics, I have found this game to be engaging and fun. I like the 1960's graphic styling and in spite of the XCOM story now following the official storyline of XCOM, this did not hamper the game. The game's stop-action-tactical-adjust interface is very much like, "Mass Effect" and complements the, "Gears Of War" cover-to-cover, tactical shooting interface. Would have been nice if the alien weapons were different than your own; other than just being, "Lasers" but I don't find that to truly spoil the game. The weapon variety is good and again, I didn't find this to spoil the game. The CGI sequences look great, I enjoy the voice acting and the game overall feels fleshed out.

In traditional XCOM, the entire game is played from a tactical point of view, giving orders to a unit of soldiers fighting against the alien menace. In the Bureau, you play as the commander of a squad, participating in combat as well as using a pretty unique "Battle Focus" system to issue orders.\n\nThe actual issuing of orders is a bit tricky at times - the soldiers don't always do what you want them to do.  However, once you get used to the goofy little nuances, it easily becomes the most compelling and interesting feature of the game.\n\nA lot of people will tell you that this game isn't XCOM or it's some kind of abomination.  Those people are known as idiots.  This game was always intended to be a spinoff - If you're looking for something truer to the original experience, you're looking for XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  It has all the flavor and intrigue of XCOM, but again, it's a spinoff - it has a non-traditional gameplay style.\n\nIt's my opinion that this is good.

If you're looking for a turn based experiance of squad VS. mobs of alien hoards you may have come to the wrong game but...\n\nI really enjoyed The Bureau.  It might not be in the traditional spirit of previous Xcom games.. and feels like a mashup between Mass Effect and Gears Of Wars, but it really seemed to deliver.\n\nThe Burearu is a game about the struggle of a classy detective and his squadmates against inhuman odds.  The action is live and every order you make counts.  The combat is full of tension and adrenaline, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  If you're a fan of the Xcom lore and don't mind a deviation in gameplay style I'd definately recommend XCOM declassified.\n\nIf you are in it for the turn based mechanic however, I plead with you to wait for the next xcom title, as the active third person shooter gameplay may not be up your alley. It is quite polished and I can not think of a single complaint to make, but it does not follow the gameplay tradition of the games of the series that game before it.\n\nThat said, I have played all of The Bureau main campaign before writing this review (save for the post final boss content) and am 100% satisfied with the game save that I wish it was a little longer.","January 29, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Too bad we don't get to roam around in the hood for some time before the SHTF.\nStory fits into the ISO standard X-COM setting with an interesting twist and builds upon it well.\nLevel design is outstanding, both 1950s American towns, the XCOM base, outdoors and alien installations are nice to look at.\nMostly cons:\nIt is very obvious the script was re-written several times. Some dialogs contain references to things/events cut from the final game, some responses are out of place, and so on.\nThe dialog system is rough around the edges, facial animation is a decade behind the times, characters have one "talking" animation that just loops no matter what they say they're doing.\nSome logical errors that slipped past testing are remarkably game-breaking: for example, it is possible to call in artillery fire missions inside buildings, or underground, or off-world. Successfully. You can bomb the inside of a cave, the inside of an underground tunnel, or the 2nd floor of a building (while leaving the 1st and 3rd undisturbed).\nPathfinding could be better. At an occasion or five my squadmates got stuck in a corridor and wouldn't follow me. The engine teleports them to me after I get a certain distance ahead, but one time I had to fight a large battle alone, because my two agents were stuck in a cavern and I wasn't far enough to trigger the teleport reset.","July 17, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It begins as your standard cover based shooter, but once you've moved onto the first main operation, opens up quite a bit as you unlock new abilities for both yourself and your squad mates. In some early game operations you can still sit behind cover for most firefights and take potshots at enemies, but a) that's *really* boring and b) doesn't work on harder difficulties (I played on "hard," I guess, but there's still one difficulty above that).\n\nIn many of the later operations, enemies will flank your position, throw grenades to flush you out, or rush you head on with cloaked enemies and mutons with jetpacks. The fun (and frustration) comes from flanking enemies with your squad mates (giving you a damage bonus) and using their abilites to funnel enemies into your line of fire, but I found myself in many battles to constantly be waiting for my heal ability to be on cooldown, or running around reviving my squad who have run out of cover for no reason. The game doesn't seemingly give you the ability to "keep" your squad in certain positions; sure, you can order them around, but it always felt that once I moved far enough away (far enough being not very far) they would move out of cover and subsequently die, forcing me to take a ton of damage to revive them and waste my heal ability on myself.\n\nAll that aside (and despite some minor quirks I had with the controls) I enjoyed my time with it. It's no XCOM UFO Defense or even Enemy Unknown for that matter, but it offers enough challenge and tactical options to be worth one playthrough.","July 3, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was first announced as the way 2K was choosing to revive the X-Com franchise, a decision that was understandably received with a considerable amount of bafflement and ill will. Yes, people wanted a modern X-Com, but that meant a turn-based strategy game of research and tactical battles, not some shooter. The fact that, as shooters went, it actually looked pretty interesting and ambitious was largely lost in the outpouring of disgust over the brand they chose to attach to it. Then it faded from view, and in the meantime Firaxis' much more faithful franchise reboot was announced and even released before The Bureau came back into view, now branded with that name. Unfortunately, it was clear that some ambition had been lost along the way, and its development was revealed to have been troubled and fraught with drama. It came out to a general wave of indifference, and was promptly dismissed.\n\nHaving now completed it, I believe this indifference was unwarranted. It's true that it's not X-Com. And the game originally previewed might well have been a better one. But the end result is a rather enjoyable melding of squad tactics and quality shooting, with light RPG elements; attached to a fairly compelling scenario of apocalyptic alien assault. Both major and side missions have interesting things to show you, and reveal more about the nature and motivations of your foe, and there's even a pretty spiffy late game twist. And I really appreciated the sequences where you walk around the XCOM base between missions. The various people you can converse with are all fairly well drawn as characters, if not horribly deep, and there are additional story tidbits and several layers of ambient conversations and announcements throughout, changing after every major mission.\n\nMind you, it's not perfect, either. The notion that all of this is a secret that's been covered up for decades is, well, just not plausible at all, especially when the rest of the time they want to give you a sense of the appalling scale of events. Some of the conversations are a little prone to repetition. And there are some disappointing technical issues, some of which seem to be specific to AMD cards from what I've read, but others seem more generally problematic. I had severe framerate issues with either PhysX setting on and active (i.e. if I was around PhysXed cloth or effects), and on settings above Medium (at least in the DirectX 11 client), the shadows were prone to very distracting and glitchy flickering. I've also read some people have had issues with crashes, although I personally did not experience these.\n\nThe technical issues were pretty easy to work around, and if you're prepared to quietly ignore the premise that any of the game's events are covert, that's not the biggest deal in the world either. So I don't feel either of these things should put you off The Bureau. I quite enjoyed myself all the way to the end, and I would definitely recommend it.","July 27, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Everything was great and I go into details about certain things.\n\nThe game takes place, I believe, before Enemy Unknown, but either way you don't have to played and or beat it to get the story for this.  You fight aliens for the X-COM unit, the game is third person and while this is not a game where you can just run and gun I did not have a lot of trouble, I played on Easy though because its the first ever X-COM game I have played.  I can see how it will be a lot harder on higher difficulites.\n\nThe game looks great too, just for reference I only ran the DX11 version of the game, so I have no idea if the graphics are any different on whatever the normal setting is.  I also used controller support instead of mouse and keyboard.  There are a decent amount of side things to do while in your base and handling several Agents is fun too.  You can send teams out to some missions to get some kind of reward, I never lost a person while doing them but I reached or went above the threat number for the mission.  There are also side opperations you can do too.\n\nThe story is very good and has some really good twists in it, and let me say, because I missed one, always explore the base and do all the side investigations if you want all the rewards and side missions from them.  I beat the game in about 12 hours so it is not very long game, but longer than most third person games I have played and I plan to get the DLC missions to play at some point in the future.\nAlso I ran across no bugs, or crashes when I played the game.\n4/5","July 20, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/65930/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","I tried this game at a friends for a couple of hours, loved it, then bought it. I quickly noticed it isn't worth more than $15 due to one main thing: the intelligence of your teammates. If it weren't for your teammates doing bonehead things often, like instead of, when ordered, relocating to behind a wall they go in front of it and get ♥♥♥♥ing shot down instantly, this game probably would have gotten much higher scores from critics. So far, in only the second mission that I have played, the sound glitched out half way through a mission and I could weirdly only hear a few sound effects and the sound kept doing a static glitch in and out that I have never heard before in a game. Even after restarting the game, the mission was still sound-bugged. Thankfully, the next two missions I did were not. The auto-save function during play is done kinda poorly. Whenever it autosaves, which is often, it does a hard lag-lock stutter for a second. Something else that is very annoying, sometimes my graphics settings revert back to default when I launch and I have to change them back and restart the game.\n\nThe Difficulty - There is no middle ground in the difficulty, there are four choices. It's like do I want to play just above noob mode or just below get murdered instantly mode? No medium difficulty is inexcusable in any game. especially this one, and here is why:\nYour ♥♥♥♥ing teammate AI is some of the dumbest AI I have ever seen in a game. On the 3rd difficulty, veteran, they just get downed instantly in fights forcing you to go pick them up and then YOU get downed. But you have no choice because if you lose a guy that is a high rank that you have been working on for a long time, he is gone for good. And even if you command them to go to a certain spot, they will still eventually randomly reposition, meaning they stand up and take massive dmg from enemy fire while taking the stupidest route possible to their next cover, ignoring the cover they could be using to get there. But this does not always happen, thankfully. If I had known that when your teammates die they are dead permanently, I would have seriously rethought buying this game. There is nothing on this earth more frustrating than losing something you worked hard for because of the AI being the dumbest AI I have seen in a very long time in a game. Why even have perma-death when it would be stupid to accept it when it is a far superior idea to just reload a checkpoint? The only way to combat this is by setting the difficulty to level 2 out of 4. If you tell your teammate to reposition, they do not always do it intelligently. I told my guy to move to a new spot and assumed he would use the provided cover, which there was plenty of, to work his way to the spot. No. He stood up and ran across the middle of the battlefield, took massive dmg, then was downed at his new spot instantly. Having literally no choice but to run and pick him up so he didn't die and I lose him for good, I ran to pick him up and was also downed because while reviving you are exposed, and it was mission fail, restart at checkpoint.\n\nTo be fair, playing on veteran mode is entirely possible, it is just not fun at all because of how the developers decided to make your teammates ♥♥♥♥ing stupid bags of sh-t. And when it is time to gear up before a mission, there is zero point whatsoever in taking more than two seconds to know what backpacks to have your teammates wear since they are stupid as f-ck and will be often taking dmg when they should not be: A PACK THAT REDUCES ALL ENEMY DMG like the Guardian Pack! The fact that they give you the option to give them other packs is a slap in the face when you can/should only choose the one I said. And their skill trees have choices, lol. Again, if you have any brains, you will choose the skills in their trees that are going to best help them survive longer, and if they have none of those, choose skills that aim to help support you in whatever way possible or get a different squad mate.\n\nBesides all of this ignorant programming done by blindfolded starved caged confused monkeys headbutting/jumping on typewriters, the game is actually really fun provided you are playing on "squaddie" difficulty and nothing higher, unless you are a pretentious liar who says "no man it's fine I enjoy it on the highest difficulty you just need to get better". Keep lying to yourself, queer.\n\nOn a more positive note, the whole idea of a 3rd person shooter in which you can at any time hit space bar and give orders to your teammates (which is the only thing that keeps them alive) and everyone has cool down timer skills is a great idea and when your teammates aren't doing stupid sh-t and ruining the fun, is a blast to play. When everything is going well, I find myself having a great time. The skills are cool and fun and the weapons are your standard fun fare, plus alien energy weapons which are cool and fun to use so far. It can sometimes depend on the situation, but if I had to give someone one tip about this game and one only, it would be take a short or mid-range gun like a assault rifle or shotgun, and ALWAYS keep a sniper rifle as your secondary weapon, especially if you are trying to play in veteran mode. Every head shot you can get with it, regardless of the mode you are in, is a precious thing that can turn a battle from total catastrophe and losing teammates, to a decisive victory. Yes, the sniper rifle is that important, provided you have good aim and get lucky and your dumb as rocks teammates haven’t gotten downed by the time you can snipe anything. Giving orders to your squad is very simple and intuitive and they perform what you want the first time, so no re-issuing orders are needed.\n\nThe sounds are great (minus the God awful glitch I encountered on only the second mission) and the graphics are above average, except when textures are still filling/popping in and it looks like minecraft for a few seconds. That does not happen often though, thankfully. The best part about the game are the effects which are done quite well. The mission structure and upgrade system is done well also.\n\nVerdict:\n\nBuy this on sale and only on sale for $15 or less. The single and only reason to avoid paying more than $15 is because the developers did not put enough care and time into making your teammates act intelligently. Instead, they are some of the dumbest AI teammates I have ever seen in a game. And that takes what could have easily been my score of 9/10 for this game and smashes it over the head with a bowling pin into a 6/10 like Daniel Plainview did to Eli at the end of the movie There Will Be Blood, which is what you will want to do to yourself after fussing about with your sub-human intelligence level AI teammates.","May 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a great, well-written story, taking place in a very detailed and atmospheric US 60's world. Even though at first the protagonists of the game seemed to be very clyche (the smoking, drinking, I-don't-give-a-♥♥♥♥ anti hero, the I-have-to-do-what-has-to-be-done commander, the ice queen female agent and, oh, don't forget the immigrated Nazi scientist), during the story they appear to be diverse and deep characters, with their own past, problems and motivations. Due to their interactions, the story holds some big surprises during the last third of the game...\n\nAnother big plus are the battles: All missions are unique, with scripted events, discoveries, ambushes, some horror atmosphere and a great design. I enjoyed them much more than the unpersonal, repeating missions of X:COM Enemey Within. Nevertheless, this is a subject to your own preferences. You also have to use a lot of tactic in this game, however, the action is much more intense, as your squad is right in the middle, while explosions, bullets and laser beams are flying right around you. The agents have interesting abilities, and even the developing super powers of the main protagonist are logicallay explained during the game.\n\nA lot of people critizise that the research part and the autopsies  are held very simple in the game. Well, you are playing a SENIOR AGENT, not the BASE COMMANDER, so personally I would have wondered if I would have decided what research comes next, which alien we will cut first wide open to look after his bowel and so on. Therefore, you can talk with the scientists in the lab about their progress, watch them testing and developing new weapons (with some hilarious scenes) and interogate an outsider personally, having the chance to build up some sort of personal relationship with him (or you can beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him).\n\nTo make a long story short: If you are looking for another turn-based X:COM strategy game, with all the typical elements of this series, like research, base building, autopsies, and all other base commander's responsibilities, you will not be happy with this game.\n\nBut if you want to enjoy the beginning of X:COM through the view of a senior agent, if you are happy to play through an intense and well-written story, if you want to interact with interesting characters and you like action, though tactical battles, and all that in a very authentic 60's setup, you really should give this game a try!","May 9, 2015","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Peeking over the edge, they get a view of the alien patrols that wander the Small Town, USA street – the tiny squad of three is easily outnumbered five to one.\n\nThese odds aren't anything new, though.\n\nTimes slows down as William Carter, the commander of the mission, whispers his commands. "Spread out. Take flanking positions." He has one soldier throw out a turret on that side of the street to flush the outsiders out of cover. The other, armed with a sniper rifle, he has targeted an opposing sniper on the far end of the street. ommands given, Carter targets a shielded unit mid-street, and using some advanced technology strapped to his wrist, plans to lift him up into the air to be used as target practice.\n\nTime returns to normal, and in unison, the squad moves and begins their planned attack.\n\n\nThe outsiders don't stand a chance.\n\n"The Bureau" is the latest addition to the XCOM series of strategy-based, humans vs. aliens games. What separates "The Bureau" from most of the other games in the popular series is how it puts you on the ground with your squad as an individual, rather than a commander seeing everything from above. You're given a third-person perspective of the battlefield, and you're allowed to move around freely like in any other shooter. Unlike any other shooter, however, you're also given the responsibility of giving commands to your squad, lest they stand behind cover and take badly aimed pot-shots at the enemy until the End of Time.\n\nThat responsibility to command your squad is what makes "The Bureau" an irrefutable part of the "XCOM" series and is also one of the more frustrating functions of the game. "The Bureau" is not a turn-based game. You aren't able to stop the time once a mission begins, which makes timing squad commands a very difficult thing to manage, especially in the middle of a particularly rough firefight. As a bit of an aid to the player, time does slow down when Carter goes into "command mode," but it doesn't ever seem to be slow enough. Without the top-down view of the battlefield, it's much tougher to send your squad to the exact area that you need, which I suppose is more realistic given your on-the-ground commander perspective of the game, but it also occasionally leaves the player sending his squad to locations where they stand idiotically next to cover and get riddled with laser fire.\n\nFor that reason, the game really does reward the player for being strategic and patient during the fights in the game. The only problem with that is that the fights start becoming really predictable. You'll be traveling through war-torn America and turn down a street with a view of the road covered with rows of flipped cars and boxes and other types of cover. And suddenly, aliens appear and start running at you!\n\n\nThat is how each mission basically goes. You walk around, have two to three fights in carefully prepared battlefields, and then you win. Occasionally, they throw a new enemy at you or some reinforcements drop down in a flanking position so you have to rethink your strategy, but it's never horribly difficult to get yourself out of those situations.\n\n\nIf there was ever a reason that I lost a battle, it was because I made a mistake trying to rush through it. A lot of fights feel exactly like the last fight, and you end up just wanting to get through them to get to the other side.\n\nThere is the RPG element to the game, which is very similar to what was seen in "Enemy Unknown." There are various squad classes, and each one has a skill tree they are able to climb up to get new abilities. That tree is very small however, so the decision process is kind of underwhelming, and any strategy you have during character advancement is rather limited.\n\nLike in "Enemy Unknown," you have the ability to customize your squad mates when you hire them, which is a feature I really like in games like this. I love building up teams based on my real-life friends, and I do it every time a game gives me the chance. Typically, those characters are always the first to die, but I still try to do it. I always get attached fastest to characters that I'm able to create, and that bond to to your squad is a key part of the "XCOM" games. The player is able to customize a lot about their squaddies, down to the color of their tie in the suit that they wear into battle. The one thing they can't change is gender. "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified" is a boy's only club, which I suppose goes with the atmosphere of the era the game is set in; just about everything was a boys only club in that time. There is a female NPC character that occasionally helps Carter in battles, so the potential for female teammates was there, but the players just don't get to have access to it. I guess we'll just have to chalk it up to adorable/nostalgic 1960's sexism.\n\n\nOne of the things that I found cool and amusing about "The Bureau" is what the typical "XCOM" squad wears into battle. They don't rely on kevlar or any kind of body armor. They go out in their suits. Sure, some do wear camouflage, but most of the squad classes are dressed to the nines for their battle against invaders from space. Agent Carter goes between being dressed like he's a character in "Mad Men" to looking like a twin of Sterling Archer (black turtleneck and all). The "XCOM" squad, Earth's only defense against complete and utter annihilation at the end of super advanced aliens, has never looked as good as they look in "The Bureau."\n\nThe story of "The Bureau" starts off as nothing special. Earth gets attacked by an alien force, the military is destroyed, and it comes to the brand new XCOM team to overcome this threat. You do all the cliche things that a team working as Earth's last hope would do. You rescue the guy that's an expert in the alien technology. You do your best to save civilian populations. You capture a live outsider. And eventually, use their own technology against them to do an "Independence-Day-Shut-Down-Everything" type of mission. It's really standard stuff with completely average voice-acting carrying you through it all.\n\nThat said, there are a couple redeeming things about the story. You encounter the first pretty early on - a mysterious virus from the outsiders that infects civilians population and turns them into "Sleepwalkers." They ooze black stuff from their eyes and just walk around in circles repeating whatever it was the last thing they were doing before the ailment completely took hold. They don't attack you; they just continuously mutter their "last words" and walk around aimlessly. It creates a lot of creepy atmosphere in the destroyed American towns in which most of the game's missions take place.\n\n\nIn the final act of the game, the story veers dramatically off the path of the predictable and does some crazy stuff that I did not expect. I won't go into it to avoid spoilers, but it's an alright twist with multiple possible endings.\n\nI played through "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified" trying really hard to like it. It was interesting at first, but the average story and clunky game play really strayed from what I loved so much about "Enemy Unknown." This newest addition to the "XCOM" series was definitely a risk by developer 2k Marin, especially with the fantastic and immensely popular formula for "Enemy Unknown" sitting right there, and I'm not sure that risk paid off. "The Bureau" just isn't a very interesting game in comparison. It has its moments for sure, but those moments are fleeting and in the end, they're not really memorable. If you're a fan of the "XCOM" series, you probably shouldn't miss what "The Bureau" adds to the series, but if you're looking for something as strategic and difficult as "Enemy Unknown," you're going to be disappointed.\n\nBut at least you'll be dressed well.\n\n\n6/10","March 25, 2014","true","22.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Massive_Backlog/recommended/65930/","Massive_Backlog","Massive Backlog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Massive_Backlog/","516 products in account","I followed the wandering development of The Bureau: Xcom Declassified for a number of years. Patiently I observed as it transitioned from FPS to 3rd person hoping that it would not suffer in it’s long development cycle. I’m sorry to say that despite some rather nice visuals it suffers from serious design bloat. As teams changed, development laboured and it seems as they moved onward they continuing to tack on new fresh ideas. Perhaps this was done to show progression and relevancy for upper management. But it comes across as a series of continuously muddled concepts that were never truly flushed out.\n\nCombat jumps between uninspired to slightly broken. Agents can take shots through some obstacles or take excessive damage sitting flush against walls. The sparks of laserfire can be seen clipping through various barriers and my snipers can shoot through several layers of walls. Grenades are a bit off. The enemies can seem to toss them across the stage while my weak human arms can only lobe a grenade a few feet further than a effective shotgun blast. I bet the enemies can lobe grenades a bit further if they were to throw them towards me. Rather they throw the grenade upwards and vaguely in my direction. I’ve been counting the number of seconds from when a enemy throws a grenade and when it lands on my feet. On average I’m aware of a grenade is on it’s way for 4-6 seconds. Then another 4-5 seconds before it detonation I could be half way across the map before it goes off. Not a very effective weapon, at least for them.\n\nSpeaking of ineffective you learn quickly that as your allies are made of paper and the close combat of the shotgun, and alien equivalent shotgun are the most useless weapons in the game and I can not think of a single instance where close combat would be recommend unless you want to kill you allies. But they seem to do that quite well on their own. They are eager to jump into the action early in the game, but while I enjoy their eagerness to prove who can go down in a fight the fastest its recommend you keep them out of harms way until they prove themselves to be useful in a couple of levels.\n\nAlthough being a powerhouse can be fun overtime the missions are tedious. Pop all skills and target the biggest enemy. Rinse and repeat. It's rare to jump between cover with a few expections during the last few missions. Other than a single boss battle all combat mission play out the same. The variety of enemy types is varied but can nearly all be destroyed with the same tactics again and again. But enough about the combat because that’s the best part of the game. While it’s a bit too easy, too-linear, and mostly uninhabited "hot" zones  there are far worse offenders.\n\nIn the brilliant 2012 X-Com the time spent at your bunker was filled with activities to improve all your stats build new areas etc...Let’s not dwell too long in comparisons as it’s simply not fair. The return to your bunker goes between serviceable to unbearable. The conversations you have with the members of X:Com are done with dialog trees. Perhaps showing it’s influence from mass effect a bit too much! But the conversations are pointless. Full of false choices or at their best tedium to unlock a extra mission you can’t participate in. The nuggets exploring this area are banal conversations, in-active NPC’s & and fetch quests. Most of them can be skipped or simply forgotten. Some of these conversations will lead you to a mini game where you scan an area by holding L (360 controller) where you can see objects that need your attention a-la detective mode. These seem totally optional and only open paths for your extra team mates to go explore and level while you are following the main story.\n\nFrankly I’m having an ok time with it. I don’t want to throw it under the bus, it’s pretty boring outside of combat and after you get a few levels on yourself and your team mates it simply becomes a slaughter fest where nothing can harm you. I highly doubt we will hear about this franchise again and it’s a shame because at it’s best you can see what it could've been. It takes too much inspiration from better games and does not improve on them. It's a project that just needed to get out the door. Too much time, money and engery was spent re-hashing a collection of mechanices, techniques, artistic approaches over year to simply have them all go to waste. At least it was released and we'll never have to wonder, "what -if?"\n\n5.5/10\n\nRecommend by if it's on sale. I'd kick myself for spending more than $20.","December 29, 2013","true","18.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Peeking over the edge, they get a view of the alien patrols that wander the Small Town, USA street – the tiny squad of three is easily outnumbered five to one.\n\nThese odds aren't anything new, though.\n\nTimes slows down as William Carter, the commander of the mission, whispers his commands. "Spread out. Take flanking positions." He has one soldier throw out a turret on that side of the street to flush the outsiders out of cover. The other, armed with a sniper rifle, he has targeted an opposing sniper on the far end of the street. ommands given, Carter targets a shielded unit mid-street, and using some advanced technology strapped to his wrist, plans to lift him up into the air to be used as target practice.\n\nTime returns to normal, and in unison, the squad moves and begins their planned attack.\n\n\nThe outsiders don't stand a chance.\n\n"The Bureau" is the latest addition to the XCOM series of strategy-based, humans vs. aliens games. What separates "The Bureau" from most of the other games in the popular series is how it puts you on the ground with your squad as an individual, rather than a commander seeing everything from above. You're given a third-person perspective of the battlefield, and you're allowed to move around freely like in any other shooter. Unlike any other shooter, however, you're also given the responsibility of giving commands to your squad, lest they stand behind cover and take badly aimed pot-shots at the enemy until the End of Time.\n\nThat responsibility to command your squad is what makes "The Bureau" an irrefutable part of the "XCOM" series and is also one of the more frustrating functions of the game. "The Bureau" is not a turn-based game. You aren't able to stop the time once a mission begins, which makes timing squad commands a very difficult thing to manage, especially in the middle of a particularly rough firefight. As a bit of an aid to the player, time does slow down when Carter goes into "command mode," but it doesn't ever seem to be slow enough. Without the top-down view of the battlefield, it's much tougher to send your squad to the exact area that you need, which I suppose is more realistic given your on-the-ground commander perspective of the game, but it also occasionally leaves the player sending his squad to locations where they stand idiotically next to cover and get riddled with laser fire.\n\nFor that reason, the game really does reward the player for being strategic and patient during the fights in the game. The only problem with that is that the fights start becoming really predictable. You'll be traveling through war-torn America and turn down a street with a view of the road covered with rows of flipped cars and boxes and other types of cover. And suddenly, aliens appear and start running at you!\n\n\nThat is how each mission basically goes. You walk around, have two to three fights in carefully prepared battlefields, and then you win. Occasionally, they throw a new enemy at you or some reinforcements drop down in a flanking position so you have to rethink your strategy, but it's never horribly difficult to get yourself out of those situations.\n\n\nIf there was ever a reason that I lost a battle, it was because I made a mistake trying to rush through it. A lot of fights feel exactly like the last fight, and you end up just wanting to get through them to get to the other side.\n\nThere is the RPG element to the game, which is very similar to what was seen in "Enemy Unknown." There are various squad classes, and each one has a skill tree they are able to climb up to get new abilities. That tree is very small however, so the decision process is kind of underwhelming, and any strategy you have during character advancement is rather limited.\n\nLike in "Enemy Unknown," you have the ability to customize your squad mates when you hire them, which is a feature I really like in games like this. I love building up teams based on my real-life friends, and I do it every time a game gives me the chance. Typically, those characters are always the first to die, but I still try to do it. I always get attached fastest to characters that I'm able to create, and that bond to to your squad is a key part of the "XCOM" games. The player is able to customize a lot about their squaddies, down to the color of their tie in the suit that they wear into battle. The one thing they can't change is gender. "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified" is a boy's only club, which I suppose goes with the atmosphere of the era the game is set in; just about everything was a boys only club in that time.

Xcom is mainstreaming and it works rather well: decisions are now made in real time (with a Max Payne like slow mo break when you are commanding your other troops), and you can control 'Carter', the hero, like in any third person shooter. The beginning of the adventure is impressive, going around in the 60s USA under an alien invasion brings back some proper 2K Nostalgia with touches of steampunk (telekinesis, and tesla rifles) but eventually gameplay becomes repetitive as there is no progression like in the first game. Your soldiers only have 5 ranks (but the new turret throwing engineer category is cool) and the levels are totally linear. You just push through with your 3 man team (you can't make it bigger later in the game - even if some NPC do join on certain missions) and there is very little strategy involved. It's probably worth playing on veteran at least for more of a challenge. All in all there are about 20 missions (around a dozen 1-2h major ones and a few 15min minor ones), so it's basically half the gameplay time of the original.

Don't rush the games out of production to make a buck.... video game designing is art and so time should be taken so that it can be finished and polished instead assemble line production. My other issues with the game is that they changed the appearances of the aliens so that they are not recognizable from the turned based xcom game this game is derived from, which is a very good game. Also they changed the storyline from the turned based game, storyline also seemed a bit confusing at times ... very much despise the dialog and having to continually run around the base chatting with people for information as in mass effect 3 which made the game terrible in my opinion. Starts to feel like your playing a soap opera or something ....\n\nok ok... so i like the managing and all but this game could have been so much better if they made it more like turned based game this is derived from. Its an alright shooter especially now that its on deal with steam but its overall a bit of a disappointment but I very much recomment the turn based enemy unknown excom game.","March 29, 2014","false","144.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And the easiest way to do it was to quit playing that game, as this way the aliens win and my stupid comrades all die like they should. Dumbest. AI. Ever.

The AI ruins what could have been a fun Tactical Squad-Based Third-Person Shooter... Which is too bad since the squad AI can actually kill enemies unlike most other squad-based games as of late so they actually contribute to combat... but at the same time? They do detract by being idiots whom if you don't give move orders will usually stick too close to the player and not run from grenades which enemies use quite a bit...\n\nNow that I've mentioned the major weakness of the game? I'll talk about the strength which is the visuals... and wow are they good! Just look at the screenshots even. The Art, 3D modeling and mapping department definitely did their job on this game. The use of Unreal Engine 3 shines with Direct3D 11 goodness to show off the visuals of the game. The only thing that could have made this game better is better Anti-Aliasing.. I have the ingame Anti-Aliasing set to "High" which is the highest setting yet there's still quite a lot of pixelation. My guess is they used FXAA which doesn't compare to proper Multisampling Anti-Aliasing of times past.\n\nVoice acting is also pretty good. Varied cast and decent attention to detail helps add to the game as I felt like the voice actors actually game a damn about the lines they were reading.\n\nThe storyline is also pretty decent about how the aliens invaded and how you're fighting to gain their technology to combat them with and that makes this game feel like a good spin off of X-COM... and it would have been if the damn AI wasn't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Whomever worked on the AI coding of this game sadly let down the rest of the team since this is a singleplayer game thus AI is extremely important... maybe they needed more time or more staff dedicated to making the AI better?

You play as Agent Carter, an anti-hero with a dark past as he recruited by a shadowy general - with more secrets than him - into the top secret XCOM programme. From there Carter and his squad launch a desperate guerilla war against the invaders.\n\nXCOM Declassified utilises a third-person perspective with standard controls but differentiates when it allows you to lead a squad tactically and thoroughly - much like XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\nBut that, and the lore, are where the similarities end.\nThis game is demanding and requires tactical awareness at all times, it is not turn based and you must rely on checkpoints (which I personally don't like).\nIt gives you a massive degree of control over the battlefield and (with the ability to choose your character lines) parts of the - very engaging - storyline.\nThe commands are difficult to learn but once you've got it, it opens up a world of opportunities.\nThat method didn't work? Make him do that while he flanks and you provide cover.\n\nAs for graphics, they're typical and reminiscent of ye-olde times (okay, 50 years ago) but that's not a bad thing. The sound quality is good with an original dynamic soundtrack.\nI've had no problems with my low-end rig so I expect it to be a good edition to your library.\n\nI recommend this game for quick, tactical thinkers.

Still quite fun to play and I'm glad to see this franchise up and kicking again, even when trying something in a new direciton.\n\n- Some key points in the story/rules seem left out or glossed over.

Combat functions like Mass Effect, accept your team will run head first into lazer machine gun fire. They will also occasionally watch you die, its a bit.... infuriating. Near the very end, just before the last mission. Your main character is taken away from you and you get to pick between an old doctor and a virtually unknown female agent, you've had five conversations with this female agent. Anyway the game drags on well past the point it should have ended. the real issue is the meaningless mission between story missions.

The keyboard/mouse controls are the worst I have ever seen in a PC game.  It's like trying to play Beethoven's 5th Symphony on the piano when you've never had a piano lesson. (It can be done but not by many.)\n\nIf you don't press the correct sequence of movement keys (W,LShift, LShift, for example) you can't do anything (shoot, move, command others). You just stand there getting killed while you try to figure out what keys you are supposed to press that will unfreeze you. Tool tips and commentary appear in various areas of the screen so you don't reallly know where to look. The tutorial, such as it is, flashes by the screen so quickly you often miss the instructions.\n\nPerhaps it plays better if you connect a game pad to your PC... I don't know because I don't use a game pad.\n\nThe story line is decent. For a TPS game the field of view is very limited and, once again, the keyboard controls are an abortion. On top of all of that, even when you do get the right key sequence, the game software is VERY slow to respond (I have an i5 quad core and an Nvidia GTX750, so I don't think it's my gear).\n\nAmbitious project.

All of the combat is cover-based third-person shooter, and real time apart from the time-slowing assess mode which allows you to give commands to your 2 squadmates, and carefully select combat skills. I liken the combat greatly to Mass Effect, decidedly more clunky, and with an oddly bloated crosshair -- as if UI designers expected I'll forget where my gun is pointing.\n\nFrom a franchise and lore point of view, the game takes place during the Cold War with a "Noir" theme, harkening back known alien scum like the sectoids and mutons (which are actually scary to fight now, especially on a higher difficulty) and brings forth some new flavors, including a new take on the squaddie-slaying Sectopod. However, being put into the odd "shadow war" that they are is a bit lop-sided and obviously noncanonical in comparison to the other XCOM games where invasion is clearly apparent, and you are the first and last line of Earth's defense. Technological advances are also not particularly as "exciting" and the taken-for-granted nature of them from first mission of the game and there on breaks the "immersing" factor of getting new toys.\n\nTwo very specific peeves of mine are;\n1. There is no manual saving. You hop between checkpoints throughout the entire game, and this harms the unpremeditated whims of playing it. This can also lead to going through cut scenes, dialogue, and entire "homebase intervals" than you already just went through.\n2. Squadmates are finicky in cases, with AI that needs to be babysat routinely. They do not comprehend the sense of not poking their head out while under enemy suppression (which can lead to them quickly losing non-regenerable health), they do not use their skills of their own accord (yet perhaps for the better with their AI), and in my experience, have occasionally "forgot" orders to hold ground while I'm trying to cover their flank, and are very dodgey with taking out targets you mark them to attack.\n\nI intend to still play it now and then, because it has a few elements from Mass Effect that I enjoy (including dialogue wheels) but I'd never recommend it to someone who is a fan of other XCOM games.","May 29, 2015","false","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am not certain why this game has negative reviews but I am thinking it is because it is so different from the other games in the series - if you can look past that you may find a very fun game waiting for you to play. This is an action tactical game where you and two squadmates take on the enemy and you have to postion your men and yourself in order to achieve victory.

It's a good  game, good bit of fun alternate history however it does contain a few problems. Namely, an issue with a lot of games where it gives you command over a squad, is the AI squad. The game gives you full control over two teammates, little good that is as they don't listen to you... at all. It's like leading the two blind mice (it would've been the three blind mice but the third one didn't listen to what he was told and died.). You can give a move command and he'll move there but only for a short period of time and then decide it's time to rush the enemy that's the size of The Hulk. You tell them to attack a specific enemy but as they are in fact, the blind mice, they start to shoot at a completely different enemy. You can even have them flank the enemy, getting the perfect angle and shot onto the unknowing little alien but they'll still miss or fire in short enough bursts that a turtle could evade them. So you pretty much end up doing everything yourself and just using your teammates abilities, if they haven't died from trying to scare the enemy away by running really fast at them that is.\nAnother issue is how they throw massive enemies at you without telling you anything about them, little hints or giving you appropriate weaponry to defeat them. I remember the first time they threw an enemy gunship at me and expected me to take it down with a rifle. I think it's rather obvious to say that it took a while.\nOther than those two points which do continuously get really rather annoying it is an alright game. I haven't played the original XCOM games so I have nothing to compare it to or moan about as "It's not like the originals" or whatever so yeah. Good game, awful teammates. Buy this game, Or don't. Whatever. It's your money. Make your own decisions. You'll never get far in life looking for some random persons approval.","October 12, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/recommended/65930/","ANCRON","ANCRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/","352 products in account","3rd person, squad based, action, tactical shooter versus aliens. This game is about Alien invasion on a late 1900's Earth. You play as a XCOM Agent, carefully selected people who were professionals in their field of work, before joining the The Bureau. Be it in CIA, FBI, NSA and other agencies.\n\nXCOM is a secret US government facility, made to counter invasion attempts on US soil. Game has really good story but a bit not realistic with all the "borrowing alien technology" aspect. World art style is mix of 1950-1970's retro and futuristic alien sci-fi elements.\n\nThere are many weapons in the game, from WWII pistols, rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades to sci-fi alien weapons, that share similar concepts (plasma pistols, plasma rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc.). All alien weapons are energy based, with their own ammunition.\n\nYou can recruit different types of soldier classes, that are experts in their field of combat. Be it simple engineer, that can deploy turrets, sniper that can deal heavy damage from range, commando who can absorb damage and taunt enemies, or support class that can boost your squads damage, increase survivability, etc.\n\nEach class has their own skill tree, abilities and weapon preferences. One is good at range, other can survive a lot of punishment, third can manipulate the battlefield to your advantage, etc.. Personal and squad abilities can be chained from tactical "Focus" mode, you can very easily position your soldiers, order them to focus one target, revive injured ally.\n\nAI is very good and will often flank you, flush you out of cover and rush up on you, depending on what alien unit it is. Game environment and level design is great, with a lot of room for flanking and surprise attacks. Enemy variation is also good, with close range, long range units mixed with air and stealth units.\n\nGame is somewhat similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown in some aspects. You control, improve, gear up your squad, send them on rescue, Intel missions or accompany them on more harder side missions apart from main story missions. You can recruit only male soldiers for your squad, if someone wanted females, it's not possible. Sadly you don't research alien technology yourself, or make items, those are automatically managed by game and XCOM Agency itself.\n\nGame has a lot of character dialogues, with choice and effect, consequence system. Voice acting is good, texture quality and visuals are good, character control and animations were decent. Game is about 15 hours long and was a blast to playthrough. It's not as punishing as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, being a shooter, game is fairly forgiving and there's a lot of room for personal error, compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nGame was very fun and enjoyable.","January 9","true","14.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love how it blends the aspects of the new game with an FPS. Its very seemless and the story blends well with it. Unlike XCOM enemy within, you dont miss at 5 feet with a shotgun. If you miss its cause you didnt aim properly. It FEELS like it was you who messed up the shot not some random statistic formula. I say this is an underated gem that just wasnt received well because it wasnt turn based strategy like all the other games before it. This is one of the few times developers took a game in a new direction and improoved it.\n\nIm sure the hardcore XCOM fans may not care but this game is good enough to stand by itself.

Sniper rifles are not inherently OP, nor is the rocket launcher, nor is the pistol or any other weapon, everything had a time and a place to use them.\n\nBackpacks\nGrant various perks to different aspects of your character, some will fit your play style some won't, over all allows for a lot of different strategies to consider.\n\nSquads\nChoose from among 4 different class types to bring into battle with you.  Mix and match the strategies and abilities of various classes for good combination, EG: use the commando to taunt a dude, making the guy think its a clever idea to run over a mine your engineer placed.\n\nStory\nOverall pretty good, gives you an inside look of what it is like to be one of the poor soldiers who you command during other XCOM games.  The story is a bit linear, but it does have some small side quests, side missions, and various dialogue options to let you flush out the world and gain a better understanding.  Some choices you make do have consequences which change the way the game carries out.\n\nWasn't the best game ever but it was pretty solid and I enjoyed playing it, definitely worth the money.\n","January 19","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Xcom is mainstreaming and it works rather well: decisions are now made in real time (with a Max Payne like slow mo break when you are commanding your other troops), and you can control 'Carter', the hero, like in any third person shooter. The beginning of the adventure is impressive, going around in the 60s USA under an alien invasion brings back some proper 2K Nostalgia with touches of steampunk (telekinesis, and tesla rifles) but eventually gameplay becomes repetitive as there is no progression like in the first game. Your soldiers only have 5 ranks (but the new turret throwing engineer category is cool) and the levels are totally linear. You just push through with your 3 man team (you can't make it bigger later in the game - even if some NPC do join on certain missions) and there is very little strategy involved. It's probably worth playing on veteran at least for more of a challenge. All in all there are about 20 missions (around a dozen 1-2h major ones and a few 15min minor ones), so it's basically half the gameplay time of the original. The story and dialogue are rather good and the new outsiders with vertical mouths are fun to chat with.

And when you place them in cover, they left it to run straight into the enemy and get massacred. Then *YOU* have to run straight into the enemy to save them. Boring.\n\nSo I tried to left them behind (by ordering them to move to a very very very distant point out of the shooting) and play things solo. Worked well untill they decided to run back to me and ruin my fun. Really boring\n\nThen I went "oh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I wanna shoot stuff". So I decide to let them die because those fully grown up men need help even to clean their asses - and I don't take enjoyment on cleaning people's asses. It wasn't long till I had only 2 guys left besides me. And it wasn't even longer when one of them decided to commit suicide. "Great", I thought to meself, "when the last guy decide to suicide I'll finally be able to play in peace!" NOPE. As soon as there's only one guy and me, game prompts a message "You have only one person on your squad, if he dies it's game over" or something along those lines\n\nWait, what!? Now I'm the guy's mommy? And here I thought having kids were a choice...\n\nOK, then...so kids are not a choice and now I have one...*sigh*. Then I go into a mission  with only 50 bullets in my gun (plus 10 bullets on my sniper and a couple of grenades) against a giant robot-like thing shooting lasers everywhere...and my kid, of course.\n\nSo I split my time between trying to kill the thing and keep my baby boy alive. And I was doind pretty well (guess I'm a fine mom), aliens were dying, baby was alive etc etc when BAMM! That ♥♥♥♥♥♥sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ihopeyousufferinhell idiot gets out of the cover I have nicely put him and RUN STRAIGHT INTO THE BIG ROBOT ENEMY WITH THE BIG DEADLY GUN!!! Game over. And I was like "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ihopeyousufferinhell idiot!"\n\nThen I unistalled the game. Think I'm gonna play Spec Ops now. Didn't like being a mother. Guess I wasn't born for it. Really annoying","May 19","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","1","2","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkregin2/recommended/65930/","darkregin2","🐼 derkregin2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkregin2/","217 products in account","What is it with games now days that try as hard as possible to use as many words as possible? Is this an English class, or do they throw darts and pick what seems "cool"? I suppose an upside is that they don't re-use the same names all the time. Yes I'm looking at you Prince of Persia. Which one? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew.\n\nSo XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a top-down RTS where you have six soldiers and can make your own guns to take into- What? Wrong game? We're talking about the other one? Alright...\n\nSo The Bureau: XCOM Declassified -and yes I have to copy and paste that name every time because it's about as long and complicated as your relationship as your recent sexual partner- is a third person shooter where you can take two brain dead ♥♥♥♥♥ and pick up any gun that seems to have the coolest "pew pew" sounds off the ground. Can I go back to the other XCOM now? No? Another six paragraphs? Alright...\n\n\nSo you play as Jimmy Raynor- I mean William Carter who, similarly to Raynor, wears Clichés like he picked up a pile suits made of them at a cheap clothes store and decided to smother himself in them because he didn't wake up dapper enough that morning. His family was murdered, which explains the clothes shop, and he is now haunted by it because of course he is. He must have obtained his grizzly-♥♥♥♥ voice by drinking their liquefied corpses. Well, You're supposed to feel sympathy for them but you never have any reason to. I once turned to a friend and say one of his lines in his grizzly as hell voice , but that line could have come anywhere, say... Batman.\n\nThe story is that Carter made out with this alien chick, probably a bit too rough though, and it turns out that his box of clichés went missing, and the alien chick probably took them to have a little gander. So he goes on a mystical adventure to re-obtain them but is interrupted and escorted by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to this Bureau that Carter has never heard about, and pretends doesn't exist, but just like mass effect, everyone sees you as some kind of war hero, and treat you as god, despite you having no idea what the hell is going on.\n\n\nSimilar to Mass Effect, you have a choice in what you want to say, with awkward eye-contact, but unlike mass effect, there is not good or evil options, which I suppose is good, so you don't have to decide whether you want to be good, bad, or in the middle which gets you no-♥♥♥♥ing-where. But you also aren't talking to party members with interesting back stories, you talk to random ♥♥♥♥♥ in suits.\n\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is with all the suits? Why is everyone in a suit during an alien invasion. Should they not be in armour? Let's put it this way, aliens invade, like they do, and everyone was too busy looking dapper and thought it looked cool. Are they ironically being hipsters? Got'ta wear a suit. Every other game wears armour, so we have to wear suits because we're posh and ♥♥♥♥. Then again, it does make a nice change from dressing up in skulls, pots and pans such as in, say, Borderlands.\n\nMaybe I should actually talk about the combat, as that's the only thing that hasn't been terrible so far. So the combat is hopefully good while everything else is quite lackluster.\n\nPahahaha! Good is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The AI are  about as smart as mother chickens. Something, let's say... A cardboard cut out of a cat lobbed a grenade, the AI yells "Grenade!" then sort of sits on it, aiming to keep it warm and birth a baby chicken because no one else would want a child with them, and then they wonder after about five awkward seconds of me yelling they wonder why their brains are against the wall.\n\nSo the AI is ♥♥♥♥ed. What about the guns? Well unlike Unknown COM Enemy X you don't make your own weapons from scrap, or research, or days of sitting outside the engineering bay staring at it, and then when it's done you dress it up in a bow tie. and throw a birthday party, and then use it in the field and fan girl about how awesome it is. But in XCOM Bureau Declassified The, you jus sortof find it. Which completely goes against anything in XCOM, where in other games the alien weaponry self destruct so you can't use it.\n\nOh, but don't worry. There's still the regular SMG, Shotgun, Pistol, sniper ect. But there is no special slot for the pistol to go, and you can only hold two guns at a time which feels like Duke Nukem Forever. Euugh! I just thought of Duke Nukem forever, thank you XCOM Declassified Bureau The.\n\nSpeaking of the pistol, it's completely pointless other than for precision head shotting that do ♥♥♥♥ all within Bureau XCOM The Declassified as enemies have so much health you might as well fire BB pellet's at their powderizd uterus. Though the pistol reminds me of Tomb Raider's combat. The new one that is, not the old one. I'm reminded of it due to the way you can sit behind a chest high wall and make a nice sized hole in their head. Or uterus.\n\nOh ♥♥♥♥ me how have I not mentioned chest <dry heave> chest high walls. The game puts chest high walls -or cars- anywhere that there is some kind of combat. Even if you had to swat a fly, suddenly chest high walls fall from space and crush the fly that you were fighting. Thanks a ♥♥♥♥ing lot now get out my game. When you try to move on, carter just cello tapes to any wall that he happens to subtly brush past, as if he's scared of the next room, or he's trying to tell you something but he's a man of cliché's and can't be arsed. Oh, but when you actually do enter combat he refuses to stick to the damn wall.\n\nOn multiple occasions I exited a cut scene, which threw me into combat, I ran at a wall, He swiftly avoided it and straight into open, and got gunned down. So I then turned around, in attempt to get to the wall, and he ran straight past it again and dropped dead. So my partners panicked, and tried to revive me by running in the complete opposite direction and get headshot.\n\nAll in all, my favourite part of the game was that at the end you have to go on a suicide mission with the chosen one- What? Wrong game? I was talking about the XCOM: Enemy Unknown? Sorry, I was playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, It's a top-down RTS that 2K gave us while threatening to make this garbage- oh no The Bureau has gone playing with the birds again.

This game is Great, but it would be better if this game have Co-Op mode.\n\nThe Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a science fiction video game in the X-COM series, developed by 2K Marin and released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThe Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics.\nThe player controls the agent William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering "Battle Focus Mode", which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities. As in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, soldiers will suffer from permanent death and if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission).\n\n\n","July 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's like ME2 and 3 in that the mainline, gun combat has had too much focus.  Upgrades do not reflect weapon tech level (bullets, laser, then plasma), where as soldiers can, at the start when you only have the starting weapons, have tech for, say, a turret, that uses tech based off of the alien's weapons.  Any and all choices you make (and side missions) will have 0, repeat, 0 impact on the story, as (SPOILIER) X-Com HQ eventually gets attacked and destroyed, killing virtually everyone inside of the base save for some major characters.  The whole idea of "having to take alien weapons that haven't been destroyed by operator death using the Venn Brace (the device on Carter's arm in virtually all screen shots)" is just stupid.  The AI isn't the brightest.  The game also lacks a key aspect of X-Com and it's choices: will this work out in the long run.\n\nLets use X-Com: Enemy Unknown for example: You recieve an abduction mission.  You have to pick one of three.  One is in St. Petersburg, and Russia is offering a new sniper, at the rank of captian.  Your's is a squaddie, as you had to replace your previous one.  Then there's one in New York.  The US is offering 4 scientists.  You have completed all projects that will be fast, and are on a long term one (10 days left).  Then you have one in Cairo.  Egypt is offering 200 credits.  You recently bought a satilite, and still have room for one more.  Europe and NA has their panic raised to 2, amd if you don't pick it, it will raise to 4, hanging on the edge of full panic and risking leaving, or staying.  The sattilite construciton is cutting the montly report close, but you may have time to place that sattilite over the one of the paniced countries.  And there MAY be a chance of a Terror mission.  What I have given you is a typical scenario, in both EU and EW.  The player may think this: "That sniper is good, it can make my squads stronger, and I don't have to worry about my normal sniper becoming wounded.  But, I need those Scientists so I can research Plasma weapons faster, make my soldiers better in the field.  Although, I could use those funds, and can use two sattilites to lower more countries panic."  For this, there is no right or wrong answer.  And there is a chance that this can make or break your run.\n\nHowever, for the Bureau, there are no hard choices.  You can do as many side missions, and send as many side agents out before you continue on with the story.  The even added a cliche "character sacrifice" on the finally mission, (SPOILER) having you pick between Agent Weaver, Director Faulke, or Doctor Weir (depending on who you picked to continue as in the level prior).  There is no sense of loss, as you can't even use the character you just rescuesed, esentially giving you a hollow choice.\n\nThis game was labeled an X-Com game and had potential.

It looked super appealing to me - it seemed to take the concept of XCOM and wrap it as a first person RTS that looked really neat. Granted, it's story looked like it use some help, but XCOM hasn't been as much about story as much as keeping you entertained and feel accomplished for sweet plan executions.\n\nThis game falls short. I've played some offline to a grand total of about 4 hours of gameplay time, and I just can't get behind it. It feels like it had a great idea, but a budget that fell short and an atmosphere that tries to take itself too seriously in a serious story (somehow). It looked great on pen and paper, but there's so many little querks with it, and the controls feels a little stiff.\n\nI mean, if you can get it on one of those sales where it goes for $4 and you're dying to try it, go ahead - you might like it. But honestly, I'm not sure I'll be able to finish this one. Sorry Firaxis Games.","April 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/65930/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","TPS with cover, small-scale squad and rudimentary leveling and gear management mechanics.\n\n+ High levels of detail, quality and polish (it looks, sounds and feels good)\n+ Special setting (American 50ths/60ths, with some related music, places designed accordingly and historical remarks and story-related influences)\n+ Some interesting characters with a pretty great voice acting and very nice animations/motion capturing\n+ Good immersion. Story is nice. Nothing too special, but it has some interesting points. Apparently there are multiple endings, since you can make some critical choices towards the end of the game.\n+ Good action. Squad mechanics are nice. You fight in a squad of three. Not overly complex. You can slow down/almost pause the game ("battle focus") to examine the field and give orders without sweating: Go into cover, attack that enemy, use special powers to buff/debuff units, place mines or turrets, push enemies around or draw them out of cover and such things. I played on second least difficulty. Combat can get tense at times. Keeping great distance to enemies worked the best. They try to flank you and if you don't pay attention they can harm you badly that way, but with battle focus you can avoid these situations fairly well (most enemies are highlighted through walls when using that feature, so unless they cloak or teleport around or use other means of faster movement they cannot really sneak up on you too easily).\n\n? I've seen another review criticize the saving system. It's autosave and checkpoints only. I think that's better than having to save yourself. Quicksave and all may encourage some people to attempt mending every mistake they make in combat right away rather than to live through with the consequences (in case of "The Bureau" it means the death of agents - which I did avoid by loading checkpoints). At least that's what I always tend to do in games that give me direct means of saving (which can destroy immersion and challenge). So I think I'm glad how the saving works in this game.\n\n? I wish there was a "stay in cover" order. I sometimes wouldn't want my squad members to expose themselves to the enemy at all. They act somewhat autonomous, if they do their health may get shot down badly. If you choose good cover spots and keep enemies distracted a bit with "minions" or by attracting fire yourself this usually isn't happening too quickly, and when they are very low on health they seem to stay behind cover completely, but I would have prefered taking less chances there in a few situations.\n\n- Controls are irritating a bit. You sprint with SHIFT and go into cover with that as well. Because of that when sprinting close to objects you sometimes go into cover without wanting it. I couldn't find or remember a specific button to pull out of the "Move there" order either (I did improvise with another order). Sprinting itself feels a bit odd or "strict" too. You can only sprint forward, not into diagonal directions, so you might feel slighty less "mobile" than you'd expect from most other action titles. Moving around the HQ can feel tedious at times because you cannot sprint there.\n\n- Allied A.I. is sometimes making strange moves. In particular when their position is getting overrun or pressed by hostile grenades they would sometimes leap/flee into the direction of the enemies rather than fall back. If you don't call them back a bit as they step into the open exposing themselves they may get hurt badly. But that's about all of "strangeness" I've noticed there.\n\n- Using some abilities/powers can feel a bit tedious. Like if you want to spawn a minion you need to move a cursor from your character to the target location. But that cursor gets blocked by cover objects. Even if you are technically in range of the place you want to spawn your minion at you may not be able to do so (or not as easily). It makes no logical sense because your characters "throw" glowing balls to make stuff spawn, meaning that hip-high cover elements shouldn't be hindering you as much as they sometimes do.\n\n- When things get messy it's sometimes hard to keep track of the skill/power queue. Every squad member has five possible actions (attack, move, special power 1-3). Sometimes you may issue around all across the members and get mildly lost. You can chain them, but you just don't see the chain. But it's not too dramatic, after all you can practically pause the action and look around and regain your bearings.\n\n- A few strange bugs. Like sometimes I couldn't zoom in with my guns anymore, or the eyebrows of one character wouldn't load (funny, actually). Nothing dealbreaking though. Falling through the floor or something as mentioned by another reviewer I had never happen to myself. One time the game crashed, but I may blame myself for that because I've been switching out of the game to my desktop for several hours. That aside the game usually worked very stable.","August 30, 2014","true","30.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I will cover each factor to keep the review clean.\n\nStory\nThe game has an interesting and overall fresh setting which I have to admit I liked a lot. Coldwar era, everyone scared of Reds, and overall one can't help but wonder that in such an era, where not just disbelief and distrust hinder the human side but even technically, they are way behind than the "modern" human resistance of Xcom: Enemy unknown, a game from the same developers, that is connected to this one.\nOn the other hand the story develops towards open confrontation with the aliens which makes the whole thing unbelievable - especially after the developers going out of their way of providing hints about the connection with the other Xcom game, where we know nothing about previous alien encounters... while an open war with aliens ought to be something hard to forget for humanity.\nEven not considering the connection to the other game's storyline, it feels strange that while we are practically in open war with the aliens yet it just doesn't feel like it.  Aand this is where gameplay kicks in.\n\nGameplay\nYou control the protagonist, commanding a small team of men, issuing tactical orders in the heat of battle. Sounds nice. Problem is the way this plays out.\nControl can be truly clunky at times, certain abilities do things that just doesn't seem logical (an ability that forces an enemy out of cover looks the same as any other shot etc.) or just plain skip explanation how they do it but what truly kills it is the ai. Dishing out orders can be a pain while under fire and while time slows to a near complete halt you find yourself panicing. Not because of enemies outnumbering you or anything but simply because even seemingly solid orders can get yourself killed since your teammates tend to perform actions in a suicidal manner. That becomes apparent first when you are hit by a grenade attack and they either run away in fear (mostly right towards the enemy, exposing themselves even with tons of cover around, etc.) or just stay and get fried. Another problem is the effect of cover which tends to be erratic. You are in cover yet the enemy seems to have no problem whatsoever hitting you - and your teammates die fast.\n\nEnemies tend to be foolish too and while they do expose a lot of themselves it is still hard to take them down - even the weakest sectoids. Sure, later you can get upgraded equipment but honestly, when I see an enemy that is supposeldy physically weak (sectoids) soak up 10+ shots to the head from a carbine without flinching... I feel somewhat annoyed.\n\nGraphics\nThe game has what it takes to provide proper visuals while it's engine would be capable of far more realistic looks - this art style is alright. Certainly not the best looking one around (even considering age) but no problem.\nOn the other hand the design of certain things can be... strange, even forced.\nSome aliens look like the generally known versions, greys etc., modelled practically the same way as the ones in Xcom Enemy Unkown, thus providing a certain amount of consistency which is always nice while the other group of enemies consist of metallic... machines?... mainly following a geometric theme. Both groups are fine on their own but making them appear together, they just don't fit. Not because alien enemies cannot be diverse and varied or sorts - simply because the technological level of the metallic enemies seem to vastly outclass the "flesh and blood" enemies, resulting in a difference that makes one think that they are not even from the same game.\n\nOverall the game can be good, with enough patience you can ignore the problems I have mentioned... but honestly, not worth it. Ai and controls are core mechanics, if they are messed up, your whole experience will be plagued by fails that you can hardly do anything about. I as a player don't like it when the game just decides that I win or lose and honestly, that's how this felt.","September 30, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'll admit my first reaction to the game was that it was underwhelming and would get repetive fast. However the further I played into the game I was drawn in by the story. I already liked the idea of a 50s era noir setting with aliens and I just wanted to know what would happen next. Sure there are a few areas which could have used a bit more depth, however I feel the story makes up for that.\n\nFor example, my agents reached level 5 with much of the game left to go so it was a bit dissappointing to see that they had reached their maximum capability with so much left of the game to complete. That being said, the graphics in this game are really nice for the most part. The AI I can see could have used a bit of work, although I can understand the choices they made to keep them 'dumb'. If all the enemies just rushed you on the hard difficulty there would be no way to defend youself, literally, and the game would be impossible.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game though. The story was gripping, yet a tad dry at times with the 'investigations',\n8/10","October 27, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Your teammates will randomly move forward and get killed or stand in the open, and they die so quickly. Even if you set a target for them it feels as if they aren't actually doing anything, it's like they're using rubber bullets. It's just clunky and doesn't work. The storyline and characters are just as horrible, they have 0 emotion. After a certain character dies the main character is so worked up over it and it's talked about for 5 minutes when I really didn't care for this certain character whom died because he was never really important or made out to be important to the "storyline" at all. There's probably more reasons to dislike this game I just haven't played it long enough to find more and I don't intend to.

Even knowing that there's new dlc for it makes me want nothing more than my money back, and some mind bleach so I can forget I ever played it.\nAllow me to go into detail as to why:\nFirst and foremost, the game isn't finished. There are graphical and technical glitches all over the place, but not so much as to make the game unplayable. The game also looks like something from 2003, but with an extreme bloom filter and some shiney guns. Remember the whole research and progressing threat thing from xcom? Yeah, that's nowhere to be found in here. You have a series of very linear missions, with some side missions, and a cast of side characters who really are completely underdeveloped. Your soldiers all have one voice. One voice, with no variations, like in xcom EU/EW.\nThe only condition I'd see as feasible ground for buying this pile of donkey ♥♥♥♥ would be if the developers were holding you ransom, with a gun to your freaking head, and were telling you to buy it.\nIt took me about 14 hours to beat, so I guess it's kind of a long-ish game, but so's getting your ♥♥♥♥ probed with a spoon. A long game isn't necessarily a good thing, if the game itself is garbage.\nThe only really good thing I can say is that there's a relatively good twist at the end. It actually comes very close to being the best part of the game for me--but it's at the end, so the best part was when I finally beat this pile of ♥♥♥♥, and uninstalled it.\n\nIn short: DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES","December 5, 2013","false","14.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It can be quite challenging, that is true, but it never really captivates you.

Many of the original concepts from the scrapped FPS return here, such as the 1950s setting, the 'silicoids' and the investigative themes.\nWhat on the surface looks like a shallow cash-in, is actually a very deep and enjoyable hybrid TPS/RTS game, but in order to really enjoy The Bureau you have to be willing to give it a chance and excuse some of it's shortcomings.\nIt's story is paint-by-numbers, it's characters are shallow, the levels are linear, it's everything you'd expect from a mediocre shooter, but for those willing to invest in the game, there's a deep and tactical experience to be had, not to mention some genuinely clever plot twists that most people won't see coming.\n\nThe Bureau boasts many of the features of a 'true' XCOM game, you'll unlock better equipment as the game progresses, you'll recruit and train soldiers who can die permenantly, and you'll need to be strategic and use your assets creatively in order to win against increasingly grim odds. What sets it apart from the traditional XCOM games is the story driven campaign and the more personal perspective of being a soldier in the field.\n\nIt features quite nice graphics at times, and the 50s setting and aesthetic is charming, reminiscent of Bioshock and Fallout. The cover-based shooting is simple but tight, and using the tactical view, which slows time and allows you to issue orders and use skills, is a joy to use, you'll get immense satisfaction from pulling off combos.\n\nFor those fans of the XCOM universe, old and new, this is a must have game, and for fans of third person shooters and strategy games, this is a solid addition to your library.\n","July 19, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That being said, the game is good as it is bad. The story starts out pretty good, but by the end, becomes little more than incomprehensible gibberish. The combat is solid enough, and forces you to use cover, but enemies love grenade spam tactics.\n\nTo make it worse, the snap-lock cover can become really finicky and stick you to places you rather not be ending your life with a quick dose of lasers and grenades. I like the reliance on abilites, including your squadmates, however, the pitiful AI makes more than half encounters end in fustruation as you are forced to babysit them and manually extract any real use out of them.\n\nDirectX11 API is broken with framerates dipping into the low 20's, and this is on a very powerful rig. The graphics are pretty, nothing exceptional but the variance of American landscapes powered by Unreal 3 is a nice treat to the eyes. The Alien locales, on the other hand, are of the generic "shiny grey metallic tile" SCI-FI variety.\n\nThe best way to summarize this game is to call it a inferior Mass Effect clone set in 1962. It is by no means a bad game, and surely worth $4.99 in entertainment money, but to expect more from such a quality developer of the Bioshock games, you'll only end up dissapointed.","November 27, 2014","true","31.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It attempts to bridge third-person shooting with more tactical/strategy elements like a conventional XCOM game.  While many people have more detailed opinions about how WELL this is accomplished, I think the game has a pretty good rapport in trying and getting most of the two things down.  I say this to mean it is possible to just go rambo and kill all the aliens yourself with your team as minimal support.  It is also possible to not really fight and micromanage your team to kill everybody for you.  However, the game is really the best when you can master the two and be able to multitask shooting things and issuing commands for your team to shoot things as well.  I actually enjoyed that about this game very much because it allows me to focus on different enemies while being reassured that my team is putting the hurt on someone else.\n\nHowever, I think the most difficult part of The Bureau to swallow is the story.  I could talk for ages about its story, but I will try to keep it brief.  The game does not pull its punches in its portrayal of its characters; pretty much all of the characters are morally gray characters - none of them are psychopaths, but each of their motivations make them do evil things.  In that way, the characters are very realistic, they are imperfect people (or aliens) controlled like puppets and thus act out of rage, fear, and sadness.  Most will never get redemption as their thirst for vengeance makes them ignore the suffering of others; a world not unlike our own.\n\nTHings I really found quirky about this game is that damn near everybody smokes.  I had heard that those 60s people really liked their deathsticks, but I never thought it was THAT bad.  Also, the agent customization options are pretty cool because all of the agents dress sharply and it gives me a satisfying feeling to see a well-dressed man with a vest and tie blow a Sectoid head off.  Also, it has an interesting take on "third person" shooter (if you know what I mean the twist).\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a purely shoot-em-up or purely tactical game, then this one is not for you.  However, The Bureau is an interesting blacksheep for those who want to give a new hybrid a go, with a plot that is complex, but quite acurate in what we would do if aliens attacked.  And no, we do not become friends.","March 24, 2015","true","38.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Thumbs down period.\n\n\nThis game attempts to lift off but sort of falls flat while doing so.\n\nI havent't played any of the XCOM games but from what I've read from other reviews, it doesn't come close to the XCOM series.\n\nThe pros:\nGraphics aren't bad.\nYou can achieve success in battles by correctly positioning your guys.\nThe game pulls off a 1960s era feel.\n\nThe cons:\nControls feel clunky and awkward, making running, crouching and taking cover clumsy at times.You will wrestle with your character as he takes cover when all you want him to do is run away.\nThe options to select different conversational points with characters in the game when you are not in a mission allows for greater depth and exploration of the story. But you can simply go to the next mission without speaking to everyone. At one point before you go on the ship, the game has you literally go back and forth between Faulke and characters in another section of the headquarters. I am literally running from one place to the next. Thank god there is a skip button for the boring conversation.\n\nOff-mission you are pretty much relegated to running around headquarters talkign to people. Because of the size of the complex, it gets boring fast having to weave back and forth from one room to the next. It's not very easy to keep track of all of your goals after having spoken to someone and they change the second some new information comes up.\n\n45 minutes into this game you realize that the game is B O R I N G.\n\n6/10","June 6, 2015","false","20.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are actually some pretty cool upgrades, after you get your hands on enemy weaponry you can lift a target and have your squad gang up on him, or you can push them back with a burst of the outsider guns.

Many of the original concepts from the scrapped FPS return here, such as the 1950s setting, the 'silicoids' and the investigative themes.\nWhat on the surface looks like a shallow cash-in, is actually a very deep and enjoyable hybrid TPS/RTS game, but in order to really enjoy The Bureau you have to be willing to give it a chance and excuse some of it's shortcomings.\nIt's story is paint-by-numbers, it's characters are shallow, the levels are linear, it's everything you'd expect from a mediocre shooter, but for those willing to invest in the game, there's a deep and tactical experience to be had, not to mention some genuinely clever plot twists that most people won't see coming.\n\nThe Bureau boasts many of the features of a 'true' XCOM game, you'll unlock better equipment as the game progresses, you'll recruit and train soldiers who can die permenantly, and you'll need to be strategic and use your assets creatively in order to win against increasingly grim odds. What sets it apart from the traditional XCOM games is the story driven campaign and the more personal perspective of being a soldier in the field.\n\nIt features quite nice graphics at times, and the 50s setting and aesthetic is charming, reminiscent of Bioshock and Fallout. The cover-based shooting is simple but tight, and using the tactical view, which slows time and allows you to issue orders and use skills, is a joy to use, you'll get immense satisfaction from pulling off combos.\n\nFor those fans of the XCOM universe, old and new, this is a must have game, and for fans of third person shooters and strategy games, this is a solid addition to your library.\n","July 19, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The idea of mixing third person combat and RTS is interesting but it's execution is flawed.\n\nRemeniscent of Mass Effect when it comes to exploring the main headquaters and interacting with some of the main characters. The narrative is very linear and full of cliches.\n\nA similar sentiment I can share with are the characters. None of them stand out as relatable or even worth detailing. The fedoras had more character than the actual characters.\n\nThe gameplay at best is abysmal, the fusion of TPS and RTS do not mix at all. The games design isn't justifiable enough to have the word XCOM in it's name.\n\nAlso the games AI isn't.\n\nExample: I ordered my engineer to approach some cover just outside an enemy position (the enemy took cover in a book store hiding behind shelves and the main counter). So in close quaters he would have a clear shot with his shotgun. That was what should have happened.\n\nInstead he took cover in the store, in the middle of the enemy position, he was surrounded on all sides and within seconds he was killed.\n\nIt was tragic but hillarious. I could've saved him due to the bleed out mecahnic but I decided not to for the greater good.\n\nA more appropriate title/name for this game would be The Bureau: Darwin Awards Declassified.\n\nI only recommend this game because of the shenanigans the AI is capable of enacting.\nBut I would certainly recommend that you move straight onto Enemy Unknown.","February 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its NOT your regular XCOM game, that much is obvious, but its a new a fresh approach to the XCOM universe. It gives you the chance to explore the lore and the real fisical instalations of a base like no previous game let you before, you get to talk to engineers, researchers, medics, coms, etc, increasing the game imersion in the XCOM world and has the bonus of happening in the 60´s, the golden era... Elvis, James Dean, milkshakes, jukeboxes, rock&roll, its Back to the future man!!! The Graphics are very good, sound and music are top notch and the voice acting is prob one of the best ive seen in games so far. The story is quite good and the gameplay is not that diferent from what we have seen from the past, the only diference is that we have to develop our tactics alot faster now which in this case makes the action parts alot faster paced. The only regret ive got its that it ends, i really want more of this.","March 22, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It attempts to bridge third-person shooting with more tactical/strategy elements like a conventional XCOM game.  While many people have more detailed opinions about how WELL this is accomplished, I think the game has a pretty good rapport in trying and getting most of the two things down.  I say this to mean it is possible to just go rambo and kill all the aliens yourself with your team as minimal support.  It is also possible to not really fight and micromanage your team to kill everybody for you.  However, the game is really the best when you can master the two and be able to multitask shooting things and issuing commands for your team to shoot things as well.  I actually enjoyed that about this game very much because it allows me to focus on different enemies while being reassured that my team is putting the hurt on someone else.\n\nHowever, I think the most difficult part of The Bureau to swallow is the story.  I could talk for ages about its story, but I will try to keep it brief.  The game does not pull its punches in its portrayal of its characters; pretty much all of the characters are morally gray characters - none of them are psychopaths, but each of their motivations make them do evil things.  In that way, the characters are very realistic, they are imperfect people (or aliens) controlled like puppets and thus act out of rage, fear, and sadness.  Most will never get redemption as their thirst for vengeance makes them ignore the suffering of others; a world not unlike our own.\n\nTHings I really found quirky about this game is that damn near everybody smokes.  I had heard that those 60s people really liked their deathsticks, but I never thought it was THAT bad.  Also, the agent customization options are pretty cool because all of the agents dress sharply and it gives me a satisfying feeling to see a well-dressed man with a vest and tie blow a Sectoid head off.  Also, it has an interesting take on "third person" shooter (if you know what I mean the twist).\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a purely shoot-em-up or purely tactical game, then this one is not for you.  However, The Bureau is an interesting blacksheep for those who want to give a new hybrid a go, with a plot that is complex, but quite acurate in what we would do if aliens attacked.  And no, we do not become friends.","March 24, 2015","true","38.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/random_rawr/recommended/65930/","random_rawr","USS Peary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/random_rawr/","257 products in account","There's a lot to like and dislike about The Bureau. The connection with it and Enemy Unknown are tenous at best; other than name, and a visual callback in the form of EXALT in Enemy Within, the two games are completely seperate.\n\nThe visual style is good, and distinctive. The 60's era, Cold Era setting is unique and distinctive, and the game looks fantastic. Curiously, the game decides to give each of your individual classes a completely different look. While this helps you to identify them instantly, it also doesn't really lend a sense of being in an organized unit, more like a guerilla organization. Perhaps they meant to get the sense of desperation across, though it came across as more like a dysfunction junction.\n\nThe story is passable. The twist is surprising, but not earth shattering. If you're perceptive in fact, perhaps you would've seen it coming.\n\nAudio work is steller. Weapons, they sound good. Other than the Scatter Laser, which for some reason is like an animal squealingl everytime you pull the trigger, the rest of the weapons sound solid and dependable, and you can really feel the hurt that you put out. The audio cues that your squadmates give are loud and clear, and the spoken dialogue is pretty good.\n\nGameplay is okay. This is a cover based shooter, and it shows. In fact, it shows too much; you can tell an ambush is coming by the suspicious amount of cover. Though it generally blends well with the environment, it's a telling sign when you come across a series of low walls between you and your objective, and some conspicious explosive objects, but no enemies in sight. You always have two squadmates with you, but they might as well not be around. We'll get to that in a bit. With your squaddies you can outflank the enemy, but with the plethora of cover busting abilies at your disposal, you really just need to wait for your cooldowns. Oddly enough, the game doesn't let you free-throw your grenades, instead making them a targetted AoE ability with no cool down.\n\nNow on to the AI. The enemy AI is good. Stunning, even. It will pin you down with suppressing fire while flanking your position. It will flush you out with grenades. It will take advantage of an advancing muton to rush your position, flanking you while you deal with the muton, which by the way can take a literal storm of bullets and still keep coming. But surely, you must be thinking, with your two squadmates, it'll be difficult but manageable.\n\nNo. It's fustrating, that's what it is.\n\nBecause your own team AI is astoundingly bad. Your squadmates won't use their own abilities on their own initiative. They will often expose themselves to enemy fire to empty their clip, and get downed in the process. They won't relocate when getting flanked. They'll spend almost all of the time in combat asking you for orders or asking for healing. They get downed very easily, because I saw with my own two eyes my squadmates roll away from an enemy grenade, only to run back to it because it was the closest cover. It's not a squad based shooter. It's a solo shooter, with two of the enemy on your side. Its a shame, because as  the enemy AI shows, 2K CAN develop intelligent AI, they just decided to hand the player possibly one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friendly AIs in video game history. Perhaps they didn't want it to be too easy for the player, but as the AI stands, it's the most fustrating thing to experience in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, if you can weather the terrible friendly AI (which I did, just barely), the game isn't that bad. Taken on its own, as a seperate part of the XCOM family, it's a good inclusion in its own right. This game could have been so much more; all they had to do was increase the competence of your teammates. But as it stands, it's extremely fustrating.","November 4, 2014","false","18.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great graphics, wonderful characters, good gameplay mechanics and very beautiful settings. There is only two problems I have with the game. First of all, you have to get used to the character's voices, because in the beginning, everyone's voice sounds like that stereotypical government voice that closely resembles a chicken bone being lodged down your throat. Next is the ending... it's bloody awful. It's not the event that ends the game that kills it off, it's the events leading up to it. The fact that you HAVE to switch characters was a bad idea no matter which character you took. This killed the game off completely and ruined it for me. Honestly, take Weir was next playable character, as I was connected to Carter too much and Weir's ending is much more pleasant. Other than that, I completely recommend this game, but make sure you know who to trust and who to stay connected to the most.","July 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As far as X-Com branding goes, it's nowhere near as "THIS is what I'm TALKING about!" as Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within. This could be "generic men-in-black situation going on" just as easily, but fine it's X-Com because X-Com.\n\nThe single most important pro is that it's a fun game with interesting combat mechanics (especially where it differs from its inspirations). The single most important con is that it is a little bit unpolished and there's a bug or two that might affect your progress but probably won't. It isn't an A+ title, but few games are.\n\nIf you really enjoy third-person shooters with an emphasis on squad management and tactics, this is one of the few games that will scratch that itch. Even if X-Com is mainly paid lip service in the combat itself, the game can stand on its own pretty well, and if you just ignore the fact that this work of fiction doesn't really mesh with their other, superior work of fiction as far as the story goes, you're probably in for a good time.","August 20, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Think of Gears of War in XCOM setting with stupid AI teammates whom you have to micromanage all the time.\n\nPlaying it on Commander (the highest difficulty) now, and the squad mates running into enemy grenades (or not able to run away from them) is the most frustrating thing. I have to micro manage those idiots and run away manually each time an alien throws a nade, and that's really annoying.\n\nAnother game breaker is that squad members just cannot stay behind the cover. They try to attack enemies and get shot in the face. And while you can run away from grenades, can't really do anything with this thing. There should've been agressive/passive behavior for allies and also simple commands like hold ground, stay in cover, etc. As it is, The Bureau is really bad in this regard.\n\nHowever, the game becomes easier as agents get new abilities and you get accustomed to controls. On the lower difficulty settings you can even make mistakes and still win.\n\nOverall, you can totally buy the game on sale just to walk the corridors of XCOM base and shoot aliens with plasma and laser weapons.

My impressions are based on a playthrough at the highest difficulty level so I don't know how easy it gets if you crank it down.\n\nCombat in the Bureau is not your typical shooter gameplay at all - if you run and gun you will very quickly get murdered by even the most basic of encounters. Most of your combat time is spent in a slow motion tactical menu where you can utilize soldier skills and designate targets and where to move.  Your soldiers level up as you use them in missions and gain skills based off what class they are and what you choose for them. While playing on the harder difficulties if they bleed out they will die for good adding an extra level of tension but if you stabilize them before they bleed out they will come back to life after you've killed everything in the area.\n\nI really did feel like the commander because of the combat system and how it is very strictly defined by what you tell each soldier to do - they aren't AI's that will do everything on their own, if that's what you want this isn't the game for you at all and you will hate the combat. I felt combat was very fun and was the strong point of the game.\n\nThe story.. I have to admit after like 5 hours in I just started skipping all the dialog I really didn't care about the story at all in this particular game for some reason. Even skipping through it though it did yield a cool twist towards the end of the game that very likely causes different endings, though how different I don't know.\n\nI recommend giving this game a shot, atleast at a discount maybe. On the hardest settings and doing every side mission I came across the game was not even 20 hours and it has no multiplayer - you could very likely cut that in half rather easily on lower settings and skipping side missions.","August 23, 2013","true","17.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat style of Mass Effect and facial structure / character depth of LA Noir. It's fun for bursts at a time the leveling system is alright but little is affected by picking different paths in the skill tree. Whatever perks you miss you can have another person pick up making your choices meaningless. With the difficulty set at its highest the AI is there however most of the difficulty comes from the nerf bullets that are placed in the gun in this setting. Lots of talking and paltry character background for some of the main characters but it all feels cliche, (e.g.), the main character is a lone gun who lost his family and blames himself. The nicest thing I can say about this game is how things react with nvidia physx turned up. Cloth moves properly and when doors fall apart it looks very nice. This doesn't happen much and it doesn't mean you can make your own path as you are shoved down this corridor into slightly different aliens. Being that this game is only a year old you would think the graphics would still be decent which they are but the same can be said for metro last light and that just got a graphics release meaning they both were not made to meet the demands of the pc gaming community. If you love other XCOM games this adds to the lore and is worth the time. If you are like me however and could take it or leave you will get bored with the occasional oh and aw of flashy explosions and hopes for a challenging situation only to be found forced through another beigh town, hallway, or steile enviornment with the same few enemies. 7/10 Average, boring with tight controls .","August 22, 2014","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, game's quite good, but not that fun as I've expected.\nYou will ask : "But why?"\nAnswer's simple - it's a 1:1 clone of Mass Effect, only shorter. Since it's not a review for Mass Effect - I don't see a point of talking about Mass Effect, as for this game - go read a review on Mass Effect series.\nWho I would recommed it to?

The Bureau sacrafices XCOM's classic strategic elements for the action of a third person shooter. Unfortunately, the combat feels dull and watered down with poor gunplay, bad AI, and incredibly basic, linear level design. One of the biggest faults of this game is the story. When I first started playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown (which was gifted to me for free), I was incredibly turned off by the cheesy plot and art direction that reflects Mars Attacks. This was eventually overcome due to the game's excellent turn based strategy gameplay and RPG like upgrade system. The Bureau, on the other hand, maintains all the cheesiness whilst relenquishing the enjoyable gameplay, which is incredibly detrimental for this game, as shooters rely on immersion to put people into the shoes of the character they assume. The 1960's alien conspiracy in the midst of the cold war could have been an excellent backdrop for a game, and even could have made the Sectoids a little less cliche. However, the charm of the era is squandered by absolutely awful dialogue, 2-dimensional characters, and CIA agents whose wits are as dull as a rock.","June 7, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No justifiable basis in modern programming.\n-"Realistic" ammo availability, you'll be down to one weapon, that's only good in edge cases, with no ammo for general-purpose weapons. Only logical reason? "Because aliens wouldn't stock that ammo." Maybe realistic, definitely bad game design.\n\nThe good:\n-It's a straight-forward shooter with a less-than-miserable plot.

I could understand the point most people would make in regards to the X COM series. After playing through the game I have realized its not so much of a bad game as it is ok. In the sense that it has the key components of a game and I did not run into any problems really. The games just is not exciting as one would figure with an alien invasion and a country in ruin because of it. One of the major flaws in the game i think is the lack of character I hated having to talk to other npc's in the game because i just didnt care. I found myself constitenetly skipping dialogue just to what i was thinking was a mission to only have to go to different part of base and talking to someone else. I would have to say this game is good if its in the bargain bin or on sale for less the 10$.","May 29, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not even that experienced with traditional X-Com. My problems stem from this being a very problematically designed tactical shooter with a story and writing that just doesn't add up...or make sense...or make me feel anything.\n\nFirst off lets talk mechanics. As a tactical shooter, this game does at least try to bring more complexity to the genre, but that complexity is undermined by a control system that feels very loose and innacurate (I'm talking about aiming and shooting here). In addition to that, the AI of your companions leaves much to be desired.  Even when you are giving them orders regularly and changing their positions often, you will find that they are generally inneffective and frustrating to work with. I'm sure that they improve some as they level, but I doubt even then that it will totally solve how chaotically and unpredictably they behave.\n\nAs for the story, it is about as mediocre as they come. Neither the writing nor the cinematic presentation are very good at all. Often the cinematography and dialog are so bad that I have no idea what is happening. The result is a game that feels like it is coming apart at the seems. The presentation is so sloppy and disjointed that the only way anyone could possibly enjoy it is by not paying attention to it and filling in the blanks with their own imagination.\n\nThis game should have had it all for me. I am huge fan of retro science fiction worlds and X-Files-esque conspiracy laden story telling. Despite that, I can only express dissatisfaction with this game as a product. It is simply a broken, unpolished, cash-in by a company that should know better at this point. For shame 2K. For shame.\n\nIf you're just looking for a tactical shooter with a decent story, try Spec Ops: The Line instead. That game has an incredibly satisfying cinematic atmosphere, despite its tactical mechanics being simpler and more familiar. If you're looking for a good retro sci-fi game with aliens and government agents and all that stuff...well, tell me when you find one because I'd love to play it.\n\nWho I'd recommend this for:\nVirtually no one. This is one of those games that is only for people who have decided to like it before they ever even played it. If you're into the surfaces of the game world and have a lot of patience for poor mechanics, you might have a good time. If you're someone who is simply interested in playing bad games (and I say that earnestly because I do think there is nobility in that, especially for designers) you might want to give it a try as well, but I wouldn't pay full price if that's the case. Hell, I wouldn't even pay half price. I bought this game on sale for $15, and I wish I had waited until they were chuckin' it away for $5.","May 27, 2014","false","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
