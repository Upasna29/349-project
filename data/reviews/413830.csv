I am sure that the devs can make something awesome within the early access. What would be awesome would be a little more of diversity in the levels per stage. Also, something to acess the hub without having to die if you want to spend money and upgrades in the shop to get new weapons and stuff. Don't give up, devs ! Work hard and your game will definitely be worth it.","November 8, 2015","true","4.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I played the demo for Overdosed and thought the fast was a tad hard to control, the scatterd enemies are way easier to handle.\n\nAs for the industry level, its randomness is mind boggling, the rooms have a nice varity to them and are easy to navigate. Stage 1 became a good way to level up, and once i bought the teleporter it got way easier to progress quickly, stage 2 and 3 are hard as hell! Once I got some of the weapon ugrades it really did help.\n\nWhat I really do want to see is some more of those crazy pills. I want to combo up on some of those bad boys, fish eye and matrix mode whilst kicking the guts out of scary spiders!","November 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

It's got two game modes that you can sink a lot of time into perfecting, and the price is on-point. Lots of entertainment for only $7!

It's fun but challenging. I wish the developers would add controller support. As of now the controls are OK. All around a good fun game.","November 4, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"
