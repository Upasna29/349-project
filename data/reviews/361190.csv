I reviewed Sparkle 2 as one of, if not the best jellyfish eating sims available.  I stand by that review even today, as we look toward the future, or more accurately, the near present, to Sparkle 3.\n\nThe big question, which is to say, the largest one, is just how does Sparkle 3 live up to the legacy?  Pretty well, actually.  There are some new twists on the eat everything in sight until you get big enough to eat bigger things and so on gameplay.  Quests have been introduced, and if you think that a phytoplankton can't do quests, well think again bucko!  These aren't the standard "kill ten rat" quests either.  Why, I just finished one that required killing nine jellyfish.  Take that, boring old quest games!\n\nSeriously though, when you play a Sparkle game, you're not looking for fast paced excitement, you're looking for a relaxing game with depth, and since this game takes place in the ocean, its got plenty of that.  Enjoy the calm, serene atmosphere as you drift about, eating things and getting larger.  Its a good time, even if it does make me think of my ex-wife.","April 25, 2015","true","11.8"," 65 of 74 people (88%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","88","65","74","38","0"

But to grow, it must eat microelements. These will be stocked in your Genelab and depending on what you want your Animo to be, you'll add them to DNA (making a red, blue or green pet with its own power). A red animo will have the power to rush, the green to be invulnerable for a few seconds (very very practical when in a tunnel quest) and the blue will drain every element around. But you can also play with other possibilities.\n\nIn each little world, you will have quests to do, like investigate tunnels (and make sure not to hit a sort of flower unless you want to be thrown a layer deeper), defend nests or attack other species. While there is something like 10 worlds, you can come back to them later and eat elements, though the quests, as being fullfilled, will not reappear. The more you grow, the more your Animo will develop to the point where it will be big.\n\nAnd while the gameplay is repetitive (eat, eat and eat and do quests), the soundtrack is amazing and the visuals are esoteric like in Sparkle 2 Evo. But true, you have more parameters to take into account, the quests are more varied than  before and it is easier to fill the DNA compared to Sparkle 2 Evo.\n\nThe controls are also very intuitive, whether on keyboard or on gamepad, though I prefer the gamepad for it.\n\nYes, it's not the game of the year. Yes, it's essentially Sparkle 2 Evo but more understandable (at least for me). But I can't say that I found myself happy to be in that enchanting world, with an amazing soundtrack and better visuals. I don't know why but Genesis seems to me more appealing than Evo. Maybe because the enemies changing layers disappeared and that I don't have to run after them.\n\nA very relaxing series, with Genesis as ice on the cake. Release me that soundtrack and I'll instabuy!","April 27, 2015","true","21.3"," 72 of 87 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","72","87","0","2"

Your goal is to consume nutrients scattered around, slowly growing from a tiny creature into a huge (relatively speaking, of course) behemoth. You have full control over your creature’s evolution (which is largely similar to RPGs’ level-up system), and unlike in Sparkle 2, you don’t have to worry about eating particular elements if you want to evolve in a certain way.\n\nTo spice up gameplay, you regularly receive tasks from the scientist who created you, and completing all tasks on the level allows you to move to the next one. Some tasks make the game a bit action-y, but it remains fairly easy overall, and most of gameplay consists of casual exploration of your environment. (One particular kind of challenge – Spikey Rivers can be quite hard, but it can be bypassed effortlessly if you evolve in a certain way.)\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing game with occasional bits of action, Sparkle 3 has my full recommendation!","January 10","true","19.4"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","0"

Your critter drives like a bus but slowly gets more agile.  Then they throw you into the third area of "spikey rivers" and expect you to expertly maneuver your slug down a long path just wider than it through currents and spikey trees that blend into the background and make you start over if you so much as come close to them.  After half an hour of attempts, I got halfway through and ragequit.  I came back later to try again and after another half hour ragequit again.\n\nYou can't bypass it.  You have to get through it in one attempt.  Could I have evolved my critter to better handle this challenge if I had known about it beforehand?  Maybe - too bad you can't change your upgrades without restarting.  If you look at the achievements, about half the people who get to this area make it past.  I honestly have no idea why they decided to make something so aggravating in a game that's supposed to be about relaxation.\n\nThe other quests weren't a whole lot better.  Save these eggs from the predators?  Okay, great.  I feel vaguely heroic.  Ok, now eat all the eggs because the omnipotent power says he doesn't like them anymore?  What?  That doesn't make any sense and immediately pulled me out of the experience.\n\nOther than that, the in-game text is poorly translated with grammar errors in more or less every blurb.  Overall, it feels very unpolished and unprofessional.  The graphics are the only thing it's got going for it (they are quite pretty); the music is nice for five minutes but gets old very quickly.\n\n3/10 with 6 stars for the first two levels and then -3 for the third.  Only get if you're an absolute fan of the series.","July 11, 2015","false","4.1"," 44 of 66 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","44","66","9","5"

It is a simple game, with simple controls, great graphics and a passable soundtrack. If you have a couple hours, this is a good game to play.\n\nGraphics\nEverything is well drawn and animated. The color scheme changes depending on the stage you're in and enemies and yourself have a detailed appearance. The background is great and seeing the lower layers of the stage under you is very nice.\n- 10/10\n\nSounds\nThe background music is good, although a bit repeatitive. As far as I know, all the stages have a different soundtrack, which is great, but each tune is short and you can hear the full song a dozen times during a single stage. It is not that noticeable though, since you are usually focused on making a difficult pass in a tunnel or trying to evade an enemy in the middle of whirlpools trying to bring you to the lower layer.\n- 7/10\n\nGameplay\nIf it moves, you eat it. If you can't, you break it, then eat it. If you still can't, stop trying to eat the wall or a stream. You get bigger when you level up (as you eat), and you can increase some of your stats by combining nutrients into aminos, up to 49 times, with increasing proficiency as you get to higher levels. What you chose to make into amino changes your appearance and your special power. The enemies are all pretty simple to kill. Everything is simple, but well done.\n- 9/10","April 26, 2015","true","6.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","1"

The bright colours can be quite straining on your eyes when you first start playing but after about five minutes you get used to it.  Honestly though, I expected more - much more - at the start of this game. There are a limited number of levels and only three different shapes you can be depending on your level - either a red, blue or green organism. There is not much to do other than follow simple tasks that don't ask much of the player, other than the odd few tasks that are extremely difficult to complete. There is no HP meter or health bar etc so you cannot die, meaning that the few enemies and one boss fight aren't challenging at all - more laborious. However, my deep affinity for evolution games and the empty hole left by Spore kept me playing this game, despite all that is wrong with it. Overall, I think it would be much more interesting if there was more freedom given to the player, e.g. the same evolution system but utilised in a different way, such as the nutrient points could be 'sold' for certain body parts you could place on your creature, wherever you wanted.  Also, I like the idea of having your 'creator' looking in and talking to you, but maybe a deeper storyline would help. To sum it all up, I would only recommend this game to people who love evolution style games.","May 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The game in itself is a wonderful bump from the second Sparkle, Neo i believe it is, with a better leveling system with a cool DNA sync system, making the gamer feel more in control of the little spark it cares for with point distributions. The maps are what i would expect them to be, and the new quest log and mini-quests in the maps are cool, giving a bit more to do in content.\n\nNow for the fun part. The game seems, unbeatable. It might just be me, but i like to complete things, i desire to eat every little element i see so my sparkle can become a big and strong destroyer of all things living in the void, which is bad it seems. My little spark couldnt move around well in areas with spikes and forced currents, making the 3rd, YES, the 3rd map incompletable. I cannot move to the 4th map until i collect 80 something elements in an impossible to navigate area, thus stopping all progression. This is a terrible design choice, and i dont see why i should stress out over what should be a casual swimming and eating adventure. Ive been stonewalled.\n\nLearn from my mistake, or make a new file and do the bare minimum so progression is possible. With that said, i was about to give this a massive thumbs up, but becasue ive stumbled upon a literally game breaking mechanic, ill toss my joy aside caused by build-up of stress. Ill leave it open long enough to trigger the free cards, and after that, ill never open this particular title again.\n\n5/10, wont microbe again.","September 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 32 of 63 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","32","63","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/recommended/361190/","jpsf91","jpsf91","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/","478 products in account","First off, let me say that this game has an incredible ambient, graphics and especially music. And just for that i recommend it. In this game you are a sparkle, an organism that needs you to grow it by eating stuff. However, i find this game very disapointing especially in 2 aspects: the quests and the sparkle growing system. First off, the quests in this game are boring. You'll need to eat food in tunnels (which is really frustrating if you don't know the secret), and defeat other organisms. And this is the variety you'll get. All the monsters can be killed in almost the same way, and the final boss is the same, only bigger than the others. And you can't repeat quests. For the second aspect, i'll be honest: besides the three special attacks that each of the 3 sparkle types have, the stat growth is almost pointless. Even at level 50, the sparkle will be slightly better than level 1. Sure, you'll notice for example that the red one is faster. And the grinding is terrible, especially because it'll make almost no difference. I never played sparkle 2 Evo, but i feel that this game is a very lazy reskin. It sounds cool, will entertain you for a bit, but it'll get boring fast, except for the music. So, i can recommend it on sale, for about 2-3 hours of fun and the rest of lazy grinding, without replaying quests. And there's also some bugs, like even if you lower the volume on the settings, it won't work. Buy with caution.","July 4, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Want to be faster/stronger? Eat more of the corresponding color. Sparkle 3 has a level-up system; eat all you want and decide afterwards how you'll progress.\n\nFrom the start (from what I remember), your organism is much more tank-y in 3 than in 2. What with the multiple stats to consider when levelling, I assume it's possible to get as much maneuverability out of your organism in 3 as you'd in 2. Both movement and consumption (absorption) rates are slower. In 2, movement affected pretty much only your head - your body would coil around and follow it. In 3, the axis seems placed at/near the actual center of the body - no such turning-on-a-dime movement, thusly.\n\n\nI've 0.6 hrs on record currently; 100% Sparkle 2.\nI want/expect to do the same for 3.\n\nI recommend this game to:\nThose who enjoyed 2 and wouldn't mind more of a "gamey" experience; 3 is still casual, but what with obstacles and quests, it's not near as mindnumbing as 2 (though, that soundtrack though...).\nThose who haven't played 2 and aren't after such casual-ties (heh... heh...) as 2; understand that - what with the slow movement and absorption rates - 3 is still chill, but you'll have to actually make an effort to get through, as opposed to 2, in which simply being in-game damn-near guaranteed success.","July 21, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I mean sure if it's meant to be a philosophical game, but this is a game about a non descript aquatic animal eating other more descript aquatic animals. I mean maybe I'm just being paranoid and it's actually about a mad scientist turned ecologist, which is a pretty entertaining idea honestly.\n-Obvious lack of knowledge of and/or lack of willingness to depect evolution and animal diets realistically. "Blue = omnivore" .... yah.... I mean I get it's all simplified for gameplay mechanics, but it's not good to perpetuate myths and falsities about evolution (evolution is a multi generational process, it does not involve animals changing shape before your eyes).\n-General art style is very nice, but I'm not a fan of the new player animals designs. In Sparkle 2 they weren't based on a real animal either, but these look like something from the Rayman universe with their segments magically held together without connecting.\n-Quests are a good idea in general, but they remove much of the freeform element which is largely what made Sparkle 2 unique. Have you ever had that moment (looking at you Lego games) where you can't die but a level is just that tiny bit too difficult to deal with at the moment? So you're just endlessy trying again and again? Some of the quests really begin to feel like that and it spoils the otherwise relaxing atmosphere of the game.\n\nOverall I give Sparkle 3 a 6/10, a decent game and worth trying out especially for the price.","October 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I prefere Sparkle 2 Evo over this one. It feels kinda overworked and as if the original concept got lost on the way. I appreciate the game but since there is choice between this and the previous game, I recommend S2E and not S3G.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I don't like the controls and it's annoying that to make your creature go in direction you want EFFICIENTLY you have to point it way further in that direction that it is needed, i.e. if you want it to go slightly to the left you have to move your cursor a lot more to the left than needed, otherwise it'll miss its destination.

First of all the PC Controlls are awful and do not work properly. The Game also kept crashing every now and than when I went into a whirlwind. Also the graphics are horrible, it is so bright you could think there is constantly Bloom on (even if you turn it off in the options).\n\nThe Stuff that your little sparkle is eating is also rather hard to see as the overbright area overcolors the food. Therefore it is almost impossible to tell which color your sparkle is eating right now. Another thing that dissapointed me was the level design, as Sparkle 2 Evo had alot to explore, this game had nothing of it. Everywhere is just big parts of food that you can swim into. I personally found it rather boring.\n\nIf you want a nice Evolution Game Try Sparkle 2 Evo.

Illuminati centipede, in case you're wondering; http://i.snag.gy/HDsXM.jpg\n\nUnlike the previous game, this one isn't relaxing at all, as there are several quests of which are frustrating to get through. Two of them being the flower ones where you have to get through tunnels, the other being the maze one with the jellyfish. By the time you're at the maze jelly fish one, you're rather long, and if the tip of your tail so much as taps the tip of a jellyfish then you're sent to a level below. Needless to say, this is rather frustrating. I know that I haven't played for 10 hours or so, however I'm not going to spend that much time on a game that's more frustrating than it is relaxing.\n\nIn short, this game doesn't live up to the previous Sparkle game, and it lacks the soothing/calming effects of previous games.","October 13, 2015","false","3.5"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

Much thought went into the ambience, the music, the tone and presentation.  This game is polished in a way that few games in its class are, the rough corners sanded down to create a truly pleasant experience second only to Osmos, IMHO.\nSo it was a surprise and annoyance to find that the level of care and creativity that went into making the game didn't map over to the pacing of the game.  The first two sections of the first level are excellent, everything I could ask for in a casual game like this.  Then the third section, the 'Spikey Rivers', jumps several orders in difficulty. You must navigate a slim river, without touching the sides, as it goes through a dozen hair-pin turns, another dozen tricky rapids, and ever-changing water currents coming out of nowhere, and if you touch the sides once you get sent back to the start of the river.\nAfter the 20th try, I shut the game down and looked online to see: is it just me, or did the game really jump from something kids can play to something experienced hardcore gamers are abandoning after unsuccessfully navigating the Spikey Rivers?  As it turns out, it wasn't just me.  Every page of reviews I looked at, from many diverse sources, was full of posts filled with words like "frustrated" and "ragequit", and people resignedly abandoning the game because you cannot proceed further until you finish the Spikey Rivers quest.  The pacing in this game - in the 3 parts of the first level that are all most people ever see - is analogous to being taught to play checkers, then to play Osmos, then being told you can go no further unless you master Russian Roullette.\nIf you think I am exaggerating, look up any other review... the only ones saying they didn't stop playing after the frustration of the Spikey Rivers either say they'll try again later, or say they won't play again until the makers fix The Problem.  But aside from giving players the ability to treat some quests as optional, I don't see how they can fix it. The game is beautifully and consciously designed, every part fits the rest perfectly. Except for the part where any fun you were having falls down the oubliette never to be seen again.\nLoads of promise, a few fun levels, and then... that.","August 12, 2015","false","23.9"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

Your eyes will suffer, especially at night\n-	Big big problem with objective Spikey rivers (see below )-\n-       the actual play area is not as big as you might think\n\nLevel 3 - spikey rivers or "the rage quit generator" (required to further advance in the game)\nIn this objective, you have to navigate a long, narrow, labyrinth like "river" that has spikes and currents (that push you into spikes). Touch a spike, go back at the beginning, this objective is extremely frustrating.\nYou see, the level is not that hard, but, because you can level up quickly and easy, when you reach the river, you are too ...long and big. Navigating the river like this is a nightmare, almost impossible.\n--- To avoid this --- start the objective as soon as you reach level three. You should not be bigger than 3 body part/ plates, or the currents will sweep you away :).\nBesides this, the game looks like it has fun potential.
