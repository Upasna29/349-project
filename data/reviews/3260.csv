Make sure the game is installed on the same hard drive as steam. Usually the C drive.\n\n2) If the game flickers. Go to your steamapps/common folder then safecracker2. In config AND STEAM_config files change bFullScreen=1 TO bFullScreen=0 and save.\n\n3) I also had the game freeze on a black screen. To resolve this in my case i went to Nvidia control panel, manage 3d settings. Safecracker2 then manually turn Antialiasing mode to off. That solved all my issues and yes it was worth it.\n\nI love games that put your brain to the test and Safecracker certainly did that!\nThe puzzles were varied enough to keep the whole experience interesting. It was nice having a subtle story behind it too, as it gave it more meaning. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy solving puzzles and feel rewarded when they finally crack a safe.\n\nTook around 6 hours to complete and i found having a pen and paper handy helped :)","February 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 133 of 138 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","133","138","0","3"

As other reviewers are saying, it won't hold your hand--the puzzles are pretty darn difficult and usually don't explain themselves. But that's the appeal for me. It's like I really get to be a detective in some movie or something, and I have nothing but my wits to go on. The downside to the difficulty is, of course, you WILL get frustrated from time to time--pretty often, in fact, so if you don't like scratching your head too much, this isn't your game. But the difficulty of the puzzles and having to figure out even what you have to do to figure them out means that you get a huge rush from solving them. Not joking, the satisfaction of solving these things is great, makes ya feel like an extra-special clever lil cupcake. Beating the game made me feel like a genius.\n\nI do want to point out, someof the puzzles require you to give up on the room you're working through, try another route, then come back when you've gained a clue or insight from somewhere later in the game. If you have to come back to a puzzle, it doesn't mean you've failed, and you're probably doing what you're actually supposed to by saving it for later.\n\nThe problems I did have were mostly interface ones: when you do get a verbal clue from your character, it is only ever said once, and there's no way of it being logged in a Notes menu or anything, so if you go AFK for a minute at the wrong time or don't have your sound turned on, you can miss the hint completely. The hints usually aren't going to be crucial to solving a given puzzle, though. Also, I wished it was easier to move around the house; because the game is a point-and-click, you walk down hallways by clicking your mouse in the direction you want to go, and the screen changes to the part of the room you're in as you move. There is a map in your menu that gets marked off when you solve the puzzle in that room, and I wanted to be able to "fast-travel" or something similar by clicking on the room I wanted to go to, instead of having to go through the whole house one scene-frame at a time. It IS a point-and-click from the early-2000s, though, so not a lot to be expected there.\n\nOverall, I loved the game, and when I was done, I went and bought another whole package of point-and-click puzzlers from the same company, I liked it so much!","January 29, 2015","true","13.1"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

If you think most puzzle games are too easy, you will like this one. Note I am saying the game is challenging, not obtuse. The solutions are fair in this title. You may have to look for context clues, but they are there.\n\nIn 2015, the graphics are nothing to write home about, they still look good in my eyes. This is an old school click-to-move first-person puzzler, by the way. No true 3D here.\n\nThe audio is fairly thrilling and haunting when it wants to be. Player character is masterfully voice-acted by some British fellow whose name I cannot track down.\n\nOne last thing. This is an old game. You will need to play it in windowed mode. The game does not provide a way to do this out of editing a file named config.ini in the game's directory. Edit the bFullscreen variable in this file to equal 0 instead of 1.

The idea a rich guy retired and went into making ridiculous puzzles to hide his fortune is quite interesting and funny.\n\nThat being said this game makes me rage quit a lot, maybe I am not good at puzzles but I generally find myself stomped on puzzles trying to figure them out. Till i recently tried taking a picture and pasting it into gimp to put trials for example of what i tried and what failed in different colors. It felt really cool planning out the path to complete the puzzle in some instances and gratifying when it worked.\n\nThe game links puzzles together in some instances where you get parts for completing some puzzles and had to piece them together to complete others to go into the rooms. I really liked how the system worked basically the locks on doors were only accessed through solving the puzzles around you and limited your freedom of movement but the more you solved puzzles and opened doors the more pathways you had to return to places you came back from.\n\nI would defintly recommend this game to people who like puzzles and jotting down notes trying to work out what paths didn't work out or not to deduce where to go to beat it!\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269577246","June 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

Safecracker is a Point-n-Click style adventure game with a first-person perspective and 3D environment. You play as a professional safecracker hired to find the long-lost will of some guy who owns an oil rig. This game was released in late 2006 and the graphics are pretty stellar for it's time. Clean, sharp textures and smooth lighting. However, this isn't saying much as the majority of the game takes place inside an old Victorian manor. The puzzles are very interesting and require a wide variety of logic and situational awareness.  My only complaint is the somewhat steep learning curve for some of the puzzles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwash/recommended/3260/","iwash","iwash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwash/","585 products in account","In this point and click game, you move from room to room unlocking safes and solving more puzzles to get more clues (and pieces of other puzzles) to solve more puzzles until you finally solve them all and say "oh good, I solved all the puzzles.'\n\nFor the first time in aaaaaaages I found myself using a sheet of paper to solve puzzles in a video game. This was a pleasant surprise - I found myself noting things I'd never need, as well as making notes that really helped me solve puzzles without having to backtrack to look at something again. Don't be fooled - the game does give you some clues you can take with you, but some things have to be carried in your memory only. My memory is awful, so I used paper. I am only writing this review so that I don't buy this game again by mistake. That's how bad my memory is.\n\nDo you like solving puzzles? This game has some neat puzzles, and I don't think a single answer annoyed me, which is rare.\n\nDo you hate sliding tile puzzles? I do! But this game only has 1, and you can cheat (like I did. I have no shame. I hate sliding puzzles).\n\nThe game is linear in the sense that you will need to solve some puzzles before you can solve others, but it is also not linear in that you don't need to unlock a clue before you can solve a puzzle. I solved one early puzzle by writing a simple script. Later I found a clue that was useless to me at that point, because I'd already solved the puzzle. The game didn't make me wait until I'd found the clue, which was great. It's awful to play a game like this and know that even if you're entering the right code, it won't work because you didn't pick up a porcelain pig with the number 7 scratched on its ♥♥♥.\n\nThere are no porcelain pigs in this game. Porcelain pigs are not playable characters. If you like pigs this might still be the game for you, but don't go into this expecting pigs. There are 100% more pigs in this review than there are in the game.\n\n\nFor the first time in aaaaaaages I found myself using a sheet of paper to solve puzzles in a video game.

Don't be fooled - the game does give you some clues you can take with you, but some things have to be carried in your memory only. My memory is awful, so I used paper. I am only writing this review so that I don't buy this game again by mistake. That's how bad my memory is.\n\nThe game is kind of short, but it's stable enough that you can tab in and out, so you can play it when you're supposed to be working and then tab out to pull up notepad++ or whatever it is you use at work. I don't know - I've probably never even seen you before, so how would I know what you use. Maybe you are unemployed. Maybe you made a ton of money lawyering and retired ridiculously early to rule an Internet Space Empire and have a cute dog. It's all good here, we're just talking about a little game about solving puzzles. I'm not judging you. I'm judging this game, and it is pretty good. Is it $5 good? Yeah, it's worth the price of a sandwich. Even if its a sandwich you have to cram resistors in before you can eat it.\n\nThe game might be a bit of a puzzle to get started. That happened to me but I edited my config files. If you have a problem making this run, go to your Steam directory and go to /steamapps/common/Safecracker2 and open config.ini and STEAM_config.ini and change bFullScreen=1 to bFullScreen=0 in both of them. If you have notepad++ you can do it there.\n\nThe ending is a bit bland and I don't think I will be replaying to get all the different endings. It might be my imagination but at the end the narrator seemed to start talking as fast as the people at the end of financial product advertisements where they cram in all the stuff about how you will probably go bankrupt and lose your house and the respect of all but the lowest of bums. This actually made the ending better, especially as I looked away for a moment because my printer started working.\n\nThat's the biggest mystery. WHY DID MY PRINTER START WORKING.\n\nI'll tell you why. At the end, the game says "do you want to print the will?" and I said "Yes, sure," thinking I'd be able to read it on the screen. Of course it really tried to print the will, and I stopped it by hammering the big red x button until the printer stopped making noise.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who is married and likes to play games at night while your spouse is sleeping in the same room and you have a loud printer and you are likely to just click in the affirmative on a button that says "DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A NUCLEAR-DETONATION LEVEL OF NOISE RIGHT NOW?" then this might not be the game for you.\n\nIt's not bedtime yet so I got away with this. I'm wondering if I should print the will, though. I don't have that recent a save file. If I don't print the will, I will miss out on the game's REAL final puzzle. If I do print the will it will all be white text on black and it will cost me an extra $30 to have played this game. It's like the cat in the box but all the outcomes are bad, like if you were allergic to cats but also terrified of cat corpses.\n\nI liked playing this game, it was a pretty good time for $2.50. If you want a pretty good time and you have $2.50 then I HEAR YOUR MOM MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT.\n","May 17, 2014","true","6.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

My solution was to run it in windowed mode (via config file). Not a perfect way, but I've hardly seen any downsides.\nApart from that - don't get it wrong. It is a puzzle-puzzle game. It's short, it has next to nonexistent plot (which at the ending seems not only nearly nonexistent, but unnecessary as well). All in all - guys, it's not Myst, ok? It's a collection of assorted puzzles in a comfy environment. It will be a mistake to see it as anything but.\nAnd so, the cornerstone of the game - puzzles. Puzzles are mostly really good. Some are quite inventive, some do a sort of unexpected play on widely known puzzle (like a famous pipeline puzzle with restricted movements, for instances) But, well, at the same time couple of puzzles are really dumb, while others just require decent amount of mix-and-match, which is not that fun. And of course, it can't be unmentioned - The confederate Cipher wheel WAS NOT used this way. It's a vanilla Caesar cipher in game! Come on, son! The whole point of cipher wheel is to scramble the letter statistics. Why can't you've used the proper codeword instead?! Oh, and a 6 moving pins puzzle is WAY too easy for it's own idea.\nThat said, other puzzles are fairly decent and inventive, though I've actually managed to solve 2 or 3 of them by semi-random clicking.\nSo there you have it, it's a compendium of puzzles set in a nicely drawn decor. Some are genuinely good, some are fairly stupid, some are unnecessary hard (that damn broken lock!). So pick it up on a sale cheap, go have your grey matter for a swing for an evening or two, but be cautious whether you'd manage to run it properly on a modern system.","February 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Seems the gramps was quite eccentric, to say the least, loved puzzles and safe machines, and decided not to inform anyone which of his 5 family members is the heir -- no surprise they'll do anything to have the will found!\n\nIt's a short game (2-3 hours) but really well made, the high production level is evident in the good graphics, not to mention the amount of well-designed and non-trivial puzzles.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=23653309\n\nThe environment is limited to the inside of a giant mansion, with dozens of rooms spread over 3 levels and an enclosed garden. Every room is decorated to the highest level of detail -- papers scattered on a desk, chairs, paintings, different clothes in a walk-in wardrobe, sofas with cushions -- everything you'd expect in a mansion belonging to a well-educated and intelligent yet somewhat eccentric millionaire.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=41225340\n\nThe puzzles share the same level of detail, the various boxes are engraved with different patterns, the wooden surfaces lacquered and polished to a high sheen, golden keys with intricate handles -- there's too much to list it all, and that'd spoil the fun. But the presentation of the boxes are not the only selling point of Safecracker - the puzzle are quite tricky to solve, some require a flexible mind, some a good pair of eyes and a keen observation sense. There's ciphers, hidden keys, sliding blocks, lasers, wire boxes, and much more!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=83427764\n\nI can't really find any reason not to recommend this game, especially since it's not expensive, at £4.49.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMcD/recommended/3260/","TheMcD","The McD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMcD/","668 products in account","This game disappoints on almost every front. A spiritual sequel to the 1997 game Safecracker by Daydream Software, this game puts you in the shoes of a professional safecracker tasked with finding the will of a recently deceased oil baron hidden inside his mansion. Now, let's go over the standard review claptrap:\n\nGraphics: Good-looking, but terribly bland. For a purported eccentric, this mansion is generic as hell apart from the occasional interesting bit, and it just puts me to sleep. Thumbs down.\n\nSound: Once again, the music is serviceable, but terribly generic. Half of it feels like it's trying to fit into a horror game, but this isn't even close to being a horror game. Thumbs down.\n\nPuzzles: The game's strong point, but even then, it doesn't fail to disappoint. Half of the puzzles are painfully uninspired, and even those that are fairly interesting fail to provide a meaty challenge (apart from one that is just unreasonably annoying to go through) and are instead leave you with a fairly resounding "meh". And to add insult to injury, the 1997 Safecracker had more interesting puzzles. Thumbs down.\n\nPlot: Yes, this game apparently feels its plot is important, and honestly, it's a joke. Way too little time is given to flesh the characters out, and in the end, the game expects us to make a decision based on our judgement of those characters we don't have a bloody clue about. Thumbs down.\n\nOverall: A complete disappointment, outclassed on every front by its predecessor, and it comes along with technical problems to boot. Not recommended.","December 17, 2013","false","9.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There were plenty of the puzzles that made absolutely no sense as to how to solve them. After finding the method online, the puzzles were a little more fun, but still, the game just ran you around in circles, with no hints or clues as to solve any of the number of safes. The visuals themselves were pretty great, with lots of pretty scenery to see around the giant house, though I wish the game has been set at a first person view, allowing you to freely view the house, instead of the frame by frame. The voicework was decent, though sometimes being rather emotionless, as if the VA for the expert safecracker just didn't seem to care for it as much, especially during the ending voicework.\nMaybe I'm just not as creative or cunning as the rest of the players who might have enjoyed it. I normally enjoy puzzle games, and this one just had me shaking my head.

And here's my review:\n\nGraphic and sounds: Why do I start with these parts of the game first? For a game made back in 2006 where I still played pretty much every adventure game based on Agatha Christie's novels, which were also made by The Adventure Company, Safecracker has such a pleasant 3D graphic though the camera is panoramic so you can only move your camera angle without making any actual movements. The soundtracks may not be plentiful but quite attractive to my ears due its intriguing theme provoking my curiosity.\n\nStory: The plot of the game is pretty simple. You are an expert on cracking safes, having a stereotypical British accent and get hired by family members of an eccentric multi-millionaire oil tycoon who possesses an interest in making safe EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THEM HAS ANY MONEY IN IT, to find his will. There are subtle plot points on his relationship with his siblings and relatives but they do not weigh in much regarding the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: There is not much gameplay in this game yet you can find the sense of variety due to the *absurd* amount of different "safes." There are safes requiring keys, safes using lazzzer, safes using numpad, safes using physics.  It is unlikely to crack a safe similar to another in terms of the solution and how to find it.\n\nDifficulty: This is actually my most concern  about puzzle games because games like Syberia and The Longest Journey can be ridiculously hard and impossible due to its fictional logic. Safecracker is on the other side of the spectrum, where everything is logical and sensible given you have the tools to solve it. There are 20-25 safes to be cracked in the game and 5-10 of them require you to use clues retrievable from other puzzles and about 10 other cracks demand you to have keycard or a activating device to use on them first before actually solve them. The average length of time for me to solve 1 safe fluctuated from 5' to 25' and some are ridiculously complex that I needed to get some fresh air before continue cracking it. There are only 2 safes that I have to look up the solution which are the safe with 5 wheels on the 2nd floor and the chess puzzle on the loft.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is dope and is quite a remnant for its genre. I do not know any similar games that were made recently. I never had to pull my hair which also surprised me and the bloody safes are not that hard to crack at all. This game would even impress me more if it had MOAR safes and the final choice did have any actual meaning or made you feel your decision matter.\n\nScore: If Conan O'brien means perfect and Jay Leno is diarrhea after Taco Bell night, then this game gets a Craig Ferguson while flirting with any female guest. Yes, it means the game is good.","March 2, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Also, it can't handle any other resolution than the standard (which is like 800x600 or something), it won't start in a multi monitor setup if the config is not tweaked beforehand, and it likes to crash.

But before you get the game, a few things should be stated.\n1. You do not roam freely around the house you have to explore. Instead, you click your way to waypoints, much like with Google Street View, and then have a 360° picture of your surroundings. Interactive objects, such as one of the many safes, can be simply clicked on.\n2. The puzzles are hard, but (mostly) fair. I recommend having at least 3 sheets of paper and a pen beside you when playing. They will definitely come in handy. One thing to keep in mind is that you will not be told what is the expexted solution of the puzzles. Had to look up two of them because I simply didn't get what I was supposed to do.\n3. A few of the puzzles are actually well-known. I immediately knew the answer to one of them simply because I've solved the exact same puzzle in another game and recognized the patterns of quite a few of them (  the water canister puzzle with 8, 5 and 3 units of water, if anyone's wondering  ). Can be interpreted as positive or negative.\n4. The story is, well, meh. I can see the devs really did put quite a bit of thought in how to fit the puzzles into the story, and did actually do a decent job at it, but the game is, in my opinion, mostly about the puzzles.\n5. The ending leaves you slightly unsatisfied. No cut-scene or anything, just a text-based decision to make with a text-based outcome. Seems like the devs didn't want to put a lot more effort into creating an ending.\n\nNonetheless, it was a lot of fun while it lasted. The overall atmosphere is undisturbed and somehow inspirational, too. The music is sometimes a bit dark, but doesn't feel too displaced in any situation.\nWhat I found strange was that the game wouldn't start if I switched the Steam language setting for this specific game to English. I had to play it in German - not much of a problem for me, but still kind of off-setting.\nOh, and one more thing ... if you're a diehard fan of smooth graphics with lots of effort in lighting and whatsoever, move on. This game clearly isn't for you.\n\nIn total, I'd give the game a solid 7/10. Worth buying if you like to spend a few relaxed hours with tackling some well designed puzzles, especially at this low price.\n","February 14, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would love to give this game a chance, but I can't even get to a puzzle within the first 5 minutes, let alone feasibly beat it.

Playing in windowed mode helps with that; after manually editing some config files.\n\nSecond, the game is in first person mode for no reason whatsover.  It head tracks and does it without any support for mouse inversion.  For me, this was almost a dealbreaker.  I managed to set up a custom profile for my gamepad to mimic the mouse with inversion and this helped a little - but still wasn't great.\n\nThe game itself was enjoyable, aside from the movement.  But, those issues are bad enough that I can't really recommend buying the game.","October 11, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is known to cause problems on any system with Win7 or a later version. For me on Win 7 it was sufficient, to edit one entry in the .ini to turn the game into windowed mode, but it seems that this easy step does not work for everybody. So you might be forced to do some additional research and steps to get the game running.\n\nWhile testing said fixing step, I started the game vie it's .exe and not through steam and then finished the game in one session. So my shown game time is incorrect.\n\nWhen the game finaly runs, it is a nice point&Click adventure with some really good puzzles. It's not too long (about 4 hours), but it isn't expensive so that's what you might expect. If it's still too expensive for your likings, wait for a deal or but it within a bundle.\n\nI did not experience any bugs inside the game after I got it running.\n\nWhile the game is mostly fun, it's ending is really awsome and, in some kind, unexpected.","November 21, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles range from simple to "I can't believe that took me nearly 2 hours to figure out how to do!". There is no true guide for anything but that's part of the puzzle (and reason it claims I spent 9.5 hours in this game)\n\nI advise any interested to wait for a good sale because there isn't any replay value to be had- the puzzles aren't updated or changed and there is no DLC or continuing saga.\n\nI caught it on a very cheap sale and enjoyed the puzzles, but could have easily done without the attempt at a plot at the end.","January 9, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
