Think of it as Portal, but with an emphasis on movement physics rather than focusing on spartial problem solving. Its a rather unique mix that can be best discribed as a Jump and Run semi-FPS Speedrun game. Developer Team 5BitsGames tried hard to create a game that uses its game physics to create a very frantic game where shooting isn't the only important thing to do. The result is a unique mix of the two popular games Quake 2 and Portal.\n\nAnd in my opinion it is much better than the Portal games alone.\n\nGameplayWhile you still get to shoot flying robots and entities that are formed like Cubes, the gameplay is more about moving yourself in ways you wouldn't even think of in other games. More specifically the largest factor you have to consider before buying this game is the focus on movement and a calm and smooth aim rather then twitch reflexes. Furthermore memorizing each level, up of the entire game is essential for finding new ways to complete your quest in climbing the tower-themed world once again if you choose to play through it for another time.\n\nOr in other terms, DeadCore is the perfect learn how to Speedrun game. From the beginning to end I never reached a part that was overly frustrating. The entire game really opens up once you see that this game wants you to Speedrun it instead of merely playing through it once.\n\nAs an example, the first level, which serves as a tutorial took me about 40 minutes to finish when I played through it for the first time. The second playthrough however, after a bit of foreplanning and with the small-but-useful skills you unlock during your first playthrough, took about 6 minutes to complete. A Leaderbord is included so you can compare the time it took to beat any level and even the entire game with your friends or everyone else if you choose to.\n\nA Story does exist but the devs made sure that it is not rubbing you in the face. Rather then progressing with the story, you unlock bits and pieces explaining the setting by finding hidden Data Cubes through your journey, which can be accessed via a built-in journal. The Devs certainly knew that games like these focus on the gameplay. Its because of this focus on gameplay that the story itself becomes entirely a optional or even a entirely seperate factor, but it is still interesting to read through the bits and pieces you will find if you want to explore past the obvious routes. Theres also different upgrades to be found, which aren't needed if you want to beat the game, but should be gathered anyway if you try to speedrun the game. Otherwise you're up to a even greater challenge.\n\nAnd that uniqueness the strongest point this game can offer to you. What may seem like a 5 hour long game that can be beaten in less then 20 minutes if you put creativity and foresight into it. Not with knowing about the route you went before, but finding a better way through the game that wasn't obvious to you during the first time. This is very similar to oldschool jump and run games, or games Speedrunners already have lots of experiences with. Or in different words, DeadCore is a modern game but with an very oldschool Heart and Soul. It takes the FPS genre, completly subverts the way people usually play these games and creates something that is almost unique.\n\nGraphics and SoundWhen it comes to the general artistic direction, this game does look very solid indeed. Mint colors and the familiar 80's Neon look define its artstyle, which is often inspired by the movie Tron and the game Tron 2.0 yet this game achieved to still have a unique soul on its own. Premodeled shapes like cubes and slopes are placed as part of this games world. Each levels has a slightly unique style which also comes with the different lightning and a truely excellent skybox to create a fascinating atmosphere.\n\nWhile the artstyle is the most positive factor here when it comes to rating the visuals, with its corny-cyberspacy look and feel, the problem here is the quality of the models used to build the levels. Sometimes I noticed that it does look a bit cheaper than I would've anticipate by looking at the screenshots from the steamstore page. Considering how open this world is this is not a major issue but its still worth mentioning that the game isn't always this good looking.\n\nThe sound, at least for me, seems to be the worst part about this game. Don't get me wrong, I love EDM as a whole but for the music in this game seemed rather generic. The minor varity of it is still a plus regardless. It also doesn't add anything important to the good atmosphere of this game. Furthermore the sound effects also don't stand out in any way but like the music, still get the job done.\n\nSo while the Soundtrack and the sound effects are the worst part of the game, they're still good enough to not consider they're out of place. Its just that the game is excelling due to the phenomenal freeform-speedrun gameplay and overall great art design that any other factor pales in comparision.\n\nVerdictWhile not perfect, its obvious that 5BitsGames really cared about making this game "just right" without overblowing it with features or making it too short. In terms of lengh, one playthrough is about 2 times as long as completing Portal 1. And like Portal 1 this game allows you to think outside the box without being too condecensing if you don't and as a result it becomes expecially rewarding to play it on your own device, without any guide. Seeing that you finished one level in just under an hour in your first playthrough yet only mere minutes after the second one feels extremly good.\n\nThis game is a great example on the beauty of choice and out-of-the-box thinking right here. And this is something similar puzzle games like Portal 1 and even 2 could ever give to you.\n\nRecommended food while playingMentos as a occasional snack or Peppermint Tea (I recommend Earl Grey, but tastes vary) if you prefer a drink instead","July 26, 2015","true","12.0"," 146 of 160 people (91%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","91","146","160","29","10"

It's fast, it requires you to think quickly and act quickly but not to a level it get's really frustrating.\n\nThe artwork, well you either hate it or you love it. It's very simplistic with neon like effects at the same textures over and over again. But who gives 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about that anyway, the game is beautiful in many aspects. The music fits too, which ingame is much more ambient than the trailer(really didn't like the music there so that's a good thing too(♥♥♥♥ dnb)).\n\nFew things you're not going to find in this game:\n->A good storyline. There is one, and it consists of logs to clear up your lost memory(doesn't get more original than that hur dur). They aren't awfully well written either. I just looked at them and was like 'mmwyeah lets ignore those' lol\n\n->Puzzles that require more than 2 braincells. It's just not a thinking game. Not to be confused with Portal, which has a somewhat similar style\n\n->Enemies that are actually a treat to you. lol the enemies are probably the worst thing so far. They're just ''kamikaze cubes''(it's worse than it sounds though) and they're extremely predictably placed over the map. They've got a different color than regular cubes so you can just pick them off immediately. Somewhat saddening, but I didn't really need enemies in this game anyway.\n\nLater on there're some more advanced enemies which I won't spoil. But they aren't really anything either, they're all pretty uninteresting by design(to me at least)\n\nWhat you can expect however is:\n->Some neat-o floating sky platform-world which makes as much sense as the idiot who came up with the idea of giving this game a '' storyline ''\n\n->Smooth gameplay, apart from some minor pointers like getting stuck on the edge of some cubes here and there\n\n->Clever level design\n\n->The level design actually rewards you if you decide to go for an alternative route, which there're suprisingly many of.\n\n->Some damn sweet and fitting sounds. Including the music\n\nI mean for 40 euros this game might've been really dubious in more than 1 way. But for 10 euro, ah hell naw boii. You better get this, it's great.","October 17, 2014","true","2.8"," 131 of 157 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","131","157","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/284460/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Nowadays, video gaming is a hobby shared by almost everybody in the whole damn world. There are hardcore players, who’ll spend hours upon hours playing the same game because they need to be the best. There are the story players, who can lose entire weekends to titles like the Mass Effect series, bonding with those on the journey and sharing their ups and downs. There are more casual players, who enjoy nothing more than a few levels of Angry Birds on the commute to work. And then there are the type of masochistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who like platformers like Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy, and a recent addition to the list Deadcore.\nLet me take a step back and explain. Deadcore is a new platformer produced by Namco Bandai and developed by 5 Bits Games. It combines fast paced platforming elements with twitch-gameplay FPS elements. This creates an experience that’ll keep you living in the moment, one eye on the obstacles you’re trying to navigate and the other looking ahead, planning the path you’ll be taking. It’s the type of game that requires lightning fast reflexes and the patience to put into practice that age old motto; If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.\nDeadcore throws you straight into the action with little fanfare or fluff. In fact, the story isn’t revealed to you at all; it’s up to you to go and find it.  Hidden throughout the levels are various collectables, including songs from the games soundtracks and documents that piece together a story. A story of a man desperate to escape from…um, someone… Look, I’ll level with you, I didn’t find many of them, and the ones I did find were all spread apart from each other so they didn’t really form a cohesive plot.\nI found that intriguing, though. It gave me a genuine desire to go back and see what I’d missed, not many games do. While some of them are hidden in plain sight, maybe around a corner you could quite easily spot. Many require you to go the extra mile, finding new routes and thinking about the game in new ways to experience all it has to offer.\nI’d love to be able to label this as a free running platform game, but it just doesn’t tick the free running box for me. If it combined the elements of gameplay it already has, with aspects of Mirror’s Edge, I don’t think I’d be able to contain my excitement. The gameplay it has doesn’t lack excitement though. The controls are tight enough to feel like you’re in charge at all times. Whenever you throw yourself into a laser wall or off the tower you’re trying to climb, you know it was entirely your fault.\nDeadcore’s level design was exhilarating to me, incredibly clever and well thought out. Many sections of each level have multiple paths. As one of the in-game logs states; “There are several paths to choose from, but everyone’ll tell you the same thing; only the quickest one counts”. It’s a matter of trial and error to find which one is indeed the fastest, but I can foresee the speed running community having a ball with this game.\nThe shooter element in Deadcore is pretty interesting, cause there aren’t many enemies in the traditional sense. While you won’t be gunning down hordes of aliens, bugs or soldiers, that trigger finger will still be kept busy. The primary use for your gun is to activate and deactivate certain areas in the environment. There are boosters that propel you forcefully in their pointed direction, and you might need to turn those off mid-jump to save yourself from being blasted to your doom. There are blocks that come to life and chase you, exploding when they catch up and almost certainly knocking you from your platform.\nThe game, like most modern platformers of it’s type, handles death very well. When you die, you respawn almost instantly, and there’s a button you can press that forces you to reappear at the last checkpoint immediately. No frustrating waiting times or irritating loading screens with ‘helpful’ tips. You die, you get back up, you move forward again. Rinse and repeat. The checkpoints are placed far enough apart to prove challenging, but not far enough to cause any anger when you fail.\nFinally, one of my favourite aspects of Deadcore is the draw distance on the tower. At any point, you can turn and look down and see the levels you’ve already made your way through, the obstacles you’ve cleared. Looking up shows just how far you’ve got left to go, and what you’ve still to face. The first time I noticed, it left me dizzy and slightly nauseated. It was breathtaking.\nIf you’ve got the patience to keep at it, Deadcore is an amazing new take on a tried and tested formula. The gameplay elements it combines run seamlessly into each other, with nearly flawless level design. It offers immense replayability for the Speed Runner crowd, and a challenging, rewarding experience for everybody who plays it. This is definitely one to add to your collection.","August 21, 2015","true","82.5"," 85 of 93 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","85","93","2","5"

This is not Portal.  This is not Portal.\n\nThe entire point of the Portal series was to make games that are both challenging AND accessible to the widest possible audience.  Valve tuned the levels specifically to get as many people to drop their hard earned cash as possible.\n\nYou can tell this is the case, because Portal 2 is not Portal, Only Way Harder.  Even the first game pulled its punches in how far it went with the puzzles -- they wanted players to fully understand the mechanics without being overwhelmed by them.\n\nDeadCore, on the other hand, is a game made for a very specific, very small audience: FPS speedrunners.  It is not made for anybody else.  The entire point of the game is for people who are already crazy skilled to show off how crazy skilled they are, and for everybody else to watch.\n\nNote I said "watch", not "play".  If you are not already someone who speedruns games, this one brick walls its difficulty starting around level 2.\n\nIt requires very precise movements, and demands twitch reflexes to pass the puzzles.  It uses infinite respawns as an excuse to ambush the player with traps that cannot be avoided on the first playthrough.  It makes the player (and the player's hitbox) completely invisible -- you don't even have the visual feedback of casting a shadow, so good luck navigating stacks of moving laser walls in 3D space.\n\nIt is a game that expects you to die over and over again, without any thought or consideration as to WHY you'd want to keep doing that.  And why should it: if you're already committed to speedrunning a game regardless of how fun it is, then why should basic game design concepts like difficulty scaling and pacing even matter?  The harder and more unfair a game is, the more you can show off.\n\nTo be clear: it is totally fine to make a game that's super difficult, and aimed at the hardest of the hardcore.  But what that means in practice is that most people are going to be more entertained watching speed runs of said game, for free, on Youtube, than paying money for the experience.  I actually recommend anyone who isn't a speedrunner do exactly that, spoilers be damned.  If you're still interested, at least you'll have a fair idea of what you're getting into.\n","December 20, 2014","false","4.8"," 538 of 779 people (69%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","69","538","779","30","25"

You also use a weapon, but game involves very little combat, as your enemies are just mechanical traps which the weapon disables for a brief moment. Game also features some mind-bending gravity shifting & jump-pad mechanics, which only add to the overall flavor of super tough experience.\n\nYou have to keep in mind - this game was designed with speed-running in mind. Given, i beat the game in 8 hours and my actual run time not taking into account all trial-and-error was 4:11 hours, you can see how much repetition can the game require from someone with not that decent hand-eye coordination. However, with perserverance you can definitely beat it and the pay-off, while confusing, in the end is worth it. Despite all the frustration, i do see it as a great, unique gaming experience and i do recommend it you try it.\n\n+ Graphics - very, very cool and in places (especially epilogue level) breathtaking.\n+ Level design - though some checkpoints are too scarcely placed it is manageable.\n+ Sound design - very good, all actions you perform give adequate feedback and add to the mysterious sci-fi atmosphere.\n+ Performance - first i thought it wasn't that great, but it was, turns out my integrated and dedicated GPUs were fighting about this game. However there are few notable locations in game where the overwhelming amount of enemy-trap thingies and visual filters murder the fps. That does not hinder game progress however.\n+- Story - depends on how you look at it, there are logs scattered across the levels that tell the lore, but i did not find the story to be a significant part of the game. I will, however, look up all the possible endings cause i don't believe i can achieve them myself.\n- Music - i personally didn't like that drum & bass here at all and found it a little unfitting, but perhaps my slow pace had something to do with that.\n\nOverall score - 9/10. A great purchase, definitely not only on sale price.

Some patience and practice can give a very rewarding feeling everytime you hit the next checkpoint.\n\nThe game at it's core is an obstacle course, where the main goal is travelling from point A to B through lethal traps and pitfalls.\nEarly on the game teaches you that you can use and exploit any object in the physics-defying architecture around you, sometimes even using a trap itself to propel yourself forward. This aspect of Deadcore adds a puzzle element to the whole experience, so it's not just a twitch-based runner. Combining the puzzle aspect with the branching paths in each level the game lets you carve your own trail opting for a safer or a faster route. Even though there are no walls, no ceiling or even a floor most of the times, you can still be creative in how you progress through the labyrinthine levels, since there are multiple ways to crosss each obstacle. The player can be slow and methodical at some parts figuring out the way for himself or use timing and platforming skills at others. At first you will only be able to traverse a basic path as the developer intended, but the more tools and power-ups you unlock, the more the game itself opens up to you.\n\nDeadcore also rewards exploration and pushes the player to search for 3 different types of collectibles. First type unlocks more bits of the story helping you to understand your environment and it's purpose. Second type unlocks more music tracks, ranging from ambient to D'n'B and jungle beats. The third type opens up completely new paths in the levels, adding even more complexity and replayability.\n\nThe main and only downside that comes to mind is the game's lengh. Takes about 10 hours for a slow casual player like myself to make 2 full cycles of the game and unlock the "secret" ending. After that point, any replayability is based on speedrunning and ranking up in the player lists, or achievement hunting if that's your thing (all of achievements easily feasible).\n\nIn summary: Deadcore is a butt-clenching adrenaline fix with a unique gameplay experience, part puzzler part speed runner.","July 9, 2015","true","12.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","28","33","4","4"

You have to be very precise in your jumping and shooting otherwise you will fail. If you fail, you must try harder.

It might even be so hard that certain players will simply drop off, but if you are not afraid of insanely complicated puzzles you have to give this a try.\n\nA lot of skill, fast reflexes and quick maneuvering are keys to solve the riddle throughout its 5 levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubillium/recommended/284460/","kubillium","Kubillium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubillium/","222 products in account","So, Deadcore kind of appealed to me because it seemed like a fun puzzler in the style of the Portal series, it looked very futuristic/cyber and the overall graphics were very appealing. Additionally there's this whole mystery with "What's on the summit of the construct?!" -- these thingies always totally suck me in.\n\nIt's really a game that lets you jump around a lot with a very interesting mix of jump'n'run finger agility  tasks and at the same time some nice puzzle elements. You get a few different abilities to play with (double jump, air dash, and the switch gun with two shooting modes, essentially) and you progress only via checkpoints after a big puzzle or a small set of shorter sequences. There isn' a lot of story or anything that would immerse you deeply. You can find some logs on the way to uncover a few flavor texts adding to the experience but in the end it's always about getting up and wondering what's up there. Besides the hidden logs you can find a few upgrades for your abilities (more ammo between checkpoints, higher juming, faster dash recharge, etc.) and some music tracks.\n\nFor me, as someone who can be an aweful jump-precision dyslexic, the game took almost five hours in total for one playthrough with not nearly all upgrades and logs. Later playthroughs will be faster since you already got a bunch of upgrades and more experience. Also, once found, you will keep all your abilities even if you replay some levels which opens up new pathways to progress. Other than that there's not a whole lot of replay value unless you want to do speed runs and fight for a spot on the leaderboards.\n\n\nThe Yummies   Great price for the amount of hours you play it\nGood graphical presentation\nGood level design\nNice ambient sounds\nCool enemy types\nBasically no bugs encountered aside from maybe two avoidable issues at certain points\nThe option menue allows you to set the depth of field value so you can kind of regulate the felt pace/speed for yourselfThe level design is cool and futuristic. It's super open and you can always see past levels below you which gives the game sometimes a continuing fun-house experience (interestingly enough my fear of heights never kicked in while looking down). The sound blends in nicely into the graphics and the setting overall. You don't have super loud stepping sounds, all rocket jumps from platforms basically blend into the surrounding ambient humming and there's nothing that will really ♥♥♥♥ you off. The only sounds that stand out are the different kinds of drones that will be in your way; they all have very distinct sounds that will make you go 'uh-oh' by the end of the game.\n\nSpeaking of the drones: What I like about them is that there's only a single kind of drone that can actually kill you in the end. All the other kinds of drones are just there to poke you and ♥♥♥♥ you off: One lets you see your perception of some colours so you won't see deadly laser barriers anymore, one just bumps into you and shoots you off a cliff, etc. They are highly annoying but you usually get a chance to safe yourself if you react fast enough.\n\nThe level design is mostly very good and there are enough ways to build a huge amount of interesting tasks with varying degree of puzzle factor and agility requirements. In a lot of cases you get to choose a super fast reaction route that can be very unforgiving or a path that makes you train a certain rhythm of actions to reach your goal. But most of all levels focus very much on a certain kind of agility training, so there is not a lot of real puzzles left (although I still had to stop and think at times on how the devs thought this will be possible to do at all).\n\n\nThe Bummers   No controller support\nIt can definitely make you rage-quit a couple of times\nBackground music ruins the cool ambience sometimes (unless you love drum&bass I guess)\nVery bland story/additional information about the whole construct\nSome tasks/puzzles are not clearly laid out\nSometimes the checkpoints are just put at stupid spots on the mapI was a bit disappointed by the lack of background music. Most of the time you don't hear a lot (which might've been a good sign because the music blends in but in the end it was just nothing noteworthy there to listen to) and when you hear it you want more than just the two minutes of it. Also, the music is kind of hit and miss. Given that I totally despise most of drum & bass I still found some very nice parts in some songs in the game but a lot of times I was kind of bored or annoyed.\n\nThe other thing is how hugely disappointing the mystery of the summit is. I mean, there could've been something but in the end you reach the thing, jump into a white hole and then it's over. There is no explanation whatsoever aside from a cutscene that basically just shows the whole construct moving a bit and then it fades out. The logs are just so horribly written that I didn't bother to read most of them really carefully since it was either some weird monologue about some of the tasks you are going through (and some of the drones/abilites) or a dialogue that mostly just talks some sensei-stuff that is utterly boring.\n\nFinally, there is this whole rage-quitting thing a lot of people are complaining about and I kind of get it. It can be super annoying when the drone you just disabled wakes up just half a second to early or you fall down from that one doulbe-jump 'n dash sequence for the tenth time. Also, at some parts it's completely unclear how you should be progressing there without going for some healthy head-to-desk-repeat action. Also, sometimes checkpoints are coming in at a ridiculously high frequency where you just think "where was the problem here, I was just walking in a straight line?" At other times you will find yourself playing for 2-3 minutes going through an insane adrenaline rush inducing sequence that's really hard (and can let you die a couple of times) and then you respawn back at the beginnig. Some better ordering of the checkpoints might've helped here.\n\n\nThe VerdictThe main problem with most people playing the game is probably that they think you can play it like a Portal game. What DeadCore actually is is a side-scrolling jump and run that is played from a first-person perspective. For about 50% of the game I didn't know that myself and was at times ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about how some sequences are laid out. But in the end I understood that it's not about puzzles and thinking, it's very often just about running into something and figuring out the rhythm. Then you will get adrenaline rushing in your blood and after a longer sequence you land on a checkpoint, turn around, look at what you just crossed and think "Wow, how did that happen, exactly?"\n\nThose are a lot of moments where the game shines and is super fun. At the other hand some sequences are so hard to manage or way too long that it makes you freak out and punch something Borderlands-Brick-style. But those are not most moments. It's a game with a high sense of urgency that is very real once you find a bunch of timers running inside your head on when to jump next. It's fast and keeps up a nice pace with only few moments to catch a breath. Oddly enough I found it very relaxing to play after work because of all those immense jumps, combined with the your abilities which give you a real nice sense of free movement in three dimensions.\n\nAll in all, if you're not sure about the whole rage-quitting thing wait for an 50% off or more offer but if you're into annoying jump'n'runs /and/ Portal, go for it and buy it.","January 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumdadumdoo/recommended/284460/","dumdadumdoo","Dum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumdadumdoo/","233 products in account","Probably one of my top five games released in 2014. It's a shame practically nobody knows about it, it's super fun. So fun that I actually went out of my way to review it because I feel like it deserves more attention.\n\nTo sum up the game, I would say it is a speedrunning fast paced game based around mobility. If you played Dishonored and liked the blink mechanic, you'll love this.\n\nThe aesthetics, graphics, atmosphere, and soundtrack are all fantastic. The gameplay is super fast paced, but the overall pacing of the game is good. It introduces new mechanics at a good pace and doesn't overload you with information. Then, it tests you on it all.\n\nThere's a great feeling when you manage to pull off something crazy such as pulling off a crazy stunt that you think that the developers probably didn't realize you could do. But the thing is, the developers did know probably. The map design is phenomenal. Because the game takes entirely in the sky, every single thing placed is deliberate and every jump calculated. So, when you pull off that crazy jump, you know at the back of your mind that you beat the developer's challenge that you didn't even know they were challenging you to.\n\nDeadcore is one of the few games that I've actually wanted to go back and replay. Because you unlock new mechanics and powerups, going back and replaying levels to see new areas that you can reach and collecting "sparks" (which reveal new parts of the level) is super satisfying. Beating a level five times faster than you did originally is a great experience that really shows off how much you've progressed, through mastering mechanics and unlocking the new ones.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a good story, this game doesn't really deliver I think. The story is entirely given through text files which you can collect. I haven't really read them, so it's possible they're really good. However, I like to leave it up to my imagination to come up with an explanation for the game and I feel like reading the logs might ruin it a bit. I might be completely wrong, but just be aware that this is not really a story driven gamemode. Your goal is to get to the top, not to save the universe.\n\nThis game is almost flawless, but it is important to point out the flaws.\n\nFor one, even though almost everything in the level design is deliberate, I did manage to find a few things that I clearly was supposed to come back to later. For one, at the beginning of a certain level if you are observant enough you can find an alternate route. Getting to this route would normally require a powerup that you would unlock if you went the normal route, but you can use some of the nearby launchers to get there. Maybe this was intentional, maybe not. I did this in my first playthrough, and I was able to beat it without the pretty important powerup, as you don't actually need it for the alternate path or the rest of the game. When I finished the game and realized what had happened, I felt kind of punished for being resourceful and observant.\n\nSecondly, similarly to the first, there was one point in the game where you could get to a "spark" (which, once again, unlocks new sections of the game which require mechanics you unlock later on) by playing around with the environment a bit. Once I got to the spark, I realized that I clearly was not supposed to be there since it was impossible for me to progress without the mechanic I hadn't unlocked. This one is a bit more forgivable since I had to go out of my way to get there and I felt like something was wrong.\n\nThirdly, one of the last enemies you encounter in the game feels really cheap and unpredictable and can really screw you up. For a game based around perfection and speedrunning, getting killed in a nearly unavoidable way is pretty annoying. Definitely the only parts of the game that I really disliked the design of and felt like it was more artificial difficulty than challenging.\n\nFinally, there are some small bugs with the instadeath lasers and gravity fields. Sometimes they don't work, sometimes they're unclear, sometimes they don't reset properly. It's extremely rare when it does glitch out and typically it only glitches out at specific parts of the game, but if they get you killed when you're hauling through the level as fast as you can, it can be frustrating dying for no reason.\n\nAnyways, if I had to give this game a rating I would probably give it a 9.5/10. It's almost completely flawless and easily worth the $10. One of the most fun games I've had. Provides a solid challenge while being fair almost the entire time, in a way similar to Dark Souls almost.","October 26, 2014","true","14.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The game feels very polished and well rounded. The story is pretty bare, which is fine because that isn't the game's main focus at all. The main goal is to get to the top of the tower using coordination, puzzle solving, and some minor FPS elements to disable enemies or traps. The campaign doesn't take too long, however speedrunning the levels can get very addicting. This game uses tight controls and good level design (most of the time) to provide an enjoyable experience to the player, casual or hardcore.\n\nPros:\nGood graphics and world design to emmerse the player in the game. While it's nothing phenominal, it's definitely above average.\nThe puzzles and level design provide for entertaining gameplay and feel very fluid despite being very challenging at times.\nTight controls make the platforming feel fair and fun to play.\nSpeedrunning modes to put your skills to the test. It compares you on the global leaderboard and on your friendslist leaderboard.\nThe extra pickups are very well hidden and are a great addition for completionists.\nNeutral:\nThe music is decent and adds to the atmosphere of the game. While it isn't the best soundtrack I've ever heard, it definitely fits the genre and helps keep a steady rhythm while you're playing.\nCons:\nThe enemy placement can be a bit frustrating in the final few levels.\nOverall:8.2/10","January 29","true","16.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/284460/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","DeadCore pulls absolutely no punches in being exactly what it wants to be.\n\nA first person, speedrunning focused sci-fi platformer, it's unabashedly everything it proclaims itself to be and doesn't give a damn if you can keep up with the absurdly high performance requirements placed upon the player. So I guess it's fair to say it accomplished its goals, that it became the game it was designed to be, but for all it's gorgeous particle effects and impress sense of speed it's so obsessed with being this monumental hurdle to overcome that it neglects to ever give you a reason to want to.\n\nThere's no difficultly curve in DeadCore, just you and a brick wall of unintuitive level designs, agonizingly spaced out checkpoints, stiff controls, and everything that's ever been a problem with first-person platformers. Its perspective is likely it's largest oversight, as it makes it extremely hard to accurately jump onto minuscule platforms when you can't see where you're landing, and having to constantly look down to counteract this obscures the omnipresent series of instant death obstacles you have to simultaneously dodge.\n\nI never felt in control playing DeadCore. Every jump was a gamble, a roll of the dice deciding whether I miraculously made it through or would be sent back usually not knowing why I died, or feeling like I was being punished for things I had no chance of avoiding. It's overwhelming and constantly punishing, to the point the idea that I would return to try and better my times was almost laughably ridiculous.\n\nFor as constantly as it reminds and urges you to make your own path, progression in DeadCore is unrelentingly strict. Any diverging paths usually boiled down to an occasional fork in the road or making an impossible jump that might have saved me a few seconds, but I was always trapped in this impenetrable obstacle course. Level designs are obtuse and at times forced me to do things that felt like I was breaking the game because there was no other discernible way through. The purity of its mechanics is then lost as I unsuccessfully tried to perform the tasks set before me as the game continued to tell me I was either doing it wrong, or not doing it well enough.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the top of the tower I'd been ascending throughout the game, my sigh wasn't one of satisfaction that I'd finally managed to overcome the seemingly impossible obstacles that stood in my way, but one of relief that I'd never have to go through them again. I have no doubts that there are people DeadCore will simply click with, who would tell me I'm just bad at it and if I would only give it more of a chance I'd begin to enjoy it. Be that as it may, completing DeadCore just once was such an unbelievably stressful and frustrating experience that I can't imagine willingly taking on that task again, and would feel sick with myself if I recommended anyone else do so anyway.\n\nYou can read more of my reviews on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 6, 2015","false","4.1"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","47","75","0","6"

Yay!\n\nDeadCore is a fantastic FPS parkour puzzle speedrunner game. The objective is to reach the top of a mysterious tower by running, jumping, and using your trusty Switch Gun to activate and/or deactivate switches, enemies, moving walls, and gravity fields, while trying not to get disintegrated by lasers or fall to your death (which is by lasers most of the time anyway because a floor of lasers follows you upwards whenever you reach a new checkpoint). Most of the enemies don't actually kill you, but the turrets and troopers launch you away (often into lasers) and the mosquitoes slow you down (so you can be killed by moving lasers).\n\nThe whole game can be speedrun in less than an hour, but it takes several hours to finish the first time, familiarise yourself with the levels, learn some speedrun strats, and find the hidden Sparks to unlock the game's true ending.\n\n+ The controls are simple and responsive: WASD to move, E to boost, M1 to shoot, M2 to aim (personally didn't find much point in aiming), and M3 to blast.\n+ The feeling of speed is very nicely communicated (did I describe that right?)\n+ The graphics are very nice and sleek-looking, even on very low (;_; my computer)\n+ The levels are well designed, with some tough challenges, often with multiple paths, and encourage a bit of exploration to find the collectables\n+ Speedrun mode! Leaderboards! Beat the devs!\n+ Beating the dev times, completing a paticularly difficult section of a level, finding short cuts, finding hidden collectables, and just being launched high into the air and boosting around, gives a lot of satisfaction.\n+/- The difficulty ramps up quite a bit, and in the later levels you will die many times to the challenges. This is a personal thing, I enjoyed the difficulty but some people won't.\n- Story doesn't really make sense. Or maybe I'm too literal-minded.\n- You have no body and it's a bit hard to know what your hitbox is going to do\n\nOverall a great game, I highly recommend it to fans of first person parkour or speedrun games, and people who like a challenge.","June 7, 2015","true","14.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

Movement is very smooth and jumping has a fair bit of airhang to it to help you know your bearing, you always feel in control and the only jarring thing I can point to is some mild annoyances with narrowing down your hitbox at first.\n\nThe platforming challenges are imaginative and diverse and the level design is solid: levels have a very dynamic and animate feeling to them, where you in contrast feel like a manipulator, dissecting and disrupting the world around you. DeadCore is also quite branched, both in terms of official alternate routes as well as hidden shortcuts that can be found through exploiting dashes and rocketjumping.\n\nOne thing that bears mentioning though is that the levels lean heavily towards the GMOD near the end, where you activate gravity panels and flip in a variety of angles to get to otherwise unreachable locations, if motion sickness is an issue to you or you have a general apathy towards disorientation in platformers, then it's a valid concern and something that may put you off the game.\n\nOtherwise, intriguing atmosphere, smooth controls and high quality level design, definitely recommended.","November 1, 2014","true","16.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The gameplay really dragged on with the only change as you progressed being the frustration of the obstacles. For about two hours I had a lot of fun with the fast gameplay and the gorgeous graphics. However, that is really the only good thing I can say. Th difficulty curve was harsh and unforgiving. About and hour and a half in I hit a point where it became more frustrating then fun. The enemies don't make it harder or more interesting, just more annoying. the story is only told through logs, and I think if it was presented through a driven in-game story the game could have benefitted. The game also feels like it drags on. after two hours I would look up and feel like I was only a quarter of the way up the tower, which was really disheartening.

The clouds are also 2D projections which follow the player's gaze. But none of this actually affects gameplay, besides ruining immersion a bit. I think the sound design is awesome, though, and overall I think this game takes many inspirations from Portal 2's style. (edit: I feel as if later in the game, the developers stopped striving for a 'wow effect', which is okay, I guess. There's only so much 'newness' to go around. I noticed when I went back to the first level from the third.)\n\nOn the gameplay: I like it. Platformers have classically been the prerogative of 2D or 2.5D. It's very nice to see a 3D platformer, and intriguing to see how unconventional and innovative platformer mechanics have been shown in this game. Another thing I like is the freedom for the player to explore each "level" and choose their own path, seamlessly (through that level, not through different levels in the cycle), apart from areas where the player cannot go "back down".","October 23, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Death & Retry is the core gameplay loop, but it's never frustrating as we're dealing here with "fair" difficulty, where only the player can be in cause of failure (not the game itself).\n\nFinally, the atmosphere is amazing, both graphics and sound do a pretty good job at putting the player in a true sensation of vertical immensity, and the falls are always scary, which brings a good tension into the mix.\n\nGreat job 5Bit Games !

DeadCore is an exploration, reflex, puzzle, first person platformer (good lord that's a mouthful) with a heavy emphasis on speed and timing. Visually it looks good, while it's not pushing the boundaries of graphics for the future, it still looks beautiful for what it is.\n\nGameplay wise it's a giant navigation puzzle and a fast one at that, your objective is to climb the tower, at first it's pretty basic until they introduce you to the switch gun, the switch gun allows you to turn switches on and off, it sounds pretty simple and it is at first but, usually consisting of "open this door" or "Turn on this jump pad" but it starts to get pretty complicated and reflex based pretty fast with turning off fans to prevent you from getting sucked off of the map while you're jumping to a platform that requires you to turn off one jump pad, turn on another and then turn off the turret shooting you..all while moving fast.\n\nThankfully the controls are hyper responsive, i have not had a single instance where i've needed to use the switch gun, jump and move and not being quick enough due to unresponsiveness, all controls react in an instant and in a game like this that's paramount.\n\nIn story mode you are able to take your time if you wish, though the switch gun has a timer built in to it so you can keep track of your time if you want to, the real heart of the game lies within it's speedrun mode, this is clearly a game built for speedrun fans and it shows.\n\nIt's a really fun game and for the price it's well worth the purchase, i'd even go as far to say that i would of happily paid a little more for it, If you're a puzzle fan, you'll love this game, if you're a platform fan, you'll love this game and of course if you're a speedrun fan, you'll feel right at home.\n\nI highly recomend you check this game out.\n\n\nEDIT: Now over 10 hours in and i'm still loving it, even more so than i did when i wrote this review.","October 19, 2014","true","11.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It does share a similarity with Portal but the genre they're both in is as far as the similarities go. DeadCore is vastly different from Portal. Rather than use...well...portals to get around and solve puzzles, you jump around, run, dash, and shoot switches to progress.\n\nThis is a very difficult game. It requires a lot of precise movement to get through the various hazards placed throughout the 5 levels. There's also the added challenge of it being in first-person, which means you can't entirely see your surroundings, but that's not a huge issue. DeadCore is also a fairly fast paced platformer, you don't have much time to react to hazards and other obstacles which gives even more challenge.\n\nThere's also various collectables hidden throughout the game. Music, hidden pathways, upgrades, and even lore. The lore isn't really anything special, but hey, it's there so might as well look at it once.\n\nThe only real problem I have is, because it's in first person, you don't have a good idea of what your hitbox is. This is a problem because later parts of the game require you to go through very narrow pathways, and since you can't see what your hitbox is, expect a lot of deaths. You also can't see any incoming hazards easily, though it's less of an issue.\n\nDeadCore is a good game. It's short, but because of how the game works, there's some nice replayability and some potential for some cool speedrunning tactics.

Others have mentioned this in the forum - devs are looking into it.\n* Some of the gameplay mechanics. For example, many times you will have to 'dash' between horizontal laser beams. Since it's first person and you can't see your character model, there's a lot of guessing at first to know whether your character's hitbox will hit the lasers or not. The gravity shifting mechanic in the second half of the game can also be very disorienting as it constantly shifts your camera automatically. Not a fan of the perspective changes in a fast-paced first person game.","October 24, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have powerful movement options and find tools to make them even more powerful. As you progress, you see flashes of words associated with your immediate task, seemingly the thoughts and warnings of people who have been here before you. Climb to the top.\n\nThis is platforming in its purest form - dash, double jump, avoid death fields, boost high up, create your own shortcuts, shoot down enemy sentries, and keep climbing. The movement mechanics are so robust they have a visual artistry to them. The music is a combination of ambient soundscape and thumping electronica.\n\nWhat little context exists is abstract and light. You find logs with flavor text but they're all pretty interchangeable. DeadCore is just about climbing the tower and (optionally) collecting the sparks that activate something at the top. It's incredibly fun.\n\nNote on speedrun mode: The game has been patched a few times to remove major climbing/clipping exploits, but several still remain. There are obscure ways to boost yourself from the bottom of a level to the top. Unless it gets patched again (which seems unlikely), don't sweat the leaderboards too much and just play it the way you want to.","December 9, 2015","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Tried to make this as complete as I could- sorry it's long).\nAfter watching the trailers, I thought this looked like a pretty fun game... and boy did it deliver! When I dived into it, I was more than just in awe! Deadcore is definately on my list of top games in 2014! I highly recommend Deadcore to anyone who wants a challenge, or likes speed runs, fps puzzle, or platformers in general.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced, extremely satisfying and the mechanics are brilliant. The general idea of the switch gun is simply genius, and adds a unique element to the game. The other abilities are also great- dash, g-mod and blast are unlocked further in and add more challenges and allow you to go back and explore previously unaccessible areas. Please note that the BLAST EXPLOIT HAS BEEN FIXED- so you can't use blast to climp up easily. You will have to play the legit way like I did! :p\n\nThe world itself is dangerous, mysterious and intriguing. It is quite an adventure through this game and it keeps you interested and curious. There are lots of different secrets to unlock- new pathways, and hidden collectibles- logs, music tracks, sparks, and more powerups- like ammo or dash boosts. The logs you find develop a small, story like explination that really adds to the feel of the game. Sparks unlock areas that are a faster route, but also more challenging. Exploring the world is unexpectedly fun- by that I mean that a first glance at the game would not suggest there is the exploration element. The soundtrack is perfect for the game- with a mix of fast paced, awesome tracks. The design is kinda Tron like, and suites the game perfectly.\n\nIt has a very good learning curve and a very high skill cap. You gain more abilities, experience and knowledge the further you get. Sometimes, you will get stuck on a particular part and it will be EXTREMELY RAGE INDUCING. My advice is to NOT RUSH and to analyse the challenge so you know where you're going wrong. Timing can be a very key factor to success. The enemies are cool but can be very frustrating, especially as I found the hit boxes on them are very small- one issue I had was that sometimes you hit the cubes and they don't deactivate- the shot needs to be too central for my liking. Wasps can be infuriating, and turrets are considerably rapid fire. The "bosses" are pretty awesome. Another issue I had was that you don't get a good feel of your size- meaning lazers can often hit you when you think you're clear. Some of the lazers I thought were a little too punishing- particularly ones that rotate. Also, I hate the laser tunnels you have to dash through. Sometimes the game offers little to no room for error- and the slightest wrong move can kill you.\nThis adds to the overall challenge though, and when you do get past that one bit you were stuck on, it is SO REWARDING! Each level gives new challenges that increase your skill. I myself am not very accurate and my reflexes aren't too sharp, but I feel they have improved because of this game- so what I'm saying is even the less skilled players can pick this game up and improve.\nLvl 1 is simple and pleasant- a good eye opener that leaves you jaw dropped in awe as you look up at the massive tower ahead. Lvl 2 is still quite easy, with some more tricky challenges. You are getting tested a bit more. Lvl 3, the difficulty starts to pick up a lot! Lvl 4, for me, was my least favourite lvl. It is the most demanding in terms of your pc- as you're in a storm of effects. The difficulty is extremely high and quite frustrating- mostly on the 1st time. Lvl 5 as a whole is shorter and a bit more rewarding than lvl 4. As a whole is it less difficult, but it has the hardest specific challenges. The end to lvl 5 is extremely rewarding- with a really epic challenge at the end. I won't spoil what you find at the end.\n\nConclusion: Deadcore is a genius game that I definately recommend. It is extremely challenging but equally rewarding. A FEW minor issues, but nothing you can't overcome eventually. AWESOME AND UNIQUE GAME- Want to thank the people behind this awesome game- Deadcore needs more recognition! I am a little sad that I have finished it! XD I would definately be up for a sequel! (That would need lots of thought though). DEADCORE IS AWESOME- BUY IT!  9/10","March 28, 2015","true","27.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Very ethereal, gorgeous, metallic setting, with cool music to back up the pacing. Controls fairly tightly, but can be very frustrating if your reflexes are not up to par. Frequent respawns, and a decent amount of trial-and-error. If you were looking for another Portal, this isn't it. If you were looking for another Antichamber, this isn't that either.\n\nThere's a moderately interesting story hidden in the collectible logs (among the other collectibles), but you likely will miss big pieces if you don't collect all the logs.\n\nIt's pretty dang short and does have some replay value for those interested in collectibles and speedrunning... I got it on sale for $4 and felt that it was well worth it.\n\nI would give it a 7/10, but it's an 8/10 in my book because I think I got a lot more satisfaction out of it than I expected for my purchase.

Now, shall we begin?\n\n+Promising environment and textures - the techy-mystery type!\n+Fitting sound effects - works perfectly with every movement.\n+Great gameplay - involves a lot of speedy runs and jumps, as well as activation of numerous entities! Parkour!\n+Perfect soundtrack - though not the best, it coordinates well with situations, speed, and mood of the game.\n+Tone - not sure how to describe it, but the game gives off a very well-produced feeling of accomplishment!\n\n+/-Pace of the gameplay - depending on how you like it, the game's speed will give you either a feeling of frustration or adventure.\n+/-Challenging - once again, depending on the player, challenges can either be accepted or rejected in frustration\n\n-Difficulty - this is indeed one of the toughest games I've played.\n-Limited demographic - this game is truly for those who like games that are fast-paced, involve parkour, or like challenges. It is also only for those who don't mind dying repeatedly!\n\nThough rather short (if you're good at the game), I've come to really enjoy "running and jumping and falling off things" while playing this game. I've seen people compare the game to Portal, but with all honesty, it's not really. The "gun" that you are given has completely different properties, and the gameplay may be different, but it's original. Most of the time, you "gotta go fest". Moving at "sanic" speed is one aspect of this game that makes it fun (for me at least).\n\nAs for my rating: 80%\n"Dexterity..."\n\nNow, let's go swat some Mosquitos and run past the Troopers!\n\n","June 19, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The scenario for every level of the story, is just gorgeous. About the soundtrack most of the tunes fit perfectly with the game, if not, all of them.\nThe gameplay: It's pretty fun, once you get the hang of. For me the beginning was the worse, the learning curve is a little high. But after that, I absolutely fell in love with the game.\nI completed the story in about 3h 15min (first playthough, lots of fails, not speedrunning, but also not that slow). However, keep in mind that the story has a lot of replayability (collecting some logs, etc.. or just getting a better time), and also you have a SpeedRun mode, which adds new maps, and more hours of entertainment.\n\nAbsolutely recommend this game.","June 13, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fast dying, respawns and reasonable check points help keep it un-frustrating. The music is nice and keeps the gameplay feeling smooth and exciting.\n\nThe levels are well designed and really push the game's wierd futuristic aesthetic. There are often multiple paths to choose from and some are a bit hidden. Indeed, the game rewards you with various collectables for finding some of these areas. As you progress you will enounter new mechanics, often in the form of upgrades. These mechanics usually have to be exectued while platforming somewhat precisly and quickly in order to complete the levels.\n\nEnemies are usually moving laser walls (instant death), turrets(fires a shot that pushes you back), giant fans, etc. This is not a game that focuses on combat and shooting these enemies will either do nothing or just disable them for long enough to run past them. In short, enemies are more like obstacles than enemies of a traditional FPS.\n\nThere is no real storyline to speak of but there is hidden lore in the form of logs hidden about. The logs are short but entertaining enough to read.\n\nThis game seems like the sort of thing that could be very competitive and there are high score boards if you are into that thing.\n\nNot sure how long the game is but I picked it up for under 4 USD and 2.6 hours throughly enjoyed so far, I already feel like I got my money's worth.","June 19, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backstory is a weak excuse to sprinkle collectibles around the levels (there's only twenty of them, they're text logs), and the plot is about as deep as the end sequence to Mass Effect 3. Speaking of three, that's about how many hours it takes to get the true ending from when you start the game for the first time.\n\nThis is the part where you imagine the stern face, the frown, and the shaking of head. This is then the part where you tell yourself, 'who cares! I'm going fast! Wheeee! There's times to beat, things to collect, one way to go, and that's up!'\n\nAs you should! Deadcore feels tight. The running, the jumping, the dashing, the rocket jumping, the platforming, racing along a knife's edge to some sick beats along the looming specter of some inexplicable tower, it's absolutely exhilarating. Once you get a feel for the game, once you learn how to get to the end of the level, well, that's where the racing starts. There's achievements, there's developer times to beat, your friends' times to beat, your own times- you will feel yourself getting better at the game and you might surprise yourself with how quickly you do.\n\nA caveat, though- the game's kind of hard. It's very possible that Mr. Real Time Strategy On Weekends or Mr. Really Good At Last Hits isn't going to make it to the end. There's no losing condition, though, and with as 'short' as the game is, it makes it a very feasible goal. There's no grinding. There's no timewaster, no character progression. There's just you and your own skill.\n\nSure, maybe you can get the true ending in three hours, but there are completionist goals, and the brevity of the game keeps them refreshingly in reach. Again, it's not about putting the time in, it's about gaining skill, and pushing yourself like few games these days push you. And let me tell you, pushing yourself to make it to the top of the tower in under one hour... Mmmngh. Good feeling.\n\nIf you're a twitchy shootery kind of guy, or you dig fast paced platformers, and you think you'll enjoy finding the logs, music, and crushing time records, the game's definitely worth the ten bucks. If you're not, or not so sure of your skill, jump for it when it's on sale.

The running, the jumping, the dashing, the rocket jumping, the platforming, racing along a knife's edge to some sick beats along the looming specter of some inexplicable tower, it's absolutely exhilarating. Once you get a feel for the game, once you learn how to get to the end of the level, well, that's where the racing starts. There's achievements, there's developer times to beat, your friends' times to beat, your own times- you will feel yourself getting better at the game and you might surprise yourself with how quickly you do.\n\nA caveat, though- the game's kind of hard. It's very possible that Mr. Real Time Strategy On Weekends or Mr. Really Good At Last Hits isn't going to make it to the end. There's no losing condition, though, and with as 'short' as the game is, it makes it a very feasible goal. There's no grinding. There's no timewaster, no character progression. There's just you and your own skill.\n\nSure, maybe you can get the true ending in three hours, but there are completionist goals, and the brevity of the game keeps them refreshingly in reach. Again, it's not about putting the time in, it's about gaining skill, and pushing yourself like few games these days push you. And let me tell you, pushing yourself to make it to the top of the tower in under one hour... Mmmngh. Good feeling.\n\nIf you're a twitchy shootery kind of guy, or you dig fast paced platformers, and you think you'll enjoy finding the logs, music, and crushing time records, the game's definitely worth the ten bucks. If you're not, or not so sure of your skill, jump for it when it's on sale. It's popped up in a few game bundles already, so it shouldn't ever be too long between sales.","December 8, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"Do I get angry/frustrated very easily?" If you answered YES to this question then stop right here and turn away slowly. If you answered NO to this question then get ready to die, then respawn, and then die again and respawn.\n\nThis is one of the hardest games i have played in a long time. You have to watch your movements very carefully and watch your back at all times.. one wrong step and your repeating. If you have ever played portal, then picture if you will, one of the higher level puzzles, you have to jump and while your falling open a portal and then when you enter you have to open another to get higher just to reach your platform.. this is sorta like that but x10 lol .. This difficulty almost rivals Dark Souls in such a way that you almost want to go play Dark Souls cause it might be easier at times.\n\nIf you think you can handle jumping puzzles and shooting while jumping without being able to stop for more than a second then go for it i dare you.. No i challenge you to play this game and see how far you can climb the spires of DeadCore.","January 26","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many levels (if not all levels) you can just play and have fun. I have seen that many people compare this game to portal and that is not really correct. It gives you a portal feeling, so if you liked portal you will definitely love this game.

DeadCore's combination of tight controls and fast pace elevate it far above most other Platformer-FPS games. There may be a frustrating moment once in awhile, but once you conquer them you feel like a frikkin' ninja. The game is rarely cheap, so if you die, odds are you just didn't time something right or you messed up. Frequent checkpoints means that attempting a difficult section again is quick and painless. The art style never changes, but creative level design helps keep things interesting. New mechanics are introduced at a satisfying rate, and every tutorial consists of a few floating words and a simple puzzle to get you started. Difficulty scales nicely as you play further as well.

It is constant entertainment with no downtime and although some parts can take you longer to solve or execute properly, the feeling of accomplishment after that is something I've not experienced in ages!\n\nThe controls feel good provided you have a decent computer: it's a Unity game with lots of objects... playing this on my recent laptop (GTX 850M) didn't feel as nice as playing it on a real gaming desktop (GTX 670). There is a bit of randomness (especially in the robots AI) and a few glitches here and there but nothing really getting in the way of the experience. Oh and the aesthetics (visuals, sound design and music) are just dreamlike! Such a strong atsmophere for a game with almost no storytelling (actually there is a lore but it's entirely yours to find out!)\n\nMy first run took me about 4.5 hours. Might not seem that long but any additional level would probably be repetitive, boring or frustrating (also let's not forget this is a small development scale, not an AAA studio); I felt like it was the right "size" and I've thouroughly enjoyed these 4 hours. The replayability is assured thanks to the speedrunning factor: you might not think you are the speedrunner type but try it, because flowing through complex levels with mastery will feel reaaally good!\n\nSo buy the game because it's really worth the bucks!

This one totally slipped past my radar, and if it was not for the great Humble Bundles I would have taken even longer to experience it. To start out, this game is MADE for VR. When VR hits I totally hope we see more games like this because the idea of jumping around some tower in the sky and doing puzzles in an FPS environment is basically what a lot of people are going to go crazy over in the virtual realm.\n\nAs for the game: it has stellar art direction, though the game was obviously made on a budget. I consistently felt like I was actually involved and trying to escape or find whatever the story was pointing me too. I felt like I existed in the virtual realm, and even though I'm only on a 42 inch the game made me feel like I was in a virtual reality prison I had to escape. The devs deserve their win for that alone. They also encourage you to explore the tower and its offshoots with varied pickups throughout and sound files as well some interesting tidbits on the story that are vague but intriguing.\n\nThe level design is fairly masterful and you will always find yourself looking out to see what is around you and how to get there. The mechanics for jumping seem pretty straightforward to me and the momentum and actual controls felt good to me once I got ahold of how to use my DS4 in the game. I wasn't feeling too much lag at all.\n\nIt supports 4K now and you can use a controller with Input Mapper and Xpadder--I use a DS4--or whatever other combination you want to try. Keyboard and mouse controls are fine too. I did have to use custom resolution in Nvidia CP to get it into 4K, and then I added CP FXAA on top of that for a pretty stunning experience at 60FPS. It should also be noted it probably isn't the smoothest looking 60FPS game you have ever played but it does get the job done.\n\nA remarkable game that I hope will someday find its way to more systems and definitely Virtual Reality.","September 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, the "twitch" factor is very high.  To make a pun that current owners of the game will get … it’s “Sky High.”  It is my sincere hope that enough reviewers will echo my sentiments & that the developers will eventually enable a control panel & permit a “God Mode” so that talentless old folks like myself can at least observe the level design & artwork, which is quite good.\n\nI've unlocked a gravity ability, & I have given up on level 4.  I've seen You-Tube posts of nerds with superhuman gaming powers (& obviously way too much time on their hands) hurtling through the levels like a hot knife through butter, yet I apparently do not have the patience to die as much as I have...anymore.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's a gorgeous game.  The movement is good.  The levels are well designed (despite their difficulty & oftentimes confusing mechanics.)  The colors are nice & the textures are good enough.  The game loads quickly & respawning is mercifully instantaneous.  It simply is too “twitchy” & it lacks a compelling story line to keep me intrigued.  The level I gave up on is particularly dark & chaotic.  Keeping track of which way is up became ridiculously impossible.\n\nI would recommend this to someone young with very good hand eye coordination & a LOT of spare time on their hands.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone who has ever experienced a seizure.  Even some folks with no history of seizures might experience one while playing “DeadCore.”  I feel very fortunate to have purchased “DeadCore” for only $3.99 during a holiday sale; I can honestly say that the levels I DID get through were worth exactly that but not one penny more.\n\nOne last thing: folks who compare this game to “Portal” or “Portal 2” are vastly overstating this game.  There’s a gun.  It’s an FPS.  There’s apparently some sort of AI that’s taken over things & made a mess of the world.

It didn't hurt there was an active community as well to be part of.\n\nSo along comes a game designed to capitalise on this as so few games have got FPS platforming right. Great looking and with some relatively tight mechanics.\n\nHowever, where I rarely felt cheated before, past the half way mark deadcore constantly has sections of rote memorisation. There are long and un-checkpointed parts that force you to replay countless times to learn them. Even a half-decent FPS player would find it hard to impossible to judge many of the jumps on reaction. This is especially evident in the gravity sections, with no easy indication of orientation, its very easy to get lost before being summarily thrown into the abyss.\n\nThere are enemies whose only purpose seems to be to frustrate and foil jumping runs, you can only delay and cannot kill them. Your gun has limited ammo between checkpoints, that are again put further and further apart. This gun is required to activate switches yet can be depleted to stop aforementioned enemies, I cannot see how this was a sensible design choice.\n\nOverall, an interesting concept with fantastic graphics, but layering on artificial difficulty with too many frustrating and confusing gameplay elements to remain as fun as it starts.","January 16, 2015","false","4.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/recommended/284460/","zhuinden","Zhuinden (人^▽')～","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/","2363 products in account","I'm at a bit of an edge about writing a review with whether I recommend this game or not. I'd rather say, I don't recommend this to any casual player. This game is technically similar to "They Bleed Pixels", except the game has checkpoints rather than "place your own savepoint" mechanic (thankfully), and it has more puzzle elements to it (gravity manipulation, switching stuff on and off)\n\nSo what does that mean? It means this game is a B**** to beat, it makes you RAGE at every opportunity. Now, you might say, yeah you're bad and you should feel bad, learn to play instead of whining.\n\nBut the problem is that the game doesn't give you breathing room many many times, EVERYTHING is timed, shooting the fans is PIXEL-PERFECT precision targetting and twitch reflex (especially the laser gates, those are really irritating and the only real way to dash past them is, well, trying again and again), jumps need to be near-pixel-perfect, and the moment you'd just stand by to look around you realize there's a Trooper in your face and WHOOPS YOU GOT KNOCKED OFF THE LEDGE DO IT AGAIN LOL\n\nThe game's story is told via "Logs". Now, Logs are a secret item. You need to "explore" in order to find them. However, considering pretty much everything in this game can kill you (and they will, because they are unkillable, you can just "delay" enemies) - Exploration is pretty much non-existent. If you stop to look around, you die by the monsters or the turrets or the time on the gravity modifier switch running out or pretty much anything.\n\nBasically, you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. Exploration is difficult, even though the game itself says it encourages it, but in honesty, the game mechanics really don't. Also, you need extremely good timing with twitch reflex and the like, and to be honest, it's a bit beyond me, so it's more of a "trial-and-error did I get lucky or not" experience for me rather than something that's actually fun - unlike Super Meat Boy Light World which did it right.\n\nI mean really, this is basically a 3D "Torture Platformer", as TotalBiscuit would say.\n\nGet it ONLY if you are an EXTREME MASOCHIST who literally enjoys having to do the same thing 40 times so that you can do it pixel-perfectly before you can move on to the next obstacle which is progressively harder and harder. I'm pretty sure there were areas where I died and respawned 100 times. What is this sh**.\n\nI'm going to beat this game once, then probably not play it again - even though if it didn't have enemies that fly around and just screw you over, and the lasers that you have to dash through at a pixel-perfect time while you're in midair, I'd probably enjoy it a lot more. But I don't...\n\nAnd then there's that enemy at the end which you can shoot down and paralyze (as you cannot kill them) only with 10 ammo, you have 30 max, and if they shoot you then it's instant death, and I couldn't dodge them even though I was dashing. At least you don't have to hit it on one specific pixel like the fans, though. A moving pixel. I don't see how that's fun, that made me retry a particular area 10 times merely because I ran out of bullets trying to hit that thing.\n\nVerdict: If what you enjoy about games is that they're extremely challenging and you have to try again and again and again and again to get it right, and the most important thing for you is to overcome challenges and feel good about your ability, and you are an extreme masochist who doesn't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by having to respawn and try again WAY TOO MUCH, then this might be the game for you. I mean, it does look cool, after all. The music is decent. It's just the game that's literally tedious. I'm a try-hard too, but this game is a bit too much even for me.\n\n(yes, I did play VVVVVV. If I want to compare, this is like having to beat Veni Vidi Vici between each checkpoint, except you get random monster encounters in the middle, and it becomes longer and longer and longer and longer with more spikes and more pixel-perfect obstacles)\n\nBUT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THIS GAME:\n- Platforming (lots of it - double jumping, dashing, shooting at things, walking in walls)\n- Switching stuff on and off with the gun (you have to switch em off or you die, or time turning things on or you die)\n- Gravity manipulation (which of course is also timed, it happens in certain areas where the map provides it - it can be kinda fun but also extremely confusing, and finding which way to go is a pain sometimes - but if it isn't being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then it's actually kinda fun)\n- Trying to find which way to go because once the gravity manipulation comes in and you have to fall down dodge 4 laser gates then dash out to the left and shoot at the gravity switch, it's kinda not intuitive.\n- Frustration\n- Cool visuals\n- Decent music\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY:\nIf you like a game to be really difficult and challenging, then by all means do get it. Hell, you may even tell me that I just suck and this isn't as hard as I made it seem! Because my issues were mostly with how fine-tuned the game was to screw you over pretty much at all times. So for those who are hardcore players, I do indeed recommend this.","November 14, 2014","false","5.5"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freker/recommended/284460/","freker","Freker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freker/","934 products in account","Incredible.  The gameplay behond Deadcore is essentially a first person platform game which just so happens to have a gun to activate things. The game challanges you to climb a large mechanical tower made of levitating blocks higher and higher with checkpoints along the way. Sometimes it seems incredible how high one level can go.\nThe way you get around in Deadcore is by jumping platform to platform, using jump pads, stragetically whilst activating markings on some of the surrounding blocks, whilst dodging red lazers, autoturrets and floating security droids shaped as blocks or orbs which try to knock you off or into lazers in various ways. timing is important.\n\nThroughout the early levels you get introduced to different abilities to climb this monstrous tower of jumping puzzles, turrets and lazers. A double jump at first, a boost which you can use twice before recharging, or hold down for a powerful boost forward and finally a kind of boost orb which when used properly can help propel you in the air after a double jump. However the gun you carry around is more like a tool and you can only fire 30 times, until you get a checkpoint where the gun refils with shots. This can be specially annoying when defending yourself from drones as you try to figure something out, only to reach where you wanted to go and find a marking to activate, with no point but to kill yourself and try again and learn through trial and error.\nJust as you get used to the rhythm of shooting markings to activate jump pads at the exact moment, barely fit through lazers like the Japanese game show concept 'Hole in the Wall', then the game literally turns itself upside down with transparent markings on to of blocks which temporaliy affect your gravity in that purple highlighted area and that's where it gets a bit like Portal, getting completely misco-ordinated whilst climbing a tower upwards, suddenly realising what direction you are facing in mid air and quickly making a landing whilst some floating drones are trying to send a pulse wave so you can get incinerated by a nearby patch of red lazer.\n\nUtterly brilliant and taxing, like my earlier reviewed 'A Story About My Uncle' but instead relies on perfectly timed jumps and a repetition and rhythm as you jump pad to pad and activate marking by marking. It's more like a physical training course and the reward of getting to a checkpoint where you can auto save your progress (and go back to the real world) is so satisfying, but it's so easy to fall into a trance doing each action at the right time and each move at the right measurement and you will swear a lot.\n\nMinimal, mysterious, thrilling and very rewarding.","January 24, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #42 - DeadCore\n\nI used to play Quake III back in the day, and I remember this one level in particular, Q3DM17 : The Longest Yard, which my friends loved to play.  It was different from most of the other levels in that the level took place out in space.  It had these floating platforms, and on the platforms you'd find these bouncypads that would bounce you from one platform to another.  Well, in theory anyway, unless something went wrong, which in my case it always did.  Like I'd get shot in the middle of the air and it would alter my trajectory and I'd miss the landing and fall into the void.   Everytime I'd die like this I'd lose a point (the game considered it suicide), and often I'd end the match with a negative score.\n\nToday I discovered there's a whole game that plays just like this Quake 3 level. It turns out I'm not very good at playing this either.\n\nEach level is laid out with a series of checkpoints.  When you miss a jump and fall to your death, you'll zot back to the last checkpoint you went through (or you can just press R).   Since there aren't other people to kill, instead the game scores you by keeping tabs on how long you take to get to the end of the level.  In fact, the big part of what reminds me of Quake III so much is the sense of speed as you move and jump through the level, as the game encourages you to speedrun.\n\nThe first level is setup to introduce you to the controls and objects you'll find in the environment.  It starts with the basics of moving and jumping around, then introduces you to objects that launch you around, and then things that start shooting at you.  You do end up with a gun, but rather than using it to shoot people, you shoot objects to either activate them (like doors) or deactivate them temporarily (like turrets).\n\nIt sounds pretty basic, but the game gets challenging pretty quick.  Soon you are having to do things like shoot at turrets in the air so they don't knock you off course as you are jumping.  Or you'll end up on giant spinning wheels trying to get your aim right so you can jump to a nearby platform.  Then the game throws this weird looking windmill thing at you that you have to shoot to get the blades to stop spinning so you can move past.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of platformers or are a very casual player, you may be turned off by the difficulty in landing jumps and timing things right.  Personally I found the game to be challenging, but also rewarding as I practiced and got better at navigating the level.  It took me 25 minutes to get through the first level.  The best time is under 48 seconds.  That leaves a lot of room for improvement.","November 1, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Many times, I asked myself: "Where am I looking at? Is the exit this way? Where do I have to go? Am I stuck?".Furthermore, I think the team had to pay taxes on the checkpoints and the numbers of levels, since the checkpoints are very sparse and the levels soooooooo longs. I guess the developpers were not thinking that some people might enjoy a play of 30 mins.\n\nNo editor bundled with the game.\n\nI wouldn't recomand that game until the points I mentioned are fixed, unless you are a huge fan of Shootmania platform.","January 25, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I say now with the utmost certainty that this game met ALL of my expectations...\n\n...In that it is just an obscenely terrible piece of software. At first thought after getting a hang of the basic controls I figured this could be a really cool game that I could enjoy for hours on end, but as its "hardcore" difficulty began to show through I soon realized this game was wasting my time.\n\nCONS:\n- Poor cursor/blast firing; It honestly feels like the blasts aren't going where the cursor is aiming at. Sometimes I shoot a button or object point blank multiple times and it doesn't hit.\n- Atrocious difficulty; it goes from "fair but challenging" to "hideously unfair" in record time.\n- Fake difficulty; this is one of those games that tries to balance out the difficulty with allowing you to die as many times as you want.\n-  Crappy abilities; the incredibly underwhelming Rocket Jump not only barely works half of the time, but also expends a third of your entire ammo, which cannot be replenished until you reach one of the sparse checkpoints, or die. Some parts of the game expect you to use this badly done gimmick with every single bit of ammo, and if you mess up just once, you won't have enough ammo to continue on and have to start over.\n- Confusing layouts; there are very frequent "Where do I go?" moments, this is especially prominent in the gravity modifying segments, where you have a tough time just remembering which way you came.\n- Terrible precision placement maneuvers; I refer to all the instances where you have to "thread a needle" through the laser fields, among other intolerable segments.\n- Substantially less fun blind; this is a game that's only tolerable when you've already memorized what the levels are like. Otherwise you continually run into death traps that you could have in no way telegraphed.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fantastic Atmosphere; It's a huge void that I just itch to explore more and more of.\n+ Outstanding Graphics; The Sci-fi Movie feel the game brings is a definite plus in my book.\n+ Tight controls; despite the level layouts working against it a lot, the actual controls are pretty good.\n\nOverall an awful game at its core despite its pretty visuals. It's artificially challenging, panders to the "pro-gamer" demographic by an obscene margin, and I just don't care for it. I can understand a need for high difficulty, but I've also stuck by the notion that I shouldn't have to practice a typical computer game with the same diligence required in neurosurgery.","November 22, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","4"

This means that even though your fps counter may show 60 (or whatever your maximum refreshrate allows), the game still actually renders only 50fps. The whole engine is locked at 50. If you play on a 60Hz screen, 10 frames will be repeated, creating a tremendously uncomfortable headache experience. The game is supposed to be fast paced. At the moment, you either play the game with the screen set to 50hz (or 100....if you are lucky) so that you can match the game framerate (you will have to deal with input lag at 50Hz).....or you don't.\n\nI chose the latter.

And the ending was kind of cool.\n\nNow for the negatives (disclaimer: my computer is a few years old and is not a gaming PC)...\n\nIf you played Portal, and thought this would be more of that sort of fun (as I did), you should know that this game is not like Portal. In Portal, the levels were basically designed for you to succeed once you figure out the puzzles. In this game, there are more demands on the user to get the right timing, the proper precise movement/alignment, and to react quickly to everything around you. Also, in Portal, you would probably die a few times as you go through it, but your respawn checkpoint was always close so you didn't lose much progress. Not so here; completing a section requires a series of complex maneuvers where you can easily screw up one of the steps. I died a total of 1,034 times my first time through this game. So, if you enjoy a trial and error process where you constantly die, you may enjoy this.\n\nI also found the game glitchy. Maybe it's the age of my machine, but there were many times the game would lag momentarily (consistently at the same places), and it affected the simulation enough that I wouldn't be able to complete my maneuver. Also, it seemed like sometimes my second jump wouldn't respond (and more rarely, even my first jump wouldn't respond). Also, the target areas seem very small, so you have to be extremely precise. Additionally, your gun projectiles seem like they're infinite speed (i.e., you have to click on exactly what you're trying to hit, not try to lead the target so that the projectile actually impacts the target when it reaches it on your screen).\n\nAll that to say, my experience was more aggravating than enjoyable. I hope yours is better.","January 3","false","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/recommended/284460/","saltydaveiv","david / BNET: OceansAbove#1601","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/","338 products in account","If you were born sometime in early 90's or a little earlier, you were propably a teenager when the best multiplayer shooters and thir modding scene lived their golden age. Before the age of DLCs, stripped of modding support, where games were accepted and loved "as is" and it was just that, instead of continous tracking of the developers on various forums, having all kinds of outragous postrelase changes and hated additions, mandatory microtransactions or always online forcing for no reason... those were the days.\n\nDEADCORE, is definitly a game that time travelled ahead of it's age. It's simplistic, pure, does what it does as is from the (virtual) box and have this great retro feeling lingering in it's atmosphere, while it takes advantage of some modern features is a good way (such as steam workshop integrated so downloading player created content is easier than it was back then).\n\nGAMEPLAY is rather simple - it's a speedrunner puzzle platformer, much like Portal, only without portals. The gameplay is fast, forgiving in a just comfortable time period to achieve the feeling of progress, just to throw in the good old ruthlessly precision demanding sections every now and then. You will fail, you will die, and you will retry over and over again because it's fast, engaging and fun down in it's core gameplay. Retrying takes less than a second and you'll never face a painfully long to skip game over screen, and this paired up with the excellent fluid gameplay, the surprisingly artistic abstract level design (it plays a more functional part in the whole, so a portal-like minimalistic thing would work great, but still it manages to show some jawdropping backgrounds), the sometimes logic, sometimes speed and skill, but usually both demanding gameplay makes DEADCORE a worthy challanger to Portal and similar games.\n\nTwo negatives here, sadly strenghtening each other: DEADCORE, has no story. I'm not saying this is bad, because it doesn't needs one. Or a coherent universe, or characters and any kind of conversation, it's pure perfect gameplay only. Still, that is likely the first thing that keeps it back from being more widely known and appriciated for what it does. Second thing, is actually the same as the first - motivation. When you are in the game, it's absolutely fantastic gameplay hooks you in - but when you finally quit, you'll never really have any motivation to launch it again the day after. I'm totally in love with speedrunner FPS mods for various oldschool multiplayer FPS games like Quakes etc. and DEADCORE is excellent at that, but as a singleplayer game it lacks the motivation multiplayer games offer with the presence of other players (online leaderboards aren't that motivating for many). The puzzles wouldn't have a place here then because you'd see others doing it so it's instantly solved, but it and also lacks the minimalistic interaction or feedback with/from... anything (like GLaDOS) and the lack of either is really leaving an empty space that isn't filled and it really feels.\n\nIf these aren't a problem for you and you are looking for a great modern game that gives away this retro skillful smart speedrunner vibe, look no futher.\n\nDEADCORE, is for you.","January 14","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Challenges are simply designed, but punishingly brutal after the firsat dozen or so.  Thankfully respawns are instant and checkpoints are beyond plentiful.\nThe game's visual design at first glance might seem too basic, but I really grooved on the shiny-black-shapes-tastefully-Tronlined-floating-in-an-endless-sea-of-clouds it has going on.  HUD elements are all gathered neatly on your Switch Gun (does what it says), giving the player a clean view in a mannar similar to Dead Space.  Story is told though text logs found thoughout the game, though they can easily be ignored if the player wishes to focus solely on gameplay, a thing I found refreshing.\nControls with mouse and keyboard were tight and responsive, air control is precise and predictable, a must for this type of game.  Sound design is similarly simplistic but satisfying, with more subdued music that I enjoyed as it lends well from the experience without distracting from the gameplay.  Puzzle design is very three-dimensional,  always requireing the player to think "around" instead of "forward"\n\nAll in all an awesome Firstperson-Puzzle-platformer that get's right in the sweet spot for gamers wanting their constant adrenalin rush with zero downtime, add to that a solidly meshing theme of visuals, gameplay and music and you've got yourself a great experience.  8/10\n\n\nCons\n- No Controller support as of this review, some of those jumps I really felt uncomfortable with using WASD, really missed my stick then\n- Cannot keymap to extra mouse buttons, Since I'm relegated to my five button mouse I tried to map the Dash command to one of the empty ones, no luck, it's stuck at E","August 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Cause at about level 2 they start throwing suprises at you. In this game I like to go fast, but this game forces you to slow down if you dont know whats coming beforehand, And thats just flat out BAD DESIGN. you're meant to go fast in this game so why do you force me to stop to precision shoot some fan blade? WHY do I still get thrown back if I shoot an enemy  watch it start to retreat back into it's shell of broken dreams, but then touch it a milisecond before the animation finishes? WHY DID YOU ADD AN UNNEEDED GRAVITY MECHANIC?! thats right, a gravity mechanic. you can tell by this point you're probably pretty close to the end of the game, so they added a CONFUSING, USELESS gravity power. I was struggling my way through this to see the end, but this is where I stopped. You're supposed to go through this gauntlet of reverse gravity platforms, an every time you jump into a new one they get harder, but you will NEVER reach the next one because you either: A. Jump to short and have to start ALL over. or B. the double jump flat out just doest work. It doesn't help that when you actually make it to the next platform you are IMMEDIATELY assaulted by lasers and turrets. so in short, this game gets really stupid real fast. play it if your blood pressure is too low.","June 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But this game suffers from the same issues as Cloudbuilt in that it is far too complex. I only managed to get up to level 4 and I gave up half way through it because rather than offering lots of small simple levels, the levels are vast and complex and a nightmare to navigate. It is not easy (at least for me) to find which way to go as there are lots of paths. There are also far too many environmental death traps to navigate. By the time you get to level 4 it's no longer about being quick, but actually just getting through the game. Where Cloudbuilt fails because of its complex environments, extreme pace and many enemies, it at least manages to keep levels short and makes it clear that being fast is what's important. Deadcore, on the other hand, fails because it offers collectibles and long levels. The only thing that makes it remotely apparent that this is a speedrunning game is the timer on your weapon. I'm not sure if I misunderstood the game, but it seems to be that this is more of a "deathtrap navigation puzzle" game than one in which you are under time pressure; at least in the first run. The core mechanics are very promising, as is the general aesthetic and design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonMusic/recommended/284460/","NeonMusic","Neon | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonMusic/","84 products in account","In a way. I actually like this game. Smooth graphics, amazing visuals, interesting storyline. However when I had gotten about half-way through the game. The gameplay started to drag on. Certain bits of levels you might see for the rest of the game repeated. I didn't want this to be a rage game. But that's what it turned out to be. This game was praised for its level design and at first I can say for the first 1hr to 1 hr and 30 mins it is on par. However the Dev's seemingly enough would take parts out of some of the levels and put them into others. For example you might have seen an obstacle in the first level repeated in almost every single other level.\n\nI am almost sick of the same repeated parts in each level. One I picked up on, was one where their are 5 red laser panes, and at the end there is a boost to get you to a part of the level that would normally be unreachable. The farther you get in the game the more parts that you catch are repeated over and over again. The worst part the checkpoints get even farther apart. Which makes the repeated bits in levels even more noticable. By the third level I was absolutely sick of the gameplay its pacing was horrible, and just nonsense. The game however does try to add some new mechanics by about the 2 hr mark. However it falls flat on its face, as its mechanics do not match the levels overall pace.\n\nOverall I would rate this game a 6/10.\n\nGraphics: 8/10, The only major problem is how low resolution some of the textures are off in the distance, and how unrealistic they are. It is painstakingly obvious. The main menu suffers from this to.\n\nSound Design: 6/10 some of the sounds are so f*cking cool, but they repeat FAR too often for me to handle it.\n\nMusic: 6/10, The music is awesome. Futuristic, and overall it has a nice compostion however even 2.5 hrs into the game. You hear the songs loops. Not all the time like their is one song. But like seemingly the game likes to repeat certain songs more than others. Problem is the music gets a 6/10 because of how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid the level design is, makes the fast paced drum and bass music not match up with the level design. And the fact you repeat the same part of a level so often you want to turn the music volume off.\n\nLevel Design: 2/10. This brings the game down so much. Because it was what it had mostly relied on. It fell so far from expectations. It is annoying, repetitive, and sluggish. As I have said before it repeates itself alot, you might see entire parts of a level copy and pasted from other levels. Overall levels are put into this absolutely random mad copy and paste spree. Levels had gotten so damn annoying I got sick of it and did not want to play the game anymore. If the game was a rage game like you would have died a lot, I wouldn't have minded as much if the level design was overall good and was fast paced, not sluggish and annoying. Their was this one part in a level that had this super long segment that was literally copy and pasted from the previous level, like nothing was different.\n\nStory: 8/10. Although the story is simple, in a way it is as equally complicated. The story, is extremely intresting, and just awesome.\n\nWas this worth my ten dollars? For the 2 hr's of gameplay that were actually fun, I would say no. Imagine this game as the bad version of portal. And I tried to finish the game but I literally would see entire huge parts of a level copy and pasted. Like it was literally so bad that every level was pretty much the same. The only thing that would save this game would be if it had custom campaigns and workshop compatibility. Possibly, an in-game level editor. If you think about it most of the parts of levels are put together kind of like portal. Like mostly cube based, and things like that.","February 18","false","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The pace of which you jump from obstacle to obstacle got to the point where it could be pretty intense, but it was somewhat broken up but the laser tunnels that seemed to kill you no matter how dead in the center you were, or you'd get through them, and the last would melt you.\n\nThen the gravity mod for your switch gun. Now it's a ♥♥♥♥ poor puzzle game with extremely disorienting camera flips each and every time you enter a purple field. The game's momentum simply stops when this happens. Now you must sit around at the same section wondering what the hell to do for several minutes at a stretch trying out several different things while the camera flips you around and ruins whatever plan you may have had. Then cubes and robot bugs fly after you and bounce you around to make it even more hilarious.\n\nI can recommend this for the first big section before the gravity mod. But for me, it managed to stop the pacing of the game. I often asked "What am I doing?" as I would try to figure out a plan and then lose my spot when the camera changed. If the camera changed slower, and was more clear as to where you just came from, and what angle, it wouldn't be as much of an issue. But as it stands, I'm not entirely sure how that would work.\n\n8/10 for the parts up until the gravity mod\n5/10 after a while with the gravity mod","October 20, 2014","false","3.3"," 34 of 85 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","34","85","0","9"

You may not even have to get through the obstacle the way the game wants you to. By that I mean, the way you solve the obstacle is very flexible. You can often go around, above, or behind your obstacle and there are even multiple paths to your ultimate destination.

Everything about it is beautiful.\nBut none of those things make it so great; what makes it such a fun game to play is how it feels, and I can tell you first hand it feels amazing.\nThe flow and structure of the game is simple, yet beautiful; challenging, yet fun; and every second of it feels satisfying.\nIf i havent sold you yet, let me keep going.\nIf you think its linear, that its just a “walk through this, open door" game, it all depends on what your approach is. You can walk a straight line and push through brick walls to find the end of the level, or take your time and find shortcuts to propel yourself forward. There are plenty of secrets to find, including music, even more levels, and lore.\nSpeaking of lore, if youre looking for a story, youre looking in the wrong place. The games tutorial screens dont actually speak in coherent sentences, what little cutscenes the game has are pre-rendered and unhelpful, and they dont add much, but they definitely dont take away from the core gameplay mechanics which you should be focusing on. But on the other hand, some of said mechanics are actually explained through unlockable bits and pieces of text you can find.\nIf youre looking for your moneys worth, then youre in luck. Apart from single-player campaign, it also has a speedrunning mode, for which you can choose a soundtrack from songs you previously unlocked in campaign.\nAnd what a soundtrack, too. Its a portal-esque mix of synths and electronic, and it goes well with each level. Youll see a red thunderstorm of lasers and lightning, and youll hear deep basses and dark grooves along with it. You come to a part where coordination is key, where its all about speed, and a drum and bass with a fast beat accompanies you as you race to the finish.\nIn terms of level design, the game gives you plenty of mechanics to play with, most of which are beneficial. However, looks can be decieving, as youll be challenged along the way with a gravity field that isnt quite supposed to be there, or the odd boost pad that youll have to dodge at breakneck speed.\nAlso, remember when I said "play with"? I essentially meant "Exploit". This game has taught me to think outside the box countless times. Basically, if you think you can do it, you probably can.\nSpeaking of thinking outside the box, youll be rewarded for awareness and creativity while playing. Sometimes youll be trying to figure out different approach to a solution, and ill see an unlockable that wasnt even there before. Sometimes even an entire different path to the end.\nIn any case, this game is a beautiful mix of everything for casuals, but if youre in it for the long run, youll definitely be rewarded. At $ 4.39, this is a steal. At $10.99, you definitely get your moneys worth plus a bit more. Recommended.","December 19, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've put about four hours into it and thus far it is exploding my mind in the best way possible.\n\nThe controls are intuitive, responsive and basically flawless.  The difficulty curve and level designs are astounding.  The game trains you (or me at least) at almost the exact rate to keep the game consistently difficult without ever feeling hopeless.  The puzzles and obstacles introduce new elements and re-use already introduced elements in new ways often enough that it never feels stale.\n\nI'll be the first person to admit that I lose patience while playing games quicker than most people.  However, to my disbelief, I have yet to transform into a rage-fueled beast of pure hatred or really get upset or irritated at all while playing Deadcore.  I'm going to attribute this to the instant and painless respawn, reasonable checkpoints and entrancing nature of the games music and art.  I should mention that the original reason I bought the game, the interesting art, was exactly as enjoyable as I had hoped.\n\nIn summary I am really enjoying this game.  I hit play on a level and wake up 60-90 minutes (like I said I'm REALLY bad at timing jumps) later with my perception of time shattered, covered in sweat and filled with an honest sense of accomplishment.  My only critique is lack of controller/gamepad support, though I did read a post from the developer on the Steam forums which said they may add it in a later patch.  I don't mean to overhype Deadcore but all in all it's great game and I highly recommend it.","January 4, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feels very old-school in the best possible way. As an old-school FPS player (non-competitive), I never really had too much trouble getting through the levels; sure, some of the checkpoints were somewhat annoyingly spaced apart, but I rarely died more than a dozen times while trying to get through a difficult area (and that only happened a few times in the whole game). Most of the time, it was an utter joy zooming through the vast, contiguous spaces and navigating the difficult spatial challenges. It reminded me of the sense of flow you felt once you got good at a level in Super Meat Boy.\n\nOnly major issue so far is performance: running on my 2013 15" Macbook Pro (i7, Nvidia 750m) under Bootcamp, I have difficulty keeping a constant 60fps, even on low settings at 720p. In fact, in the level I'm in now, I'm hovering around 30-40fps. Not sure if this can be fixed or if it's inherent to Unity, alas...\n\nEDIT: I've since found the custom settings, and can now play through most of the game at 60fps with most settings on medium and a select few on low.

It quickly went from a game of thinking to a game of repeating stuff I've done a dozen times just to get yet another shot at the one part that was actually giving me trouble.\n\nI didn't hate this game, since when it played fair, it was genuinely very good.

However with this difficulty comes a very high skill ceiling, meaning that people who have a knack for it or put in the time to get good will get REALLY good, good enough to show off to friends and impress Youtube subscribers.\nPeople have complained that this game only appeals to speedrunners and streamers and that it's a game designed to be watched rather than played, which I have to agree with, if you're not up to the challenge.\nThis game won't hold your hand, if you can't think fast enough and react quickly enough to solve puzzles on the fly while being knocked around by loathsome little death cubes and shot at by turrets, you won't be able to master this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/recommended/284460/","vmblood","VolkmasterBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/","222 products in account","I was incredibly hesitant about getting DeadCore.  A first person, puzzle based shooter with no enemies involving weird jumping and shooting mechanics.  I loved Portal 1 and 2, hated the "Portal Paint Modification" that sold for 5-10 bucks, but thoroughly enjoyed Antechamber.  I had also played Spectraball recently, and it looked like a similar game of sorts (I liked Spectraball).\n\nGoing through the first level, I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.  2 hours later, I realized I really liked this game and I couldn't quit.  This game can be hard at times.  Puzzle games are always meant to stump you.  This game stumps you in two ways.  One: some parts are difficult to get through and require some thinking, and two: some parts are easy to understand, but they require quick movement and on the spot thought process.  This is what made part of this game enjoyable.\n\nThe game also calls itself an exploration game.  I was highly confused about this until there was an option to go in two different directions.  I could literally choose which puzzle I wanted to perform, and the further you get, the greater the choices become.  I could literally replay this game and have a completely different experience.  Sometimes, alternative solutions are hidden as well.  I accidentally missed a part of the puzzle I was supposed to go to, and landed somewhere else entirely, only to find out this was actually a secret and I could skip this area altogether if I made a difficult jump.  Exploration also reveals "plot points" and certain boosts to powers (to make the game slightly easier).\n\nHowever, those plot points?  Ignore them.  I literally did not know they existed until 3 hours in, and although it was interesting to read, it wasn't necessary for the game's existence.  A few parts were laggy, but it was mostly in the beginning at the base of the towering mass of floating puzzles.  From the first few puzzles on the lag disappeared entirely.\n\nThis game is worth it.  I bought it on sale, and I forgot the price, but if the devs of this game created a similar puzzle game, I would buy it as well (*hinthint* if you're reading this).  Totally worth the buy.  I fully recommend this game.","December 20, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DeadCore. There's exploration and a rough guide as to what to do and then you're left in a digital(?) world of this things going to kill you. So is that. And if you don't time this jump properly we're going to kill you some more.\nOne of the achievements is to make it all the way through the game without dying. I can't make it through one level or indeed one checkpoint without dying at least once.\nAll in all though I can't not reccomend the game. It's simplistically complicated. Ultimately its a platformer maze with the jumping and the landing on platforms. Then you've got your timed, not so much puzzle, puzzles. I've just entered a bit where I can now swap gravity around a bit. Because, you know, barely making jumps in one plane isn't hard enough.

Before I go into the negative parts of the game, let me start with the positives.\n\nFirst off, the graphics of this game are absolutely stunning. I have not run across a game this beautifully detailed in a very long time, and the design and layout of the game is truly very beautiful. The game also incorporates two themes that I love, Tron and Portal. The game has an almost Portal like feel to it with the gun and the linear ascent, but not so much so that it feels like copying, and the world has an almost Tron-like design to it, so that's something that I greatly enjoy as well.\n\nHowever, and this is a big however for me. The controls are very very very sensitive. The small platforms make maneuvering difficult, so I'll just say that first. You have to be ready with the spacebar and the respawn key while you are runing on those narrow platforms. Unfortunately, what makes matters worse is that the controls are hair-trigger sensitive. Press the right arrow key just slightly and you're suddenly plummetting into nothingness, and have to restart from the spawn point. Your jump key is also very powerful, launching you ten to fifteen feet at a time. While this can be a lot of fun, it is also a cause for a great amount of frustration. I also find that the camera is very sluggish compared to the controls, no matter how much I change the sensitivity of it, which makes it very hard to watch where I'm going.\n\nAll in all, while the game is fun and can get very immersive, the controls make it painfully difficult to play, and give me a severe amount of frustration. I do reccomend it, but just be warned that you might get stuck for a while on certain levels, so be wary.","November 14, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've put about four hours into it and thus far it is exploding my mind in the best way possible.\n\nThe controls are intuitive, responsive and basically flawless.  The difficulty curve and level designs are astounding.  The game trains you (or me at least) at almost the exact rate to keep the game consistently difficult without ever feeling hopeless.  The puzzles and obstacles introduce new elements and re-use already introduced elements in new ways often enough that it never feels stale.\n\nI'll be the first person to admit that I lose patience while playing games quicker than most people.  However, to my disbelief, I have yet to transform into a rage-fueled beast of pure hatred or really get upset or irritated at all while playing Deadcore.  I'm going to attribute this to the instant and painless respawn, reasonable checkpoints and entrancing nature of the games music and art.  I should mention that the original reason I bought the game, the interesting art, was exactly as enjoyable as I had hoped.\n\nIn summary I am really enjoying this game.  I hit play on a level and wake up 60-90 minutes (like I said I'm REALLY bad at timing jumps) later with my perception of time shattered, covered in sweat and filled with an honest sense of accomplishment.  My only critique is lack of controller/gamepad support, though I did read a post from the developer on the Steam forums which said they may add it in a later patch.  I don't mean to overhype Deadcore but all in all it's great game and I highly recommend it.","January 4, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A first person, puzzle based shooter with no enemies involving weird jumping and shooting mechanics.  I loved Portal 1 and 2, hated the "Portal Paint Modification" that sold for 5-10 bucks, but thoroughly enjoyed Antechamber.  I had also played Spectraball recently, and it looked like a similar game of sorts (I liked Spectraball).\n\nGoing through the first level, I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.  2 hours later, I realized I really liked this game and I couldn't quit.  This game can be hard at times.  Puzzle games are always meant to stump you.  This game stumps you in two ways.  One: some parts are difficult to get through and require some thinking, and two: some parts are easy to understand, but they require quick movement and on the spot thought process.  This is what made part of this game enjoyable.\n\nThe game also calls itself an exploration game.  I was highly confused about this until there was an option to go in two different directions.  I could literally choose which puzzle I wanted to perform, and the further you get, the greater the choices become.  I could literally replay this game and have a completely different experience.  Sometimes, alternative solutions are hidden as well.  I accidentally missed a part of the puzzle I was supposed to go to, and landed somewhere else entirely, only to find out this was actually a secret and I could skip this area altogether if I made a difficult jump.  Exploration also reveals "plot points" and certain boosts to powers (to make the game slightly easier).\n\nHowever, those plot points?  Ignore them.  I literally did not know they existed until 3 hours in, and although it was interesting to read, it wasn't necessary for the game's existence.  A few parts were laggy, but it was mostly in the beginning at the base of the towering mass of floating puzzles.  From the first few puzzles on the lag disappeared entirely.\n\nThis game is worth it.  I bought it on sale, and I forgot the price, but if the devs of this game created a similar puzzle game, I would buy it as well (*hinthint* if you're reading this).  Totally worth the buy.  I fully recommend this game.","December 20, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DeadCore. There's exploration and a rough guide as to what to do and then you're left in a digital(?) world of this things going to kill you. So is that. And if you don't time this jump properly we're going to kill you some more.\nOne of the achievements is to make it all the way through the game without dying. I can't make it through one level or indeed one checkpoint without dying at least once.\nAll in all though I can't not reccomend the game. It's simplistically complicated. Ultimately its a platformer maze with the jumping and the landing on platforms. Then you've got your timed, not so much puzzle, puzzles. I've just entered a bit where I can now swap gravity around a bit. Because, you know, barely making jumps in one plane isn't hard enough.

You can walk a straight line and push through brick walls to find the end of the level, or take your time and find shortcuts to propel yourself forward. There are plenty of secrets to find, including music, even more levels, and lore.\nSpeaking of lore, if youre looking for a story, youre looking in the wrong place. The games tutorial screens dont actually speak in coherent sentences, what little cutscenes the game has are pre-rendered and unhelpful, and they dont add much, but they definitely dont take away from the core gameplay mechanics which you should be focusing on. But on the other hand, some of said mechanics are actually explained through unlockable bits and pieces of text you can find.\nIf youre looking for your moneys worth, then youre in luck. Apart from single-player campaign, it also has a speedrunning mode, for which you can choose a soundtrack from songs you previously unlocked in campaign.\nAnd what a soundtrack, too. Its a portal-esque mix of synths and electronic, and it goes well with each level. Youll see a red thunderstorm of lasers and lightning, and youll hear deep basses and dark grooves along with it. You come to a part where coordination is key, where its all about speed, and a drum and bass with a fast beat accompanies you as you race to the finish.\nIn terms of level design, the game gives you plenty of mechanics to play with, most of which are beneficial. However, looks can be decieving, as youll be challenged along the way with a gravity field that isnt quite supposed to be there, or the odd boost pad that youll have to dodge at breakneck speed.\nAlso, remember when I said "play with"? I essentially meant "Exploit". This game has taught me to think outside the box countless times. Basically, if you think you can do it, you probably can.\nSpeaking of thinking outside the box, youll be rewarded for awareness and creativity while playing. Sometimes youll be trying to figure out different approach to a solution, and ill see an unlockable that wasnt even there before. Sometimes even an entire different path to the end.\nIn any case, this game is a beautiful mix of everything for casuals, but if youre in it for the long run, youll definitely be rewarded. At $ 4.39, this is a steal. At $10.99, you definitely get your moneys worth plus a bit more. Recommended.","December 19, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combine your speed and skill to beat the obstacles along the way to the top of the tower (With some hidden collectibles around if you are the type for that).\n\nIt brings a few standard mechanics (double-jumps, dashing and jump-shots) to traverse a seemingly simple world where, by traversing jumps, boosters, gavity wells and more, you must reach the top of the tower.\nAlong the way, you will encounter a few enemies including turrets, deadly lasers and drones with repelling blasts to knock you off and fall to your death.\n\nWhat initially seemed like quite a simple game turned complex relatively quickly and when combined with the attitude of being the faster 'runner', offers quite a difficult challenge. Adding to the general progression of the game, you can return to earlier stages to complete other sections after learning a new skill.\n\nI would recommend to anybody really, it's a nice game to play despite getting slightly annoyed when you fail the same part 20 times in a row. Definitely look into this if you are a lover of speedruns.\n\nGameplay: 9\nGraphics:   8\nControls:   10\n\nOverall, 9/10","February 17, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It is at first a bit frustrating, then it becomes challenging, then it turns into pure bliss and fun. When you start out the game, you are immersed into a beautiful world, a mix between portal, and a first person shooter (of sorts). It takes a few hours of practice and determination to get used to the way the world around you works, and the controls and when to time things.\n\nAt this point you hit the challenging stages. A few areas in this game will make you cringe, because it adds your abilities together to complete them. It becomes unrelenting at one point, but it slowly and eventually turns into fun. Once you complete a play through you find yourself wanting to go and return to the game to complete a 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. playthrough. You essentially strive to become a better player at this game. This game was also made in unity3d which is a fantastic program for game design.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a must buy for all players. It has a bit of RPG, Action, FPS elements to it. For the price they are asking, and for the length and beauty of the game it is worth every penny.","March 11, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic mechanics are simple, but the execution is what makes the difference, Of course there are some areas that can use work, where lasers phase the slightest bit through the floor and still kill you, and it is annoying. From what I've played of it, it doesn't hinder me from finding a solution (standing a foot to the right.) Sometimes the controls don't feel as exact as they should be, and it can be hard to navigate levels. Level design does get a bit unimaginative at points, but you do feel like you're progressing. Even though enemies are clearly designed to bother you or knock you off the level, there are times when that unexpected boost can help. Overall, I would say it is a solid game, worth the money, but in need of a bit of polishing.","May 1, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well reader, you are correct, this does sound like Portal, but in a way, it plays VERY differently than how Portal plays. Let's start with the setting, Portal takes place in a laboratory run by a psycotic robot, you are in a tower(?) run by an unknown entity. Then the iconic guns, Portal has the Portal Gun, which has the ability to create doors from one place to another, DeadCore has the Switch Gun, which turns things on and off. There are more differences that I CAN compare, but I won't. I personally think the Switch Gun is unique, but it has been done before in various Unity games, but it is a new feature that hasn't really been put into puzzle games. Another thing I like about DeadCore is that it treats itself like a platformer, with the double-jumping, and the impossible platforms to reach, and other things I won't go into too much detail with. I really can't say anything about the story-line, I'm barely into the game. BUT, I recomment this game to anyone looking for a fun First-Person platformer puzzle game.\nOH, I forgot to mention, the soundtrack is amazing, though it reminds me of Deus Ex: Human Revolution's soundtrack, which is awesome because one of the reasons I loved Deus Ex: Human Revolution was for its soundtrack/","January 11, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They make you go through this really hard section in the game that takes quite a while to get through and then once you finally get through it (after many failures) they don't give you a checkpoint until after ANOTHER difficult section. Or once where you go through another difficult and long section where you need to use alot of your ammo and then when you reach the end of that (most likely with little or no ammo) they still don't give you a f***ing checkpoint to refill, forcing you to restart and do the whole d**n thing over again.\n\nSo, yeah.

I didn't close this game for almost 3 hours after I started.\n\nSome other reviews have said that this game is only for "hardcore speedrunners" and that others should just watch the videos.  They miss the point - Deadcore lets you become a speedrunner in hours, and that's why it's awesome.","June 14, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know people like to compare it to that game, but Portal is about space-folding puzzles, holds your hand, doesn't really allow for imagination, and is great for casuals. This game's puzzles is about timing, accuracy, imagination, and speed. It's like a horseback archery obstacle course on drugs. For those who are a fan of the FPS speedrunning community, this game is a must buy. If you ever played the DeFRaG/CPM obstacle courses for quake 3 arena, this is your game. If you circlejerked "the cake is a lie" for months with your friends, maybe check out a couple youtube vids before you decide.\n\nAs for your tools: Instead of strafejumping, you have a limited amount of speedburst (upgradable through exploration). Instead of a rocketjump, you get a charge shot that will give you about a third of the height. You can sorta plasma-climb with it, but as of the recent patch it's been (deservedly) nerfed. CPM air strafing still exists.\n\nThe puzzles and exploration aspect of the game are very well done and visually stunning, and require a clever mind on top of trial-and-error to beat. You get to keep your upgrades through playthroughs so each time you restart the Cycle you are stronger and faster (and have a better mind for the course; look hard and use your imagination - you may find shortcuts or ways to circumvent danger entirely that you didn't have access to before).\n\nAs far as the story goes, there really isn't one (I haven't found all the collectables yet, there are hints that you find out more when you 100% the game) to speak of. The game is pure and simple - explore on your first playthrough, then compete on every Cycle after that. Its simplicity is what makes it great in my opinion; you are completely focused on the course.\n\nWish there was a soundtrack version to buy.","June 15, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It controls beautifully, and really ramps up the challenge to deliver a solid experience throughout.  The mechanics really come together to create scenarios where you have to be quick-minded and quick to react, with some sections simply requiring you to know what you're up against.  This creates an addicting flow to the game, like a first-person Super Mario Bros, but with a cool futuristic atmosphere.\n\nBe warned however, this game does modify gravity in specific zones, and the transitions into and out of these zones can be disorienting, especially at the breakneck speed some sections require.  It will take some trial and error to figure out certain levels, but with how fun the levels and the mechanics are this is not a bad thing.\n\nAlso, after unlocking more abilities, visiting the first few levels allows you to collect more 'sparks', which enables even tougher sections to be unlocked.  These are very challenging but quite enjoyable, and gives it some immediate replayability.  With the unlocked abilities, simply exploring known sections and seeing what places in the level you can actually reach is also a fun exercise.","June 16, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes the the level design from Counter Strike surf maps and adds a platforming and shooting element with a clear emphasis on speedrunning. Whats really remarkable about its design is that it manages to do first person platforming justice. With open ended levels and a variety of failsafes after missing jumps, the player doesn't feel as if the first person angle is a liability. The shooting bits mix very well with the overall design of speed. And, while there isn't technically any combat, the targets and turrets act as a shooting gallery, turning a speedrunner into a speedshooter, keeping the player on their toes. In DeadCore, your eyes are just as important as your feet. A first for this emerging genre of "speed runners".","July 17, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason this game is an 8 and not higher is because it pretty soon gets a little boring, repetetive, and frustrating. Is it fun? Yes, but after the 1st hour is when it becomes those 3 words.

Many of the features and mechanics in DeadCore are rather self-defeating: it's a platformer that relies on extreme awareness of environmental hazards and body positioning, but at the same time, is a first-person viewed game where you can't see your feet. It's a game that is so conscious of the impending need for repetitious retrying and respawning that it mapped a quickspawn button next to 'use,' but it spreads checkpoints thin for the sake of exploration. Movement is typical WASD, allowing for a straight vector of movement at 45° angles relative to the camera’s center, but will frequently require you to run a straight line while aiming at targets outside such a range.\n\nPoint is, DeadCore's biggest enemy is itself. But getting beyond that, if you can get used to the quirks and have a high tolerance for the inevitable friction, all while surviving a skill-based game that takes no prisoners, DeadCore offers an engrossing aesthetic that is well-implemented and even more well-polished; thankfully, the game seeks to capitalize on a more zen-like experience, rather than the standard (and played out) frantic cyber-savvy motif. A simple, quiet package, DeadCore may very well frustrate you, but it will reward you greater.","November 26, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With sharp visuals, clean controls and a fitting sound track it's an easy game to lose time to trying to shave that short second, but beware, on your first playthrough be prepared to die ALOT.\n\nThe game relies on precision movement and quick reflexes and will punish you off you're off the mark. Look for checkpoints as you play through as they will save you a lot of time, and hence comes the risk when trying to cut corners; skip a checkpoint, and be punished if you screw up. This also plays into the routes, some are harder than others, some have fewer checkpoints, but if you plan to go for it, you can shave off minutes if you're successful. Due to this, it would be nice if they introduced a way to revert your checkpoint furthur, say, previous or 3 checkpoints before. It would make the overall game more casual friendly as some of these alternate routes, once you start on them, you're not going back... In this sense, the game pulls no punches. Shaving off minutes becomes really satisfying given how punishing trying to do so can be. Practice and memorise if you want to feel any real satisfaction, otherwise, this game is probably not for you.\n\nMy first playthrough was almost like Super Meat Boy all over again...","November 30, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles/parcours are more dependant on reflexes and speed, rather than brainpower. Most levels have multiple ways to navigate them, each with their own challenges. It's got very crisp visuals and an ambient soundtrack.\nIt's got a story but it's not the main focus of the game, as all of it is given in text logs that you can unlock and read at your leisure in the main menu by finding secrets. Personally i think it's a good thing because that way the gameplay isn't interrupted.\nThe controls are a bit "floaty", your character builds quite a bit of momentum and the jumps feel kind of low-gravity ish but due to the level design that works in it's favour (although it takes a bit of getting used to if you played games like mirror's edge or portal)\nAll in all I think it's a pleasant little game.

Once you get comfortable with the movement, it feels great to zip around the levels.  There's tons of ways to optimize routes and the level design is intelligent with a lot of room for improvisation.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the palette is sort of TRON-esque with lots of neon blue and black, but they do an excellent job with the sense of height and scale.  I got sweaty palms more than once leaping around platforms with an infinite fall below.\n\nThe music turns out to be a great treat (if you enjoy electronica).

I'll probably mess with the speedrun mode for a bit as well.  So, my verdict?  Deadcore is a blast.  The game is a sci-fi styled puzzle/platformer/shooter where you're stuck in a sort of computer glitch/alternate dimension where you must scale a huge tower using quick reflexes and every ability in your arsenal.  If you mix Mirror's Edge, Portal, the movie Cube, Megaman and some other similarly themed games and movies, you will have Deadcore.  This is not a game for those looking to relax or have an easy go of things.  Your patience will be tested but there was certainly a sense of accomplishment whenever you'd complete a very difficult section and finally reach that elusive next checkpoint.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay sees you jumping from block to block/platform to platform while dodging moving laser fields, robotic foes hellbent on knocking you into the abyss and every other oddity you can imagine.  There are disorienting anti-gravity sections that will turn you on your head, jump pads, gravity tunnels that send you hurtling towards danger that you must avoid and much, much, much more.  You get a few abilities like a dash to help you out as well as the Switch Gun that does everything from activating objects in the enviroment that you need to use in order to progress to stopping your robo-foes dead in their tracks.  There is a story and it's told passably enough through numerous data logs that you can collect as you climb this digital Tower of Babel.  Speaking of collectibles, there's plenty to find.  In addition to the logs there are also music tracks, Switch Gun upgrades and Sparks (that open up new pathways of travel) to find.\n\nDeadcore takes place in a pretty unusual setting that is brought to life thanks to some excellent graphics.  You'll truly feel the awe and scope of the situation you're in as you look up and see how far you literally have to climb to get to the next area.  Particle effects dazzle, threats are well-animated, dizzying gravity changes look awesome as the scenery flips every which way and the overall atmosphere is a slice of sci-fi goodness that looks simultaneously grand and opaque, all in the same breath.  It's not THE most beautiful game ever created as some of the enviroments can get a bit samey, but 90% of the time Deadcore is a pleasure to the eye.  The sound is pretty strong as well, if not quite as crystalline as the graphics are.  Robotic foes make c3po noises, your Switch Gun shots pack a fair punch and everything is perfunctory in terms of special audio FX.  Where the sound really shines is with the techno/industrial soundtrack that pumps adrenaline in the background; complimented by numerous dips into trip-hop ambience.\n\nEven if Deadcore packed a simply average presentation it wouldn't matter much because in a game as challenging as this one, the controls are the most important aspect.  MOSTLY, they are competently well done and accurate enough for you to do the job but let's face it...you're going to DIE and die you will as you struggle with all of your might to pass the 5 main levels in story mode.  Jumping, dashing, shooting the Switch Gun and avoiding threats works most of the time and pulling off a series of daring saves and escapes is satisfying and breathtaking to chain together.  The real big BUT here is that sometimes things just don't work as they should.  Movement is a bit floaty and even if your leaps and dives are dead on the money, you are bound to go sliding off your perch.  The game has its own physics to master. Sometimes the game requires lining up perfectly between several moving lasers and these segments are rarely passable on the first attempt.  In addition to the "float" controls, there are instances where your button presses won't register AT ALL.  My keyboard is new, clean as a whistle and generally in top-notch condition, but that didn't stop the f*cking Space Bar from not accepting my double jumps many, many times even if I waited a moment on a platform to make sure that the double jump ability reset itself.  Checkpoints are oftentimes pretty fairly located but there are several portions of the game where you'll need to cover a darn good chunk of distance to reach one and in these cases the ill-response of the controls will have you repeating these portions over and over and over again.  What makes it fun is the fact there is a Steam Achievement that can only be unlocked by dying a hilarious # of times.  I laughed to myself seeing this, saying, "Ha, even if this game is tough as nails, I'll never die THAT much."  I'm not sure what's scarier...the fact that I scoffed at the idea of dying so frequently or the fact that I reached the achievement before I totally completed level 3.  Good God...I died fast and hard!   But I kept trying and playing...\n\nIn terms of replay value, masochists like myself will find more than enough of it in Deadcore.  I'm already starting a second playthrough to see if I can grab all of the collectables at the very least and there is also a speed-run mode available where you can stack yourself up against the competition all over the world and try to best the developer's times.  This is one of those games  that I'll probably lose interest before getting every single achievement (I won't be good enough to get a few either I'm sure), but it's going to keep me playing long after a single completion.  In fact, I hope to get some more out of it in after writing this review.  There's not much else to say here.  This game was pretty darn great and worth the money I spent on it.  Though I hit on the controls fairly hard, I do want to enforce the notion that you will get better and come to get a grip on the movement in this game the more that you play.  I kind of disagree with the folks that say you can't get better at it.  I did.  It has its quirks, but I see them as masterable quirks.\n\nLet me break down as always into what I liked and what I didn't in a more quick reference style!\n\nPros:\n\n-Excellent graphics and visual effects\n-Great lighting and particle explosions\n-A small but useful selection of abilities and Switch Gun modes\n-Fun level design with alot of different challenges packed into each one\n-Decent sound design with exceptional music\n-Lots to see and do (collectibles, alternate modes, different paths, etc.)\n-Controls are a pain but somehow become adaptable if you stick with the game\n-Interesting story premise\n\nCons:\n\n-Controls are NOT for the casual gamer (I'm pretty hardcore...not the best, not the worst, so I had fun learning to get better at them)\n-While the graphical sights are impressive, they do get samey as the game goes on\n-Though the music was excellent, sound was rather humdrum\n-Story itself becomes passe as the game progresses (perhaps ending #2 will shed more light)\n-Enemies feel like an annoying afterthought.  They aren't particularly challenging as the platforming is the real challenge and they feel more like an annoyance than necessary to the gameplay.\n-For a game focused on speed, there are certain segments where you must sit and assess the situation even if you already know the level.\n-Sometimes the controls flat out don't respond\n\nOverall, I had a blast with Deadcore.  I got more enjoyment out of it than Portal...just my humble opinion.  It's going to tick you off sometimes but every time I wanted to put the game down I found out that I simply couldn't for long.  It was fun more often than it was annoying.  The sci-fi setting was cool and when the controls were hitting their stride, there was plenty of satisfaction in pulling off several quick movements in succession.  Hopefully, a few of the games issues will be addressed and upgraded, or fixed in a sequel.\n\nRating:  8/10","November 17, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game offers more post-game content in the form of time trials, composed of both areas from the story and additional maps of greater difficulty, but I find they don't offer the same magic that the main campaign offers.\n\n\nUltimately, the game is pretty short, but it accomplishes everything it wanted to in those hours, and ends before the game risks becoming tedious.  Very much worth your time.\n\nEdit:  Don't ask me why, but the developers completely whiffed the projectile animation.  Your bullets look slow and inaccurate, but in actuality the gun shoots dead-accurate and instantaneously fast, meaning you should NEVER try compensate when aiming for a moving target.  Just aim for the target, and shoot.  It'll hit.

Some sections Have moving grav lift platforms with moving lasers above them. You have to not only gauge your timing to land on the jump you must also gauge the timing of the above laser. This wouldn't be as difficult if you could see both at the same time. As it stands there is about a fullscreen length difference in the item placements. Some jumps are hard to gauge unless you've gone through the game before. That being said the checkpoint system is pretty generous. However, i can only believe it is as such because of the "difficulty" built into the game. It should be difficult because of the skill required, not because of oddly place jumps.","August 20, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though Deadcore doesn't offer the same mechanics exactly, it brings the same kind of feel and difficulty to a game that is more similar to Portal 2 (in style). Also some exploration is required for (full) completion as there are collectibles throughout the game and multiple paths to be found.\n\nSomething I noticed in the negative reviews was that the game was "hardcore" in difficulty and that sometimes failure was unexplained. I just wanted to say that firstly, the difficulty is no extreme when compared to the Source challenges described above but obviously don't expect to do everything first try. For me, having to have multiple attempts is part of the fun. It describes itself as a speedrunning game, so you would expect to have to figure out the fastest way to do each section. As for dying without reason I have no idea what they could be talking about. Red lasers kill you. Sometimes you get moved into them but you can plan to avoid those things (i.e. some enemies or obstacles). Everything is easy enough to figure out.\n\nIt's got a nice distopian theme that the 'log' collectibles help to build (despite the fairly unrefined writing). The story is only really told through these 'logs', and nicely leaves a lot to the imagination. Good music and visuals. The lot.\n\nThe main game only takes a few hours to complete - other levels are unlocked by finding 'spark' collectibles in the main game which will give you a lot more playtime and are better as time trial challenges compared to the main levels. After finishing these also, I was half expecting there to be a level editor but there was no such thing. I feel games like this benefit greatly from community made levels but unfortunately it was not the case here.\n\nHowever I would say Deadcore was worth the money anyway for someone as described above (as somebody who never really buys games unless they're on sale (I got it for £1.99)).","March 23","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sweet soundtrack for the most part, really atmospheric, I would recommend ascension (20 minute long song from level 5) at around minute 0:10:00, best part in the whole game in my opinion.\n\nI hope 5-Bits games make another indie title as good as this one.","March 24","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Thought it would be more puzzle solving oriented rather than focusing on time trials, but it turned out to be the latter. I didn't really understand the whole point behind it, except for gathering collectibles and power ups. What is the motivation? Does the story unfold later on? Is there a story behind it at all or is this just about 3D platforming.\n\nIt's not a bad game. It looks nice. If you're into challanges (especially timed ones) with platforming, it's ok.

Anyway at first time I completed it in 4 hours when the best one score was nearly 35 min.\n\nFirst of all minuses of the game:\n- Music. I don't think that it's suitable and also it bit annoying.\n- Game length. Just 4 hours, as I said.\n\nDespite all this, I really love that game:\n- Code is great. That's very rarely that some game with nice graphic don't freeze or lag on Linux\n- Level design. Oh, goddamit! Those're the best levels I've ever seen!

The levels (only 5) are huge and the last ones will be pretty long and hard.

There is a secret ending, so replay value is correct.\nLastly, soundtrack is awesome, but I expected a bit more about the enemies. In the last level they were pretty annoying in some places, finally they could have added a "final boss" similar to the last enemy you discover so the end would be just perfect and rewarding (I have to admit that the normal ending was cool enough).\n\n9/10","August 18, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I was having trouble with a level that required the player to repeatadly dash through a series of gates and land on a jump pad. I beat it instead by using the jump pad to land on top of the gates and jump over all the obstacles. That exploit wasn't left in by accident; the devs clearly expected players to find this solution and didn't make any attempt to stop us from using it.\n\nBiggest con: Checkpoint placement is always tricky to get right in a game like this. Too frequent and it feels like handholding. Too far apart, and the game turns from a test of skill into one of patience and your ability to learn the obstacles by rote. Deadcore definitely landed in the second court at plenty of points.\n\nIn addition, the greatest downfall to first person platforming is the inevitable lack of proprioception. There were some challenges that were very difficult to complete because playing a videogame means you lack peripheral vision and a sense of how much space you occupy.\n\nFun, but aggravating.

Then Dead Core might be your jam. However, I would urge anyone else to avoid this game. On the bright side, you should know whether or not this game infuriates you or not well within the window of time presented by the Steam Refund policy. I'm fairly certain I could've gotten past the section I was in if I had spent another 10-15 minutes until I lucked out (actually trying to dodge something made it harder for me to pull off), but humans only live so long, so I'm certainly not going to subject myself to this game any longer, as unhappy as it made me while playing it.\n\nIf you want a really enjoyable first person title with no combat and lots of long jumps and such, play A Story About My Uncle. The story in it is super 'meh,' but it's incredibly fun and aside from character models, it's quite pretty. I highly recommend it.

You know what you have to do, but good luck pulling it off. Sometimes you can improve your performance by figuring out an even faster way to nmove on and sometimes finding collectibles requires some thinking but you can play through without ever just standing there for half an hour wondering what to do next.  Portal on the other hand is figuring out the solution to a puzzle. Actually performing that solution in most cases isnt that hard.\n\nSecondly there is nigh 0 story in Deadcore. That is not a bad thing, it isnt neccesary. There are hidden collectibles that give access to texts that will give you an idea of what the story is, but you have to find those first, so there is a good chance you go through the game without any story, also there is no voiceacting. This of course also means that there is no humor, but again that is not what this game is about or needs. Meanwhile Portal has its great and funny voiceactors that carry you through the game and you always know why you are where you are etc.\n\nthird the gun. yeah you use a physics doing gun in each game. In deadcore it is used to disable enemies and activate or deactive different mechanics, you dont always need it, there is a good chance you can get through a section without using your gun once. In Portal it basically is your main mechanic\n\nSo yeah that should explain why its an apple-pears comparison.\n\nNow deadcore itself in my opinion was great fun. Some say it is to difficult and I can agree that it can get punishingly tough, but the last checkpoint usually wasnt far away and you get right back in the action. Id say a downside is falling off stuff since you are basically waiting to slam into death or going to the menu and clicking restart from checkpoint, neither of which are as fast as dying from anything else.\n\nThe abilitys all work and except for a rocket-jump like function all work very well, though sometimes precise landing can be a problem when for example your dash shoots you farther than you wanted. The rocket-jumpish ability btw almost never comes into use (in my playstyle, which means just trying to finish the level) so it isnt a problem.\nNow the mechanics of the game world itself are mostly pretty good, but the gravitation changing combined with your camera moving and often the gravitation sections being the hardest to see where to go and what to do next can be a real pain.\nAlso the enemies could have been done better. I kind of feel like they are more of a nuisance than anything else. THere is a swarm of tiny enemies for example that slows you down and makes you less mobile and is therefor generally your death. This of course also means that once it has you escaping gets even harder. What is even worse is that these are most commonly found in the already hard enough gravitation segments. The other 2 enemy types are less annoying but all together I think this game could have done without them.\nOh and devs you will never read this but: PLEASE DEACTIVATE PAST CHECKPOINTS THAT NO SENSIBLE PERSON WOULD USE ANYMORE IN SOME PATCH! You can easyly lose everything in some sections of the game because instead of falling to your death you fall on top of a checkpoint hat is basically where you started half an hour ago and there is no way you can undo it and that is just rage inducing and a game killer.\nThankfully it isnt possible for this to happen often and probably you just have to have my luck for it to happen at all.\n\nNow about speedrunning: yes, this game is used for speedrunners showing off with leaderboards etc. Is it hard to speedrun through? Is it good and fun to speedrun through? No idea, if there was an opposite of a speedrunner that'd be me. Though the game often offers paths that are faster but as a price more difficult. Now if you, like me, are not a speedrunner that isnt even an issue. How fast you complete the game means nothing if you dont want to shine on some leaderboard. Oh but dont excepect the game to be slow, until you reach a platform where nothing tries to kill you you have to be fast and precise or die.\n\nAll together great fun but not very long, by on sale if you like challenges","June 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has more emphasis on running and going fast then solving puzzles like portal, but it is a game based with heavy interest in speed running! Though it is not speed running video game, those games almost always suck.\n\nAnd about my last point. It is really hard and annoying sometimes, but that only makes the game more fun and addictive!

It has a futuristic setting and the whole game will throw you for a trip.\n\nI don't think there is much in the way of story, just scattered words and logs across the game. Not really a big focus.\n\nThe main gameplay has you jumping and sprinting around. It starts our very simplistic but as they give you new mechanics things can start to become very challenging. I would highly recommend you don't play this game if you have some type of motion sickness as the gravity sections might be difficult to take. That said, the gameplay is very smooth, unique, and fun. Not many platform games give you this much freedom to move around with, and very rarely do you see first person platform games at all. The game has 6 or so levels, and took me about 3 and a half hours. The game also has collectibles you can find which would greatly add to the gametime, I personally didn't go for them. The game greatly encourages speedrunning, with leaderboards and even a speedrunning mode. Hell there's a clock on the Gun at all times.  I can see how the mechanics could be creatively used by speedrunners to get through levels quickly. I'm usually pretty competent at platformers and even I had a lot of trouble in some sections so I would say this game could be pretty difficult for more casual players. It could do with more checkpoints in some sections.\n\nThe overall look and feel of the game is something to be admired. While it can be a little monotone at times, the emptiness and beauty of the levels isn't lost on me, and some of the crazy mechanics will surprise you. I feel the gravity mechanic will be either greatly loved or hated, depending on your perspective, but it is something to appreciate that you don't get to see much in a first person game.\n\nThe game also includes a weapon and enemies but this is either meant to be underutilized or just meant to give you more things to do. Enemies are just there to be shot once, to stop them for a moment, while you continue platforming. I feel it's unecessary.\n\n\nPros\n-Solid/Smooth Gameplay\n-Very Pretty Aesthetics\n-Creative Unique Mechanics\n-Speedrunner Support\n-Challenging\n-Interesting Level Design\n-Collectibles!\n\nCons\n-Uninteresting/Lacking Story\n-Might be too challenging or needs more checkpoints\n-Somewhat short without looking for extras/speedrunning\n-Droning Music\n-Annoying Sound Effects (in some areas)\n-Sometimes level design can be confusing\n-Enemies and Weapon feel somewhat pointless\n\nI liked DeadCore a lot. I feel that if it was a longer game there could be a lot more creative mechanics added instead of relying on the few ones the game has. It might not become your favorite game, but I would recommend everyone at least takes a look to appreciate what is being done here.\n\n\n7.7/10","July 5, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I was having trouble with a level that required the player to repeatadly dash through a series of gates and land on a jump pad. I beat it instead by using the jump pad to land on top of the gates and jump over all the obstacles. That exploit wasn't left in by accident; the devs clearly expected players to find this solution and didn't make any attempt to stop us from using it.\n\nBiggest con: Checkpoint placement is always tricky to get right in a game like this. Too frequent and it feels like handholding. Too far apart, and the game turns from a test of skill into one of patience and your ability to learn the obstacles by rote. Deadcore definitely landed in the second court at plenty of points.\n\nIn addition, the greatest downfall to first person platforming is the inevitable lack of proprioception. There were some challenges that were very difficult to complete because playing a videogame means you lack peripheral vision and a sense of how much space you occupy.\n\nFun, but aggravating.

Part of the reason for this is that I tend to be absolutely terrible at them, going all the way back to Super Mario Bro's.  The only reason I even picked this game up was because it was on sale and I had just recently had a hankering to replay the Portal Games (the only platformer I had ever truly enjoyed) but this caught my eye on the sale page.\n\nDeadCore is not Portal or Portal 2 or Super Mario Bro's.  There is no real story even if there are supposed tidbits of information granted through an annoying "journal" style system that you pick up as collectibles.  There is no protagonist or antagonist either really there are enemy bots of sorts, but thats about it.\n\nSo do I reccomend it? Without a SINGLE doubt.  Why?  Because it absolutely gorgeous, it is fun, it is challenging, and it isn't all that expensive for what you get.  Buy it at full price or wait for a sale and buy it then.  But buy DeadCore and play it.\n\nI hadn't really realized one prime reason that I always get bored with platformers and drop them without finishing them.  And that is because generally if you fail in a platformer, if you make one tiny mistake, they throw a huge failure screen in your face, taunting you with your lack of skill, and eating up a comparitively huge chunk of time.  DeadCore doesn't.  It instantly respawns you and lets you try again.  Your spawn points in the game are mostly close enough that if you die you get set back, but not so far that you want to flip a table.  The sounds are great, the game is beautifully artistic and has a very cool Tron sort of feel with the way that lighting is done, and I died 975 times before I made it to the top of the tower without realizing it.  In most similair games they would take between 10-15 seconds for the screen to go black, taunt you with your death, go through some sort of animation, then maybe put you back in.  That would mean 162.5 to 243.75 minutes of cut screen.\n\nThank you DeadCore for not wasting my time... I can proudly say as a non-platformer gamer I've completed it and may play the additional content in the future.","November 1, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each level introduces a new mechanic adding a new layer to platforming. The levels feel like large obstacle courses that slowly ramp up in difficulty. Every level also  features multiple pathways encouraging multiple playthroughs.\n\n+ Speedrun mode allows you replay the story campaign missions in addition to bonus levels that are unlocked by playing the story campaign to compete for the fastest times. You play these levels thinking how good you are only to watch  videos online and realize how little skill you actually have.\n\n+ Great controls lead to great platforming. The platforming is less about precision and more about timing. When to dodge lasers, when to jump, when to avoid enemies etc. Every new section is like a puzzle, figuring how to reach the end, how to get the timing down just right etc, leads to a lot of satisfaction. You will die A LOT but that isn't a bad thing because every death means you learn something new. Once you die you instantaneously respawn at the checkpoint so you never have to wait. This may not seem important but when you die very frequently it becomes important to get back into the game as fast as possible.\n\n+ Enemies are introduces in the later levels to add variety. You can temporarily stun them with you weapon or you can try to avoid them.\n\n+ Techno soundtrack fits perfectly with the overall theme of the game\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n-The game has a bug that doesn't seem to remember your settings every time you start the game. You have to go back into settings for the game to recognize it. Some levels had a few random bugs making it almost impossible to complete.\nRestarting the level fixed these issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are the type of person to rage quit, this game may not be the best for you as it requires patience, timing, skill and a bit of luck. An enemy in the wrong place can make a good run turn ugly very quickly. If you are willing to  put up with that however, you may find yourself playing one of the best platformers on steam.","November 2, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You know what you have to do, but good luck pulling it off. Sometimes you can improve your performance by figuring out an even faster way to nmove on and sometimes finding collectibles requires some thinking but you can play through without ever just standing there for half an hour wondering what to do next.  Portal on the other hand is figuring out the solution to a puzzle. Actually performing that solution in most cases isnt that hard.\n\nSecondly there is nigh 0 story in Deadcore. That is not a bad thing, it isnt neccesary. There are hidden collectibles that give access to texts that will give you an idea of what the story is, but you have to find those first, so there is a good chance you go through the game without any story, also there is no voiceacting. This of course also means that there is no humor, but again that is not what this game is about or needs. Meanwhile Portal has its great and funny voiceactors that carry you through the game and you always know why you are where you are etc.\n\nthird the gun. yeah you use a physics doing gun in each game. In deadcore it is used to disable enemies and activate or deactive different mechanics, you dont always need it, there is a good chance you can get through a section without using your gun once. In Portal it basically is your main mechanic\n\nSo yeah that should explain why its an apple-pears comparison.\n\nNow deadcore itself in my opinion was great fun. Some say it is to difficult and I can agree that it can get punishingly tough, but the last checkpoint usually wasnt far away and you get right back in the action. Id say a downside is falling off stuff since you are basically waiting to slam into death or going to the menu and clicking restart from checkpoint, neither of which are as fast as dying from anything else.\n\nThe abilitys all work and except for a rocket-jump like function all work very well, though sometimes precise landing can be a problem when for example your dash shoots you farther than you wanted. The rocket-jumpish ability btw almost never comes into use (in my playstyle, which means just trying to finish the level) so it isnt a problem.\nNow the mechanics of the game world itself are mostly pretty good, but the gravitation changing combined with your camera moving and often the gravitation sections being the hardest to see where to go and what to do next can be a real pain.\nAlso the enemies could have been done better. I kind of feel like they are more of a nuisance than anything else. THere is a swarm of tiny enemies for example that slows you down and makes you less mobile and is therefor generally your death. This of course also means that once it has you escaping gets even harder. What is even worse is that these are most commonly found in the already hard enough gravitation segments. The other 2 enemy types are less annoying but all together I think this game could have done without them.\nOh and devs you will never read this but: PLEASE DEACTIVATE PAST CHECKPOINTS THAT NO SENSIBLE PERSON WOULD USE ANYMORE IN SOME PATCH! You can easyly lose everything in some sections of the game because instead of falling to your death you fall on top of a checkpoint hat is basically where you started half an hour ago and there is no way you can undo it and that is just rage inducing and a game killer.\nThankfully it isnt possible for this to happen often and probably you just have to have my luck for it to happen at all.\n\nNow about speedrunning: yes, this game is used for speedrunners showing off with leaderboards etc. Is it hard to speedrun through? Is it good and fun to speedrun through? No idea, if there was an opposite of a speedrunner that'd be me. Though the game often offers paths that are faster but as a price more difficult. Now if you, like me, are not a speedrunner that isnt even an issue. How fast you complete the game means nothing if you dont want to shine on some leaderboard. Oh but dont excepect the game to be slow, until you reach a platform where nothing tries to kill you you have to be fast and precise or die.\n\nAll together great fun but not very long, by on sale if you like challenges","June 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Double-jumping, available from the get-go, is always a welcome relief in games like these, as it makes you feel more in control of your movements (Remember how good it felt to finally earn it in SotN?)\n\nPlatformers are generally not my thing, but this game sold me on its creativity (and the sale), and failed to disappoint.

Most of the platforms are spaced out at just the wrong length, so that you have to back up and try to precisely land on them (which may not sound like much, but really ruins the flow of the game), and there are some obstacles that are just plain not fun to try and get through, like those lines of squares with the lasers on the top and bottom that require perfect timing down to the milisecond or you have to restart. I stopped playing after trying about 50 times to get passed a badly designed obstacle to no avail. However, aside from those things, the core mechanics of the game feel really nice to control. I'd love to see a sequel in which more thought is put into the levels, and they're designed to flow well, where the challenge comes from staying focused and moving through the level with quick reaction time instead of nitpicky traps and obstacles that feel like it was the game's fault instead of yours for messing up.","August 11, 2015","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are smooth and the mechanics of the game are easy to learn (difficult to master). Double-jumping, available from the get-go, is always a welcome relief in games like these, as it makes you feel more in control of your movements (Remember how good it felt to finally earn it in SotN?)\n\nPlatformers are generally not my thing, but this game sold me on its creativity (and the sale), and failed to disappoint. Finally getting around to playing it, I found I didn't want to stop.\n\nIf you love your platform games, 9.99 is a solid buy for a very solid game. But even if it's not, wait for a sale and give it a shot; you might be surprised.","July 31, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale and thought it might be worth a few hours of fun, but I sure didn't expect it to be THAT good.\n\nAt first, DeadCore appears to borrow a lot from the Portal franchise: the silent protagonist in first person who has only one gun that is actually a sciencey contraption, the vast, dehumanized and very dangerous environments, the fact that you can fall from any distance without hurting yourself, no health bar, most of the sound effects are very similar, the clean techno-futuristic æsthetics... it even has got the cute little robots that casually try to kill you while doing silly voices.\n\nBut the comparison stops right there. Far from being a Portal knockoff, DeadCore seems rather like an homage, with its own distinctive personality and game mechanics. Here, the emphasis is really not on puzzles and reflection — most puzzles are solved at a glance and necessitate about mere seconds of thought; even if it gets mind-bending with the introduction of the G-Mod, it still doesn't really require you to think — but on pure skill. Mad skills, I would say.\n\nThis game seems like the embodiment of the popular gaming expression "Git gud or git REKT". It really requires you to concentrate to a point you're not used to, even if you're a core gamer, and I apologize to my keyboard and mouse for the liters of sweat I've been pouring on them because of it. You hear you roommate sneeze in the distance, it breaks your concentration for a handful of nanoseconds, and BAM you don't know it yet but you are already dead. This game tolerates no approximation, and even less attention deficit. Which quickly becomes a great thing because you really feel yourself get better, and better. It's like a simulation of the process of honing your skills. Which feels AWESOME. And yeah, you won't ragequit and storm off the room. You will get better. Because the game is very addictive.\n\nThe most beautiful part of it is that it is never frustrating. The game keeps punishing you, but you always feel like it's well deserved and that it's your fault if you just respawned on the checkpoint. Even the checkpoint system itself, which I am not a fan of, isn't as punishing as it could be, as there are plenty of said checkpoints — the only problem with it is when you accidentally freefall from a high place right onto a checkpoint that is located at a much earlier point in the level: that is worth a few screams.\n\nWait, have I mentioned how æsthetically pleasing it is? It looks really beautiful. Gorgeous lighting, very fine textures, particle effects up the ♥♥♥... and it seems crazy how well it is optimized. On my old entry-level rig (Core i5-2400S / GT 730 / 8GB DDR3) the game gets an average of 45 FPS, in 1080p, with the graphical settings on Ultra. On the lowest settings I blasted through the 300 FPS barrier. This seems insane for a game released in 2014. How did they accomplish this magic? Maybe the fact that most elements are cube-shaped lowers drastically the general polycount? Anyway, it looks very good; and the music is very good too. Its blend of ambient and drum'n'bass just goes perfectly with the levels, which is actually quite rare in a game. It is really well done.\n\nNow, a bit of criticism, because this game isn't perfect either. My biggest enemy in the game? Keyboard lag. In a game like this, it is particularly deadly and frustrating. I don't know why it happened so much, but damn, it did. There were also quite a few bugs along the way. Some were harmless, some were helpful, some got you killed instantly. And, in my humble opinion, making this game a FPS was a mistake. Sure, it looks cool, and helps a lot with the immersion. But in an environment where any literal misstep can cost your your life, it would actually be great to be able to see your damn feet! How often did I get touched by one of the laser barriers and wonder which part of my body actually triggered the death! Did I get hit on the left? Right? Head? Legs? Actually seeing your character would have made a lot of deaths way less puzzling. Sometimes the game feels like playing a manic shooter where you can't see your hitbox. It makes the experience less enjoyable.\n\nBut globally, DeadCore is enticing, very pretty, tons of fun, and never boring. It is a puzzle-platformer-FPS but often feels more like a racing game and procures sensations similar to the likes of games such as F-Zero or WipeOut. This, despite the fact that nothing about it is actually new, makes it feel innovative and very very refreshing.\n\nObviously, I would recommend it in a heartbeat. This is videogaming as I love it and most gamers — from the Tetris hardcore player to the Super Mario Galaxy fan — should love it and enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.\nA well-deserved 9,5/10.","August 9, 2015","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have two main gripes with the game that prevent me from even caring to continue playing it.\n\n1) The "Story" mode just...isn't.  Perhaps it is only because I never even completed the first level (more on that in point #2), but upon starting the game, you're thrust into the gameplay. No explanation of where you are or why.  No indication that there is any goal to the game other than just jumping to the next platform.  Now, I'm not saying every game needs to have a fantastic story in order to be enjoyable, but if there's an option for a "Story" mode, there really ought to be a story.\n\n2) This is the deal-breaker for me.  It's been talked about over and over again: platforming from a 1st-person perspective is a horrible, horrible idea.  Since it is impossible to see your feet, prepare to die.  Again. And again. And again.  Why?  Not because you made a grave mistake, but because it is IMPOSSIBLE to tell exactly where you are going to land.  Every jump is an estimate (unless you look straight down whilst jumping, thus making the shooting mid-jump impossible).\n\nSo do I recommend this?  No.  I did not even complete the very first level because I was first completely bored with the gameplay and lack of story, and then because I just kept dying over and over again due to the design of the game (not due to its difficulty).\n\nIf I'm bored within seconds of starting a game, that's probably a bad sign.\n\nNow, I'm sure some will love the competetive nature of the game and the leaderboards and to them I say "Wonderful!"  This isn't the type of game I can get behind, however, because unless you're willing to devote hours to trial and error just to get your name at the top of a silly, pointless list, this is just a waste of time.","August 9, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I was having trouble with a level that required the player to repeatadly dash through a series of gates and land on a jump pad. I beat it instead by using the jump pad to land on top of the gates and jump over all the obstacles. That exploit wasn't left in by accident; the devs clearly expected players to find this solution and didn't make any attempt to stop us from using it.\n\nBiggest con: Checkpoint placement is always tricky to get right in a game like this. Too frequent and it feels like handholding. Too far apart, and the game turns from a test of skill into one of patience and your ability to learn the obstacles by rote. Deadcore definitely landed in the second court at plenty of points.\n\nIn addition, the greatest downfall to first person platforming is the inevitable lack of proprioception. There were some challenges that were very difficult to complete because playing a videogame means you lack peripheral vision and a sense of how much space you occupy.\n\nFun, but aggravating.

The game offers more post-game content in the form of time trials, composed of both areas from the story and additional maps of greater difficulty, but I find they don't offer the same magic that the main campaign offers.\n\n\nUltimately, the game is pretty short, but it accomplishes everything it wanted to in those hours, and ends before the game risks becoming tedious.  Very much worth your time.\n\nEdit:  Don't ask me why, but the developers completely whiffed the projectile animation.  Your bullets look slow and inaccurate, but in actuality the gun shoots dead-accurate and instantaneously fast, meaning you should NEVER try compensate when aiming for a moving target.

Some sections Have moving grav lift platforms with moving lasers above them. You have to not only gauge your timing to land on the jump you must also gauge the timing of the above laser. This wouldn't be as difficult if you could see both at the same time. As it stands there is about a fullscreen length difference in the item placements. Some jumps are hard to gauge unless you've gone through the game before. That being said the checkpoint system is pretty generous. However, i can only believe it is as such because of the "difficulty" built into the game. It should be difficult because of the skill required, not because of oddly place jumps.","August 20, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They you'll love deadcore.\n\nOk, that's an exaggeration.  For $10, you actually can't beat the entertainment value.  Great graphics, a neat conecpt, and neatly implemented.  Very stable game, and very polished.  My only complaint is that the latter stages of the game turn into a 'success by 1000 tries' scenario.  You'll see the path to complete the puzzle in front of you, but due to a slight misstep or under calculation, you'll bite it and have to start from your last checkpoint.  This is particularly annoying when you have to dash through a narrow corridor upside down while spinning right side up as 5 lazers close in on you, or something similar to that.  It's neat when you get it, but the 999 times that you died before trying it cheapen the experience.  In the earlier levels, you zip around and you feel like youre accomplishing something using your skills.  In the latter levels, you feel like you eventually got lucky.\n\nOverall, if you have $10 to spare, pick it up.  You'll enjoy it overall.

The levels (only 5) are huge and the last ones will be pretty long and hard.

There is a secret ending, so replay value is correct.\nLastly, soundtrack is awesome, but I expected a bit more about the enemies. In the last level they were pretty annoying in some places, finally they could have added a "final boss" similar to the last enemy you discover so the end would be just perfect and rewarding (I have to admit that the normal ending was cool enough).\n\n9/10","August 18, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, the game seems easy since the first stages are basically jumping from platform to platform but the difficulty kicks in by the time the game introduces new mechanics to the player. One of these mechanics includes enemies that try to knock you off the platforms, instant death ray beams and an aura of purple that changes the laws of gravity. These mechanics add a challenge that most platformers can’t offer to the same degree. The only game I’ve play that is somewhat similar to this is portal, however, in portal the demanding parts were mostly trying to figure out how to navigate the testing chambers in a puzzle like way where in Deadcore the struggle was trying to maintain the right amount of speed while avoiding any death traps.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the few flaws of the game are certain areas that weren’t designed properly. For example, near the end of the game there were supposed to be a series of death pillars that moved towards you while you were stuck in a reverse gravity field but they started to glitch out so badly they started spawning at the end, sucking all the challenge away from the section. There was also a bit of a problem when it came to shooting, aside from the inclusion of iron sights (probably one of the most pointless reasons to have ADS) the precession of where you hit the targets were very demanding, especially when it came to the fan obstacles. Other than that, the game functions perfectly.\n\nThere is no real story in this game but it doesn’t need one, what matter when it comes to this game is being a fast paced platformer which it does excellently. Another aspect that I loved about this game was the design, this is by far one of the most visually impressive games I’ve played. I have an appreciation for games with abstract imagery being used as a background of the game so it’s no surprise that the visual style of the game blew my mind.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a game that’s fast paced, visually impressive, or challenging, then Deadcore is the game for you. It truly is one of the most underrated games out there and I would love to see it getting the recognition it deserves.\n\n9/10\n","August 21, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll probably mess with the speedrun mode for a bit as well.  So, my verdict?  Deadcore is a blast.  The game is a sci-fi styled puzzle/platformer/shooter where you're stuck in a sort of computer glitch/alternate dimension where you must scale a huge tower using quick reflexes and every ability in your arsenal.  If you mix Mirror's Edge, Portal, the movie Cube, Megaman and some other similarly themed games and movies, you will have Deadcore.  This is not a game for those looking to relax or have an easy go of things.  Your patience will be tested but there was certainly a sense of accomplishment whenever you'd complete a very difficult section and finally reach that elusive next checkpoint.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay sees you jumping from block to block/platform to platform while dodging moving laser fields, robotic foes hellbent on knocking you into the abyss and every other oddity you can imagine.  There are disorienting anti-gravity sections that will turn you on your head, jump pads, gravity tunnels that send you hurtling towards danger that you must avoid and much, much, much more.  You get a few abilities like a dash to help you out as well as the Switch Gun that does everything from activating objects in the enviroment that you need to use in order to progress to stopping your robo-foes dead in their tracks.  There is a story and it's told passably enough through numerous data logs that you can collect as you climb this digital Tower of Babel.  Speaking of collectibles, there's plenty to find.  In addition to the logs there are also music tracks, Switch Gun upgrades and Sparks (that open up new pathways of travel) to find.\n\nDeadcore takes place in a pretty unusual setting that is brought to life thanks to some excellent graphics.  You'll truly feel the awe and scope of the situation you're in as you look up and see how far you literally have to climb to get to the next area.  Particle effects dazzle, threats are well-animated, dizzying gravity changes look awesome as the scenery flips every which way and the overall atmosphere is a slice of sci-fi goodness that looks simultaneously grand and opaque, all in the same breath.  It's not THE most beautiful game ever created as some of the enviroments can get a bit samey, but 90% of the time Deadcore is a pleasure to the eye.  The sound is pretty strong as well, if not quite as crystalline as the graphics are.  Robotic foes make c3po noises, your Switch Gun shots pack a fair punch and everything is perfunctory in terms of special audio FX.  Where the sound really shines is with the techno/industrial soundtrack that pumps adrenaline in the background; complimented by numerous dips into trip-hop ambience.\n\nEven if Deadcore packed a simply average presentation it wouldn't matter much because in a game as challenging as this one, the controls are the most important aspect.  MOSTLY, they are competently well done and accurate enough for you to do the job but let's face it...you're going to DIE and die you will as you struggle with all of your might to pass the 5 main levels in story mode.  Jumping, dashing, shooting the Switch Gun and avoiding threats works most of the time and pulling off a series of daring saves and escapes is satisfying and breathtaking to chain together.  The real big BUT here is that sometimes things just don't work as they should.  Movement is a bit floaty and even if your leaps and dives are dead on the money, you are bound to go sliding off your perch.  The game has its own physics to master. Sometimes the game requires lining up perfectly between several moving lasers and these segments are rarely passable on the first attempt.  In addition to the "float" controls, there are instances where your button presses won't register AT ALL.  My keyboard is new, clean as a whistle and generally in top-notch condition, but that didn't stop the f*cking Space Bar from not accepting my double jumps many, many times even if I waited a moment on a platform to make sure that the double jump ability reset itself.  Checkpoints are oftentimes pretty fairly located but there are several portions of the game where you'll need to cover a darn good chunk of distance to reach one and in these cases the ill-response of the controls will have you repeating these portions over and over and over again.  What makes it fun is the fact there is a Steam Achievement that can only be unlocked by dying a hilarious # of times.  I laughed to myself seeing this, saying, "Ha, even if this game is tough as nails, I'll never die THAT much."  I'm not sure what's scarier...the fact that I scoffed at the idea of dying so frequently or the fact that I reached the achievement before I totally completed level 3.  Good God...I died fast and hard!   But I kept trying and playing...\n\nIn terms of replay value, masochists like myself will find more than enough of it in Deadcore.  I'm already starting a second playthrough to see if I can grab all of the collectables at the very least and there is also a speed-run mode available where you can stack yourself up against the competition all over the world and try to best the developer's times.  This is one of those games  that I'll probably lose interest before getting every single achievement (I won't be good enough to get a few either I'm sure), but it's going to keep me playing long after a single completion.  In fact, I hope to get some more out of it in after writing this review.  There's not much else to say here.  This game was pretty darn great and worth the money I spent on it.  Though I hit on the controls fairly hard, I do want to enforce the notion that you will get better and come to get a grip on the movement in this game the more that you play.  I kind of disagree with the folks that say you can't get better at it.  I did.  It has its quirks, but I see them as masterable quirks.\n\nLet me break down as always into what I liked and what I didn't in a more quick reference style!\n\nPros:\n\n-Excellent graphics and visual effects\n-Great lighting and particle explosions\n-A small but useful selection of abilities and Switch Gun modes\n-Fun level design with alot of different challenges packed into each one\n-Decent sound design with exceptional music\n-Lots to see and do (collectibles, alternate modes, different paths, etc.)\n-Controls are a pain but somehow become adaptable if you stick with the game\n-Interesting story premise\n\nCons:\n\n-Controls are NOT for the casual gamer (I'm pretty hardcore...not the best, not the worst, so I had fun learning to get better at them)\n-While the graphical sights are impressive, they do get samey as the game goes on\n-Though the music was excellent, sound was rather humdrum\n-Story itself becomes passe as the game progresses (perhaps ending #2 will shed more light)\n-Enemies feel like an annoying afterthought.  They aren't particularly challenging as the platforming is the real challenge and they feel more like an annoyance than necessary to the gameplay.\n-For a game focused on speed, there are certain segments where you must sit and assess the situation even if you already know the level.\n-Sometimes the controls flat out don't respond\n\nOverall, I had a blast with Deadcore.  I got more enjoyment out of it than Portal...just my humble opinion.  It's going to tick you off sometimes but every time I wanted to put the game down I found out that I simply couldn't for long.  It was fun more often than it was annoying.  The sci-fi setting was cool and when the controls were hitting their stride, there was plenty of satisfaction in pulling off several quick movements in succession.  Hopefully, a few of the games issues will be addressed and upgraded, or fixed in a sequel.\n\nRating:  8/10","November 17, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A good mix of parkour and platforming with an FPS type feeling to it. It's challenging without being straight out annoying, and the level designs allow you to sometimes find your own path instead of following the meant one. Also, since there's no downside with death besides going back a little ways, it allows to explore. And it's a gorgeous game.\nHowever, there are a few con'. Some of the level designs require precision, while the mechanics aren't meant to be precise, making deaths sometimes a little too common. Because of this, you often spend more time looking at the ground to see where you're going instead of the amazing looking world. And the difficulty curve can be a little much at times.\nHowever, it's still an enjoyable game.","March 6","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of side-jumping to find hidden items and you can also "glitch" a lot by jumping on edges. which actually makes the game more fun than feeling it's broken.\n\nBad - Only thing I can't talk well about are the requirements, they're off the wall. I'm running 6core 3.2 CPU, 6BG RAM and HD 5500 1GB. But I can only play this game on LOW and on the absolute LOWEST resolution which sucks b*lls.

Air movement is a little too feathery, though. I kind of wish there was bhopping or something in the game instead of the dash ability. The lore is also pretty interesting. Like any good platformer, there's tons of stuff to collect. The game's environment changes each time you do a cycle and new paths are opened up. No two playthroughs are going to be the same. Since the game is quite difficult and the obstacles rely on actual gaming ability/reaction time, or just creative intuition to get passed them, I'm actual glad there's a checkpoint at every corner.\n\n"You see those ominous pillars in the distance?

It feels like a fps custom map rather than a game about speedrunning.\n\nIf you wonder what I mean, check out Cloudbuilt. It has features like wall running, boosting and grabing ledges that make it feel like a much better speedrunning game than jump, crouch and shoot.","June 2","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine a really tough minecraft parkour map with slow shooting turrets whose bullets just push you, laser walls, moving laser walls and flying cubes that can use a wave attack that simply pushes you. And that's just from what I've experienced in the short time I spent playing this game, I shutter thinking of what other obstacles they've added to the game. If you see this and like what you've read thus far then don't think, just buy!","June 4","true","1.2"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
