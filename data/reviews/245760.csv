During the first half of the game you play back when the transformers were still on Cybertron. Now this sound good to you, it sounded ammazing to me, but the developers were too lazy to even try to bring the charm from the previous games.  Character models are ripped straight from the previous games with absolutely no texture upgrades or improvements. Oh, but they couldn't be bothered with bringing in all of the sound files, because nearly every single character is missing one of their transforming sound effects. Pre-rendered HD cutscenes have been replaced by laggy, buggy, boring cutscenes that use in-game graphics and end up looking like garbage. Instead of buying weapons and their upgrades, you earn chests at the end of levels that randomly give you character trophies, perks, gear, and weapons. This is a failed attempt to innovate the game because 90% of the time you are getting ♥♥♥♥ you've already gotten, which it then converts to a crappy perk or something.\nThe second half of the game takes place on Earth in Michael Bay's Transformers universe. If this doesn't already activate red flags just take a seat, sonny. Now, I will give it credit; the graphics on Earth are beautiful. Bright vivid colors, smooth textures, and good looking character models are just a painfull reminder of how good the first half of the game could have looked. My biggest complaint is  absolutely pathetic character roster. You can play as Optimus, Bumblebee, Drift, and Grimlock. That's ♥♥♥♥ing it. Oh, you liked playing as Grimlock in the last game? Good! His controls, transformation animation, attacks, sounds are exactly the same as they were in Fall of Cybertron, just with a new half-♥♥♥♥♥ skin slapped on it. Oh, the final boss is a joke, so don't get your hopes up.\nEven after you finish the god awful campain mode, they ♥♥♥♥ up the multiplayer, which was the part I was looking forward to the most. Instead of modes like team deathmatch, capture the flag, head hunter, etc, with a decent character creator, you get a half-♥♥♥♥♥ escalation mode that forces you to play as characters from the game. It's not fun at all because nobody else plays, so good luck finding a match.\nThis game is a disgrace. It pisses on the good name the last two Transformers games had built, robs you of SIXTY ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS, and wastes time you could have been spending on a better game. ActiVision should be ashamed of themselves. A SHAMEFULL DISPLAY!!","January 14, 2015","false","6.4"," 244 of 263 people (93%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","93","244","263","26","4"

And the console port of Dragon Age: Origins. With a pedigree like that, what could go wrong.\n\nTechnically, there's everything in this that made War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron work - appealing third-person shooting, familiar faces and voices from the G1 Transformers cartoon, and gimmicks hooked in from the Transformers universe that are, admittedly, as compelling as they have been, if nowhere near as fresh. It's deprived of a soul, though.\n\nIt's a product, built and manufactured with devious precision, from the inclusion of the Michael Bay film universe to satiate marketing drive, to scenarios that seem to be outright ripped from prior games. Very few new things happen in this game, instead opting to be some kind of weird, bad DLC for Fall of Cybertron, only selling at full-price, as a tie-in to a often-derided Transformers universe, at least by fans (the same fans that made the High Moon games successful). It's an insult, albeit a perfectly playable one, with a confusing plot, bored actors, tried-and-true gameplay that has nontheless run its course and has been sucked of all joy. Also, it is really ugly. Ech.\n\nNo-one deserved this. High Moon especially, their legacy trampled on as they scream silently in The Activision Purgatory. Rise of the Dark Spark, bafflingly, takes two of the most intensely passionate games of the last decade and turns it into the definition of "shovelware". I could recommend it to people who really, REALLY want to play more of Fall of Cybertron but much, MUCH worse - and if that sounds like it could be fun to you, well, bully t'you, but it's not exactly my idea of a good time, and I don't doubt most would agree with me.","September 26, 2014","false","5.8"," 194 of 209 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","194","209","18","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SireOblivion/recommended/245760/","SireOblivion","Sire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SireOblivion/","415 products in account","If you're played the other two Cybertron titles you'll know that they had no right being as good as they were; the first was a solid third person shooter with an enjoyable story, co-op and a good multiplayer. The second game improved everything about the first game, removed the co-op for a better campaign mode and had a really good multiplayer mode. Where's this game fall into place? Bottom of the barrel.\n\nI've only played one mission (about 20 minutes in) and part of the second and this game is a massive disappointment. The first mission has you as Drift, a new autobot from the forth film who's a Samurai that blurts crap about "honor" but has a deep voice that makes him sound Native American. Right. Oh, and you're also on Earth and things are going down all over the place. You're just dropped into some conflict without any explanation and Lockdown (the seemingly villian) is already established as the enemy. I take it you'll have to see the movie first for this to make any sense. The gameplay is the same from the first two titles, you mow down enemies, transform into vehicles and use special abilities. This game each character has a unique ability, in the case of Drift you get a one-hit-KO attack where he dashed to any nearby enemies and kills them. It looks really really bad. Speaking about looking bad the environment looks awful, you get a drab looking city without any details that looks like it's from a game made 10 years ago, painted brown (of course) and the characters really just don't fit in. Character models look great by the way. Except their vehicle modes, not because of a lack of detail but because I don't think they licensed any vehicles. So instead of turning into a Bugatti Veyron like in the film you turn into a generic sports car that somewhat resembles a Veyron, like how Rockstar does for the GTA games so they don't have to pony up the money. I didn't get a chance to play as the other characters in the intro and Bumblebee and Optimus didn't Transform so I can't say if all vehicles are imitations of what they're supposed to be.\n\nThe second mission I was playing as Shockwave and Soundwave on Cybertron and it looks just like the old games which is really nice, Cybertron has lots of detail and the characters really fit in. They also retain the aesthetic the first two games established and the same voice actors reprise their roles. All is well on Cybertron. But I'm not sure why I'm there? If you remember the end of the last game all of the characters battle on the Ark and get lost in the depths of space in a cliffhanger and presumingly to arrive on Earth but nothing is explained here. The first mission I was already on Earth and the second mission I'm on Cybertron? Again? After we already left? I'm going to assume the rest of the story explains it and that the game is taking place during the other two and after the other two games. At the same time. Or something.\n\nLast but not least, and the greatest offender and the whole reason why I can't recommend this game:\n\nThere's NO multiplayer.\n\nWell, there is, but in only in the co-op "Escalation" mode that was in the previous two games. You fight waves of enemies with friends on different maps and nothing more. This mode was never populated in either of the previous titles because the team deathmatch was just so good. I've dumped more hours in Fall of Cybertron's multiplayer than I have in most of my Steam titles. It was that good and if you've played it you know that I'm right. I was hoping this game would improve upon it, give us more characters to use in multiplayer and repopulate the playerbase which at this point is lacking in Fall of Cybertron. It's ironic that the team that made this game, Edge of Reality, made their mark with the multiplayer only "Loadout" and then completely scrapped the best mode in the Transformers series in favor of a bad campaign and lazy horde mode.\n\nDon't buy this game and instead buy the first two and enjoy the hell out of them and join me and the many Russians that still play Fall of Cybertron's multiplayer. I hope that if his series is to continue, it's under the hand of High Moon Studios. I will amend my review if I feel the game gets any better as you play further into the campaign.\n\nUpdate: 3 hours into the game I'm on Chapter 8 out of 14, there's probably 2 hours left into it. The game has stayed mediocre throughout, but thankfully most of it takes place on Cybertron. I actually haven't gone back to Earth, though I'm guessing the end chapters take you back. So far everything has been a rehash of the same art assets from the previous two titles but don't live up to either games' level design. You even get to play as Bruticus again and it's completely boring; you're in a small area and you spend 10 minutes fighting three different types of enemy and nothing changes. There's a lot of areas where you have to fight wave after wave of enemies and can't progress until you kill enough enemies.\n\nThe dialogue is fantastic though, and you get to play as a lot more characters in this one which is a really nice touch, but the rest of the game doesn't hold up. If you're a big Transformers fan and you have to play it, wait until it's $15.","June 24, 2014","false","5.0"," 770 of 1,001 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","770","1","0","54"

It's sad to see something that I really like assembled in sush a lazy way with no love or care put in to it. The way the game is played is EXACTLY like its predecessor Fall of Cybertron, with little to no effort to optimize. It's littered with re'used animations, props and models from both Fall and War slapped together in a lazy and awkward manner. There are also lots of inexcusable texture fails as well as some really awkward animations in the cutscenes. As an artist this really got on my nerves. The level design was also random and awkward with random prop everywhere or the lack of any with a single console in the middle of an empty room.\n[Edit: What I mean is that many times the game feels really flat with empty rooms and flat textures. Other times I see pieces of the world placed strangely serving no purpose, it's just there.]\n\nPlaying this game made me feel like it was Colonial Marines all over again.\n\nThe audio was inconsistent and the com link had this strange and really annoying sound, was driving me nuts ! It got bugs and glitches everywhere, the companion A.I. is really bad too. It really feels like an unfinished product.\nLastly the Story feels like a really bad fan fiction ... There are 2 story lines, Bayformers and Cybertron. The first 2 or so chapters begin with Drift in Bays universe discovering the EVIL plot device ‘The Dark Spark’. The rest after that is pretty much just explaining how "the EVIL plot device" got there in the first place through the Cybertron universe. And then there's another 2 er 3 or so chapters in the end again with Bayformers with MIGHTY GRIMLOCK !!!! Slapped in there at the last moment as a ‘glorious finish’.\n\nHonestly it's all a real mess and the Bayformers part feels really off from the rest of the game.\n\nBut ... I did really like the dialogs. The interactions between the characters were as awesome and wonderful as always. It had an interesting level and upgrading system. I will say that the game works smoothly in combat, the vehicle forms are still a little clunky. But I say that cuz’ it's more or less exactly the same as Fall of Cybertron.\n\nDoes this make up for all terribleness in this game, no. Do I recommend this game, no.\nHowever as I wrote, I did like the characters, they’re awesome. Shockwave, is. Weird ...\nSo it is worth a look at ... But please for the love of everything that is Transformers !!\nDo NOT, pay full price for this game !!!\n\nOr maybe, watch a game play of it first ?\nJust to make sure you really wanna spend money on it.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Thoughts on Escalation.\n\nI don't like escalation that much I'm more in to tdm multiplayer; sadly Dark Spark did not have one. However Cuz' it's so identical to Fall I can see why they did not have one. But anyway; the escalation is definitely one of the games strong points but the maps do suffer from the things I've mentioned previously. And the bad A.I. doesn’t help. This version of escalation does provide a lot more freedom in both characters and gear, you can mix and match as much as you want, (This also leads to some characters gettin' a tad ooc "out of character" e.g Grimlock with stealth and sniper). However I felt it lacked a sense of progression and the dispensers were placed a little odd, or I dono, it was a lill' off to me.\n\nBut in the end, I can see the charm in it. Personally I got bored with it rather quickly. Felt more or less like a DLC to Fall.\n\nEdit, edit:\nYa know what ?\nSooo Mungry says it all: (Escalation)\nhttp://youtu.be/_DlzwV5vd_4\n\n---\n\nRating: 4 / 10 "Steves" Had its moments ...\n+ Dialaugs and characters\n+ Escalation mode\n- Everything else !!","June 24, 2014","false","12.1"," 327 of 424 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","327","424","0","22"

I read about how bad it was since High Moon didn’t develop it and this game goes to show you how much High Moon loves this franchise because this game definitely lacked the heart of War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron. I am a huge HUGE fan of both of those games and they are the only reason I wanted to try Rise of the Dark Spark. Can’t customize the controls, no FOV slider or fix just like the previous games but at least you can fix the controls with 3rd party software and the first two games had fixes available for the bad FOV however in this game you can’t adjust the FOV at all and I could only play this is short bursts because of massive headaches. This game had a couple of good moments with Jetfire and BumbleBee but that’s pretty much it. The sound needed serious work as it kept cutting to low volume to high volume, missing transforming sounds, enemies repeating annoying lines etc. The first two games had such booming sound effects that you must play them with the volume cranked. My goodness High Moon needs to be saved from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD franchise and put back on other games.\n\nI only recommend this game if you are a huge fan of WFC or FOC and even then this one is barely passable.\n\nI don’t have Dark of the Moon, is that one any good?\n\nFREE HIGH MOON","December 9, 2015","false","6.7"," 112 of 126 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","112","126","10","13"

Really!?! After those great games WfC and Foc(War for Cybertron, Fall of Cybertron) we get this. The campaing sucks and WE HAVE NO MULTIPLAYER! Only escalation(it's the only good thing in the game). No new weapons, just 5 new characters who are from Bayformers... and if I remember right 8 maps to escalation mode where players fight together agains 15 waves of enemies. Thats it. SPOILER WARNING!!! The campaing start in cyberton and the transformers are looking for the mysterious dark spark. After many of boring levels(the leveld don't even fit to FoC storyline) we get to earth AND THE BAYFORMERS UNIVERSE! After great story in the other games before this stupid game, the makers of the game decide to kill everyone! Well Optimus, Bumblebee and Drift are alive... but everyone else is DEAD. No Unicron, no continuing the old story, just combaining Bay's movies and the old good games. The story really SUCKS. There is still some new things: You can level up your character in campaing and escalation(it doesn't effect the game anyway) to level 25, and then you can activate "Prime mode". It means that you have level your character again to level 25 and unlock all characters and weapons again. What is the point in it? And from like achievements and completing waves in escalation you get gearboxes. When you open those boxes you get new weapons, characters, abilities, and upgrades. First its fun, but after a while it will be very boring! You get like 100 gearboxes in 2 minutes! Well not really that much, but I think you get it. The graphics are the same they were in FoC, and controls too. Buy this only If you are a big fan of Transformers. I'm so disappointed to this game... maybe next time we get a better one? :) This was my first review in Steam, I hope it helped you. I give this game 3/10. Sorry Edge of Reality, High Moon Studios just makes better Transformers games.\nUPDATE!!! I was wrong about the story(I went to wiki to check it). The Dark Spark just appeared in the movie universe.

I did not want to believe... The negative reviews, I mean...\n\nI was fully aware this was not a High Moon game. That it would pale in comparison to War for Cybertron or Fall of Cybertron. And honestly, I didn't even expect it to be great. It's just that, after seeing how the same engine was used, as well as the assets, I thought: "Well, perhaps at the very least the shooting is going to be enjoyable? I mean, it cannot really be that bad, right...? right...?".\n\nright...?\n\n<sobs>\n\nLets start by addressing one of the most important things that's missing from this Transformers game, which is NEARLY ALL TRANSFORMATION SOUND EFFECTS. Call me crazy, but I remember spending two minutes pressing F over and over again when I first played War for Cybertron, only for nostalgia's sake. Yet here, off all the assets reused from other games, the only thing they should have reused is missing almost completely. Some of the robot transformations are completely silent.\n\nOh, right, speaking of assets, nearly everything other than voiceovers is reused in some way here, with very little new stuff added. And it's all put together in such a lazy way it's honestly just painful to watch. The environments are bland, empty, ugly, the sound levels are all over the place, the animation is wonky and the pre-rendered cutscenes are so low-res you'd think they were recorded off an Xbox One or something (heyoo!). Not to mention, the level design is a joke, leaving little to no room to use transformations in any fun way, and offering no interesting sights to look at.\n\nBut whatever, Fall of Cybertron was also short on vehicle segments. The question is, how good is the action?\n\nIt's not...\n\nI can't even fully comprehend how they've manged it. Putting aside the fact that the luck/grind based item/weapon unlock system is utter garbage, and the controls somehow feel less responsive than the previous games, the real issue is the fact the enemies are glitchy, dumb and cheap. Enjoy shooting at enemies stuck inside or under a texture, running blindly into a wall while standing next to you, or sniping you from a long distance with a couple of extremely precise rapid fire rounds. Heck, even the Bruticus and Grimlock levels are glitchy and... boring... HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!\n\nThe only redeeming thing about the game are some of the dialogues between known characters and some background lore. Still, neither the Cybertron's, nor the Bay's "story" fit well anywhere within their respective timelines.\n\nOh, didn't I mention that about 1/3 of the game is based on Bayformers? As if things couldn't get any worse...\n\nI got this game off a sale thinking it may not be AS bad as people say, and at the very least I'll enjoy some mindless action. I was wrong and I regret the purchase. I should have played Fall of Cybertron for the 10th time instead.","January 19","false","7.1"," 72 of 80 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","72","80","15","4"

But after playing this...I somewhat felt like the game isn't worth its price tag. Note that I will be comparing this game with War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron.\n*Spoilers are here*\nPlot: The game's plot iss underplayed. For a game that focuses on the Dark Spark, the Dark Spark nor its holders did anything. Lockdown did use the Dark Spark to simply time freeze the Autobots but never capitalize on that. Megatron only used the Dark Spark to create what I will call Terrorcon based from Transformers Prime. Other than that, Megatron never use the Dark Spark to his advantage. In contrast, War for Cybertron focus on Dark Energon. As such, Megatron utilizes Dark Energon to corrupt Cybertron tippng the balance. Thus, I feel as though the entire Rise of the Dark Spark's plot is just another Autobots vs Decepticons fight with nothing that can tip the balance.\n\nGameplay: This game is similar to Fall of Cybertron in terms of control. Progression is different. Instead of gathering energon shards from killed enemies, you now have leveling system. Leveling doesn't boost your character in the campaign. It only serves as a means to reaching Prime mode. Campaign and Escalation are linked with each other. So, if you level up in the campaign, your level in Escalation will be the same as well as the amount of EXP you have. Unlocking and upgrading weapons depend on gear boxes that you get from challenges and leveling up. While this sounds good, it's not. Every time you open the box, you have a chance to earn random items from weapon unlocks, upgrades, TECH item, HACK, and so on. With that said, it can get frustrating to go through many boxes and not get a weapon upgrade to get the last upgrade.\n\nIn terms of the game overall difficulty (assuming you play it on normal), the game tends to spike in difficulty. For example, in a mission where Starscream, Shockwave, and Soundwave are searching for the Dark Spark, they come across a group of Guardians. Okay, nothing too difficult...right? No, there are small drones identical to CLUTCH that can destroy in less than a second. Why? Because they hit very hard. Two or three shots can rip your shields and possibly kill you off. Again, these things are tiny and hard to see. Thus, you have to slowly progress through the level while keeping an eye in the air for one of those nasty thing.\n\nFor online gameplay, you are left with only Escalation...yes, no online competatitve multiplayer. While I'm not a big PVP kind of person, having no online competative multiplayer make this game not even worth the $50. While Escalation is fun, but I have seen people just simply spawn camped the enemies make the game even less of fun time.\n\nGraphic/Presentation:This game is similar to Fall of Cybertron but a bit lesser. The Earth mission areas are somewhat barren especially in the city. The only minor redeeming factor is the looks of mission areas in Cybertron...but it's something that I've already seen.\nThe game does have its own soundtrack, but the majority of the music you will hear is from Fall of Cybertron. This is true when you are playing on Cybertron.\n\nSummary:Overall, I would not recommend to buy this game until the price is down. Even then, you probably won't get your money's worth if you have played the previous game. If you want to get into the Transformers series, this is not the game you want to play.","June 28, 2014","false","20.2"," 105 of 136 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","105","136","0","3"

I guess they were in a hurry to connect these games to the Michael Bay movies and cash in on the movie tie in.\n\nThere's a poorly executed weapon upgrade system that's only good for eating my time away and shattering my immersion.\n\nDialouge and characterization is solid, hilarious, and memorable.\n\nThere were so many impressive moments in Fall of Cybertron, it's sad to see this game sink so hard.\n\nAddendum:\n\nI powered through the game since my review. The difficulty spike seems to have been specific to that one early level as I never died once after that point. However, the game is still the weakest of the three with far fewer memorable, powerful, moving moments.\n\nThe weapon upgrade system and uncrating system ate up a frustrating amount of my time, whoever greenlit the idea of having me sit down and wait on my thumb for thirty chests to open in a row needs to be slapped in the face.\n\nI hear the studio responsible for these trio of games actually shut down, no doubt in response to this game's lackluster performance. To be honest though the first two magnificent games don't get nearly enough attention for how enormously they exceeded my expectations. Even fall of cyberton by itself is worth playing, just ignore that this exists eight hour long game exists since it does virtually nothing you don't get in the superior prequel.","November 1, 2014","false","7.7"," 85 of 106 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","85","106","4","6"

I'm a huge fan of the Cybertron series having bought both War for and Fall of on ps3.  So I was really excited when this game popped up on Steam.  More so because I believed that the series was finished after FoC.\n\nIn terms of story, both War for and Fall of Cybertron moved things along at just the right pace to keep from being too repeative.  By comparison Rise of the Dark Spark plays and looks almost identical to FoC.  The story line is also a lot weaker than the previous games.  The premise had a lot of potential but as other reviews have noted - they really didn't do much with it.  I don't think trying to merge the Cybertron series in with the movie series was a great idea either.  The sections played on Earth and that linked up to the movie were probably the most boring.  Perhaps I'm biased though because I strongly dislike the way Transformers has been treated in the present movie franchise.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes.  If you've played the other games, particularly FoC, then there's basically nothing new here.  Well, actually, that's not strictly speaking true.  Something felt wrong when playing in robot mode.  Either the weapons just seemed too weak or I seemed more vulnerable but I found myself playing through almost the entire game in vehicle mode.  I never seemed to take as much damage,  I could move around faster and the weapons almost always seemed better than anything I could select for robot mode.\n\nI played through the game in about 20 hours but I'm sure it could be done much faster than that.  I collected less than a quarter of the achievements on my first play through but I can't see myself going back and doing the rest.\n\nI did attempt to try out the Escalation mode but it seems like no one else is playing this game.  So I've no idea what that is like.  The promise of being able to play as some old school Transformers seemed like it could be cool though.\n\nOverall the game just felt tired.  Probably because it has all been done before in FoC.... and for that reason I can't really recommend it - at least not at full price.","April 5, 2015","false","22.0"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","31","36","3","1"

Do not buy, even at 25-50% off. Seriously, I bought this at 50% off and I compeltely regret the pruchase. It's buggy as heck - the graphics are terrible - when I started the game most of the textures were in low resolution and on top of that I could literally see through buildings. I took some screen shots but of course the game is so buggy that it doesn't even save them, otherwise I'd post them. Also when trying to interface with the Teletraan you have to be in the "perfect" position otherwise the interface button won't pop up. I literally spent 5 minutes trying to get it to pop up once. Also some enemies are just ridiculous, either by design or (most likely) by bug. They are unkillable and shoot you down within 3 shots, faster than any human reaction time. I am so dissapointed with this game. I love all things Transformers, I have hundreds of them, a tattoo on my arm, and pretty much every comic, but this game.... I completely regret... and I haven't even gotten to the "Bayverse" part (aside from the first chapter which was awful) so I can only imagine how terrible it gets from here on out. I really wish I could get a refund. I loved WoC and FoC, and this game uses the same assets and a lot of the functionality, but it's not at all a sucessor.\n\nFull Moon Studios, please for the love of god make another Transformers game that people can enjoy.

From the horrible textures, the xbox button prompts, the strange diminished sound when speaking, the reused maps, the aimbot robots, and the strange story line. It's difficult to find anything redeeming about this game.\n\nIn the first level you play is a city. It's drab, bleak, grey, and bleak; lacking in color except for the occasional billboard. It looks like it's straight out of some PS2 era game, but worse.\n\nUnlike the first two games, War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron (which are great and I urge you to buy them), the only way to receive new weaponry is to unlock them through a leveling system. The problem with that is that you can't save up for what you want to buy. You have to go through every single previous weapon in order to get what you want.\n\nThe first transformer you get to play is is Drift. He has a special move that instantly kills anyone around him. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that if it were executed correctly, but the problem is that it wasn't. It's coupled with a terrible animation that looks extremely out of place.\n\nIn summery, I doubt that much (if any) work was put into this.

If you want to play this without an Xbox 360 controller, you are out of luck. Most of the button promts are in xbox 360 commands.\n\nThis game is nowhere near as good as the first one. This game on PC is a poor console port. Where most of the promts showing as Xbox 360 buttons and not as keys. Options menu is poor, no customizable keys, so pretty lackluster in that regard.\n\nThe good:\nThe game models looks as expected from a title like this\n\nThe bad:\nOn hard difficulty the game is nearly unplayable, Poor design choice when it comes to map and enemies can make it hard to spot enemies, even at longer range there is pop-in of enemies of the smaller variety, as you will often find yourself dying to seemingly nothing a bunch of times, without any warning or ability to tell where the damage came from as the enemies spawn behind you and give you no indication of them doing so. This is the only game I have ever quit out of frustration, as the harder difficulty can not have been playtested at all. This seems rushed and there was no reason for the game to come out in this state. Some animations in-game are at what looks like 30 fps. So you will be following a AI companion and they will jitterly move forward as a result of only running at a peasant frame rate while as you run as a masterrace frame rate.\n\nThe game overall feels rushed and unfinnished, some cutscenes are in nice ingame render while others are in what looks like 2002 video renders of the game in terrible low quality all pixelated and grainy. It has some charm, but previous titles in the series were better.

It is SHORT, approximately 4 hours, with time wasted doing little achievements and challenges. The game feels completely unfinished and rushed, the storyline is pathetic. Nothing about the game makes sense, nor does it tie in to the previous two games in any real fashion. There is NO resolutiont o anything regarding the "War for Cybertron" universe. In fact, there are only a couple of levels even set in that time frame. The levels that ARE set in that time, occur BEFORE the "Fall of Cybertron" storyline, and are in no way reflected in the "Fall of Cybertron" game. Just a little pocket of non-relevant missions that in no way contributes anything to any storyline. There are bugs and glitches EVERYWHERE. GAME BREAKING bugs that will forcibdly close your game, or force you to reload an earlier checkpoint. Combat and hit detection is clunky, delayed, and completely unpredictable. Horrible terrain and pathing leads to getting hung up on 6 inch stones on the ground. Cutscenes are giant pixelated blocks of pre-rendered garbage, and audio levels throughout the game are completely butchered.

This seems like some programming student's ISP for graduation.

If those two new prospects don't sound very appealing ... it's because it's not. This new "Cybertron" is easily the weakest in the series with a host of flaws and not much new stuff added.\n\nThe games campaign starts off by immediately putting a sour taste in your mouth by starting you off on Earth in the Bayformers universe. The environments on Earth are absolutely horrendous and can leave you asking if the entire game will look this bad, and the answer is only about 30% of it, which is the portion of the game you play in the Bayformers Universe. However if you manage to muscle through the first level you are then transported back to the familiar venues of Cybertron where you will remain until near the end of the game. The Cybertron levels are about on par with previous titles and all the characters retain their looks, voices, and personalities.\n\nGameplay wise this game plays almost exactly like "Fall of Cybertron" so if you've come to love the gameplay of this series then there's no worries on that front. Unfortunately not much new stuff is added to spice up the gameplay. The upgrade system from "FoC" returns with the exact same weapon upgrades, along with TECH, H.A.C.K, and abilities and characters for multiplayer being unlocked through crates that you get by leveling up and completing challenges. These crates vary in level and randomly give out everything mentioned above, so get ready to pull your hair out everytime you open a crate wanting an upgrade to your Riot Cannon and instead get 2 Jetfires, a multiplayer ability you already have, and a bunch of H.A.C.K's.\n\nStory wise this game is a bit of a mess. As I said before the game starts out on Earth in the Bayformers Universe where you play as the new transformer "Drift" who is a samurai robot who hates using guns over his superior folded steel katana's (which he only uses in his new unique ability) and constantly talks about "honor". For the first level Drift will go through an empty, desolate, and all around ugly city fighting off Cybertronian mercenaries working under "Lockdown" who looks less like a transformer and more like a 15-20 ft tall terminator. In the end Lockdown retrieves the titular "Dark Spark" and causes Bay Optimus to flashback to the Cybertron series to describe what the Dark Spark is and how it came to Earth. (And don't worry the Cybertron Universe is still a completely separate from the Bay universe.)\n\nThe Cybertron portion of the game takes place a bit before "Fall of Cybertron" and as I said before, exists to exposit about the Dark Spark. Still the Cybertron portion of the game is  enjoyable with a few of the old veterans returning to be playable. Still a couple of notable characters aren't playable in the campaign at all such as Starscream and Megatron. Very few new characters are introduced in this segment save for a trio of insecticons, one of which is playable in the campaign, and the rest are playable in Escalation.\n\nAfter around 9 or 10 chapters on Cybertron you're thrust back into the Bayformers Universe for the finale. The environments   in the new jungle area are better compared to the city, and the devs must've thought that too since you spend a couple of chapters in this same level. Afterwards you go to an even worse looking city that's completely devoid of color save for grey and brown, where you get to continue to play as Bay Grimlock. This Grimlock isn't very fun to play, with most of his melee attacks lacking weight and you constantly having to use his unique ability to get more health as you get continuously gunned down from all sides. Anyway the games final chapter has you play as Bay Optimus and face off againt the Dark Spark powered Lockdown where he reveals (SPOILER) his evil plan is to make more money in a universe where I didn't even know transformers had money.\n\nLastly the Online has been changed and a bit butchered compared to the last game. There is no competitive PVP, no campaign co-op (like "FoC), and Escalation has been radically altered from previous titles. In this new variant you enter Escalation with a player setup such as character, ability, and weapons and devote all your credits to building and upkeeping base defenses instead of using them to unlock new areas, and weapons. The difficulty has also been significantly toned down and now almost lacks a challenge.","June 27, 2014","false","11.9"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

The enemies say stuff when you are getting attacked and it gets so old and is the worst and cheezy things to say and to make it worse, bad voice acting.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nif you want to jump in and expect even more than FOC. then your absolutely wrong. they removed multiplayer pvp, when that was one of FOC most strongest points to play. The teletran 1 shop has been modified but you can't buy things anymore now its replaced with BF4 battlepacks. did i mention no customization well you can't make your own transformer, and weapon upgrading is so linier you can get characters in battlepacks. They do not even have COOP campaign, something we wanted in FOC but no the only coop is escalation. Animations are lazy\n\nSTORY (SPOILER ALERT)\nnobody dies. This is an episode of the G1 series where the bad thing is destroyed from the bad guys and they escape. Abosolutely lazy story design first chapter is on earth then the next 5 are on cybertron and then suddenly back to earth.\nlockdown is an average bad guy because i was programed to be bad.\n\ni could go on and on why this game is horrid and why you should not buy it. but heres the real mistake. Transformers rise of the dark spark was not made by high moon studios. That is whats wrong high moon would not even center this game around the dark spark cause that would be completely dumb and they would have made a transformers game about something else. and not something that does not even matter in the transformers universe. im giving this game a 2/10 beyond dissapointing and dumb i bought this game for 50$ in the first hour. now to make up my money i have forced myself to get all of the achievements. This game sucks so bad it doesn't even have steam trading cards. i could recomend this for 5$.\n\nand btw dont give michael bay any more money for age of extinction, it was a horrible movie but not as horrible as this game.\n","July 2, 2014","false","18.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Wait for the price to drop before you buy it.\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a third-person shooter based off of both the Michael Bay Transformers movies and the High Moon Studios "Cybertron" games. It attempts to cross over these two fictional universes, and does so with limited appeal.\n\nStory (Spoilers Ahead):\nThe story is...strange. It feels unfinished, unpolished, and quite frankly, lazy. The plots of the movie and Cybertron segments are almost identical: "Villain X has the Dark Spark! We must retrieve it before he unleashes total havoc upon the planet!" The differences are, of course, the antagonist and the setting. The Cybertron story, however, shines brighter than the movie story because it bridges some gaps between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron; we see Shockwave discover the Insecticons, Ironhide's apparent death (as to my remembrance, he did not appear in Fall's campaign), and so on and so forth. The Cybertron story takes place after War but before Fall, acting as a prequel. We see that Starscream has not gone rouge, Trypticon is still offline, and the Ark is still under construction.\n\nWhile I certainly appreciate the attempt at a prequel (and the Cybertron segment is certainly the best part of the campaign because of it), the Cybertron story simply ends up feeling like "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron - Deleted Scenes", and you clearly know WHY they were deleted; the unnecessary plot element we know as the Dark Spark.\n\nThe movie story isn't worth going over; the movie it was based off of was a huge contradiction within itself, so just read a review about Transformers: Age of Extinction for that.\n\nGameplay:\nTransformers: RotDS has exactly the same gameplay as its predecessor, which is both a good and bad thing; Transformers: Fall of Cybertron has excellent gameplay, displaying balance and finesse in its weapons and gunplay, pitting you up against challenging enemies who knew their way around a rifle as well as you do. In any Transformers game, you are both soldier AND vehicle, which is always interesting and fun. This game does not screw up in that department, as the gameplay from Fall of Cybertron was left completely untouched. In fact, a lot of things were left completely untouched...RotDS did not have the same developer as the Cybertron games.\n\nActivision slated a new development company, "Edge of Reality", to make this game in lieu of High Moon Studios. Edge of Reality reused all assets created by High Moon Studios for the Cybertron portion of the game, right down to the weapons, character models, animations, sounds, and effects. The only thing that got a re-do was the HUD, which -does- look rather nice, to be fair. Aside from that, the recycling of High Moon Studios assets was a blatant display of laziness and carelessness that should be frowned upon. They could have at the very least touched up all the in-game assets, giving them a bit of a makeover for the next generation, but not even that was done.\n\nThat aside, there is one large flaw in the gameplay.\n\nTHERE IS NO PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER.\n\nEdge of Reality and Activision apparently thought it would be an excellent idea to omit the thing that practically made the Cybertron series the smash hit that it was: PVP. Instead of any of the PVP gamemodes, even the simple Team Deathmatch, we get a beefed up Escalation mode.\n\nHowever, The new Escalation is my favorite part of the game. You can play as over forty characters from both the Cybertron and movie universes. Essentially, in doing that, all you're doing is selecting your character model and either a ground-based or air-based alt mode. After selecting two characters, you can customize your loadout to your liking.\n\nThe loadout consists of a primary weapon, a heavy weapon, a "robot ability", three "T.E.C.H." abilities, and one "HACK" (if you so choose to enable one). The robot ability is an action you can perform at any time. There's a cooldown time for the ability, so you aren't able to just spam it. T.E.C.H. abilities are like robot abilities, but they are one-time use and generally more powerful. A HACK is a disadvantage you accept in order to gain more XP- similar to Skulls in the Halo series.\n\nYou use all of these in-game to survive 15 waves of enemies, with each wave increasing in difficulty. In the new Escalation, you can set up defenses such as barricades and sentry turrets to help ward off the attackers. In addition to this, there are "power foes"- essentially characters from the campaign thrown into Escalation mode in order to destroy you. It's a nice addition.\n\nRotDS also has a rather nice unlock system for characters, weapons, and abilities. You unlock the aforementioned via obtaining "gear boxes": crates containing unlockable in-game items. (Think: crates in Team-Fortress 2.) You acquire gear boxes by completing missions, hitting landmark waves in Escalations, earning achievements, earning combat distinctions, and simply slaying enemies. I found this to be rather fun and clever. If PVP were implemented, it would be a great way to level up your characters.\n\nGraphics:\nAt first glance, the game looks passable. But once you play it for a while, you notice blurry textures, jagged edges, and animation errors. These are especially prevalent in the Earth levels, in which Edge of Reality had to make new models, textures, and animations, rather than recycle High Moon assets as they did for the Cybertron portions.\n\nOverall:\nThis game was somewhat of a disappointment, although I can't say I didn't like it. At the end of the day, I enjoyed this game. As a compliment to Fall of Cybertron, it would have worked nicely. However, a lack of PVP, a weak story, and a too-high pricetag (that last one especially) make this game not worth it. Once the price drops down to at least $20, it will be worth buying. Until then, if you really want this game, wait for a discount. $50 seems a tad too much for what we're getting.","July 16, 2014","false","24.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The other two Transformers games were great. They had that atmosphere that made them great. They had the story, the graphics, the sound, the physics that made them enjoyable. Not to mention the multiplayer mode. But if you're a transformers-fan you could even enjoy playing the campaign for the dozenth time. This.... this haven't got any of these. (IMO) The new developer, Edge of Reality couldn't make anything new. They just copy/pasted the WfC and FoC files (they actually did: some map parts are exactly the same), wrote a sh*t story and tryied to sell this "product" for almost the same price as the Fall of Cybertron's. So, here're some concretes:\n\n1. The story: the basic idea, combinating transformers universes is a stupid one. In two different TF universes the characters have different backstories, so WfC/FoC Optimus Prime is not Baysformers Optimus Prime (fortunately). So, you can imagine the mess, that it creats. The whole story is about securing this darkly sparking thing, but it couldn't draw my...... I'll be honest: I don't give a sh*t to it. And especially: it doesn't fit to neither WfC/FoC and AoE storylines.\n\n2. The gameplay: that's a mess, too. The fighting style from WfC/FoC is sorely nerfed, you can't enjoy fights as you did in FoC. The coolest thing from WfC, the hand-to-hand combat is almost disappeared. You can't go there to pounce an enemy, no, it will dodge, an shoot you down (or just the AI is more clever than me). The enemys' weapondamage/manpower rate is quite unbalanced. In previous games the enemys did not harm as much as you did, but they were more than you.( or they were Brut-es/icus-) In this game, they harm as much as you but they are a lot more than you. This will cause you end up in a corner with a sniper rifle until the end of the battle, or you'll running cross the battlefield for health packs.\n\n3. The atmosphere: The atmosphere of the game is sh*t. The skins of the game are good, but the textures are ugly.\nThey can't represent FoC's detailed textures. The sounding of the game is ♥♥♥♥ as well. The musics that are "borrowed" from WfC and FoC are good, but the new ones, in the Earth part of the campaign are sh*t. The musicians could use the themes from Age of Extinction, but they didn't. Even its main theme's not original. Sound fx-s were not used correctly, some fx-s were missing (TRANSFORMATION SOUNDS, IN A TRANSFORMERS GAME!), some were too loud, it's horrible. I have to mention, I played through it with 5.1 sounding, but I would rather play it with headphones instead. The centre speaker (which plays dialogues [mostly] and that sounds, which are coming from on-screen things) was more quiet than the others, which caused, that the music and sound fx-s were too loud, and I couldn't or just barely could understand the dialogues. The voice acting wasn't so bad, but I didn't like Optimus Prime's all day long shouting.\n\nThe only good thing that I can tell about this, are some well-known dialogues from G1 between them  quarreling with eachother. For example: Shockwave's comments. (e.g.: "Your incompetence never ceases to amaze me, Starscream." [a well-known G1 line, - very original] It made me laugh. though)\n\nThis game is not good: 3-4/10\n\nI only recommend this game if you've played WfC and FoC so many times that you're bored and it's at least 75% off.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and by now, noone plays even the Escalation mode, so, you can forget about multiplayer. Good luck, and have fun!","July 26, 2015","false","15.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

It raises more questions and only answers one. Leaving the Audience still not knowing what has Happened to Metroplex and Omega supreme, you dont even know what happens to Megatron once he gets to earth or the other Autobots and relies on the Michael bay movies which are Terrable from the start because of the Murder of Jazz. If theyre are any other Hardcore G1 fans Like myself out there, I think you will all agree with me, that the Interchange of plots is Appauling, the exclusion of Key autobots such as Prowl, Windcharger and Brawn further add to this, the Game also appears unfinished as only Escalation is included currently. The combining of the Cybertron and Bay universes was a grave mistake and should never of occured, for instance Grimlock goes from having a Sword in Fall of Cybertron to having a Mace, he also looks dull and we have no clue of what happened to the Ark as Senital Prime did not exist in the Cybertron series it was Zeta Prime and this unbalances and ruins the story line. Preventing us from fulling understanding the plot, and the Assumed death of key characters because of the universes coliding is appualing, and Im not saying that because Jazz dies in the Movie Transformers. This game is Dwarfed by its Prediceser, and is not worth 50$, it is a peice of junk compared to Fall of Cybertron. For other fans Such as me, I say, dont buy this its a waist of Money, and to those whom are looking for a Transformers game I recomend Fall Of Cybertron as this is Just appualing, and not worth the time or effort.\nFurther More if your a Decepticon fan like myself, seeing Prime live without Megatron is quite sad, Let alone that Lockdown a lesser branch deccepticon who has denouced his position in the decepticon ranks and became a bounty hunter, appears to be stronger than Megatron, Soundwave, Shockwave and to a lesser extent starscream. It would be one thing if it was a combination of cons, for instance, Menasaur, Devistator, and Bruticus and who could forget Kryticon and Scorpinok, but Lockdown is a lesser decepticon, even if he is 'Empowered' by the dark spark, this fact accually ends up failing to relate with the Transformers: Age of Extinction, which ends with Lockdown's death. A poorely moddled Grimlock im sorry, to say could not of joined the battle going by the Lore set for us to work on if Lockdown was not dead, and if this is occuring while the Autobots are dealing with lockdown, where is Hound? Crosshairs?\n\nFurther more Consider this, Transformers: RIse Of The Dark Spark, is admitedly a fun game, however it is poorely designed and runs out of content to follow really quickly, it takes under 5hours if you know what your doing to finish the Campain on Hard. Not to mention, there is NO multiplayer, and the Lore is heavily relient on the Michael Bay series, moving from a seemingly acurate transfer from Transformers Prime, to a Highly inaccurate mash of story which it is now. Not to mention, it takes a Second for you to Boost after Transforming now, and that Sucks incredably. It has no Multiplayer, besides Escalation, as I have repeated before. So please take this into account this game Is not Worth 50$ its worth 10. Dlc included.\nMy Ratings are this:\n3/10 for fun, No Multiplayer, and Incredibly irratating small hit boxes that pack a punch.\n1/10 for Lore, as I am a Lore hunter and this game answers no Questions just makes you ask more and has a Plot that is impossible to follow aswell as near Non existant.","June 25, 2014","false","15.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

The earth scene is a little boring and lacks a lot of detail. (little disappointed) But beyond that, cybertron universe is what you would expect, with high detail and a lot of s*** going on in the background. The story takes place somewhere right before the events of FOC. And the gameplay is nicely familiar to the previous titles, with new approaches to said familiar assets. So esentially you'll feel like you're playing FOC again with minor differences. They implimented a much better use of the T.E.C.H. than the last game (which i never used in the last game) and it allows a new thing called Hacks, which handicap you in some way for a nice exp boost. (nice little side challenge). The only multiplayer option is escalation but it's a much much beefier version of the last one that allows you to play as any of the playable characters in the game and lets you outfit their loadouts to suit your play style. I still honestly prefer FOC team deathmatch but this really isnt too bad and its a much better step up from previous escalation. If you're a true transformers fan, and you can get over the crappy detail of earth, stop reading reviews and get this game.

And Rise of the Dark Spark is one of those very rare games.\n\nIt's not bad. It's not good. It just IS. And it has flimsy pretense to be.\n\nThe closest comparison I can manage is Farcry 3 and Farcry 3: Blood Dragon... And Rise of the Dark Spark really does feel like a little fun project that someone did on the offside. For full price.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Gameplay? Pretty good. The problem is that it's copied wholesale from Fall of Cybertron (Hereby shorted to FoC), the previous Transformers game. All the character models (Including DLC items like Hound and the Insecticons) return. All the guns return. The Grimlock stages return. Bruticus returns for a stage. It's like a highlight reel of Fall of Cybertron.\n\nThere's CRIPPLINGLY little NEW to the game. The Age of Extinction content numbers FIVE characters (Drift, Earthmode/Ninja Bumblebee, Knight Optimus Prime, Lockdown and Stinger) with four unplayable enemies (Which use FoC enemy types, they're just new skins. They use the same voices and everything.) Three... Passable Earth level types too (City/Ruined City, Jungle and Military base.)\n\nAll of the voice actors return, and the FoC section of the game acts as a prequel (A flimsy one, but a prequel) to Fall of Cybertron itself. It's not BAD.  ...But it's not GOOD. It takes Fall of Cybertron and does NOTHING with it. It slaps a new coat of paint and goes 'there you go' The unlock system from Fall of Cybertron is simply randomized... And it's not BAD, but it doesn't do anything BETTER.\n\n\nDespite LOVING Transformers, and even arguing that this is one of the best movie tie-in games I've ever played... I can't recommend it. Very little was done to justify the price. If you see it for $20 or something? By all means, buy it, play it, run around in Escalation with some buds killing things. Hi-five. As it is? No. It's just not worth it. It's not BAD, but it's just... Meh. It's nothing FoC didn't do. It's not even, really, a cross-over. FoC will at no point interact with movie in any meaningful way (Or any way at all, realistically). Spoiler or not... It has to be made VERY CLEAR, considering it's the game's entire selling point.\n\n\n\n\nSidenote: As of writing (And hey, movie game... Patches are not expected) The AI seems to have been broken (From FoC's decent-ish enemy logic) to flow with certain areas of the game. The most common type of enemy (With a machine gun) simply doesn't reload as often as it should and will murder you dead in about 3 seconds on Normal if you're not careful (I.E pressed against a wall and only peeking your gun around the side). The final boss has cheap SNK syndrome moves and is an ungodly pain.","June 25, 2014","false","6.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Here we go\n\nFirst off, this game is CLEARLY developed as a CYBERTRON title. All the aspects of models from the Cybertron series are (THANK YOU HIGH MOON STUDIOS). My gripe at this point though is when you watch enemies in cutscenes, they move like they are some retro 8 bit version of themselves sliding and not running. They don't look like they belong in the place they are. With this is my only problem in the Cybertron universe.\n\nNOW. Going to the review on the EARTH side of things. OBVIOUSLY this was a work in progress title for the Cybertron series. Once word of the movie got out and a date was released, you can CLEARLY tell that models were implemented and put in with the care that the actual movie games have been made (none at all). The buildlings are drab and have little color to no texture. The cutscenes for earth were actually missing bot textures and frankly, I did not like opening the way it did (opinion).  This part of the game (On Earth) could have been polished WAY more than it was.\n\nMy next gripe is the audio. I have a Tiamat 7.1 surround headset. During gameplay, it's AWESOME. Come cutscenes though, I find myself having to turn the volume up because the speech audio is VERY low during these times. Speech audio during levels however seems to be okay. What went wrong here?\n\nThe lack of multiplayer WILL be an issue for me once SM is completed. But i'll just go back to FoC for that.\n\nOverall. I will say that I am enjoying the game. Was it worth 50 bucks? Hell no. Am I still happy I added it to my collection? Sure am. It's Transformers. For those saying it's only taking 4-5 hours to beat. Up the difficulty to Hard like I did. It's not a cake walk, but it's not a super hard challenge either.","June 24, 2014","true","12.4"," 107 of 202 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","107","202","5","10"

Gee I wonder what it.. IT'S TRYING TO LINK THE BAY MOVIES TO THESE TWO AMAZING GAMES (well really just the fourth one but that's beside the point)!  But that's only where it begins!  Because the game takes place on two worlds there's two different stories in the game which is a neat idea but was poorly executed.  One that takes place during the Fall of Cybertron campaign showing how the Dark Spark got to Earth, the other bieng on Earth which cannot fit anywhere into the movie.\nAnother thing about the game is the controls, everywhere and I do mean EVERYWHERE it displays the controls as if you had an XBOX 360 controller plugged in.  Luckily it's not to hard to figure out and during the actual game it says for example "Press A or Spacebar to Jump".\nThe friendly A.I. isn't to good either sometimes getting stuck in a place that they just shouldn't forcing you to restart from your last check point and hope it works this time.\nThey've also gotten rid of the online multiplayer battles which is kind of dissapointing but they did leave escalation which is in my opinion now one of the main selling points of the game and possibly saving it from a lower rating from me.  This time there's a level system in both escelation and the campaign which are linked.  Every time you level up you get a gear box which contains random loot such as weapons, weapon upgrades, Tech, and characters to use in escelation.  They're a bit like Battlefield's Battlepacks, just a lot more repetative.\nAlso when it comes to choosing your character for escelation it tells you the character's ability and then when you select the character it gives you the choice to change that ability making the only use for character selection is to choose your vehicle form and your skin.\nAlso if your going to get the DLC just get the weapons, because the characters are just as I said in the last paragraph it's all just skins (ones that cost money compared to all the others that you can get for free).\nBasicly to sum this semi-rant review this game is not worth it's $50 asking price... at all.  I recommend it only if you can get it for at least $15.\n5/10","June 24, 2014","true","23.5"," 35 of 64 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","35","64","2","3"

All in-game button instructions are for a game pad.\n\nSecond, there is no way to change the keyboard controls for this game.  The default controls are the only controls you can use.\n\nThird, the audio levels are inconsistent.  While some parts of the game the dialogue can be understood, other parts of the game you cannot hear a single thing the characters are saying.\n\nI ended up playing until Sideswipe and Ironhide appeared...which leads me to the fourth and last...\n\nFourth and last...  This game is BUGGY!  Throughout the game I noticed that whenever I interacted with an object the game seemed to want to stall out.  What I mean by that is this...  Imagine having to interact with an object but when you do the character can no longer do anything.  The character cannot interact with an object, cannot move, cannot jump, cannot shoot...the game basically is still running and the other characters talking...but the character that you control can no longer do ANYTHING AT ALL.  This is a random bug.  I reloaded from the last checkpoint a couple of times and I noticed it doesn't happen at the same location where you interact with an object.  It  just is a random occurance whenever the player character interacts with an object.  Considering that this uses the console way to save games it can lead to you having to replay a LONG level before reaching the place where your character stalled out at to see if you are lucky enough for the game to let you through.\n\nI cannot tell you about the game's story because this game was so buggy I eventually quit.\n\nBut I will say this.  For this game to be as BAD as it is considering how good the previous two Transformers games were is truly shameful.\n\nAVOID THIS GAME.  It was never meant for a PC and the developers obviously didn't care about the PC market at all.

Both were great games, with great characters, and a storyline that makes fans of Transformers giddy with excitement. When I first heard of Rise of the Dark Spark, I was very happy to see the movie versions brought into the mix.\n\nDid it work well?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat we have here is a lazy made game that I hope will not be the direction Transformers games will be taken. I did not expect this game to have "next gen graphics", but the textures, lighting, etc. are just bad. Portions of the game set on Earth look drab. Charcter models look nice, but the only place I see actual work put in is...just guess...the portions on Cybertron. This, let's say 4 hour campaign, is pathetic. Introduce the villain, Lockdown. Lockdown gets weapon of mass destruction. Autobots stop Lockdown. That's it.\n\nThe game boasts 40 characters from the Transformers universe.

Almost 90% of characters are ones from War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, such as Cliffjumper, Insecticons, Shockwave, etc. I would have loved to see a clean 50 50. 20 Bayformers and 20 Cybertron Characters, but no.\n\nRemember that wonderful and thrilling Multiplayer in Fall of Cybertron?

Because of the previous entries in this saga, the odds were stacked against Rise of the Dark Spark, especially when you consider that a new developer took the reigns from High Moon.\n\nThe story itself is pretty standard. There's a McGuffin that you must retrieve from the villain, or else the universe as we know it will end. The characters you play as during the Cybertron chapters should feel familiar by now, and all of their respective voice actors seem to have returned to reprise their roles, so the dialogue is at the least still interesting and well done. There is one exception, however: Optimus Prime. In the previous entries, Optimus had a more rounded out personality than what you'll find in this game. Here, in Rise of the Dark Spark, we have a Prime who does nothing but spout heroic platitude after platitude.\n\nEdge of Reality put forth effort to extend the work of High Moon by including the audio tape easter eggs, but after listening to them in game it's hard to shake off the feeling that there is something missing this time around. Likewise, the game mechanics, textures, animations, and models are all recycled from High Moon's work, which comes across as lazy, but may also be symptomatic of how rushed this game was. The quality of the graphics in the cut scenes was already showing its age in 2012, so you can imagine by now how jarring it is to see the high grain, low resolution animations between the standard, even if last-gen, graphics experience of the gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, the mechanics and controls are the same as those found in Fall of Cybertron, with the exception of hacks and the new upgrade/leveling system. Some reviewers have complained about the twitchy controls behind the vehicle mode mechanic, but I didn't find any difference in handling between this game and FoC. Edge of Reality's addition of hacks and their changes to the weapons/upgrade store system make the game interesting and have the potential to bring you back to what is a short campaign mode in order to unlock more equipment and characters.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms against Rise of the Dark Spark is the total lack of multiplayer death matches. In the past two entries, it was the multiplayer feature that extended the lifespan of both WfC and FoC. It will be interesting to see whether or not the online Escalation mode will attract any attention, but based on the empty servers for this mode in the previous two games, it doesn't look hopeful. Plenty of us wonder why the multiplayer wasn't included, especially considering that Edge of Reality had recycled so much of High Moon's work. Surely the materials were there and could have easily been used.\n\nBecause of the recycled elements and wafer-thin story, the Cybertron chapters in this game feel much like they are part of an expansion pack or episode that should have cost a half of the retail cost. The Earth chapters are not discussed in this review because other reviewers give plenty of attention to the failings found in that half of the game, and I wouldn't be saying anything that hasn't already been said. I wanted to focus on the aspects of the game that I really enjoyed, and that I wished were more prevalent in the game.\n\nDue to the current price tag of $49.99, the lack of a multiplayer death match featureu, and the fact that the Cybertron chapters maybe make up about half of the game, I would not recommend purchasing Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark at this time. Unfortunately, we may not get a sequel anytime soon that has the same attention to detail and love of the extensive canon that the past two games in this saga have received.","July 23, 2014","false","8.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I had a feeling it would be bad, but not this bad.

I start it, and a few red flags are already going up.\n\nWhere's High Moon Studios?\n\nAlright, maybe these guys are just as good and High Moon and were fine with a bit of movie tie in. NOPE.\n\nGraphics settings: Low, Medium, High, EXTRA. Yeah, there's some in depth options for you.\n\nAlright I may go into the character creator to see what they have available.

I'm not someone who looks for multiplayer in in games I play, but WFC and FOC had a wonderful formula for fun.\n\nOkay I might check out the what "character setup" thing is about.

Ok now, from what the game description says, the Earth side of the game is the sequel to age of extinction, i went and watched the movie. This is no were near sequel, absolute rubbish. I'm thinkin that the developers were out of ideas, this 'Dark Spark' is entirely new. Was not part of the original transformers franchise. Also, u don't get to use prime's new sword, dissapointing. Now as for the cybertron side, prequel of fall of cybertron. Not really, the missions were really random. The only thing that related to FOC was the mentioning of the ark and trypticon.

Specially liked the co-op mode. The second part didn't have a co-op mode but was still great. But "Rise of the Dark Spark" is so poor. Graphic details are just simply bad, earth part makes no sence from the last part when Megatron and Prime disappeared with their ships. A Transformer Samurai speaking of honnor? Man that was just bad... really just bad!\n\nThis game is way too unstable it does crash sometimes in the middle of battles back to desktop without any reasons. As well it gets stucks on loading when you activate some weapon Terminals  (only possible solution: Ctrl. + Alt + Delete). Funny thing sometimes you get a black screen just like that and you need to restart the game as well. Neither you can't Alt + Tab the game without provocing  a crash.\n\nI think the game is actually not really finished at all they require a lot of patches to fix bugs and crashes. Now I do understand that it costs money but I'm pretty sure they just rush it through to get it out on the same time as the new Transformers movie and that is exactly the reason why they ruined this game.

The game takes place roughly around the last 20 minutes of the film, Transformers: Age of Extinction for the movie segments, and halfway through the time-line between War and Fall of Cybertron. The gameplay is exactly the same as Fall of Cybertron, it's predecessor, and was expected to be as Edge of Reality is known for reusing game conent, programs, etc. While this was a simple thing, it was not entirerly a bad thing, as I instantly knew the controls once I started playing and was able to play with ease. However, with that, it felt like I was just playing Fall again just with added levels, but at the same time, it felt like a polished up version of the dotm game as well with the earth segments and characters. Along with that being said, the adding of a second weapon to all of the vehicles made it feel more like its moive predecessor game. A hinderance though, is that you cannot drive and shoot at the same time with these earth guys as you are able to with their cybertron counterparts. Another thing on this is that the character models, while some being new or from previous games, have an extreamly high metallic look to them which has caused some lag for some, others not so  much, but cannot be altered for now. Besides this, the game starts of with the movie cast, and proceeds with the cybertron family up until chapter 10, in which all makes sense except for a few things, one being the fact that Megatron has his Fall body rather than his War despite the fact that this game is before Fall. All-in-all, the story is decent and gameplay is good. As for Escalation, it takes all the previous games maps (not including the WFC dlc mpas which were/are not available for pc) and gives the the Fall look, adding two earth maps as well. The adding of leapers and titans to either side makes the game more challenging and fun and having an open area is nice and easy on your in-game wallet. However, the lack of ammunition and health that can or can't be scattered about makes it hard to do much. But as was said before, more challenging. On the subject of lag and anything relating to it, this doesn't seem to happen much on my end, I can't say the same for anyone else but as far as I know, there has been no lag for me, but when the lag does come, it is the result of an upcoming host migration. Straight from Fall and back with a vengence, Host Migration is not as bad as it was in the last game. But if you're someone who would like to host a private game and have a somewhat good but not good enough internet connection, then you'll get one of these within a couple minutes. One thing that has been removed from the last game is the ability to join a game already in play, and the ability to acsess your friends list while in-play. Meaning if you want to join your friends game or if they yours, you can't. And neither can they. But the main feature of this game that has affected many is that you crash as you get to the first mission, about4 seconds in and then-ERROR-, you have recieved a virtually damaged copy of the game. At the moment, there has been no word from Activision or Edge on any updates to fix this problem and a lot of people are doubting that there will be. Those of you who have bought this game and have had no luck in being able to play it, I wish you luck on finding a solution. Those of you who are looking to buy but aren't sure of it, my honest opinion is no. While I am a huge Transformers fan, I just can't recommend a game with so many bugs and problems in it to those who were looking to buy it. Along with the fact that there is a good chance that you may or may not recieve a 'damaged' copy of the game and I don't want you guys wasting money on something you wouldn't be able to enjoy. Should Edge or Acti. make a patch for this, wait for some responses on the patch to see if it functions properly and then you can possilby get the game if you still wish to do. You have been warned.

Consistancy one way or the other would have been nice.\n- The last boss is a joke, and can literally be defeated by standing still and meleeing with your shield every 20 seconds.\n- As much as no-one cares about the film, the story of this game does not fit with the film at all which raises the question of why the hell they tied the bayverse to it in the first place, this would have been much better as a Cybertron game exclusively\n- Following on from above - the story is dire, and the cutscenes even more so\n- Earth Grimlocks model and transformation animation is ugly and clips through itself in several areas  which just looks stupid for the 'cinematic' camera angle it uses\n- Recycled models, environments, animations, weapons, graphics and sounds + music from older games. This entire game just seems like no effort was put in to it. Except for some of the new transformers, 2 OP pre-order exclusive weapons and a handful of earth maps nothing new has been added.\n- Enemy battle chatter in game is incredibly annoying and repeats over and over far to frequently - especially the mercenary enemies in the earth levels who say "Let's see what we got!" every 3 seconds.\n- buggy: I was one of the lucky ones who could play it, but not without having my fair share of bugs in singleplayer which hindered progress and would force a checkpoint or even chapter restart to be able to progress\n- The SP is far too short. I have 7 hours in-game, 5 hours campaign time and 2 hours escalation - 5 hours considering I lost approximately an hour of campaign progress due to bugs is pathetic.\n\ntldr: play FoC instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RenderB/recommended/245760/","RenderB","renderb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RenderB/","437 products in account","This is the 3rd game in a series that started with the surprisingly good Traonsformers: War for Cybertron.\n\nThere is some rather poor level design at times with Invisible walls all over the place, and objects you just can't jump over. Most obstacles are there, so that enemies can take cover. Something you still haven't learned to do yourself. (You can stand behind walls etc, but you cannot actively get into cover.)\n\nThe locked camera is a bit on the close side. Even for a 3rd person shooter things feel a tad claustrophobic at times. The game also plays silly buggers with scale.\n\nThe lock/gear box system makes exploring far less tempting.\nThere are still audio logs, but more than once I had one spawn only after a certain event. You won't be finding any blueprints, since all weapon upgrades/unlocks now are random drops from said boxes. (With a very high duplicate ratio) The same goes for unlocking characters, skins, and consumables.\n\nYou get these gear boxes by levelling up via XP, and completing challenges. You can increase gained experience points with consumable temporary multiplier items, or applying a “hack”. These range from enemies that explode upon death to removing the game HUD.\n\nUnlike previous games this does not seem to allow setting classic skins in the campaign, so you are stuck with the film stuff.\n\nThe story could have gotten interesting, but sadly never actually goes anywhere. Most of the game takes place in the past. There are no bridging events with the present. The story from the last game isn't expanded. Instead quite a few things are changed in a very poor attempt at cramming the film universe in.\nThis results in large gaps/changes without an explanation: Why are we fighting cybertronian Mercenaries, and where did they come from? Where are the decepticons? Why are there no soldiers even inside high security military bases?\n\nRise of the dark spark screams sequel, but doesn't quite go for that good old “To be continued” text at the end.\n\nRise of the dark spark is also the shortest game in the series. Total game time clocked in steam is a very meagre 6 hours for completing the campaign. That includes a lot of idle time for coffee breaks, calls of nature, dinners, and so on.\n\nThe gun play is more or less identical to Fall of Cybertron. I had some issues with triggers: Interacting with a certain object, or helping an npc would require wiggling my character around before the prompt showed up. I also died a few times by falling/clipping through the level.\n\nAll in all this is by far the weakest game in this series. It feels rushed, and lacks any passion. Some segments feel like they have been poorly copied from earlier installments. Certainly avoid it at the current price. Even if you are a major fan wait until it is a fiver at most.\n\nOn a more personal note: The changes made to Grimlock are a bloody waste. The character no longer speaks, but just roars/groans. For some obscure reason he has been made a good chunk larger (Actually so has Bumblebee), and they replaced his sword with a glorified club. Now he is nothing more than a overgrown mute brute without any personality what so ever.\nThese new designs look wrong to me. Even the T Rex form doesn't actually impose. It has a faux organic look that just detracts from the overall robot aesthetic. Same goes for the new robots forms. With the old models you could clearly see what vehicle each of them transformed into. There was some “logic” to the designs that these new ones miss.\n\nHey Optimus: Where did your trailer go anyway?","June 29, 2014","false","6.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I would recommend you reconsider putting your money to something else. I have just finished the campaign and felt I had to let other people know about how dissapointed I am with this game.\n\nI am one of the biggest Transformers fans. I loved the movies, G1, the movie games (which weren't the best but they were some of the first console/pc games I ever played) but most of all I loved the Cybertron games. When War for Cybertron came out I was moderately excited. When Fall of Cybertron was announced I was incredibly excited. They will always be my favourite games. When I found out that the next Transformers game was not being developed by High Moon Studios I was dissapointed but hopeful that maybe we would get a new, possibly better game. Oh how wrong I was. In the last game I actually got annoyed at High Moon for abandoning the game and ignoring the community for about a month. Please come back High Moon! I didn't mean it!\n\nRight, now where to begin with this game. Earth. Let's talk about Earth. The level design for the Earth levels is appauling. I haven't ever seen an environment made worse than Earth in this game. Oh and don't get me started on the Earth textures. Repeating, horrible, flat grass is the worst notable texture. I prefer the level design from revenge of the fallen. Give me that any day rather than this.\n\nHas anyone else noticed that whille in the vehicles weapon mode (On Earth) the vehicles fall like their have the weight of a feather? Don't know how Edge of Reality messed up there but it is annoying. I tend to stay in robot mode on Earth because of it.\n\nCybertron on the other hand is great. Well it would be wouldn't it. All Edge of Reality have done is reuse assets and I'm fairly sure that they reused a multiplayer map from FOC.\n\nOh god the new characters. Can they please updated the back of Bumblebee's head. It is th emost digusting design ever. The front is fine but the back is not. Oh and I don't know yet but if Stinger is the same then do it for him too please. I know they won't but it would be nice. The transformations, even from the old games look clunky. I swear they have made them like this. I can't remember the animations from FOC being this clunky.\n\nMy final thing to rant about, I have not done everything but I would be writing an essay if I did, is the fact that there is no PVP multiplayer. NO mulitplayer besides the coop escalation mode from the previous game. I am annoyed greatly by this. The customization was one of my favourite things to spend time doing in the previous game.\n\nOh actually there is one more thing. The cheesy scripting. This is by no means the voice actors fault. I love the fact that they all came back to reprise their roles from the previous game, besides Grimlock (Who had the most horrible, low resolution dino mode ever. His tail is pretty much the size of the rest of his body and gives him a fat, stupid look.).\n\nOh no sorry, one last final thing. Whose idea was the dubstep for the main menu? It made me facepalm.\n\nActually there is only one thing in this game that made me laugh. I was doing the first mission and a tank explodes infront of me. Not like you'd think though. There was some terrible explosion effect and the tank teleported so that it was at about it's own height off the floor before falling down and lying in a low poly mess.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry that this is a lengthy review but I felt like people should be warned to consider not buying this game. I won't spoil anything for you but if you are expecting a good storyline and ending and are as excited for this game as I was, don't get your hopes up. I know for a fact that there are games with better storylines than this that cost next to nothing.\n\nI hope this helps anyone looking at this game. Remember though, it is your choice.","June 25, 2014","false","13.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Nothing and i mean NOTHING about this game is better than WFC and FOC. It just sucks. Just don't buy the game. In fact, don't even waste your time trying the game out. I wasted like about 5 hours of my life on this game.

There may be a lot of boss fights, but they feel quick and not fun.\n-Some drones are so overpowered it's stupid.\n-The story is so short. Took me about 5 hours to beat.\n-The AI is so dumb that you are pretty much on your own at most parts.\n-No freakin PvP mode.\n-Escalation has really bad FPS.\n-Cutscene graphics are even worse than the gameplay graphics.\n-(This is just my opinion.) They even try to add some "funny" parts into the game. But it's just stupid. In fact, it's funny how bad the funny parts are in this game.\n-The game costs $49.99\n\n\nSo if you are a full Transformers fan like me, then you will understand why this game sucks. BUT.

But, it should also not be ignored.\n\nWhat you have here is a unique blending of the War for Cybertron franchise with the Michael Bay movie-verse. The very first mission has you on Earth. The next 8 have you on Cybertron in a time period that lies between WoC and FoC. And these 8 chapters are where the game shines. You have a good story in there, something that fits very nicely as a bridge between the last two games. Plenty of nods to various G1, WFC, IDW, and Bay-verse lore.\n\nGreat use of new and returning characters, but, you'll see a lot of re-use of audio assets and models from FoC as you go along. Speaking of audio, the pre-rendered cutscenes sound far, far quieter than the gameplay so the transition is a bit jarring. The voice acting is on-par with the previous games though I must note that Steve Blum seems to be playing what sounds like at least 5 roles and sometimes you'll hear Shockwave sounding like Starscream, or someone else sounding like a background solider. Oddly off-game for the voice-acting giant.\n\nGraphically, it feels like a step down. Textures seem oddly washed out in some areas and on some characters. The Earth-forms for the Autobots look a lot more detailed and finished than their Cybertronian counterparts.\n\nGameplay is not very far removed from FoC. Each 'bot has a special power: Drift has a ninja dash attack, Optimus has a shield, etc. These, along with deployable items and weapon upgrades you now get from completing challenges, do help spice things up and keep things interesting. Though now there's a heavy focus on clearing out waves of enemies to progress. A significant bulk of the game is like this, moreso than the previous titles combined. It gets old after awhile.\n\nBoss fights have returned. Sort of. Nothing like the boss fights in WFC, they're now handled like you're fighting AI in the old FOC multiplayer. Not bad, but not great.\n\nWhile I totally enjoyed the on-Cybertron parts of the game, as they felt like a proper WFC title, the on-Earth portions are extremely lackluster. Bland environments, boring level design. Maybe I'm spoiled on the alien nature of Cybertron, or just bored of Earth, but they just don't feel as fun.\n\nTruthfully, it feels like they smashed two seperate games together: A prequel to Fall of Cybertron with an Age of Extinction tie-in title. There's a real sense of discontinuity between the two. You can see the seams. It feels like a last-second change of direction in order to salvage two titles. I have no idea if any of that is what actually happened, but I'd sure like to know.\n\nOverall, it's a good WFC weighed down by the addition of movie tie-in fluff. I can't recommend picking this title up unless you're a die-hard WFC fan, because the WFC stuff is great! And then you've got the Bay-verse stuff... eh. If you've gotta get it, wait for a sale.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this review once I got through the WFC chapters. Now that I'm near the end of the game, I have to note for the record that at least 3 of the Earth chapters take place IN THE SAME LEVEL.","June 25, 2014","false","8.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

I have played every single console Transformers game (except for Prime), and using that, I can say that compared to them, this game is average. The graphics are great, the campaign seems pretty good so far, and the Escalation multiplayer is fun. However, it has no competitive multiplayer. This was a big down point for me, because FoC multiplayer was one of the best multiplayer experiences i have ever had. The escalation does its best to fill that gap, but it doesn't replace it. Another big thing: The developers didn't seem to spend much time porting the game from consoles to PC. I say this because the on-screen controls require you to click the 'A' button usually seen on console games at the bottom of the screen. This makes the controls feel clunky.\n\nPros:\n-Good campaign\n-Good graphics\n-Weapon upgrade system seems robust\n-Escalation is fun\n\nCons:\n-No competitive multiplayer\n-Clunky controls in menus\n-Reused assets from FoC (I guess that is a good thing, really, since they were so good)\n\nShould you buy it? That depends. If you played the previous Transformers games for the campaign, pick this one up. Obviously, don't get it if you wanted competitive multiplayer. Overall, I give this game three stars, which is why I reccomend it.","June 26, 2014","true","31.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It seems like a game of two entirely seperate halves, if those halves were taken from two entirely seperate wholes.  The Bayfailers really jar with High Moon's Cybertron universe and it doesn't just show in the art and visuals.\n\nUnfortunately, Edge of Reality haven't really bothered to put the same level of love into and polish on the game as High Moon did and so when they're not just re-using all the work High Moon did on the Cybertron side of things (which feels clunkier than ever anyway), the Earth/Bayfailers sections of the game feel awkward, contrived and much like the Bay movies, have very little story or character development and quickly devolve into one, never-ending, monotonous, grinding fight-scene.\n\nAlso I would not be surprised if Michael Bay himself wrote the script for the Earth-sections either.  SPOILER BELOW\nLockdown's entire motivation for finding a decepticon superweapon, trying to resurrect Megatron and launching an all-out assault on a human city is... he wants to get paid...\n\nTo be frank, I'm reminded of when Iron Lore took over the original Dawn of War franchise from Relic, if Iron Lore had been a bit more rubbish.  This would have been a perfectly passable title for a small-budget studio if only they'd left the Bayformers out and either attuned the Earth sections to stay more in line with High Moon's or G1's universe(s) or simply left Earth out altogether and released a smaller title for half the price.  Especially since the multiplayer side of the game has been cut heavily.  There is now only a 15-wave escalation mode which has actually made the new levelling system pointless as a skilled player can easily survive all 15 waves with a stock character.\n\nI would recommend this game but only as a huge fan of the High Moon games and other parts of the Transformers universe.  The franchise needs some love and new developers need to be encouraged to take up the reigns and put out some better games.  Unfortunately, this title is not one of those better games but it does have a few kernals of greatness buried under the bugs and bad design choices.  I have no regrets over purchasing it but would definitely recommend picking it up in a sale or waiting till the price comes down in time.","June 29, 2014","true","6.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

Said points are absolutely true, but I think they are wrongly stopping people from playing this game. Transformers: Fall of Cybertron was a very well-received game, and Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark uses the same engine as its predecessor, hence recycled gameplay. But if the afforementioned gameplay was a success, why shouldn't it be now? Sure, the games look similar, but they have different plots with the same great core gameplay. Multiplayer in the past two games, while great, were riddled with hackers. In lieu of this, Edge of Reality added more meat to Fall of Cybertron's Escalation mode, allowing players with over 40+ characters to choose from for any map, versus the previous choice of four. And now Escalation is a great deal better. I do not beg to differ with those who are confused wtih the plot, as it fails to make hardly any sense at times, but the game's still fun, no? But, think of the split between Earth/Cybertron as two differnet plots completely independent of one another, or two games in one. This can be thought of as a very large DLC for Fall of Cybertron, but there's only a $10 difference between the two in price. That said, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, but for most who are interested, I'd wait for the price to drop.

The gameplay was very similar to the previous games in the series which is good. There were a few bugs with the game but overall an enjoyable experience.\n\nThere are some new mechanics with the power-ups and the weapons. You no longer buy them with the money that you get from killing people, you unlock weapons by killing a certain number of enemies and get locked boxes that have a large variety of items in them. You can unlock characters for the mulitplayer this way and get other assorted items. The extra items are "hacks" which can basically be challenges (like you dont regenerate shields) but they all have bonuses and an addition extra experience bonus.

Seriously, I felt like they were on a journey all about the samurai Autobot... I couldn't care for his redemption story, I wanted a solid story about Autobots versus Decepticons. And the whole Lockdown movie... well you know what? The only fun I had was when the game shifted into the Cybertron world.\n\nAlso, the campaign does run at a smooth 60 frames per second Locked, but that is actually what I expected for the PC port. I was very responsive and fluid, and I truly enjoyed the controls.\n\nBUT... (sigh)\n\nThe Multiplayer isn't what we would consider multiplaying... Its more like a horde mode where you pick a side and have waves of Autobot/Decepticon come at you while picking from uncustomizable avatars. You can't build your own Transformer like the previous titles from High Moon Studios (WTF, where were they when this was getting made...?)\n\nMost noticeable, is that the PC multiplayer is fixed to an astounding 30 frames per second!!\n\nNow wait, wait, don't thumb me down, let me explain. PC isn't console, and its architech is different; it can handle more load and more graphical demands. If you give me 60 frames per second during the campaign, which is more demanding due to voice overs, graphical demands and musical tracks, why can't I get the same thing in multiplayer? I would think that we would benefit from a higher fps due to competition.\n\nI still would recommend this game, but only because after the lame intro campaign and you get on Cybertron. After that, its back to the movie aspect which is basically a cut a paste. The multiplayer aspect is bleh, because of the locking of frames, you won't find the fluid gameplay that you want on PC. I also found it funny how right after the community wasn't heard about this game's locked multiplayer frame, Fall of Cybertron multiplayer had an abundance of activities and I literally played for the next 10 hours FULL SERVERS!!\n\nGet this game on a sale or on ♥♥♥ if discounted... Its not worth $49.99...","October 7, 2014","true","15.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

The ai isnt great, they shout the same words over and over again. There is no longer pvp, only a complete re hash of escalation (as mentioned before, no further options, so you only get the limited waves again...), so you cant create your own transformer anymore.\n\nAll in all Id give it a rating somewhat like the film.... good for a laugh, doesnt stand out, no way worth the asking price.\nGo spend your money on something better, and hope that they trash this game, and build it back up again better, it has the potential to be so much more.","August 23, 2014","false","11.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

They have an amazing engine from Fall of Cybertron. They have a bunch of engaging characters. They do nothing new with either of them, and they kind of don't do a lot of the good old stuff either.\nThe level design is at best generic, and does nothing to highlight the character you're playing. In FOC if you had a cloaking device, you knew it was a stealth level. If you had a grappling hook, the achievement for the level wasn't "Use the grappling hook as little as possible". The levels are all slightly different variations of run and gun. There's not even much of an incentive to transform, save that it gives you access to a missile launcher.\n\nThe writing is lazy, at best. Ok, so we get to see Shockwave hooking up with the insecticons. Woo. But the game would almost write itself if they just thought about it. Trypticon just crashed? Ok, why not explain why he was under Autobot guard in FOC? Drift is even in this game? Why not drop some deeper hints about why he defected, maybe play a level with him as a Decepticon on Cybertron. And why not explain WHAT THE **** Grimlock is even doing anywhere?\n\nIn short, this game trys to shoe horn itself into the FOC cannon, and cash in on Transformers 4. It fails at both. You should not pay more than about $10 US for this game. It's good for about 6 hours.","August 24, 2014","false","8.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Anyway, i was let down in various aspect, the fact that they didn't add multiplayer for example, there's only co-op and there's nobody on there. The customisation for co-op was very limited too, in previous games you could use various parts of different characters to make your own transformer, now there's no such thing.\n\nAnyway, up to the campaign:\nI like the fact that they added certain "level boosts" (tech) that makes gameplay somewhat harded but gives you extra xp in return, it makes it more challenging. Now, the story that took place on Cybertron looked fine to me, just as in previous games, but the part where they landed on earth just somehow didn't look right to me, there's something wrong with the textures which also makes it feel like they just threw this game out there just so it was out, it feels like there didn't go allot of effort into it.\n\nSo in the end i got let down in various parts but still think it's worth to play this game, it's a lesser one in the franchise and i hope the next one will be better.","June 12, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game was handed off to smaller studio that mostly just recycle game elements from the previous game in addition to adding some really poorly designed and skinned levels containing the terrible Micheal Bay movieverse Transformers. The terrible and forced meshing of these game universes aside, the gameplay was just a clunkier  less responsive and often times buggy version of the Fall of Cybertron game. Sometimes I would just be unable to switch weapons or fire, or my dash would happen in the wrong direction, or my special ability fail to activate.\n\nAdditionally this game removes any and all purpose to transforming into your vehicle form for all but two levels where you can transform into a jet and the level mandates the use of the Z axis. The remaining levels have no reason for your character to ever enter vehicle mode, something I commonly swapped in and out of in the previous games. The lack of need came from there being mostly tight corridors of same seeming hallways leading you inevitably in a straight line into your ultimate direction, and the extreme surpluss of ammo packs, rendering your vehicle form weapons completely useless as you can just spam away your primary weapon without ever worrying about depleting your ammunition.\n\nAll in all this game is a buggy pile of slag that borrowed elements from previous games and mainly came out as a way to make money off of the release of the 4th installment of the Micheal Bay Transormers triology, Age of Extinction.  Though this game is not quite as bad as that movie, it's certainly a huge step down from Fall of Cybertron, and possibly even below that of War of Cybertron considering they just made a worse version of a previous product. Unless you can get the game on sale, which I did, this game is certainly not worth playing. Thankfully it's short and the severe lack of collectables make it a quick blowthrough to extract a little transformative joy out from a sea of slag.\nOverall Rating: 2/10","January 29, 2015","false","14.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flash255/recommended/245760/","flash255","TheOfficialBTD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flash255/","232 products in account","Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark. The game that when announced, had people some what hyped. Then they released the trailer and then we all saw that High Mood Studios was not in any way involved with the development or design of this product.\n\nLike many others, I was disapointed knowing that High Mood Studios wasn't involed but I didn't completely give up. I'm a big Transformers fan and I wanted to give this game a chance despite the amount of flak this game got before release. Lets lay a fact down. This game was designed and developed because of the move Transformers: Age of Extingtion, that being said, I personally feel that the reason why anyone even considered to buy this game was because they tied in the Cybertron games. Personally I don't like the movies, the Cybertron games told the story of what actually happened whilst the movies just took the characters we love and made it's own plot of what didn't happen to them all those years ago in the comic issues. Thats why I was unconfortable with the development team of this game (Edge of Reality) mixing the two together.\n\nThis review so far hasn't made this game look very good, so why have I rated this a possitive? The Escalation mode in this game I feel is done better than both War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron because of the amount of variaty you get with your own decisions. In both war and fall, certain maps had certian characters for that spacific map, a total of four characters all together to choose from. Each character that you could choose from had it's own role whether that be a medic, support, tank or turret type class, it was either that or nothing. What happens if someone chooses the Transformer you wanted to be? Tough, better luck next time. In Rise of the Dark Spark how ever, you can prepare all of this that suits you best before you even search for a  game. You can choose any Transformer you like, wth any gun, any ability in any map. Some people may argue that this takes away the team work aspect. Personally, I feel that it actually adds more a team work aspect. Rather than being given the role that could potentially keep you alive, you have to work as a team and communicate even more to see how each players abilities can be benificial to your success on beating the final wave, 15.\n\nAs just said, wave 15 is the last wave of enimies you get to as well as facing off against either Optimus Prime or Megatron. If you're in an Earth map, you will be fighting Earth Optimus. If in a Cybertron map you'll be up against Cybertron Optimus and honestly, there is not a better feeling in this game than playing as the mighty Megatron and fighting off against Optimus Prime in the final wave, it gives you a great feeling and is very rewarding when you defeat him.\n\nIf you have a computer capable enough on maxing this game out in terms of graphical textures etc, this game looks visually stunning. Well, most of it at least. The earth maps are designed poorly in my opnion but the cybertron maps are perfect. It's not all doom and gloom as the cybertron maps do brighten up which is great especially on a high end computer. Stunning visuals and graphics may be amazing, but it's unfortunate that I can't say that about the games plot.\n\nMost of the time you're on cybertron which is the only reason why I stayed interested, as soon as I got to earth, I pretty much gave up as it was simply not interesting. The time frame between cybertron in this game and the other two cybetron games are completly out of perportion. SPOILER ALERT. Near the Start of Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, Megatron is detroyed by Metroplex causing Megatron to be rebult and have an entirly new body later in the game. If Rise of the Dark Spark is set After War for Cybertron and before the events of Fall of Cybertron, then surely Megatron should still be his original self rather than in his new body as the events of Metroplex defeting him hasn't happened yet. There are more examples but i'm sure you get the idea.\n\nPvP multiplayer has been removed which means that besides playing the campaign again, you only have one game mode left to enjoy. I can't say much on why the multiplayer was not added into this game as I simply don't know.\n\nThe fact that I find the Escalation mode in this game to be absolutley brilliant is the reason to why i'm giving this game a high positive. It really isn't the same Escalation as the other two games and just feels perfect when it comes to controls and playing. It really does make this game worth the try. Do I feel that this game is worth £29.99? No. I'd say wait for this game to be on sale for at least £15 or lower as you're really going to enjoy one mode that this game has to offer. I hope this review helps you make your decision on whether this game is for you or not.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 5, 2015","true","48.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Activision pegged Edge of Reality with the job of developing this game rather than High Moon Studios, and it shows. The game is rough, but its not aweful. The polish and quality you expect from this franchise isn't there, but its not so bad that the game is unplayable.\n\nThe leveling and item unlock system is pretty good. There are difficulty spikes at times, with enemies able to zero in on you with perfect aim. Like in Fall of Cybertron its best to fight from cover. T:RothDS is a thinly veiled movie tie in, but as I said its not a total disaster like most movie tie in games. I'm hoping High Moon will be allowed to make another game in this franchise.\n\nIf you're a fan of the franchise I say get it. The game's visuals are hit or miss at times but the gameplay we've come to expect from the Cybertron franchise is indeed here. Peter Cullen and the rest of the voice cast has made a return. Edge of Reality (developer of Loadout) made a good effort. As I said, this is to the Cybertron series what Arkham Origins was to the Arkham series. Not the best, but could have been much worse.","June 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2ultima/recommended/245760/","d2ultima","D2ultima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2ultima/","504 products in account","I wish I could. I haven't played a massive amount of it yet, but I'll list the pros and cons I've noticed so far. My recommendation is mostly as to whether it's a good PC game or not, rather than if it's a good GAME or not. I've not beaten it to decide if it's a good storywise game yet. I can say from now though, it is NOT worth the price.\n\nPros: Let's get the short list out of the way.\n- The game is fluid in campaign. It is lightweight on strong hardware (1 x GTX 780M, using ~600MB video memory. Treat my card as inbetween a GTX 660Ti and 670 for power) and only uses about 40% of my GPU to maintain 60fps at the max graphics level. Most people will be able to run this game.\n- The animations are very nicely done. The dashes are great, the punches are nice, cutting people into half with Drift's ability (he's the first guy you use, no spoiler here really) is WONDERFUL as their top half simply sails halfway across the map without skipping a beat and you can just watch it fly. Robots breaking apart is wonderful.\n- The game feels for the most part like Fall of Cybertron mechanics-wise, which is not particularly a bad thing.\n- The gun sounds are pretty decent, and their effects are nice. I like that the SMG-type gun (I forget its name) has its shots actually disappear after a certain distance, making you carry the Neutron Assault Rifle or another sniper-type weapon for long-range engagements.\n- The car forms have nitro. Enough said.\n- You can switch between controlling with your keyboard/mouse and the controller at any time, simply press the corresponding button on your desired device. Some games still do not do this and only allow controller OR keyboard/mouse, so I list this as a pro.\n\nCons: I can't think of anything else good about the game.\n- The game looks like garbage. I have legitimately seen PS2 games with better textures than half of this game, and I've only played the first level and part of the second. I've not even played anything obscure. Cybertron looks better than earth, but it doesn't help the quality of textures and objects in the slightest.\n- I cannot. Rebind. My. Buttons.\n- The menu is in Xbox controller. Even if I use keyboard keys. The game says both controller buttons and keyboard bindings, but it's not enough, because...\n- The game gets its keybinds wrong for the keyboard. It told me "Hold LB or Q to sprint". Q is the special attack. Sprint is shift. I cannot. Rebind. My. Keys. And. The. Game. Gets. The. Keys. Wrong. EXPLAIN.\n- The game does not say which key "back" is on the Xbox controller for the keyboard with in-game prompts. The key is Tab.\n- The game does not use SLI. It does not *need* SLI, but it is an Unreal Engine game. Come on. There's people with two 650M laptops who could do with the SLI to play on max graphics. I don't want to see what low graphics look like, max is so bad.\n- The options menu for graphics consists of four options: Resolution, Graphics Quality (low, medium, high, extra), Fullscreen on/off and vsync on/off.\n- Turning vsync off crashed my game.\n- Vsync being off is pointless as it runs at 60fps with or without it on, even though my screen is 120Hz. I heard MP is locked to 30 as well from other players, which means it's even MORE worthless.\n- The game's controls are Xbox-controller heavy. It feels better with an Xbox controller, and seeing as how you cannot rebind the keys and the game gets its key prompts wrong, you almost need one to play the game. This is a problem for those who do not have them.\n- The game's mechanics are more clunky than the previous games' own. You are unable to jump as quick after landing from a jump and you are unable to switch shooting hands as fast as I remember. Picking up guns is faster and the dashing (especially air dashing) is great though, but not enough to fix. Transforming also has more of a delay after doing it before you can transform again. Picking up a new weapon is quick though. It's a different mix entirely, to be honest, but even though subtle, it's an overall downgrade instead of an improvement, and that's never really good.\n- The voice acting struck me as very... bland. Optimus sounded a little off and the rest of the voice acting was just... meh. I felt like skipping the cutscenes, which is something I've never felt before in the games. I've always enjoyed their interactions, but this time it's so... meh. To be fair, the rest of the characters could be totally fine. I did not play that far. But I just don't believe it was up to the level of emotion and immersion than I am accustomed to.\n- This isn't really a con, but it annoyed me. The game starts with optimus telling you that you're dealing with about 5 zillion enemies and you need firepower, and your character is remorseful as he "discarded those weapons for the finer arts of the sword". Then shortly after, I shot my first enemy (as a car) and INSTANTLY failed an objective, which is to kill every enemy in that level with melee or sword special attacks only. WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME THAT I NEED THE GUNS THEN GIVE ME A CHALLENGE TO NEVER USE A GUN?! WHY?\n- Sprinting must take place after a dash. This is to say, you must dash and keep holding the button in order to sprint. Who the hell felt this was a good idea? There are unused buttons on the controller, far less the keyboard. Come on.\n- Who the hell locked multiplayer to 30fps?\n- This game costs $50 and will have DLC (it already does, though it's not really for "sale" yet).\n- This game is unfamiliar with the concept of anti-aliasing. Yes, I list this separate from bad graphics.\n\nI had something else to add to the cons but I got distracted and forgot what it was. Anyway, as you can probably tell, I'm very disappointed in this game. I also know it isn't so much a review but more like a "beware: this is what you are buying". And you should, because as far as I am concerned, this should only be purchased by people who really want the story it has to offer. If you think that after all this, you will still enjoy the story because you're such a transformers fan and you'll love the game regardless, then go for it. It still handles fairly well and the aiming with a controller isn't really bad, which is a step up from a lot of games (in the opinion of a controller-aiming noob, mind you. I'm that guy who'll play Sleeping Dogs with a controller and as soon as I grab a gun I switch to keyboard and mouse to become a headshot magnet. But this game? Not a problem). I really can't justify $50 for this game as it is. Maybe on a last-generation console? Sure. It would look fairly standard for that generation and if it played at 60fps as well, then even better. It does not have texture popping issues, a common trait of UE3, so that's also good. But it just doesn't have enough work into it to be worth a purchase as-is on the PC platform for this price.\n\nOf course, it's still up to you, but just know what you're going into. That was my objective really, and why my opinion piece is fully explained at the end.\n\nEdit: Thought it was $60 at first. My bad. Also, I'll edit a section above the review in the future if I finish the game and need to ammend anything I've already said.","June 25, 2014","false","2.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RavenCelica/recommended/245760/","RavenCelica","Umbra Celica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RavenCelica/","161 products in account","Oh, where do I start? I love this game! For all the flak it gets, it's a stable, and frankly, fun Transformers title. Despite what everyone says, the visuals look exactly like Fall of Cybertron, which creates some very beautiful character models and locations. Locations like Cybertron's "Sea of Rust", or Kolkular (Megatron's fortress), are beautiful to look at, especially with the upgraded visuals on PC.\n\nThe campaign mode's plot is the least enjoyable in terms of story, as it breaks canon in many areas (Such as Optimus and Grimlock's partnership in the game's 13th mission, despite the game being a prequel to Age of Extinction), which nagged on my mind a lot. Besides this break in continuity, it's rather enjoyable, however, I just wish it was focused more on Earth, as over half of the game takes place on Cybertron, which wasn't in my interests with an Earth-marketed game.\n\nSound design remains the same as Fall, with most of the original voice actors present to fill their roles in game (i.e: Peter Cullen as Optimus, Fred Tatasciore returns as the Aligned Continuity Megatron, while Jim Ward lends his voice to the Insecticon, Hardshell. This attention to voice detailing leaves you immersed in their voices and dialogue. Weapons sound beefy, and hold impact, with my favorite sound to hear, being one of the "Gambler" upgrade for the Path Blaster (Gambler being an upgrade that makes the final shot in the chamber have the destruction potential of a small nuke, while the Path Blaster is a single shot, semi-automatic rifle.)\n\nLevel design in this case is never actually "repetitive", as the levels retain the brightness and color from Fall, while giving more varied areas to explore, ranging from a massive "desert-esque" land, a city at dark, and a massive alien fortress, etc.  This keeps each area fresh, while also smoothly changing from level to level. The gametype Escalation (A horde-type mode, where players fight off increasingly difficult waves of enemies) is beefed up in RoTDS, as there is not only a healthy amount of maps; but a multitude of upgrades to certain map areas. (Ranging from Corrosive fields, to turrets, and even electric barriers.)\n\nThis also goes hand in hand with the amount of playable characters, which is massive, even for a Transformers title. However, most of the characters are Cybertron based, while only about 4-5 are Earth-based, (Drift, Bumblebee, Optimus, Lockdown and Stinger, if you bought DLC) which might leave some players desiring more in the way of Earth modes.\n\nAlso, multiplayer is absent in this case, although, Escalation is cooperative. This may not affect people who are campaign lovers, but people who play games for multiplayer need not apply here. Overall, this title shouldn't be treated as a full on, new title. It should be treated as a massive expansion. It's a fun, if not short ride that is well worth the money. I'd recommend it.","September 6, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

It's pretty obvious that Rise of the Dark Spark was meant to be an entirely different game until someone higher up the Activision food chain decided they couldn't have to TF games competing against each other so they had better find a way to blend them together. Here's the thing, The Cybertron game series isn't part of the same Transformers universe as the movies, it's not even part of the same universe as Generation One. Nope, Cybertron is actually part of the Aligned Universe which includes the Transformers Prime cartoon series. Activision, of course, is aware of this, but hey, it's a movie year, time to get out the shoehorn.\n\nI like to think that the original plan for this game was for the Earth portions to actually take contain characters from the Prime series which would go a long way to explain why the environments look so simple, much like the on the CG cartoon. Reskin the characters, replace Lockdown with Megatron, adjust the dialogue a bit and add a few Decepticon Earth missions (since there technically are no Decepticons in Age of Extinction) to even out the Cybertron and Earth missions and we would probably have had a much better game.\n\nDuring development it was implied that the game doesn't take place in a single universe, but crosses dimensions. When Optimus speaks of the Dark Spark at the end of the first mission it's likely he's talking about an unrevealed past from the movie universe while the story that takes place on Cybertron stands alone. This is supported by the end of the game where Lockdown talks about the Dark Spark being capable of time travel (and likely interdimensional travel as well) and then the scene where G1 Optimus Prime appearing on Earth as the Dark Spark rockets across the sky. If they wanted to make Transformers Multiverse game in the future (with lots of polish) where characters from multiple universes come together to fight over the Dark Spark I would love to play it.\n\nAs it stands the game isn't aweful. The Cybertron portion is as much fun to play as the previous games and works pretty well squeezed in between them. it's unfortunate that you only get eight Cybertron missions, but they're solid, if not a little bit recycled. Then again, War for Cybertron only had 10 missions so the gap isn't that bad and they can be played stand alone once you get past the first mission. The Earth missions are not so great. Graphics aside, there's really nothing realistic about the above ground settings as they look unlike any city on earth. Below ground it's a lot of long, twisting pathways with no rhyme or reason. On an alien planet it's easy to suspend belief, but on Earth it's not a lot better than any of those early 90s FPS game. There's a few glitches throughout the game where you make it to your destination and nothing happens. Restarting the mission usually fixes it, but it's still frustrating. One of the really ridiculous things about the game is trying to figure out where the Earth portion takes place. There's only a very small window between the Dinobots arrival and Lockdown's deveat that this could take place during which would mean a major pause in the action and the disapearance of the other Autobots. Plus at one point you see Stinger with Lockdown and they aren't even on the same side in the movie.\n\nAs an overall game it's a B-. If they had just stock to the Cybertron stuff and didn't shove the movie stuff in there it would have been so much better. If they hadn't rushed it out to be released with the movie it probably wouldn't have suffered nearly as much in the bugs and graphics. Unfortunately this is the game we got. While I don't hate it I can't say I'm entirely satisfied either.","June 30, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The cutscenes could be better but they do well enough. People are complaining a lot about this game but I'm completely happy with it, its a different development team so you can't expect it to be exactly the same as the others, Iv'e also read the complaints about the story, the story is fine it bridges the two universes well enough as long as you know enough about both of them.

They could of completely did without the bayformers. I did however find the new escalation to be very fun with a few minor downfalls. I love the tons of characters you can select from and its not like Fall where your on edge of your seat to pick the character you want. One downside is the gear boxes i think they should have set it to once you learn all the characters they stop popping up in gear boxes. It makes it take so long to open them to the point where i dont even open them anymore until i get low on tech. I was really hoping they would bring back coop for campaign and the no multiplayer pvp sucks. So all in all if your in it for escalation then i say good game other than that nice try edge of reality but your no high moon. Hopefully this is not the last transformer game i would love to have one thats based in the begining of the war for cybertron and not the end like the first 2 games.","September 16, 2014","true","187.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glacials/recommended/245760/","glacials","glacials","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glacials/","517 products in account","I played this game out of loyalty to the Cybertron games (War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron -- both really great games).\n\nThis game didn't deliver. Here are some reasons that come to mind for why I feel this:\n\n- The game was very short; I seem to have completed it in roughly 4 hours\n- The level design and interaction is subpar. In several areas it's unclear where to go, or you travel across a large empty room only to receive dialog that you have to backtrack to its beginning, or you spend too much time waiting on NPCs to open doors for you\n- Several animations are lazily and awkardly reused from Fall of Cybertron across different characters and scenarios, like Grimlock's "smash open 2-panel door" animation being used on Optimus Prime\n- The transform-into-vehicle animations have a ~1 second lag time after completing before you can boost, which takes away from the cool factor and discourages you from transforming as a combat option\n- The new (to the Cybertron games, anyway) antagonist is not well introduced or personified\n- The game softlocked on me three times in my first playthrough -- either an NPC refused to proceed through an obviously empty and closed-off hallway, or a door refused to open, etc. Resetting from checkpoint immediately fixed these issues.\n- This was a lazy port from console; the menu and interactions even display 360 button images.\n- Speaking of the menu and it suffering from lazy console porting, some of the navigation options aren't available as keypresses and you have to go down to the key and click the word for the action you want to perform like a dummy\n- Cutscenes, both prerendered and not, seemed overused compared to Fall of Cybertron's format\n- The story was not engaging enough and I couldn't say at any given time what my overall (according to the story) objective was, which was something I could definitely do for Fall of Cybertron\n\nThere are many other minor things that are not worth mentioning specifically, but which are worth mentioning as a group, that make it clear this game was not given the time, love, and polish of the previous two games in the Cybertron series.\n\nIf you feel that you must buy this game out of loyalty to the series (I did), you may go ahead. If you don't feel that way, I would recommend against buying it.\n\nMy own loyalty to the franchise has decreased as a result of the release of this game in this state, and I probably won't be booting it up again.","July 5, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

By the time you reach the Cybertronian era you wish you'd never go back. The Escalation mode is quite enjoyable, where you can choose to play as whichever transformer you desire (as long as they are unlocked).\nOverall, the game is fairly good but has room for improvement (DLC?). Such as:\n- Replay levels as whatever Transformer you wish (Singleplayer)\n- Add more movie characters (Galvatron for example)\n- PvP multiplayer (deathmatch, team deathmatch, ctf, etc.)\n- Possibly the addition of a free roam map for both eras (A city for earth and something or rather of Cybertron, multiplayer?)\nThese additions I feel would make the game reach its true potential. I still recommend this game, so if you have fifty odd dollars you want to spend then this is the game for you, oh I almost forgot...TRANSFORMERS!","June 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

All the fans that want to micro manage this game for its flaws is a waste of time. The animations are key and it is basically an update from FOC. You get a ton of cool characters and arent restricted to use who ever in Escal mode like in FOC and just plan awesome. Yes it does has a 30 FPS lock for Escal mode and they have their reasons for that I am sure but other than that I like it. The dialog is cheesy and makes me laugh but take the good with the bad. I am not really a picky gamer unless they didnt sound like they way they should and they do so in that aspect I like this game and all the others. Id get the whole trilogy honestly because they all have there ups and downs but as a whole they are awesome to have in ones collection.\n\nAnd about the controls being buggy I never had a problem and I am utilizing a 360 red clear Afterglo. And that hype about how they move too slow in Vehicle mode is a lie they all have a boost added on to the regular speed up button so it goes in 2 tiers.","October 30, 2014","true","14.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

The story takes place on Earth where a lost artifact called the Dark Spark, the opposite of the Matrix of Leadership. A bounty hunter named Lockdown is seeking the Dark Spark and to use it to his own will. But Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots will not allow this to happen and now he must retrieve the Dark Spark before Lockdown.\nThe Dark Spark was originally on the home planet of Cybertron, where Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons, wanted it to rule over Cybertron and the Universe. But Optimus destoryed it, whilst it was in Megatrons hands, well so Optimus thought. It had ended up on Earth and noe Optimus must destory it.\n\nThe multiplayer in this game is called Escalation, a survival that contains up to four players and all the maps from War and Fall of Cybertron also with two earth maps.\nYou can play as any character that is available in the game, by unlocking them though packages called Gear boxes.\nBut however Escalation gets boring really fast.\n\nAll in all, this games Cybertron side of the Story is made very well, but the Earth side is very bad.\nIf this game was just the Cybertron side it would have been ok, but the multiplayer only has Escalation and thats it...\nThis game gets 5/10 only for the Cybertron side of the story.","November 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"
