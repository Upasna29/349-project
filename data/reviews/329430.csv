More like Slap in your face pay for a major patch that should have been what we call PC GAME VERSION of the game.\nIf you don't have this game, you will surely enjoy it this game is amazing. HOWEVER, for those veterans who do own it along with every other dlc before...\n\nI am not easily impressed, and this so-called version carries minor updates that should have been.\nTHE PC VERSION of the game IN THE FIRST PLACE. Do you really want to support ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports of games and then having it rerelease on you with some major updates and fixes as "Remasters"? Do you want more game devs doing this more in the future? Are you going to give in?\n\nSorry No! I will not, and I'll stand against it as I will not be adding anymore hours to this game, and that is how  I'll show my defiance. You can have My 20 dollars smeared with crap for free. For you have no strings on me.\n\n(When the update goes for the reasonable price I'll play this with the rest of you but until then I suggest holding for it, Won't change my review or what transpired however.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=433745414\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAjy3Wmxp9s\n\nPros + Looks better than the original, supporting 1080p, Lighting and texture looks better, and it runs better at 60 fps.\n+ New animations and rework, but you wouldn't notice them much\n+ New missions added in order to entice you to play again\n+ All dlcs in one pack read to go!\n+ The game itself has fantastic game play, mechanics, etc. we know this because we've played it. We know this game is great, a year ago or so.\n\n\nCons - Doesn't feel like a remaster as they claim, a remaster is a perfection of their game and does more than just blow the game 1080p and adding some side missions, bells and whistles here and there.\n- My titan X is sitting here cold at 1080p because it doesn't support 4k? WTF! The textures are also horrible!.\n- Some of the bugs in the original carried over insanely laughable, I caught them while starting the game and added it to my video. Zombie glitching around is some examples.\n- Remastering applies to certain things such as music, some voices, etc.\n- No multiplayer can ever be implemented in this game (Saw that video)\n- Charging players for this Update of the game and cutting away the original support ( The main game is gone from the store you can only get the dlcs for the original, but it will be no longer supported in any way or form you have to upgrade to this version for that) You can, however, purchase the original from HUMBLE BUNDLE and add key to steam.\n- Promises that was told and unkept. They never came to be.\n- Calling it and emphasizing remaster to insult those that own and know what remasters are in their collections. (Homeworld, Tombraider anniversary collections, etc.)\n- Veteran players who own the game, do the math on how much you are paying for this game along with having the original+dlc already (This was posted on the forums, 50+$)\n\nGame is targeted for new audience.That's all I'll have to say. At least unlike the other reviewers with thumbs up and positive.  I am honest because I have cash to waste on being honest about the game than sucking one for a review copy or  just defending my purchase like a fanboy and sheeps who have absolutely almost no class in what pc gaming quality is about.\nI am sincerely disappointed and I rarely am since I love video games, and I truly love playing games to review them for fun, however, I do have morals and ethics. I do have hours and hours in the original (Xbox Version), and I love the game but sorry I will not be supporting these types of re-release as legitimate remasters as I have many that do so in the category.\n\nBy all means if you are a huge fan, love the game or never played it, then enjoy the product and do what you have to do and go ahead and play the game. Don't let my review stop you from what you are doing because it is my opinion, which is more important to me as yours is to you.\n\nI'll 100% support you guys again on your next game if you bring us a quality game, especially for the pc versions. Sorry dev do not take this personally, but I will be skipping on this art piece.","April 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 2,217 of 2,539 people (87%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","87","217","2","86","170"

I paid good money to improve the game experience and all I got was this reskin (and some NEW bugs!).\n\nThe base game\nI enjoyed the base game with the upgraded visuals. There were also some mechanical tweaks (mainly the vehicles now handle according to Earth gravity) and lovely additions to the soundtrack; it wasn't a new experience, but an improved one. The Freaks got balanced, you didn't get as overwhelmed with tasks, the CLEO drops and reskins brought a little spice into things - it was quite nice revisiting the game I love, warts and all.\n\nThe new content ran out a bit too quickly, however, and the endgame was boring with the last stretch of missions and looting a little flat as usual, but I felt it was okay value for 24 hours of gameplay. After all, I was getting 2 refreshed DLCs too, right?\n\nDealbreaker DLC\nBut then there's Lifeline. My first three playthroughs had major game-breaking bugs, and the whole 'refreshed' DLC is riddled with old bugs that have been reported to UD Labs time and again. NOTHING has been fixed, and there is very little additional content for Lifeline - the reskins are lame and there are no new weapons (the CLEO ones suck compared to army stuff).\n\nI felt utterly cheated, still do after 8+ hours of gameplay.\n\nWhen Fighting 7/Bladed 7 Kung-Fu Vince falls through a bridge after exiting your vehicle and gets killed by a solo Feral under said bridge, you know your game is ♥♥♥♥ed. Never mind the CLEO missions that don't spawn, zombies that spawn inside the ground, disappearing items, worthless AI, Journal glitching out, wrong voice clips playing for your player character etc.\n\nThis really put the base game into perspective for me, too. In the end, the improvements were marginal at best and left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe bottom line\nThis remake is way overpriced for what it is - reskins and some extra tunes. The mechanical tuning should have been done for the original, it was borderline bugfixing! I paid good money thinking I would get actual content and bugfixes/polish too, but NOPE. I still love the base game for what it is (it's complicated with Lifeline...), but if you're an old player, don't buy this for the full price, about 70% off would be fair.\n\nIf you still want to play the same old game and can stand the bugs, that is.\n\nNew players? Buyer beware. The base game is still one of the better zombie survival games and has unique mechanics that are quite enjoyable, but the devs don't seem to be interested in fixing and expanding the game - and that is a bad, bad sign.","May 9, 2015","false","62.5"," 708 of 786 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","708","786","10","12"

Once for the Xbox 360 and once for the PC.  Now I can say I purchased them a third time, because this one is esstentially the same as the original and the DLC.\n\nWhen I started to hear news of a newer updated version of the game my heart skipped a beat.  Maybe we'd finally get a version of the game that wasn't handicapped by the outdated consoles they were created for.   Did I get that.. well the answer is a yes, and a no.  While the game looks far better than the previous version, it just isn't worth recommending for a full price purchase if you already own the original game.\n\nIf you don't own the original already, this is a good deal, you get the base game and all the DLC and the patches and bug fixes which were never brought to the original game.  Excuses are just that excuses, saying the patches and bugs weren't possible to fix because the game was restricted by the console release... WHY?  This isn't a console, it's the PC.  Those excuses don't work on this format..\n\nBottom line remains, if you own State of Decay.. save your money, if you don't own the game, the YOSE is the way to go.  Great value for your money, but this HD upgrade was totally  unnecessary and the bugs/glitches should have been fixed in the previous version.","April 28, 2015","false","32.9"," 677 of 793 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","677","793","14","15"

The game is still pretty much the same experience.\n\nAnd here we go\nIf you are  new  to this game and interested, then I'd most likely recommend buying it. Don't mind the negative reviews on this edition of the game. Instead read the ones on the original one (which is no longer available for purchase at the moment) since they tell more about the experience than these on YOSE. Why? Because most of these tell about how this edition was released only to make money out of small updates and about the bugs that make the game worse. The worst thing is that the original game is not receiving any of the new content and updates that are included in this edition. I can understand the pain and I agree that it's a horrible move, but I'd like to direct this short review specifically towards everyone who has no experience with the original game.\n\nI'll let you know about the game's basics and the good and the bad in short.\n\nState of Decay\nThe base game\nSurvival in zombie apocalypse\n3rd person view\nMelee weapons and guns\nCars\nCollecting loot (from food and medicine to weapons and building materials)\nBase management\nExpanding your community\nHelping your neighbors with problems\nDoing missions that eventually lead to the end of the game\nYOSE Day One Edition\n2x DLCs: Breakdown and Lifeline\nImproved graphics\nAn exclusive character\nTwo new guns\nA new car and already existing vehicles with custom skins\nNew missions (looting supply crates)\nThe Good and The Bad\nPros\n+Looting and managing inventory is easy\n+Combat is alright\n+Base management is simple and clear\n+Vehicles are easy to control (most of the time)\n+Moving alone can actually be really dangerous (it's good to have someone with you)\n+Graphics are nice...\n\nCons\n-...but they can get a bit ugly (for ex. in the woods)\n-Fighting with melee weapons gets repetitive\n-Missions also get repetitive\n-Simplicity is a minor impact\n-Voice acting is propably the most repetitive thing in the game and needs a bigger variety\n(same sentences are repeated alot)\n-Vehicles feel a bit too fragile sometimes\n-The game is still screaming for co-op\n-Minor bugs that are close to breaking missions\n-Performance needs tweaking (fps drops)\n\nNutshell\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSounds: 7.5/10 (Including voice acting)\nPerformance: 7/10\nStory: 6/10\n\nConclusion\nState of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition was made only with money in mind and so it should propably be avoided by veterans unless you need this new content and bug fixes + the upcoming fixes for the new and old bugs. In the other hand, this is something that fans of survival games should look into. You can spend alot of time while playing this game. Even I spent over 12 hours on the base game and tried out one of the DLCs (Lifeline) that I have not played before (I did play the original game and the Breakdown DLC back in the day). The other DLC (Breakdown) will leave you with even more hours on your counter. The game is propably best played with a controller.\n\nNewcomers\n8/10\nVeterans\n5-6/10\n"The polished yet dirty version/edition of a fun game"\n\n\nPlease let me know if I missed anything.

People who purchase this game as newcomers to SoD "franchise" as well as the returning players deserve smooth and flawless gameplay for the money these developers ask for this game, unfortunately if you think that you're getting flawless game for your hard earned money, I have to disappoint you by saying you better forget it.\n\nAs for the "remaster" aspect of this re-release, promise of the high quality textures is one of the biggest lies and not only you can see it for yourself in the parts of the game where textures are just ugly and you can't quite recognize what are you even looking at, but also according to developers themselves, PC release is smaller than Xbox One release because in PC release they didn't need to upgrade as many textures to higher quality as they needed to upgrade for Xbox One. This is interesting. Now I don't really own Xbox One, but I wonder if the Xbox One players really have the same ugly textures that show here in my PC version and while the fact that they did not upgrade as many textures for PC as they upgraded for Xbox One should naturally mean significantly lower price on PC, the price is the same even though the value added compared to original is clearly not that significant at all.\n\nSmaller difference in the quality compared to original equals smaller reason for anyone on PC to upgrade to YOSE, but wait. Can you really stay away of this re-release and just enjoy the original? According to some players, the original game won't launch for them anymore and as a matter of fact, the original game and its dlcs are replaced with YOSE, so there is no way to purchase the original anymore and no way for original owners to get the support unless they purchase YOSE! So much for optional purchase for the original owners...\n\nLet us put that aside and let me say what most of us think anyway, but nobody had the guts to say it out loud:\n\nReal fans of SoD expected more from the SoD "franchise" than just a re-release of the same thing they already have and losing the support for the original is a legitimate reason for fans of the original SoD to be mad as they are basically forced to upgrade to YOSE and pay for the same thing again if they don't want to lose support.\n\nIn other words, for original fans it feels like being stabbed in our backs and I'm pretty sure that we all will remember this and keep it in mind from now on every time these developers bring a new game of any name.\n\nEDIT:\nTo be completely fair, I love the little things they added exclusively for original owners and those who pre-order this game (new character who is already one leveled-up badass with unique weapons for original owners and special prepper pack for those who pre-ordered the game) and I also love CLEO items, but it still isn't that significant change that would justify the re-release and especially the price and just like many already said, not only bugs aren't fixed at all, but they somehow managed to introduce new bugs and crashes to desktop that basically render this overpriced re-release unplayable, isn't a "definitive edition" supposed to be clean of all the bugs present in the standard one?\n\nSpeaking of bugs, here is a little peek...\nhttps://youtu.be/l4hlT29VCg4\n\nAs an owner of the original release, I would be willing to pay for all the new stuff in form of a regular DLC as an optional "update" even if the price was slightly higher than a regular DLC, but the current price is a ripoff even with 33% discount.","May 1, 2015","false","67.7"," 274 of 329 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","274","329","11","10"

Meanwhile, there is literally a squad of review-skewers operating out of the community forum vowing to upvote every single negative post no matter how meaningless it is and downvote the opposite, so right now it's pretty hard to view an actual opinion of this game (Obviously, don't pretend I'm somehow 'unbiased' or 'more correct' in this situation). I'm going to predict that the amount of people who downvote this post within the next several hours will prove those previous statements.\n\nFor further thought material, if you go to Metacritic, critic reviews for this game are definitely positive, and the problems they have with the game are more about a lack of polish and the fact that it wasn't a complete 'overhaul' like they hoped for, rather than it being a bad purchase or a bad game.\n\nHere is actually new content-wise in YOSE:\n\n-New knife-combat (which comes with a bunch of nice badass moves) (One of the bigger changes in the game)\n-30 minutes of new music\n-The amount of cars has more than doubled (although most of these come from new variants of already-existing vehicles. There is a classic 80's sedan, SUV, a non-customized version of the modern muscle car, some new tuners, a new classic muscle car and a bunch of new colors and variants for all of them.)\n-New facility options (you can now do stuff like make coffee and convert ammo and stuff like that)\n-A bunch of new guns\n-A new type of mission (which is acts as a really nice reward occasionally in breakdown)\n-New Breakdown Heroes/survivors (including a returning-player bonus)(Milo Eldrige is an example of a new generic survivor for those misinformed souls that think Gurubani is the only change).\n-Slightly sharper graphics and frame rate (Not even close to a big change)\n-New visual ground effects, actual fog, etc\n\nKNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WORTH 30$ FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE THE GAME.\n\nIf you are a new buyer to the series, then yah, buy this. State of Decay is a great game, and this is definitely the better version to get. There is more content, a bunch of smaller features the previous did not have, more support (patch inbound).\n\nDespite the generic review claiming the game is 'broken' with 'broken features', the game is far from unplayable. The majority of bugs are physics flaws and bugs are definitely not something the game is bad with.\n\nAside from that, if you are angry about the game not getting enough attention, you can blame MS for trying to make this a cash grab. The developers - who are very attentive to the community on the website - can't even do a DLC until the publishers ask for it. I'm not trying to baselessly shift blame, that is literally what one of the developers said when answering a community suggestion ( https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/the-guns.27815/page-281 ). Keep in mind that in that same thread the developer can be quoted as saying that something new might just be in the works as well for the game.","May 18, 2015","true","117.6"," 802 of 1,049 people (76%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","76","802","1","43","30"

While it pretty annoying by itself for having to pay for what is essentially a (performance?) update, it is rather unforgivable that this game still, in its present state, is extremely buggy; character floating in the air, running through solid walls, teleporting, etc. The sheer amount of this types of bugs I encountered is mind boggling. Arguable, there is a graphical update in this version, which makes everything a lot brighter, which in my opinion does not help the game. Let's not talk about game design, while it could have been a lot better, at least it does not totally ruin the game like the bugs do. With the exception of course, by the fact that your companions tend to run away or leave you while heading out. This is especially no fun when you try to clear out an infestation, raising the chances considerably to be overrun and die.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenPredator/recommended/329430/","GenPredator","Genpredator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenPredator/","49 products in account","I do not recommend this game because it is so ridiculously glitchy.  Being new to the game, I read the reviews, and despite the negative recommendations because this edition should have been a patch instead of a remastered version, I got it anyways.  The indications of poor graphics performance and poor physics were fairly slight in the reviews, while predominant complaints were the former, so I thought, how bad could it be?  Let me tell you new comers, it's that bad.  Let  me break down the problems this game faces.\n\n-sluggish controls;  The action you try to perform may or may not be done on the first button press.  This leads to over zealous and useless button mashing.\n-Zombies literally spawn right in front of you and are attacking you before they are visibly spawned in.  This is most notable when the game decides to mess you up, you'll see a few zombies, go whale on them, the music will kick into more serious tones, then you are swarmed with zombies that were nowhere around 2 seconds ago.  You'll start seeing them spawn in right behind a zombie you are executing.\n-team npcs are obviously programmed to be more of a nuciance than a help. They are notorious about standing in doorways, not attacking enemies until the last second.  They will NOT help you carry stuff, such as supplies you find, which really makes them pretty useless.  You cannot direct them to move, attack or anything otherwise useful.\n-The camera is not your friend.  Half the battle is keeping up with the camera.  Especially while driving.  Nothing says pain in the @$$ like driving with the WASD scheme and rotating the camera manually.  90% of all car accidents in this game is due to blind spots from the camera nemesis.  When fighting, sometimes all you can see is the back side of a zombie or your head.\n-Aiming can be a real pain in the nether region.  Scoped weapons aren't truely scoped, as you only zoom in ever so slightly, but the sight is still over the shoulder, and it leads to frustratingly difficult long shots.  Against all survival guide recommendations, spray and pray will end up being the order of the day when you inevitably get swarmed, hopefully you brought enough snacks, painkillers and a backup melee weapon because it's gonna turn into melee when you run out of ammo.\n-Vehicle physics seem to have been written by a toddler, because the physics are either as stiff as a board or as bouncy as a rubber ball.  Run over a zombie, you may dent your hood, or you may take your vehicle for a tour of the solar system, you're at the whim of random physics.  On that note, if walking everywhere wasn't a sure recipe for disaster because of materializing zombies, it would be easier to walk.\n-Walls and doors may or may not stop a zombie attack or the flames from a molotov.\n-Street curb can be an invisible barrier.  Make sure you take a running leap to get up on that sidewalk.\n-To search containers, you have to position yourself perfectly in front of it, you can't open that cooler lid standing beside it, because that's IMPOSSIBLE, the same goes for entering and exiting vehicles as well as putting items in the storage compartment.\n-Climbing down a ladder can be a perilous endeavor.  Sometimes you'll climb down normally, othertimes you'll swan dive off the platform.  Oh, did I mention how the useless NPCs like to stand in front of doors?  Yeah, they do that with ladders too.  Feel free to push them off, not that you'll teach them any kind of lesson but you'll feel better...\n-Last but not least;  the missions are so repetitive, and absolutely pointless...  "<insert name> is in a tough spot." blah blah blah...  The idle NPCs constantly go out, need help, and never bring anything back for the trouble, just a time sink.  You can ignore them, but you'll start having morale problems unless you bring back supplies constantly.  You also run the risk of losing members, especially before you have all your outposts.\n\nOh, and, whoever decided how much items weigh really needs to spend some time figuring out how much stuff really weighs.  If a person struggles to carry an assault pack filled with a hatchet, 30 rounds of 5.56, a rifle, 3 bottles of asprin, 3 MRE, and 3 grenades, I don't think they would be much use in the military, let alone the apocolypse.  And military trained personel who takes 20-30 seconds' to change a magazine?  I'm looking at you Lifeline.\n\nThe game has promise, but I think between the dev's ADD and the DRM (i.e.  lack of any community fixes) it's going to be a broken promise.  Graphically and functionally this game is on par with Xbox1 and the PS2 era, though the concept is there for a great modern game.  Very sad, and I wanted to like this game so badly.  My recommendation, if you absolutely must get it, wait for a sale, but I bet you'll still be disappointed.","August 21, 2015","false","96.3"," 111 of 129 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","111","129","8","3"

Honestly I almost see almost no difference graphic-wise, it certainly doesn't look that much better.\nBut that wasn't something I had hoped for anyways. What I had hoped for was an improvement gameplay-wise, but alas they didn't deliver. The same long known bugs that plagued the old game, are also present in this version, the extra Mission type   is nothing to write home about, the Bonus Survivor is bugged, I couldn't even add him/her to my community, the Bonus Gear I can't even recall if it worked.\nAlso they stated that they had reworked the UI, but I really can't tell, because it is still the same unresponsive, lackluster console conversion i had to put up with in the orginal game. It is definitely not tweaked for PC, at least not worth mentioning. Performance-wise I had no problems at all, I ran the game at "Ultra"(haha)-Specs and it ran fluid, almost all of the time (oc'ed nvidia gtx 760).

Don't buy this game until the devs make it very public that they've fixed it, should they ever actually do that. Until then, try and find a way to get the original.\n\n*\n\nI loved this game when it came out. I remember watching the trailers and having my hopes raised so high at the prospect of an open world zombie survival game of this calibre. And when it came out, it actually lived up to the hype. Somewhere in the outdated graphics, the lack of co-op, the awful sound design, and the disjointed voice acting, was a fantastic game with amazing mechanics. Hours were spent glued to my xbox fighting off waves of zombies, scrounging for supplies, searching every container looking for new weapons (and there must be hundreds of different weapons), building up bases, rescuing survivors and expanding my group.\n\nAnd then Breakdown came out, and I was ecstatic. It's like they realized their weaknesses and limitations, and decided to devote their attention to building their strengths. While the story of State of Decay was decent enough to push you around the map and through events in the game, they now gave us the world as our playground and challeneged us to survive for as long as possible in whatever way we chose. Once again, many hours were lost.\n\nAnd then came Lifeline, and in my opinion, the cracks started to show. It was still every bit as fun as the original, but what I'd hoped would be an entire urban centre to explore, turned out to be almost entirely inaccessible. The map consists of a large city area of which the entirety is inaccessible. The only areas you can explore are the suburban-esque areas of the outer limits of the city, which contain little more than the same houses and buildings you saw in the original. But despite all that, the fun was still there. The story was interesting enough, and being given a pile of new, military grade weapons to mow down zombies with was a blast. So even though the fun was shorter lived than the original, it still held up to its own.\n\nAnd then...this. This terrible, awful, wretched money grab they shamelessly put out. The base game is still there somewhere, but it has been completely buried in a buggy, laggy, entirely unplayable experience. They boast about being remastered in 1080p, as well as improved textures and animations, but the game looks almost no different than the original. The menus are a little sharper, the icons look a little crisper, but the player models, zombies, vehicles, the world itself is unnoticeably different. The only thing that's really changed is that the game can't keep up with itself anymore. Frame skips are constant, even in low texture density areas. Bugs are rampant, with your characters floating in the air or falling through the world, zombies pop in and out of existence all around you, the game crashes to desktop.\n\nAnd just to add insult to injury, the devs are charging more than the base game for this, and have made the original, playable version unpurchaseable. Coming up on a year after its release, the devs have seemingly made no moves to acknowlege that their product is broken, nevermind actually fix this game and make it playable again. One can only hope that day is coming.","April 16","false","0.6"," 96 of 116 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","96","116","2","0"

Out of curiosity, I will be reinstalling to see if it addresses some of the bugs I mentioned.\n\nUpdate 2 on November 27, 2015:\nEverything seems to work fine now. Only took them 7 months to actually patch the damn thing.\n\nI really want to recommend this game, but I can't in good conscience tell people to go out and get YOSE given the state it's in. On paper, it sounds great: HD re-release of 2013's State of Decay, all DLC included, bonus missions and new characters for the Breakdown DLC. I got the original State of Decay around the time it came out of Early Access back in late 2013 and it was plagued by bugs that eventually got patched out. So, imagine my surprise when playing the re-release only to discover they brought back the same bugs. To list a few:\n\n- Opening up the journal will running or driving will lock your character in that direction infinitely until you press the same direction key again.\n- Incorrect character voices. A female character will use her own voice to say one line, then switch to another female voice, and then cheer in a deep male voice.\n- Issues with map geometry, i.e. with a horde right on your butt, you'll sprint across the street only to hit what the game thinks is an invisible wall because the curb is like half a foot above the street.\n- Wonky car physics, meaning that driving over what you think is a small rock will rocket your vehicle into the stratosphere and kill your character.\n- Worst of all, the infinite loading screen glitch is back. Anyone who played the original SoD at launch will remember this, where if you switch between characters, the game will load in as the new character, but the loading screen will float in place forever. It's easily fixed by exiting to the menu and loading back in, but this shouldn't be an issue in the first place.\n\nIt's almost been a month since launch with no patch (other than one to fix the import save function). Until YOSE gets fixed or falls to a price you think is reasonable, I say skip it. If you've not played the original, you can get that and all the DLC for less than $10 or $15 during a sale.","May 27, 2015","false","82.3"," 155 of 206 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","155","206","4","2"

It's still choppy as hell and it's not very enjoyable. I don't really feel like the "new" things in this version is worth the money. They could've done a little more for that price.\n\nIf you have the first game, go back and replay it. If you're new to the party, play the first one. State of Decay is a great game and I had a lot of fun with it. But this release must be a joke.\n\nI wish I could recommend it because SoD is basically a nice game. It's an open-world zombie game with a story line that isn't completly flat (the zombiegenre doesn't exactly throw possibilities at you) and since I absolutely loved SoD the first time (and managed to get all achievements which is a real nice plus for me) I decided to get this version too because hey, another perfectly completed game with added content incoming, right?\nNah.\nHonestly, I am incredibly dissapointed. The things they've added aren't that impressive and don't stand out that much from the original game, the graphics look exactly the same to me and not only did I spend 20 euro on basically the same game, it even runs worse for me than the original. And I'm running it on the lowest possible settings (not that there are many settings).\n-The mouse sensitivity is off the charts even when I change it down low.\n-There's like 3 resolution options and I see no real difference when changing it.\n-The textures look bland no matter what setting they're on.\n-The loading takes quite a while and even when I'm finally in the game it takes even more time to render everything around me.\nNot to mention my FPS starts high at 60 but drops way down to 5-20 as soon as I'm in the game.\nCould be just me, sure. I'm not technical. But I'm not trying to play it on a potato either.\n\nMaybe they'll fix it up in a couple of weeks or so. Maybe I'll come back in a few months and see how it's taken itself, but right now?

Bugs, and poor resolution were some of the most notable issues. Fortunately the core game was so good, many people including myself were willing to forgo any problems that it had, and enjoyed it any ways. What a great idea it is to "remaster" the original! The question though, is Year One remastered enough to justify a $30USD price tag?\n\nIf you've already played or own the original game is it worth $30? Short answer: NO.\n\nYes, the lighting have been improved significantly, and the texture quality is better, but other than that, there's not much new here. Sure, there are also some extra minor characters added, and now cars have decal (whoopie...), but every thing else about the game is exactly the same. The game advertises improved animations, and combat mechanics, yet I notice little changed about these 2 things. If there have been any changes, they're so tiny, it's barely noticeable. The two biggest improvements are the lighting and texture quality, both could of easily been added as a patch. There are no other notable additions, the model quality is exactly the same, there are no new modes to play, no new areas, no new quests, nothing for returning players.\n\nIf this was advertised as the definitive State of Decay collection, I would be fine with it. Lots of games like Boarderlands repackage old games into compilations for the benefit for new players, but this was advertised as a remastering. Even the description of the game mislead old fans to believe that there are a ton of new stuff here, when there aren't. Worst off, the most noticeable improvements, lighting, texture quality, and true 1080p, are things that should of been in place when they launched their original port! But instead they decided to charge it to us, as a lazy excuse of a remaster. If you're a returning player to the game, Year One is nothing more than a glorified update patch.\n\nLuckily for us, the original is absolutely a stellar survival game, and since they changed nearly nothing about it, it remains a stellar survival game. If you are new to State of Decay, this might be a good time to get into the game, and perhaps Year One is suitable for the new comers. For old time fans who have already played, or own State of Decay, don't bother. It's not worth your money unless you have enough disposable income to justify it. But even then, the practice of selling what amounts to a patch for $30 and misleading old players to think that there are a ton of new stuff when there's not, is not a practice that I can condone.\n\nPros:\n- Still the same, great State of Decay game\n- Suitable for any one NEW to the game\n\nCons:\n- For returning players, there isn't much new\n- $30 for what amount to a patch is unconscionable\n- Neither combat or animation have been improved enough to justify it being in the description\n- The original was a lazy port, Year One is a lazy remastering","April 30, 2015","false","6.8"," 114 of 155 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","114","155","4","2"

I bought this game on a whim when I found out that I could import my save. To save time for others:\n\nTL;DR: Save your money if you already have the original game, because the new content does not validate the price. If however you havent got the game at all, it is worth paying for as the old one is no longer available on steam.\n\n\nPositive aspects:\n-returning players from SoD get access to an exclusive player with the Nimble trait (reflexes)\n-new type of car added that has an increased trunk space (6 spaces) with a bit less handling than a modern pickup, but more readily available and just as sturdy.\n-like original SoD has intergrated controller support available\n-returning players can import their save from SoD, breakdown and Lifeline\n-Actions like creating more snacks and coffee are now available at the kitchen\n-new mission type included in story type and breakdown, gives new lease of life to objects such as timers and talking dolls\n-new map icons make it easier to see at a glance what kind of missions are available to you\n\nNegative aspects:\n-The game is really badly optimized. This particular game lags even on minimum specs\n-Some zombies are not rendered correctly, and sometimes the buildings have the same problem. For machines (like mine) that ran original SoD perfectly fine, it seems like this is an issue that shouldn't have been one.\n-the map looks less smooth and more boxy and cartoonish\n-for the content that has been added ontop of the old version, it really is not worth the money even with the discount. The added features included in this pack, i would only realistcally pay around £8 at most.\n-No new voice actors have been commissioned. For when playing breakdown and the like, it can get tiresome to hear the same 6 voice actors over and over in different pitches.\n-at times, attacks do not connect to the zombies, leading you to waste your stamina swinging wildly while they still come and wreck you.\n-it is commonplace for your character to glitch into the foundations of the building. Whereas in the original SoD this glitch was only really common for zombies, the glitch has now expanded to affecting player characters\n-the graphics as a whole just look sharp and horrible as if no edge smoothing has been used at all. in all honesty, I prefer the graphics of the old game.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI will probably continue to play this game as i have already spent money on it, but looking back I wish I saw a review like this instead of the generic "This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cash grab" so i could have just happily stayed with the original.\nHowever, if you've never played State of Decay at all, it is a brilliant game, and will recommend you buy this copy as the old one is now not available.","May 3, 2015","false","26.4"," 85 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","85","111","6","0"

I can overlook the bugs in the original game, but the larger number of bugs in YOSE edition is pathetic.\n\nI don't know if it's caused by bugs, or the way the zombie AI is programmed, but zombies seem to know where you are from as far as 3 blocks away. I keep having my survivors killed due to being horded by dozens of zombies who just always know where I am sneaking around. I destroyed a bunch of zombies, and the other groups keep endlessly coming, until my survivors ran out of stamina and get killed. This is truly frustrating.

They just stand there getting mauled by zombies without fighting back. Seriously, what the F**k did the developers do to the AI ???\n\nI have played the original SoD, and I will still go back to the original. The zombie AI is more balanced in the original game. The YOSE edition zombies somehow have human detector radar and you can never hide pass them. I keep losing my survivors and desperately look for new ones and train them, only to see them get killed as well. This totally ruins the gameplay.

The items it adds are basically the same items that already exist with a different skin making them worthless to the package.\n\nIf you don't have the original State of Decay game but were thinking of picking it up, this is a great value and, in that situation, I could recommend the game.  Otherwise, if you already own the games, steer clear of this game.","May 11, 2015","false","50.0"," 92 of 124 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","92","124","4","6"

They have improved shadow quality. But if you go into shadow.cfg from the original game, you can adjust shadow quality much better than the remastered edition have. And the lightning in the new version is more ugly, because of its low shadow contrast. So in the forest at the beginning you dont see any lightning, because of the low contrast. They also didnt improve textures. Best example is, when you look at the streets. Next thing, I have a WQHD Monitor, the native resolution is 1440P, but you only get 1080P ingame. For a FullHD Monitor, its okay, but every resolution lower than nativ looks terrible. When you have a Full HD Monitor, try to set 1600*900 and you see not only the difference from 1080P to 900P, also what its like, when you cant play in the native resolution of the Monitor. And the best thing is, NOW i cant get 1440P in the original Game. Here also only 1080P.  I think they patched it, so that the original game dont have 1440P any more and doesnt look better than the remastered. My shadow cfg and Draw Distance in the original Game is also bugged after latest patch in original game. So i only have the remastered Edition in 1080P with ugly contrast, ugly shadows and so on. And I was naiv to think, they could include tesselation, Parallax Occlusion Mapping, High Res Textures, best performance and so on.....haha...the performance in this new edition is bad too and i have a GTX Titan X :D:D I wasted my Money...Dont do this mistake...totally Fail!! ...sry for my bad english.....","May 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 100 of 137 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","100","137","6","0"

I loved SOD since I first heard the idea back in the day. I bought it on my Xbox (before I converted to the master race). It was innocent, a small company making the game everyone dreamed of. The concept was there, it made me feel for the characters when they were torn to shreds because I was too careless. It was an amazing game. The shoddy graphics and buggy gameplay were the only things hindering this beast of an idea. Everyday that I played this game I wanted to know what undead Labs was going to do to fix it. After a while I grew tired of waiting.\n\n3 days ago I logged onto Steam wondering if they had one of my favorite games. State of Decay. There it was $19.99 in all its glory just as I'd left it. Then I saw that Undead Labs HAD been working on it after all! So I bought the game a day before it released.\n\nI started the game and was immediately filled with disappointment. The didn't launch properly at first. Then the load times seemed to take forever and day. Finally I spawned in the Breakdown mode as Summer and BAM! Undead Labs told me ,"hey, we made the game better sorta."\n\nI play on a surface pro 2. This thing is a monster of a tablet. It can handle skyrim and GTA5 on almost full settings and is amazing. Sure it runs a little warm on those games but who's rig wouldn't?\n\nAnyway, there I was on Minimum resolution, minimum graphics and a Small as hell 4:3 display. Black borders all around. V sync on then off. IT ALL RAN THE SAME. Laggy, buggy and zombies jumping through walls. Forget driving. Hordes of zombies were complete chaos. My surface pro through all that was still running ice cold. Like I wasn't even playing a game.\n\nTo summarize: If you bought the original with expansions don't waste more money on something that is subpar. It doesn't live up to my expectations and frankly I don't know if it ever will. Undead Labs needs to do something about these issues because they're destroying a dream game. All the while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a ton of people off.\n\n-The Gamer that waited","April 28, 2015","false","14.8"," 111 of 156 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","111","156","8","5"

Some of the interface graphics have been improved. The icons on the map have been made a little bit bigger.\n\nWhen you start Breakdown, you get five hordes right off the bat. With no outposts to fend them off, you have to find a couple of cars to get rid of them.  Then you're down a couple of vehicles because they've been ruined.\n\nThe same thing with Lifeline. You get rushed early in the game and you get overwhelmed. You're not given enough time to set up to fend them off properly.\n\nThe original campaign is the same, you go through the camp site and go on from there.\n\nThe zombie and the horde spawning can be a little bit too much at times. Everytime you try to search for something, they'll spawn outside the house. If you're in a field, they appear right in front of you. If you get out of a car to look for something, they'll be there next to the vehicle.\n\nI'm all for killing the damn things, but it gets to be annoying after a while.

Building a community, scavenging resources and improving your living conditions during an apocalypse. It had it's own charm and all the annoying things about it (especially the bugs) were tolerable when you considered how small a developer Undead Labs was.\nYet i can not recommend this version of the game to anyone, not even people who haven't played the "non-remastered" version.\n\nThe original version got rid of a lot of bugs through patching but most of those are back in the YOSE edition with the addition of way more annoying new ones (car hit detection where you drive through a whole zombie horde without hurting a single one). A lot of obvious design flaws were not corrected (like adding a simple sorting function to your base inventory) and the visual improvements are nice in comparison but not that noticeable. And for a "polished" version, the framerate is horrendous, even on a decent system.\n\nI ended up reinstalling the original SoD, since it has fewer bugs and a lot of awesome mods available, that make the game more enjoyable (and from which the developers should have drawn inspiration on how to improve their game).\n\nIf Undead Labs will patch it to a playable state and add a little mod support, i'll give it another whirl. Until then, this prime example of a money grab stays off my hard drive.\n\n#Update 31.10.2015\nApart from a small hotfix right after release, the developer did not address any issues for a full six months.\nThankfully modders have not been idle and there are some nice additions and fixes out there that makes it feel like i didn't totally waste my money on this purchase.\nNow only recommended if you don't own the original and don't mind searching for and installing mods and community made fixes by yourself.","May 1, 2015","false","30.6"," 78 of 107 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","78","107","8","0"

I admit that much can be improved and I was hoping YOSE would be a step in the right direction so I bought it even though they only gave a 33% reduction for a game that was only marginally improved.\nHowever I can't play YOSE because the game crashes my pc.  I play for a random timespan then the screen goes black and poof the pc reboots.  I tweaked settings, updated the drivers and checked everything. No matter what: my pc crashes.\nMy pc is 3 years old and made for rendering movies, which is a pretty intensive process but even when rendering, playing a game, running you tube and various programs at the same time my pc won't crash. I also played a wide range of games  such as Skyrim but only State of Decay causes my pc to crash.\nAs this takes the fun out of the game and  I don't like my pc crashing to the point of no longer functioning I can't continue to tweak and play this game in the hope it won't happen again. And since most reviews confirm that the changes are superficial I can not recommend YOSE based on my experiences.\nI would also remark that selling a game with almost no viable changes for almost the same price is tantamount to a rip off. But we are now doggy trained to the anything-for-a-profit argument so I guess this signifies the normal pattern in game development. You can see this with the early access  games that never get into full release. At first the idea was to give players the chance to help develop the game, but people quickly saw another way to make a profit: selling unfinished software that does not get into finished state because "it is still under development". Examples are such games as  DayZ and Take on Mars from Bohemia Interactive Simulations, both almost 2 years in early access without a release date.\nI would advise people not to join the early access release racket. It gives bad companies methods to rip people off,  it makes good companies lazy: they use you for what they should do themselves: properly develop software. And then  finallly they charge you again when the game is released in full.  Yes, people, the game you helped develop, for which you did not get a dime but for which you are charged twice.

That’s all, yup. There is 1080p which you won’t see because everything still awfully made, thou they make it all shinny and brighter , textures are so bad in some places that you won’t believe that this game was made in 2015.

Also note at 5th screenshot of steam store where zombies hand is clipping, even on advertisement pictures it has problems. Also if you go on official deadlab forums you will see how they mock people who says how bad it is and mostly same accounts ( some even new) tell how great this game is. So if you new to this game get ready for full pack of bugs, if you are returning player only new what you will see is ONE new character IF you buy it before offer end and 1 new mission.

Endlessly respawning zombies, poor AI, shallow story and primitive gameplay were inevitable, but there's more to it that could've been done right.\n\nIn the end, there are two points of view: as an xbox console game, even with all of it's flaws and drawbacks, it's a masterpiece not because it's good, but because there is no better alternative. As a PC gaming product, however, it can be described with a single word: mess. Literally none of the game's systems are working good enough. It's been nearly 2 years since original release and it didn't get any better.\n\nYou can build yourself a base of your liking but there are facilities that are essential to build and those that have completely negligible effects so there is never a choice. On a first glance your people seem to be a community but after a few days you realise that they're just a bunch of drones: they don't establish friend/enemy/couple relationships, events about fights, jealousy or interpersonal dislike are completely random and random community members are 'picked' to participate, when a community member dies two random members will get a morale hit etc so both base and community building aspects are a mess too.\n\nWhat there remains? Hoarding? Your base stash has only 255 slots, so eventually you'll have to waste your time clearing it out every game day or two. Spent two hours gathering supplies to train your characters next day? Too bad, they got overwritten by your facilities' daily output and you have 5 items instead of 105. Character progression? Your favourites will get killed through a wall, when all floor two zombies fall through the ceiling while you're clearing first floor and tear you apart or your car turns over near two zombie hordes because someone inside farted.\n\nIn the end I can only recommend it as a cheap and glitchy Dead Rising substitute. However you probably should play Dead Rising itself instead.\n\nP.S. Imagine yourself a grown up person that claims to be a skilled game developer. This person spends half an hour trying to get inside a blue public restroom and finally pisses oneself just because of being unable to realise that door opens outwards, not inwards. Pathetic? Definitely. Funny? Perhaps, but not so when you realise that it's your employee that you've sent half an hour ago to deliver some very urgent documents which had to be driven across town within 15 minutes or you'd lose a 1 million $ contract.","November 23, 2015","false","56.0"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","58","79","9","2"

Game is really not worth the time or the money.  The main issues are horrible load screens that take forever to load up the game when started.  For some reason, the game loads every time you change survivors.  Survivors tend to wander off and constantly become missing and gain the stat of "ran away," which is annoying.  The major nerfs on skills.  For example, Mighty weapons ability "sweep," no longer knocks legs off of zombies like it used to.  It however does knock one zombie's legs at a time, which makes it pretty useless.  I do not reccomend getting this game, which should have been a DLC from the start.  If you plan on getting this game, I would reccomend getting the original State of Decay, the only difference would be combat and I guess that it is now in 1080p, which I really do not see a difference and a bunch of nerfs to your favorite abilities.","May 9, 2015","false","40.5"," 63 of 89 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","63","89","3","0"

But that's about it.\n\nI feel like they rebalanced the game difficulty but they did that in a horribly wrong way. When I first openned this game and played for 1 hour I deleted it on the spot then I went back to play the first one, I really like the first one better. To be honest I love the Lifeline DLC better from all the chapters, and the reason is that you can start a base with basic amount of resourse and gain influence in a certain ways. But in YOSE you can't get the influence in the old ways. I can't say it's not that easy anymore, I'd rather say its confusing.\n\nI think the producer didn't know what players are actually looking for.

I really really REALLY want to like this game. Its got all the elements for what should basically among the best zombie survival games ever. Usable cars, scavaging for loot and supplies, hundreds of weapons, base creation. But the massive set backs completely ruin this game. I'm not talking about the fact is basically the same game as the standard version. But instead things more key to the gameplay.\n\nThe main thing that ruins this game for me is just how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and useless the player controlled characters are. They usually cant do their automatically assigned jobs, most of them have no skills at all when you recuit them (apart from special heros), they wont use guns most of time, depending on what gun they have they usually cant effectively use it (seriously what the hell is wrong with ai and shotguns in this game), and none of them seem to understand the importance of always having someone on the watchtower (which as the main/only real defence your actual base has)  leaving you contantly open to attack. It doesnt sound like much but its just so frustrating when all your high level characters permadeath after spending hours training them up, just because they dicided to try to hit the massive boss zombie with a stick, rather than fire an assault rifle at it.\n\nThe scavenging on this game also feels like a waste of time, in most of my playthroughs i dont bother taking a lot of the supplies as the most common items are way to common, all my bases have enough food to open a supermarket after about 2 hours of playing, whereas materials are almost impossible to find. Along with other low level weapons, melee weapons and pistols are never usually worth picking up, and in most cases even bullets aren't even that worth encumbering yourself with as you typically only use rifle rounds, and after a few hours of play you can just make them yourself. With no console command or no weapons dealer the very rare guns are basically impossible to get. It really needs balancing and the supplies need to be better distributed.\n\nBreakdown. The main DLC to play is a nice idea in theory but rapidly becomes boring. All that changed are the zombies slowly level up as you go. I cant believe theres 100 levels of breakdown, My personal best is 6, then i get bored and play something else. With no variation in levels you always start a level, loot the army bases looking for the rare guns, then build up which ever base is your favourite. Theres no side missions or random events to keep the levels fresh, its just a rinse and repeat affair. The only thing that keeps you going is the hope you stumfble along a new weapon, but its not really enough to base a game around.\n\nAll in all its a game that shows lots of promise but gets let down by a few massive issues that just sap the fun from the game.\n\n","January 19","false","76.3"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","0"

I had 50 hours on the previous version and I have logged 5 hours of what was supposed to be a really awesome SOD weekend for me.  There are a few perks to buying this game:\n-The graphics are an improvement.\n-There are a few bonuses for buying the YOSE edition.\n-The game is based on one of my favorite games for the PC.\n\nThe problems that will make me not recommend this game:\n-There are buggy zombies that appear to morph between/on top of/and around walls.\n-I have had to restart my computer 15 times in the five hours that I have played!\n-I have followed every direction on the dev's forum, on their own website, and on recommendation pages that I found on Google, and the longest I have been able to play without a restart is 30 minutes!\n\nWhen I bought the original version of SOD I lived with the glitches because they, at worst, caused the game to crash and there was a fairly forgiving autosave, but this is ridiculous!  This project seems not to have addressed the most infuriating aspect of the original game.  How am I supposed to enjoy a game when I have to reset my PC every 20 minutes?  Then I get the joy of finding that one of the developer's solutions is to reduce the resolution of my monitor to 1280X720!  If one of the selling points of this patch was the resolution upgrade, why wasn't it taken into account that PC gamers would have high quality monitors?  Overall I will say that I am having a great time with this game, and if the dev offers a substantial update to help with stability issues, I will change my review, but I can't recommend that anyone buys this game without taking into consideration that you will have moments of mad fury when you are driving back to your home base and your screen suddenly jerks to a stop... try to remember where you were at your last autosave, because your truck (that was probably full of supplies) is probably still all the way out there.\n\nFor me, I will not play this game again until a patch comes through.

I DO NOT PLAY ANY console games so I had NO idea that this game was originally developed for that market. I think that in the description of the game it should be stated that the game is a port from crap consoles and it shows. I do not understand, do devs not play PC games? Do they not know what standard PC control scheme is? Or do they not simply care? This game is a perfect example that there needs to be a return policy, period.  Anyway, this game has promise but unless you enjoy finger gymnastics (since you cannot reconfigure control) I would stay away from it. Also the camera control and aiming sucks, no level progress indicators, and did I say 1080p i.e. 1920 x 1080 resolution is all you get in this “HD” remaster…and forget about NVidia surround or AMD eyefinity…THIS IS A BED PORT ABSOLUTELY NOT optimized for PC land, it has “consolelides” all over it . Just maybe if it was on sale for $10 I would recommend but as it stands it needs a BIG patch to make it PC worthy title, sucks wasted $30.","April 28, 2015","false","3.3"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","43","63","3","0"

I have it on my 360 and I loved it and thought "Hey, base game, tad better graphics, all the dlc, and some extra vehicles. What could go wrong? Now I do like this game but whether it is just mine or all of the copies in general, I suffer from awkward controls with this game. I kind of awkwardly navigate my way through the menu trying to figure out what key does what.\n\nDo not get me wrong, I love this game but compared to what I found on the xbox, it's not quite there. I think this game needs a bit more work because in the screens it has in the corners "LB" and "RB". I realize, that might just be there for controllers, but why must they be there when there are no controllers present? I mean, it took me a few seconds to figure out what tab was and that I can't use my mouse on the main menu. All these things, though minor agitated me.\n\nI enjoy state of decay, and right now I am redownloading it because I love this game. How ever with these few pestering features I see no reason to really buy this. On top of that, the games creators, undead labs, has removed, to my knowledge, state of decay, the original one from the store. This agitates me and it really bothers me. I really do suggest others play this game, but not for $32.99 CAD. This is a poor excuse for an updated version and I think that if you are going to purchase it, don't get this version. Try your best to find the base version because hopefully you won't suffer those pestering mess of controls.\n\n5/10","August 11, 2015","false","1.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

The "upgrades" are minimal and not worth what they ask for. Hate may be a strong word, but this game fell way short of what if could of been, and the enjoyment is broken up frequently by bugs and other short comings, like the horrible seemingly forgotten ending of the campaign. There are a lot of other things that seem to have been left out or forgotten that could've helped the game a lot. The bugs are very very noticeable and plenty. Probably noticeable due to that fact that it has some great potential. All the old bugs are still there and now some new ones with this "upgraded" version. As much fun as it is, and I do keep playing it a lot, I just can't bring myself to recommend it to others. Save your money especially if you already have the original. Hopefully the developers read these reviews and see that there is a lot of interest in this game and will make an all new one that doesn't fall so short like these ones have.","May 13, 2015","false","32.7"," 41 of 60 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","41","60","3","0"

I spent many hours helping with bug reports and testing in the last version to try and fix many of the glaring issues. Re-releasing the game in order to get these fixes is garbage. I accept that the updates in this new version could not simply be applied, but should the original not still be patched?

This review will be updated as I play more of it, yes despite this being a negative review I will be playing more of it.\n\nSo, how do I feel after playing the 'beautifully remastered' version of one of my favourite games? Rather disheartened and more than a little disappointed. Even within just over 30 minutes of gameplay I can see that not much has changed and by no means is this remastered.\n\nIf you already own the previous version then keep playing that. This so far offers not much in the way of improvement never mind anything new in the way of gameplay.\n\nWhat I will say is that the trees look so much smoother and lighting is simply amazing compared to the original. Most textures are that bit smoother but where it really starts to fall apart is the people. I don't know if they look worse or if it is because the background looks better that the flaws/faults of their rather... clunky features just seems to shine through. Oh and for those who have played the previous version remember what a delight it was to have zombies clipping halfway through walls/windows and such? Yep. Still happening.\n\nI realise I do not have that much time in this game but as somebody who has put in close to 100 hours into the original game and owns the DLCs for the original after half an hour I just feel rather disappointed and wished to warn those who have the game, do not pick this version of the game!

It has an interesting take and decent game mechanics. The game itself hits the zombie killing itch really well. There are some glitches here and there, but nothing I found to be game breaking. However, I've pretty much called it quits over one flaw. It randomly crashes. Not even gracefully. When it crashes randomly from what appears to be some graphical coding issue it gets trapped at a black screen. It is in full screen so it gets annoying trying to break it loose and kill the process. Not very difficult, but it really tries my patience. On principle I'm going to not recommend this game. Code hygiene is a basic. I understand crashing in mod-able games like with the TES series since things are more malleable by design. Even if a game has a crashing glitch it should at least redeem itself by way of a graceful CTD, and provide a crash dump to aid in troubleshooting.","May 5, 2015","false","42.6"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","31","44","3","0"

You might think that a Remaster, the so-called "perfect version" of this game would have less bugs or at least not add any new ones, right? Wrong. This version is BUGGIER than the original! I've seen zombies phase through walls like they are ghosts, zombie spawning seems off especially with regards to the specials (why the heck are there 3 ♥♥♥♥ING BIG UN'S spawning right next to each other on a street?) mission starts are off, its slower, I have to put the graphics to the lowest setting just to have a BARELY PLAYABLE experience.

I cannot in good conscience not do so. You see, I came late to the party, and so bypassed the controversy that followed the release of this 'Year One Edition', which includes the dlcs Breakdown and Lifeline.\n\nIf you have not played State of Decay, then pay no attention to SOME of the reviews for this game, they are very much biased and tainted by that controversy that happened long ago which you can read more about in one of the other reviews I am sure.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. It is very close to the type of zombie-game I was looking for for many years. An actionpacked 3rd person game, much in the style of some earlier 'GTAs', with a focus on base- and resource management.\n\nGather your group of survivors,  recruit new people, complete missions and interact with other survivor-groups. Scavenge for resources to use in upgrading and protecting your base and people; or move your entire base elsewhere on the map! All in a semi-open world yours to explore. Just be careful! Cars may break down, and if you get caught alone during the night by a horde be prepared to run!\n\nA word about the dlc Lifeline. To some extent, I found this campaign to almost more enjoyable than the base game. Maybe it was just the setting, which is more urban and city-like in Flatline. The mechanics are the same, although you cannot move your base around in Flatline. This doesnt matter, as the base you start with has a lot of potential and is scene to some great defensive action. Call in snipers and air support as you try to defend your base of operations when the hordes get alerted to your presence, before gathering up your most experienced soldiers and go on a supply run, or try to rescue VIPs.\n\nAlso. State of Decay has permadeath for your survivors, and actions may have consequences. Be prepared to deal with it!\n\nI experienced no bugs, crashes or any other technical issues worth mentioning with the game as of early 2016.

Stutters and fps drops are consistent.\nI have waited months for some sort of noticable performance update or simply some better GFX settings beyond Low, Medium, High, and Maximum settings. But nothing.\n\nThis is the first game that I am actually considering trying to request a refund for. Compared to other games I play, there is just no excuse for this from State of Decay. If I can put countless hours into ports made by Ubisoft than Undead Labs and Microsoft Studios should be able to make something remotely playable.\n\nAnd this whole rant was without even mentioning the fact that this version of the game holds nearly any difference to the original. The gameplay changes and visual improvements were incredibly minor. The greatest improvements were the integration of items and facilities between game modes/DLC. Something that should have been done originally from the contents release.\n\nI've resorted to playing the original game again. Albeit with some spite.\n\n","February 24","false","5.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","24","33","2","1"

So, I deleted my previous review and wrote a new and more general one instead, mainly for those who are not yet familiar with State of Decay at all.\nEDIT: The DLCs are still available for the original version, but the main game is not.\n\nIn my opinion, this is quite an underrated game in general, and to me the best zombie game I have purchased so far. I can't say that I'm a huge fan of the genre and have tried even nearly them all, but I have seen my share of gameplay for quite a few of them. Anyway, I feel that the user review aggregate doesn't do State of Decay itself as a game any justice, because of the controversy the YOSE edition caused with it's pricing weighed against it's added content which many felt was next to nonexistent.\n\nFirst of all, I really like the combat system that actually has more depth to it than at first meets the eye. The variety of different melee and ranged weapons and the personal skills and abilities of different individuals make many different character builds viable and add to the replay value. The range of weapons is nicely complemented by the crafting possibilities of different explosive and incendiary weapons for horde control. Not to mention the use of different vehicles not only as a means of transport, but also as a quick and relatively safe way of  thinning out the densest ranks of zombies.\n\nYet the most compelling point to me is the importance of scavenging and resource management, which with different home base upgrades adds a strategic aspect to the game. Where to build your outposts, what resources to stack and how to best put them to use are questions you have to constantly ponder to best suit your preferred way of surviving. Chance also plays a role here as the composition of your group of survivors, their traits and proficiencies have an effect on which may be the most beneficial way to go on each playthrough.\n\nI highly recommend this one to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of thinking and planning in addition of the merciless slaughter of the undead.","January 16","true","125.0"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","41","65","3","0"

Nothing like taking a pipe and whailing on an undead until your arm is tired.\n\nThat being said this game is horrible in every other regard. Asside from being dull as dish water its basically GTA/SR style games with zombies as cops. Seems fine except zombies spawn out of nowhere in an unending flood. You never feel a sense of accomplishment when you clear a building and 10 new ones spawn outside and come running in that werent anywhere nearby before. Houses seem to be zombie magnets, stay ouside in the fresh air and open fields where they cant get you. Clearly these where gamers before they died.\n\nQuesting is broken as can be often completely removing a side quest if a main one or new side decides to showup. Toggling the map to search for it turns up nothing.\n\nAI is broken, while at times humorous, very annoying. God forbid you want to make a quick getaway while your partner tries to make up his mind what door he wants to get into deciding to take a leasurely stroll into the drivers side bumper for a few minutes while zombies run up, bend him over the hood and introduce him to prison ♥♥♥♥. This is not a rare bug, this will happen almost any time they approach the front side of the vehicle you get into. Dont forget you can flip a car just by hitting a small bump cause the physics are garbage. Or you know. Decide outside the base is a great idea during a zombie seige.\n\nZombies will often glich out when climbing and shooting them has a good possibility of them just teleporting to the otherside for quick easy access to your yummy delicious flesh.\n\nAI are stupid in the matter of guard towers, they dont use them even though they are avaliable. When they are an actual designated structure they often leave them unmanned because they are "tired" and no one takes their place. Not that someone with a shotgun is any good at hitting anything further than the base of the tower anyways. Might as well be shooting cottonballs out of a shotgun if you're  further than shoving it down a zombie's throat.\n\nMost item durability is a joke. Zombie hoard? Get in a car and run them over cause your generic tools wont last the fight, firing a gun is a waste of time cause it just generates more zombie spawns.\n\nMy mind is still boggled how a small tri town of maybe 1000 residence can have so many zombies.

(Mind you, Steam counts is off)\nIf you've never played a game, I would reccomend because State of Decay is unique because its like GTA (Graphics & Realism-ish) & Saint Row (Sprint + Melee) with Survival/Zombies/Post-Apocalypse, but blocks your grind...wait for updates.\n\nNote\nI do not hate this game (cause Coder/Prog/Art worke hard and I got tired of RE (Expect ReRev1 & Raid Mode) taking down corps who destroy population, and the rest of the world is left unscathed hence Why I came up with Perishing Rain/RE Extinction Movie A Game)...read credits and want to know who is the director?), I in fact nearly cried when I realize it wasn't what I excepted and had to refund the first time.\n\nInventory & Items\n- Small inventory, Vehicle Trunks have less/equal/more slots than/to Large/Small Backpack (Happy for No weight limit in Cars/Trucks)\n===Runout of slots faster than weight and a limited to Stacking Items (Marcus can Stack 4 Chips w/Large Bag & Maya stacks 3 Chips w/Large Bag...WHY???)\n===Large Backpack has 2 slots more than Small & you can't drop items, you can only destroy, no Equipment screen so equipment takes up slots (Could add 2 Slots (Simple) more or a Tab (Advance, Check Discussions for my Idea) for Equipment and you can't store items in places you found them\n- Being Overcumbered here is better than Skyrim, can Run, can't Sprinting, but cars are plenty\n- Party Members can't take stuff, weapons or items/unless I befriend them...... Bag Has few more slots than Minecraft's Quickslots)...4 Slots Without Bag, +4 Slots with Small and +2 with Large (Rugsack don't Add Slots)\n===And if you find another Bag -not referring to rucksack- its not like you put stuff in it, drop it, store it somewhere, carry it or have/escort someone else as they carry it\n===When you equip, nothing really happens unless the bag is bigger or too small\n- Food should be eaten on a daily basis (GTA San Andreas w/MGS Peace Walker Rating System) while Meds should only be used for injury\n===Food should restore back small health w/high Stamina and be easier to gather\n===Meds should restore health at high rate/stamina at low rate, but hard to find -Not just hard in amount, but say Zombies in Hospital like how you have it\n===Needed to Mod in order to get Stats on Weapons and items too so you don't know how good something is and I don't know if you can dual weapons (Most likely Can't) and auto-switch when they break (Also I discovered there is Workshop for Cars)\n\nDriving is Awesome\n++ Happy you can drive (Fallout 3 & 4 don't have vehicles unless you mod), have storage (Only accessible from outside, but Journal/Inventory is accessible from inside), get dragged out of vehicle if door is gone (Love that), scrape zombies of vehicle by running into/besides things or suddenly stopping (Koodos for that), you can drive & drift like a wheelman/vin diesel with the brake and if the vehicle flips over or explodes you go automatically flying out the vehicle (Cause technically everytime a car flips over in GTA I exit, so thumbs up on that)\n- Can Door Attack (So Can Ai), but can't shoot or hit with weapons from vehicle (At least Aim from Car in 1stPS or 3rdPS and Party covers Blind spots, Front Passenger Covers Right/225 DEGs & In a Pickup a Back Passenger can cover all/360)\n- (*After Reading Update* after Refunding, so *ignore the following*) *I don't know if they have User defined customization/Re-enforcing/upgrading/repairing*/cleaning (Add Mesh to Windows, Grill Guards/Shovel/Different Exit=Roof, Clean Blood off, Repair, Gas up/Siphon/AddGas, etc)*\n===I tried to park into a Workshop and nothing happen, must have not fullfill something/update*, but I was kind of hoping Mechanic would be a Skill that a Survivor has and you could ask for repair and they would send you to find parts...That Extra Locker Slot for Quest Items?...Focus on Skills Please, Wrench Double as Weapons/Tool\n===This could be fun when trying to start a car/battery while zombie surround, but hey so is going to the workshop\n\nDLCs (*Unsure)\n- DLCs are Spinoffs (1.99 Stories) with slight differences/advantages (Wish DLCs where in Base)\n===Lifeline gives you lots of guns -cause your the army- but *no commanding/tell a person where to stand*, ===Breakdown has a bunch (~20) characters you can play from...I wonder if I meet them all in each storyline\n\nHow Saving Works\n- Saves only when missions done.\n- In an open world -miles away from destination-, that leans to Linear World more than Resident Evil 1 (If being realistic is fun, then I wouldn't be able to Mario & Luigi on a zombie's head...takedown moves)\n===Can't switch characters mid mission and your character gets tired as time goes on (And you can't sleep in a bed either...there isn't enough for you)\n\nWhat are Ai/NPC like\n- Couldn't command Ai...even down to Ed (First Guy your with...save his life)...feels like another game where I'm doing everything and everyone does nothing or help fight (Skyrim had a good/lite system for Commands, Hold Interact > Point at Targets: Floor=Wait There, Chair=Sit There, Item=Pick up Item and Enemies=Attack That, well leave where waiting to Attack,)...could instead Wait Mode > Command > Gambits (FF12)\n- I'm the one barricading (cabins & church...mission too), moving stuff from vehicle to vehicle & couldn't tell Ai where to stand to wait...some teamwork when fighting a horde and were all hiting the same zombie...No excuses you had space for 4 Emotional Actions, Throws Arms up*...What are you waiting for?\n- No Far warning when Ai is tired (Just run home)\n\nFrom Cabin To Church\n- Got to Church, unloaded stuff (5 meds I found at a warehouse w/car) and notice an Influence system (Like Currency, very good system, but can't make mistakes), Meds only have 5 Influence and I found that strange cause firecrackers & molotovs where equal and weapons had more...should have Market Stock Exchange System=What you need is worth more (I suggested already)\n- So I went to my jampacked SUV Yukon during First time Tour around Church and got MISSION FAILED/Romance???...came back and found out they badly needed Meds...that system is so linear, I know there is a mission with my name on it saying I have to go somewhere and find meds and bring it back (HAHAHAHA there was predictable)\n- Yeah meds are needed, but the weapons are worth more *Update Type-Med Rucksack/MedCase is what they want\n\nCabin People (I found out there is no swimming or maybe lake is blocked)\n- I wonder if I store more meds/Rucksack would they (Cabin People) still be alive? Cause if we had to go to Church -can't command AI- who can drive in a car and fool (Thinking of Saints Row 3 hence why I kept Interacting in and out of SUV while nearby another car in Decay)\n\nOnly reason I rebought the game after refunding it cause I heard of SoD2 rumor, possible Mods**, found I can overlap some keys and I sounded very arrogant...I wonder if its going to be Deja Vu (Already Seen) the same way I hoped for when I heard of SoD:YOSE for Xbox1 in Metro Newspaper (Too early for Mods**)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWould refunded again (might not happen cause Steam Admins...Update* I did and it went through), reccomended if this is your first game.","November 22, 2015","false","2.3"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","40","67","3","16"

There are a lot of cars everywhere but all their trunks are empty.\nThere is no really any goal. You are being spammed with very repetitive missions (kill zombie/rescue survivors/clear location/scout area/collect resources). Within a few hours of gameplay you have the largest available base with all buildings constructed.\nExcept a few buildings' upgrades there are no upgrades in game. You cannot add weapon/armor to your car or craft and attach a scope to your weapon. You can attach silencers to weapons which are destroyed after 10/30/50 shots. You cannot detach silencer or replace is with a new one.\nThe world is small and easily accessible. One of the first missions is to drive to the other end of map which takes only a few minutes. Cars don't have fuel. They can blow up if you drive over zombies too much.\nPoor choice of items. Melee weapons, range weapons, usables (medications and grenades) and that's it. There are no armors and an assault rifle takes same space in the inventory as 3 grenades. There are two types of backpacks giving you either 8 or 10 slots for items.\nWeapons statistics are not shown. For melee weapons you have absolutely nothing other than it's cost. For range weapons there are a few icons but without any descriptions you have no idea what they mean.\nAI of your fellow survivors is very poor. They will not attack zombie if it is rushing at them until it hits them. They often get stuck in buildings or are unable to get in cars. You may be just being killed by two zombies and they will be standing a few meters away and watching.\nNo save/load. Game saves automatically and if you die the character is gone, you can still play as another character though. I did not really enjoy having to copy save files.\nThe game is not prepared for multi-screen setups. It blacks out non primary screens. If you minimize it, it switches from fullscreen to window and there is no setting to switch it back. You have to search on forums for a magic alt+enter combination to bring it back to fullscreen, and this combination is not even in the controls. There is no borderless windowed mode.","September 19, 2015","false","10.1"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","1"

To play it with fewer glitches, a few new moves, and a few new cars was completely worth the $20 (for a previous owner) cost of admission. However, I regret it now. It refuses to play properly on my system no matter how I tweek the resolution and other graph settings. It chugs and sticks and isn't even as smooth as the first edition. For me, it's been unplayable.  From the start, at the ranger station, I lost voices before Ed was attacked. There were times when I couldn't gather the duffle of supplies.\n\nThere were some other changes to expect that were not present previously, and they that are debatable changes. There are many more zombies. It is difficult to accomplish missions because of the additional hordes. Driving a car creates zombie pride day every moment. They swarm at the sound of a vehicle. Stealth walking is the only way to travel in peace. Infestations are much bigger.\n\nThey could have fixed the glitches. They could have added just a little new dialog and a few new voices. They could have made it playable without the chugs and lack of control from the frame rate slow downs (Saving Maya a gruesome death stating right next to a car door). Instead, they took my $20 and gave me an unplayable game.\n\nThanks Undead Labs.\n\n","May 4, 2015","false","7.9"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","27","44","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sil23912/recommended/329430/","sil23912","S Y P H O N F i L T E R","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sil23912/","96 products in account","I felt compelled to write this review after my experience discovering this game, reading the reviews and the backstory of it, deciding not to buy it, coming back, deciding to bite the bullet and buy it, and my thoughts on playing it so far.\n\nFirst of all I do think it\'s a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing that the developers did, making their earliest diehard supporters purchase the entire game again and going as far as to disable the old version of the game. I think that\'s a really sheisty move and makes no sense. It\'d be one thing to release this version here and ask for everyone to pay again, but forcing fans of the game to buy it again is really not cool at all. Because of this I almost did not buy the game. I hope they learned their lesson and don\'t try to pull a move like this again, they\'re lucky it didn\'t get more press coverage too because it could\'ve buried this game.\n\n\nNow on to the review. I\'m not as much of a zombie games fan as I am an open-world game fiend. I love any and all open world games, and that\'s how I came across this one. It looked like a more fine-tuned, less minecraft-ish version of 7 Days to Die, and I watched some videos on it and thought it looked cool.\n\nSo I purchase the game and start playing. First of all, the resolutions are weird. You may not be able play in your own native resolution, you just have a choice of different ones to play in, unfortunately for my 2560x1440 (27 inch) monitor, I was ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, as the game skips from 1690* all the way up to something like 3820*.\n\nI understand that the game was just remastered to 1080p so I figure whatever.\n\nStart up the game.\n\nI find myself in a camp with my friend. I bash the ♥♥♥♥ out of some zombies, free us up, head for a cabin to meet someone etc. bash more zombies, check around for supplies. It seems a little bit simple so far.\n\nBut then it started to click. The sun was going down and everything had a warm orange glow like a summer sunset should look like. I was cruising with my friend to the place we were headed, it was a long country road that had gas stations and agricultural warehouses etc. I would pull up to these, hop out of my car, go inside and collect the resources. My backpack could not fit everything -- the game is not like Skyrim where your character can practically carry a room full of stuff on his person. Instead, you have to either carry what you can, or find a vehicle and use it as your \'mule\' you can load up the trunk with items.\n\nSo I\'m loading up my car as the sun is going down and I was like hmm this is cool. This feels kind of real. It feels immersive, despite the arcade-action hack and slash bash em up mechanics, theres something very immersive about the game, you can get lost in it if you use your imagination.\n\nFinally my car is packed up and I head to the base I\'ve been told to go to. I get there and I\'m greeted by the voice on the CB radio but it\'s her in person. The sun is just about fully set as I\'m having a tense conversation with the leader of the new base. I\'m walking from my car into the base, making a few trips to unload all the supplies into the base\'s main supply hub (which sort of works as an auto-sorter and you get \'influence\' which is like currency for withdrawing from the supply closet or building/fixing addons for your base in return)\n\nThat\'s when I was hooked. It felt so real, like that feeling you get when you make a long road trip and you get to your family member or friends home in the night time, unpacking the trunk of the car as you\'re catching up with them. The dusk was a pretty shade of orange-ish gray and it really caught my eye.\n\nThe night set. I decided hey, this is the zombie apocalypse there\'s no time for sleeping.\n\nSO I opened the gate of the base and set out into the village. I kept myself crouched and moved ultra slow. You don\'t want to horse around in this game, if your character dies, they die FOREVER. They\'re GONE. You can go back and get their supplies but all of the leveling up and skills and everything you build up is washed away for good. This makes the game SO much better and more immersive IMO. You really don\'t want to lose a character. I was moving so slow, peering around corners of buildings.\n\nThe villages are set up very nicely, yards are yards, the houses are a good distance from each other and everything looks and is laid out in a nice fashion to where it looks exactly like some of the little rural villages that are outside of my city around here. They did a nice job on all of that.\n\nThere are some minor clipping bugs. The zombies can get stuck in corners or your character can, and that can be pretty annoying. The save function is a little strange too, it just seems to save on its own from time to time or after some type of event. Sometimes I\'m not sure when it\'s saved or not.\n\nHint: It WILL NOT SAVE THE GAME if you are on a mission.\n\nHint #2: OPENING YOUR MAP OR INVENTORY DOES NOT PAUSE THE GAME! I learned that the hard way. RIP Paul.\n\nThe DLC expansions come free with the game. I haven\'t gotten far into Lifeline DLC yet but it\'s an urban setting and you\'re in the military so you start off in a military base and you\'re loaded to the teeth with weaponry and gear.\n\nThe Breakdown setting is one I\'ve really been having fun with. It\'s basically the same sort of gist as the regular game but there\'s no set storyline, it\'s an infinite sandbox where things keep popping up that you can do, you need to keep getting supplies and upgrading, and the zombie population that\'s lurking around the city and the hordes that start to gather and patrol the areas just keep getting stronger in numbers.\n\nOverall, it\'s not the most perfect game ever but I am having a ton of fun in it. I really think it\'s worth the $30. It\'s an enjoyable experience with 3 different modes and tons of replayability with the infinite sandbox mode. I have one game going where I am dead center in the bigger town in the south, right in the ♥♥♥♥, and then I have one game going where I\'m in the center of the map in the vast expansive rural farm region, a nice farmhosue and I hop in my pickup truck to make runs in the morning and pull back in at night. It\'s a cool game.","May 31","true","39.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I cannot change the review because I no longer own the game (had it refunded/removed). If the bugs have been resolved, great, but my review will remain the same, just remember it's out of date so take it with a pinch of salt.\n\nI don't often leave reviews. If I do it's either a) the game is fantastic beyond words or b) the game is so awful that people need to be warned to stay away.\n\nThis is nothing but a cash grab, and not even a remotely good one at that.\n\nI can't comment on the game itself, because I've not played it. I've not played it because I can't face playing it due to the many pre-game play bugs I've already encountered within the first 5 minutes of loading, which are ruining it for me.\n\nIt's 2015. Yet this 'remastered' 'game' is worse than the original - wow!\n\nI have a brilliant computer, which far exceeds the top end specs for this game. My monitor is not great, it gives off a lot of glare because of the material the screen is made from. Therefore I use a 7 year old matt-effect monitor, made from a similar material to the screens of the paperwhite Kindles, resulting in next to no glare or migraines.\n\nThis 'remastered' game looks no different to the original, despite my graphics card being 3 times better than the machine I had when I played the original release. The 1440 x 900 resolution I use for every other game I have (and without issue), isn't supported by this game. Yes it's in the list of resolutions, but if you actually choose 1440 x 900, you're greeted to lines around the screen (no fullscreen), about 1.5 inches of the game screen not being viewable, going off the right side of the screen, and the task bar constantly shows up and superimposes over the 'not fullscreen fullscreen.' Pressing alt+return to force 'fullscreen' works, until randomly your taskbar superimposes over the top.\n\nI'm a little OCD, so I can't play a game with 1.5-2 inches of the gameplay off the side of the visible monitor. Games shouldn't be released like this in 2015. I've tried all of the staff suggestions and none of them have provided a satisfactory screen/resolution or fixed the 1440 x 900 issue, which they haven't even agreed is a bug yet.\n\nMultiple complaints on their forums about resolutions and they release a bug fix patch neglecting the resolutions issues.\n\nFor almost a month people complained about resolution incompatibilities and nothing was done. Poor service.\n\nAvoid until they a) fix the many bugs and b) offer some additional content. The 'remastered' features are not, I repeat not, worth buying this for.\n\nI no longer own the game, removed/refunded.","May 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","24","42","3","6"

I bought this to confirm the quality of this release. I got my answer along with regrets....\n\nI really hope there was a NEUTRAL RECOMMENDATION for this, because this is one of the best game I've ever played and I would like to recommend it BUT at the same time would NOT recommend it. As the owner of the original for PC, I decided to NOT RECOMMEND it just to balance out the GOOD/BAD reviews here as well to justify that releasing this in its state right now FOR PC is a bad move, shame on you Microsoft. There were already many reviews here that can clearly tell what to expect from this "thing", so I'll just summarize this base on this stated fact:\n\n\nI RECOMMEND:\nIt's fun, no doubt about that, especially to new players to this series.\n\nI DON'T RECOMMEND:\nOriginal version with bugs + minor patch without bugs removal, like putting thin makeup to cover the pimples on your face, is what the returning players should expect from this, IF they return. Also did I mention they have the original bugs in it as well plus they upgraded the bugs, because who doesn't love bugs?\n\n\nTo NEW PLAYER:\nGet it if you like survival zombie genres especially when it's on sale or IF they've fixed the game-breaking bugs.\n\nTo ORIGINAL OWNER:\nGet it on your own judgement, they probably gonna sell extra patch DLC or something to at least cover it later, or maybe use the funds to make YEAR-TWO SURVIVAL EDITION instead....\n\n\n.... in terms of gameplay, here's my old review for the original NOT-REMASTERED SURVIVAL EDITION of this, since it's hardly any different: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008168929/recommended/241540/\n\n\nP/S: In all serious note, please give some more love for the PC version this time around.

Never had this issue, one or two dead, ok, but everytime they were atleast " Missing in action " or part of an rescue mission. NEVER EVER was my base wiped out. Not in base game, not In YOSE Edition//DLC's\n\n" I can't even PLay it, it needs DX11 " Well, this is bad. But not really the fault of the Game, is it?\n\n" Not worth the money cause.... Its just bad " Most of this reviews got  a playtime under 5, most under 2 Hours. The Game is heavily grindy at the start.Kind of... Especially the Storymission slows you down if you are ahead/ want a new Base and have to go throught the neccessary Missions. That sucks, ok. But it doesn't make the game bad.\n\nStory Mode :\nYou and your Buddy were camping as hell breaks loose. Youll fight your way down to an old church were Survivors hiding, and the fun starts. Almost every charactoer is kind of unique, and storymissions can have alternative Dialoges, perhaps outcomes with different characters. Hell Even sidecharacters from other survivor hideouts have Sideplots, if your lucky to stumble over them. Gunplay is way better then in the original, you can Unpack ammo crates for Ammunition, and the new CLEO missions are Pretty good. Atleast the loot can be awesome, unique weapons and stuff.\n\nBreakdown:\nStory mission without story. You fight your wayy throught hordes of Zeds, which get stronger with every run you make. As you go higher in the stakes, you can unlock more characters throught Challenges, there are fewer cars and more " Hero"-Zeds. The Unique, Bad-**** I kill you in one swipe ones xD. Screamers, and sorts. Can't remember the names, sorry^^\n\nLifeline\nbasically another story-DLC. Shorter, but nice enought to play throught.\n\nOverall, with its crafting, basebuilding and managing this game is awesome. i bought it for...20? or 15 bucks, cause i had the previous SOD when it launches, but haven't had the dlc's. So it was a hell of a deal.\nIs it worth the 30 bucks ?

Hatte es damals als es rauskam für 15 oder 20 euro bekommen da ich die alte version auch habe. Ansich hat mich das spiel noch nie enttäuscht, das Gameplay ist gut, steuerung vll bissle hakelig, aber durchweg ein Geiles Spiel mit den verschiedenen Basepositionen, Räumen die man bauen und aufwerten kann und das Managen der Überlebenden macht das spiel eigentlich extrem laune.\nUnd Breakdown, quasi der survivalmodus ist auch richtig hart. Man hat eben auch nur begrenzte ressourcen. Irgendwann ist alles aufgebraucht, man muss also immer wieder fortschreiten im schwierigkeitsgrad,\n\nwenn es im sale ist, definitive Kaufempfehlung. Wenn nicht muss man eben für sich entscheiden ob man das geld ausgeben möchte oder nicht. ein schlechtes Spiel ist das auf gar keinen fall!","May 30","true","82.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","2"

As someone who has been playing SoD since launch day (on the Xbox 360) I can honestly say that this version is perfectly acceptable. Its not a massive upgrade over the original version, but there are some marked improvements. Ive noticed next to no bugs not present in the original, and my only issue with starting it up is I had to go into properties and add "-fullscreen" to make it fullscreen.\n\nState of Decay has never been perfectly polished, its janky and funky looking and its physics are strange and kinda broken. But it does what it sets out to do in a way few other games can match, and compared to my experiences playing the 360 version on day one, this is a huge upgrade. If you are looking for a open world zombie survival game thats a bit more serious than dead rising, but not nearly as hardcore and unforgiving as DayZ, that has more of a focus on surviving as a group than as a individual, look no further.","June 14, 2015","true","25.4"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","27","49","2","0"

After that you be wondering how this amazing game got so lost.\n\nLets start with the good:\n-Graphics are well done, buildings and houses and car mechanics all great.\n-It's a sandbox game and has base building.\n-Game controls are fairly easy to use and generally work well.\n-"Zombies" are realistic and can have a slight jump factor.\n\nCONS:\n-Gets old fast.\n-you will constantly be having to go out and rescue people that wander off your base or be forced to settle disputes within your people almost constanty.\n-You can never have more than one person with you at a time except for very limited "quest" circumstances.\n-Resources are not infinite and neither are cars "although they can be fixed".\n-"Special Zombies" can be tough at times.. you come out of a house and haven't saved in awhile and one of the huge zombies kills you.. well you're dead and that's it.  You just lost that person that you could have had since day one and was your best player.\n-WHEN YOU LOG OUT THE GAME KEEPS PLAYING... so when you log back in some people could be gone or heaven forbid dead and your resources will be gone just about.  The longer you are logged out for the worse it is.\n-Story is hardly worth bothering with.. it's mundane at best.\n\nHow this game should be:\n-Open world sandbox.\n-Single player good story.\n-YOU pick the teams that go out and scavenge for food and tell them where and when to go.\n-Make parties bigger than just a small group of 2.\n-get rid of all the annoying distress signals "your people only leave the base if you tell them to"\n-Need more materials in more places so you can play longer.\n-Have more freedom on basebuilding and job assignments.\n\nDo I think you wil enjoy this game? Sure but there is no way I can recommend this game for 30$ wait till it is 75% off before you even think about it.  I wanted to love this game.. sad.. really dissapointed stupid distress signals.. completely ruin the game.","February 21","false","27.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","13","22","4","0"

I can say that I can't fully reccommend this game. This being a follow-up to the original game, it basically upgrades itself in terms of graphics, and gives you the DLC in the full game. But what is wrong with this game is the amount of bugs it has and the same problems I mentioned in the linked review above. Now the game is still good, don't get me wrong, but the bugs just ruin it sadly. I would say buy the original version, but it seems you cannot do so anymore.\n\nDon't let this review (or any other review) skew your judgement on this game.

What was supposed to be, in the developer's own words the "definitive edition" of State of Decay manages to be worse than the original. I could tell the original SOD was unoptimized, having to play it on medium settings on a beast PC just to maintain 60+ FPS at all times. (And this is for a game designed from the ground up for the 9 year old X-Box 360) Well YOSE is far worse in that respect. YOSE has a terrible stuttering/frame drop problem that occurs regularly even on the lowest graphic setting. In a game with unforgiving perma-death of characters you have spent hundreds of hours to build and level, it is unacceptable to loose a character just because a long heavy stutter skip made you die in the middle of intense combat. Also the game just feels like it will crash if you bump into your PC lol. What I mean, if you bring up the steam overlay, minimise the game, someone on skype calls you while your in-game, doing almost anything in the background will cause the game to crash. I have found that even if you manage you unminimise the game by some miracle, the performance will be bad until you close and reopen the game.\nAll the old glitches from the original SOD I remember are still here, including the ones that glitch your save file, requiring you to start over.\nI admit is was pretty cool to see higher resolution versions of all the old art assets as I was able to see and read things on signs and posters that I never could in the past.\n\nOverall I find the original version of SOD to be better overall. Performance is way better, has better load times, and I'd rather not have the gimmicks of YOSE that do not add anything to the experience. I'd rather keep my 60FPS gameplay with minimal stutter over higher res textures, non stop stuttering, and having to exit completely out of the game in order to respond to a Steam message. Also the flashlight has no purpose anymore in YOSE as every playable character magically emits light from their body.","May 25, 2015","false","11.2"," 38 of 72 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","38","72","0","6"

At the last sale I finally got myself to buying it. From what I had read during this long period of time, I had very high expectations. State of Decay managed to excel them.\n\nI have played for 11 hours until now and I have thoroughly enjoyed them. I wouldn't say this is the definitive zombie game but yet it is the best one I have ever played (it was my first zombie game ever xD).\n\nThe core gameplay is real fun. You stroll around a pretty big map and try to survive somehow: you collect food/materials, you upgrade your home base, you make sure your crew stays motivated. Later on you even fight against various diseases who kill you almost instantly. Overall, it's very satisfying. Although it feels a lot like babysitting the dumb AI at the beginning, you learn to appreciate that the game always keeps you busy.\n\nNevertheless, there are a few negative aspects which affect your experience badly.\n1. Glitches. Be it zombies under floors/zombies in walls or backpacks also under the floor.\n2, Lack of personalisation. You basically stay forever with the basic appearance survivors have by default.\n3. The ridiculous real-time-feature. I mean srsly, bros at Undead Labs?? All types of materials you can collect in this game decrease daily. Which means you would have to play more or less everyday in order to provide yourself and your crew a functioning home base. This isn't motivational, it is f*****g annoying and also f*****g ridiculous!\n\nI can't play everyday and so I decided to leave Story Mode alone and try the endless "Lifeline"-mode. I'll probably come back to the story someday, but I just don't understand the reason they built in this feature.\n\nSummarized, I hope there will be a sequel at some time, but please people, please don't let it have this ridiculous feature I mentioned above. I'm looking forward to playing DayZ.\n\n7/10\nGood Game, but incomplete and with some strange design decisions","February 18","true","21.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

However if you have not got the original get this.\nThe game is fun and has permadeath for the handful of characters you  can play as. You can hve more characters to play as buy making friends. The game can get repetitive as you go around trying to keep food sleep and supplies and morals high. But the story is not bad, the gameplay is fun, and the soundtrack is good!

Firstly, the actual entire reason I bought the YOSE version after having bought and played the standard version is that you can have the Munition shops now make ammunition in both the base game as well as breakdown.  This alone makes a significant difference in the gameplay experience, if you are one of those who enjoying going through all the levels of Breakdown.  It makes skilling your survivors out in guns skills actually worth it, which is something I wanted desparately from the start.  However, this REALLY should have been a free update rather than a whole new buy.  This fact alone makes this a hard pill to swallow and has made me question if I would buy anything from this company again.\n\nGraphics are much improved, however stuttering is still a big problem, mainly when driving around at high speeds.  This is particularly noticable in Lifeline as there is a lot of smoke and fire effects with most of the map being highway full of burning wrecks.  You need to have a beefy system, quite a bit more than even the minimum specs as it doesn't appear to be well optimized for PC (surprise surprise).  Even with an 8 core with 24 gigs of RAM and various Gforce 900 series cards, I still get significant framerate drops while driving around.  However, it is still impressive given there are no loading screens for the quite large open map.\n\nStill, it looks nicer that the standard edition, but runs worse.\n\nAs I said, you can now craft ammunition in breakdown and the base game, which is a game changer (for me anyway).  You can make snacks and coffee in the kitchen now as well.  A few more vehicles have been added like the Army truck from Lifeline is now available in Breakdown, as well as the ability to repair your vehicles in Lifeline, which is nice, not having to just ditch the Army trucks when they start smoking anymore.\n\nFor me, most of the bugs from the old version have been cleared up, but some new different bugs have been introduced which can be just as annoying.  No more driving at full speed and then for no reason the physics engine decides it wants you to visit the moon, and launches you  500 feet into the air.  Your survivor then automatically bails out of the car mid flight, and you get to watch as one of your best survivors plummets to their death with nothing you can do but watch in utter horror.  Now however, doors/gates seem to offer very little benefit  with stopping zombies, since about 50-75% of the time, they just walk right through them, which can make things particularly frustrating (and deadly) in Lifeline sieges.\n\nSo all in all you get a cleaner interface, some animation changes (blades skill animation has been tweeked slightly), better graphics, a few (very nice) guns, some olds bugs replaced by new bugs, the ability to craft ammo, snacks, and coffee, and some new survivors (Lifeline characters have been added to Breakdown).  If you own the standard game, and none of the things mentioned interest you, then I'd say give this one a pass.  If you don't own the standard copy and like zombie games, then I would absolutely recommend you get this version.","July 2, 2015","true","134.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","10","21","3","0"

I originally played the game in 2014 on my Xbox 360 and had hours to spend on it. I decided to buy the PC version when a new version of State of Decay was released, but the original version was taken off steam. I'm going to be reviewing the actual game itself, if you want to know the difference between this remaster or the original, then these are the differences. The game has been remastered, so that just means better graphics, less bugs and problems and more smooth gameplay, and the game has ticked all those boxes. But the most notable difference is that this version contains all the DLCs for free. If you have already got the original State of Decay on your PC, then I do not reccommed you buy this. Unless you want the DLCs and improvments to the original and you're willing to pay £23 or around $30 for this, just stick with the original.\n\nOnto the actual game itself, you start off at a fishing lake getting attacked by zombies or as they though it was 'a cannibal family picnic'. You end up at a police building where you meet some other survivors. You and your friend, 'Ed' search houses and find a woman who's friends were killed. Eventually you make it out of the mountains and into a town where you meet a girld called 'Lilly' who you met on a radio. After that, you have your own free will to do whatever you feel. The story is slightly bare as the cutscenes are just as advanced as the camera system you have when you're still playing. But the gameplay is what makes State of Decay so good.\n\nNo other game is like State of Decay, it's a bit like  a mix of GTAV, DayZ and Telltale's The Walking Dead. If that appeals to you, you will love this. As the game is open world, you can go anywhere in the Trumbull county. There are several towns to explore and lots of long countryside roads, but you will spendf most of your time inside the town your base is in and looting it. There are some vehicals to drive which you will probably blow up in 10 minutes and attract a load of zombies and there are tons of buildings to loot. But knowing where to start is up to you. This game makes you make choises by your own instinct.\n\nCombat is very well designed when your attacked by zombies. You wack them with a mele weapon or just beat them to death. One zombie is easy, even ith no weapons and low stamina, you could take one on and not lose any health, but when your attacked by a dozen, it gets hard. You will automitically lock onto the zombie your facing and repeatedly smash it until it's head breaks. But when another zombie attacks you from behind, it will jump on you forcing you to try and shake it off. One thing to know is that this game is slightly over the top with gore. You can sneak up on a zombie and kill it by grabbing onto the head and smashing it on the the floor. Not to mention this game has some finshing moves that look badass. In terms of weapons, you have a lot but only really two types of mele weapons. If your using things like hammers, hatchets, cricket bats, you do quick slashes on zombies that take about five hits. But if you use big sledgehammers or an axe then you will do big swings at the zombies taking only three hits, but more time. This is simular to Skyrim with one and two handed weapons.\n\nIn terms of guns, they nail this too. You will often be scrounging for weapons, and you may come across a gun shop or police department, in that case, bingo! Because guns are very useful in some cases, in some missions you will have to protect NPCs from zombies by barricading houses and attacking the zombies. Often you are left with no choice but to shoot some, especially some of the 'freak' zombies. When you scavenge for ammo, you will not find a lot, making every shot count. You can get many guns, pistols, rifels, assult rifels, shotguns, even grenade launchers (not common).\n\nAI is alright, the zombies aren't meant to be Einstein so they are pretty easy to sneak past when you are crouching. But when your trying to survive the apocalypes, you may make a lot of noise, and this noise willcertainly attract zombies. Shooting, driving, running, jumping, fighting, scavenging will lure zombies towards you, which can be difficult because you will be doing a lot of the previously listed activities. This is also useful when you need to make a distraction, using firecrackers will make lots of noise, attracting zombies in the area so you can get past or loot. The actual zombies come in many forms, some are stronger than others but the strongest are the 'freaks'. These zombies are much more tough or deadly, especially juggernauts. These are huge zombies with look like they have mixed DNA with a bear and tank, these are incredibly hard to kill.\n\nYour community is controlled by you and your influence. Influence is kind of a 'symbolic currency' in your community which you can use to spend on different things. You can ask to find supplies or make outposts where you can store supplies or make facilities in your base, the concept is very useful. You earn influence by doing missions such as saving people, finding people, finding supplies, killing 'freaks', looting houses, talking to people and other activities. Your community also needs to feel safe, so that means you need lots of supplies and not a lot of zombies in your town, and no infestations. These are a sort of nest for zombies where they live and eat and if you don't clear infestations, your community may slowly fall apart.\n\nYou can find new members to join your community to help you survive, but this also means another mouth to feed, and supplies are rare once you have scavenged most of them. Your map shows the whole of Trumbull county and has crosses on the houses you have already scavenged. So sooner or later you will need to find a way to escape Trumbull county by following the main missions which lead to an alright story, what you would expect off a zombie survival game. I personaly had no problem with the ending, but I know many found it dissapointig. But this is a spoiler free review so I will not say anything else.\n\nThere are several vehicals to drive, but as I previously mentioned they tend to be about as safe as petrol and fire. Some vehicals are big and protected with a lot of space to store supllies and some are small and fast with little protection. One thing to note is that youi can change your character to go on house raids or when your character dies you can change to another member of your community, and then find the supplies of your last character. This game also has a very nice soundtrack along with very nice graphics. I remember the first time I tried to go on a scavenge in State of Decay was at night and I was too worried to fight the zombies in case it attracted more. So I was just sneaking from bush to bush, hiding from the zombies, along with the beautiful soundtrack.\n\nBut like most games, I do still have my fair froblems with the game. First, you don't really feel any connection to the other members of your community, when another member joins, it just means less space but more help. The only characters I ever really cared for were Marcus (the character you start with), Lilly, Ed (your friend at the beggining) and Maya (another early character you meet). And the game is slightly buggy. It doesn't feel very polished at times, but this is easily passable by the fun gameplay itself.\n\nOverall, if your looking for a zombie survival game that isn't just buggy multiplayer or the slaughter of millions of zombies, I can't reccommend this to you enough. Despite the lack of polish this game has, you will get hours of fun from it.\n9/10 Not a masterpiece, but real damn close!","April 1","true","3.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It has an open world feel in a town setting which helps immensely in making the town feel real. It was a surreal feeling as i was starting to learn the roads and ways to get back home recognising signs and houses as i drove by them while mowing down zombie hordes.\n\nCars really make a difference making missions play out faster and a little safer though still quite dangerous especially when your vehicle has no driver side door allowing a zombie to pull you out of your car to make a flesh dinner out of you if you dont toss em off somehow. Having a car makes mowing down zombies which have formed a horde much more easier to tackle compared to the much more terrifying on foot melee combat. You will have many different types of vehicles at your disposal which feel great to drive and have a nice collision model with some good visuals showing car damage until eventually you have to abandon it as it begins to smoke eventually catching on fire. You can though with the proper base upgrades repair vehicles before they get too banged up.\n\nOf course you can always walk it which makes things much more dangerous as you have to bring food to keep your stamina up and medicine to deal with any possible injuries while evading any large gathering of zombies as the day fades into the night. You can defend yourself with melee weapons for close up combat and guns for long range attacks. You will be limited by what you can carry especially with supply stockpiles you come across but this can be remedied by using a vehicle for supply runs which allows you to load up multiple stockpiles to take back to the base where your friends and other survivors are.\n\nGoing through houses and commercial buildings for supplies and survivors is creepy as you never know if there is just that one zombie you see slowly moving past a first floor window or if the place is infested by zombies in other parts of the house. With some stealthy movement you can scout the outside of the house looking into windows to get a possible idea of what awaits inside. That is unless a zombie sneaks up behind you as you struggle with it attracting the zombies in the house. Next thing you know the stealthy silence is shattered by an explosion of zombie moans and growls raging with crazed cannibalistic hunger for your warm raw flesh.\n\nGathering supplies is needed to build your base and upgrade it over time allowing it to have more survivors living there while better dealing with the psychotic murderous zombies roaming the country side. Gathering supplies which are used daily, completing missions, bringing new survivors, keeping things peaceful between fellow survivors, cooking a nice big meal, brewing up a pot of delicious hot coffee among many other things helps to keep morale up at your home base. You will also gain influence points and fame which allows you to choose better equipment from the supply store and influence others to help you.\n\nYou will be playing more then one character as you do missions you will become tired over time and need to rest. This is when another survivor can be asked to take the place of your current character out on the field while they rest up. As your characters grow and develop you will find yourself getting attached to them. When my characters died i was surprised just how it effected me and actually missed them afterwards feeling the loss along with people back at the base talking about their death.\n\nThey also died in some incredibly blood thirsty gruesome ways which shocked even a gore hound such as myself. It felt strangely sad as another survivor i was playing came across my previous now dead character's backpack full of supplies as they picked it up to take back to base.\n\nThe excellent journal log keeps tracks of all these events and effect it has on everyone. It is also used to give orders for things like base upgrades, seeing what quests are available and things like how other survivors are getting along with each other and the morale of the base.\n\nWeapons and vehicles can be repaired when the proper base upgrades are built. This is usually over night so it pays to use more then one type while the other is being repaired.\n\nMusic is done very well setting the tone of a once normal world transformed into a unbelievable living nightmare which blends well with the home town family surroundings all around you constantly assaulting your mind with contrasting atrocities of flesh eating zombies feasting on the living.\n\nGraphics are interesting in the fact that they are not the greatest yet get the point across like a sledgehammer as you are suddenly witnessed to a brutal death and even more shockingly so if its your own.\n\nSTATE OF DECAY: YOSE Day One Edition if i could call it one thing it would be the perfect George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD simulator capturing a normal if not blissful country setting where unbelievable horror is occuring.","October 19, 2015","true","18.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The other two modes, Lifeline and Breakdown are the main meat of this game. The campaign is great for the first playthrough.  I really like the story. But after that, there is really no point in replaying it other than exploring one or two alternate consequences for your decisions which is nothing major. The main ending will still be the same.\n\nOdd stuff:\n\n*Characters have rpg type elements added to them like shooting skills and melee skills, and also stealth skills. Some of these skills takes a long time to develop and seems out of place for a game where you can't control whether the character will meet their death(causes like depression, sickness, or getting killed by other chars).\n\n*Some bugs like zombies occupying the same space as a fence or a wall(common) and at times can walk through doors(uncommon) have not been fixed since the very first version of this game.\n\nOverall I'd still recommend this game as the good experience I've had with it is far more than the few annoyance with it.","March 11","true","307.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

If you think its a bad game because of them, you need to reconsider. The game is very good in itself, ive played nearly 200 hours of it for the xbox 360. Most of the negative reviews are only from people who are dissapointed that it is not too different from the original. The new version of the game includes new vehicles, survivors, missions, and a pretty nice graphics remake. While this doesnt add up to be TOO much content, its enough to keep the game fresh. Even in its own, the game does not get boring easily. Plus, the fact that it comes with both of the DLC for the game justs the price. Its kind of dissapointing when I see people hating against the game as a whole because the update wasnt that impactful, and they dont even realize that the price comes with the DLC included. If you have never played the game before, and like zombie games, I highly reccomend that you try it out. I got the game for 360, played 200 hours, and decided to buy it again for the PC.","March 27","true","66.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

After 10+ hours of playing the game I decided to make a review.\n\nThe game starts you off in a post apocalyptic world where you can do anything you want, whenever you want. After the first 5 hours you will notice that the morale missions are the most repetitive and boring part of he game, they come about every 29 minutes and the game will be effected if you do not do them. Theses "morale missions" also have he same script so don't expect any variety with them. Other than that you will have a blast with this game. The searching and horde mechanics add soo much adrenaline and stress, making you plan out every move. At the start your main weapon will be your car but after a while you will move into all types of weapons.\n\nThe base building aspect of the game is one of its strongest, you can decide to build all sorts of structures. If you are a fan of AMC's The Walking Dead you Will without a doubt love this game. From a parental view I would rate this game for 14+. It's very bloody and gory and uses many curse words but it's stuff they hear at school.\n\nBlood and gore 10/10\nStory 7/10\nBase building 10/10\nSearching and scavenging 10/10\nMissions 8/10 not including morale missions\nGraphics 5/10 Definitly not its strong point\nOptimization 3/10 Lots of frame rate issues\n\nOverall it's a solid 8/10 must have\n\nI plan on putting many more hours in this game","December 24, 2015","true","22.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Sure the companions in this game are not the most useful but they do help. One companion could be the diffirence between you getting a lot of resources and a zombie ripping your face off. Vehicles are super useful especially since 1. they can kill zombies really easily, 2. they can carry supplies in the trunk, and 3. there are a lot of them. Also i'll tell you right off the bat that this is a "year edition". Year editions like for example "game of the year editions" aren't remastered versions. Year editions are just the original game but with a little bit better graphics and all the DLC but at a lower price. Your not going to get incredibly better graphics with this edition just a little bit better. If your looking for a single-player version of games like Day-Z or H1Z1 then this game is for you.

They are angry at this being practically a "Game of the year" copy, where all of the DLC and updates are included. Seriously, read some of them, they're pretty salty over nothing. As for the complaints about graphics, perhaps they just need to upgrade their hardware, because I've ran into very few stutters as some have claimed. You do see a little flickering on some distant images, but its really not bad at all. This game is absolutely fantastic, ranking well into my top 10 favorite games of all time; and that says a lot considering how many fantastic titles I've played in my lifetime. This game really makes you put in the effort to keep everyone alive and satisfied, without feeling grueling and overbearing. I waited until i put in over 10 hours before deciding to make this review, just in case it was an easily beat, or at the very least quick to beat kind of game.

They are angry at this being practically a "Game of the year" copy, where all of the DLC and updates are included. Seriously, read some of them, they're pretty salty over nothing. As for the complaints about graphics, perhaps they just need to upgrade their hardware, because I've ran into very few stutters as some have claimed. You do see a little flickering on some distant images, but its really not bad at all. This game is absolutely fantastic, ranking well into my top 10 favorite games of all time; and that says a lot considering how many fantastic titles I've played in my lifetime. This game really makes you put in the effort to keep everyone alive and satisfied, without feeling grueling and overbearing. I waited until i put in over 10 hours before deciding to make this review, just in case it was an easily beat, or at the very least quick to beat kind of game.

Sure the companions in this game are not the most useful but they do help. One companion could be the diffirence between you getting a lot of resources and a zombie ripping your face off. Vehicles are super useful especially since 1. they can kill zombies really easily, 2. they can carry supplies in the trunk, and 3. there are a lot of them. Also i'll tell you right off the bat that this is a "year edition". Year editions like for example "game of the year editions" aren't remastered versions. Year editions are just the original game but with a little bit better graphics and all the DLC but at a lower price. Your not going to get incredibly better graphics with this edition just a little bit better. If your looking for a single-player version of games like Day-Z or H1Z1 then this game is for you. So to sum it all up.\n\n1. not many problems.\n2. companions are useful.\n3. vehicles are super useful.\n4. a little bit better graphics.\n5. all DLC.\n6. decent combat.\n7. pretty good survival aspect.\n8. decently interesting story and characters.","February 10","true","15.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Lots of negativity in this one but not from me.\n\nMany are pessimistic here because, indeed, this should ave been little more than a patch rather than a total new release.  So, some had to double buy.  However, that stated, this comes with the DLC of Breakdown and Lifeline that the original one had to purchase them seperately.  Here shows, once more, waiting for that right time to buy, instead of getting immediately at release, can be a good thing.  Many games have updates not patched immediately, but held until complete and packaged together wit their expansions then.\n\nOne thing, I desperately wish I could use my controller with this one.  Keyboard functions are nominal, but can take that precious second to reach that finger over that would have saved your life by rolling/sprinting away.  I only feel, using a controller I may not have had to restart so many times.  If I had a controller, the way it saves may not be so bad!  Death is perminant for every character, and between that and using the keyboard, completion of the game is possible but improbable.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, grim, dark, amazing, and terribly terrific.\n\nAudio does cut in and out at times, and is extremely important as your char gives you clues on if you can outpost yet or not a place, and radio from home base updates missions still to do/new on map.  A text caption backup at the bottom of the screen exists, but is far from full proof.\n\nOnce I loaded a relatively young game up, at the church, we had our gate per usual but the wall wasn't there.  People were running freely from the church to the parking without using the gate.  Now, this may speed up their little scavinging runs, but what if we had a horde come through just then?\n\nMy biggest dislike though is glitching through walls.  It happens pretty frequent, especially when a juggernaut does it when you're trying to pitch him fiery cocktails and not get the NPCs or yourself wasted during a besieged mission.\n\nTip, at all costs, avoid a jugger when elements would otherwise force you to face it one on one in the open.  Avoid jumping into a horde on the other side of a window to try to kill the juggie at a distance.  Just run away to fight another day.  Strategical retreats, also, are noble.  Especially when twenty something people depend on your continued existence.  You need not tell them you ran away from fighting another thirty zombies, just tell them about the seventy before that you killed over dinner.\n\nYou are the apocalypse hero, so tell your story, your way.  History remembers the words of the winner, but dead things tell no tales.  Worry not, for the zombies you ran from will not tattle on you!\n\nOkay, I've mentioned many little nuances, and few large good things.  All those nuances though remove very little from appreciation and immersion for me.  Overall out of a rating of 100, I rate this a 99.

Seems like they had an idea for a game and then took a lot of input from the usual never satisfied gamers, you know the 'wouldn't it be cool if it was co-op?' or ' let us build bases but not have to manage them' or ' I want to play as a (fill in the blank) type person'.\nBottom line it is a third person sandbox zombie survival game. No stratagy needed, no tactics and very lacking in the rpg department. Worth $30? No. Worth $10 sure.\nPros:\n\nOpen world\nVehicles\nDifferent styles of guns and melee weapons.\n\nCons:\n\nVehicles are to weak. A ♥♥♥♥♥ slimy rotton zombie is not going to total a 1/2 ton military pickup with a reinforced gated bumper. And really all I can put in it is 4 duffle bags of stuff, wish I could have told my Sgt. that in the army...lol. Oh and stop sighns and other little stuff causes severe damage to your vehicle too, and some of the zombies laugh at you cause when you come back, they put all the stuff you tore up your other car on back up.\n\nCombat is very clunky, have a zombie right in front of me, but my toon goes 5 steps away to hit a different one so that one can now get from behind. Partners are a hindrence, best to just leave them behind. They will hold one while your hitting three and get mad when you don't hit the one they are holding.\n\nVideo and graphics are typical low budget stuff. A lot of pop ins 20ft away, makes it kinda hard to drive at max speed then suddenly a broken down car pops in or a horde right in front you. Then again, the pop in happens when you're walking and running.....SMH.\n\nMenus are a very bad port job. Sometimes they glitch so bad that keyboard shortcuts are the only way to make them work, mouse is yuky to say the least. No tooltips or very vague, scroll doesn't work well at all.\n\nTutorial is basicly ' you are a survivor and zombies are everywhere, go make some friends and kill zombies.....end tutorial'\n\nBottom line, good concept but poorly executed game. DLCs are just more of the same with achievement unlockers (see listening to whining gamer input) and a quick cheap storyline for the military. Game is steril and incomplete, would hate to have seen it before the graphics update. Best thing they could do is open up the sdk and let people mod it into a good game.","March 7","false","42.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With three different playstyles; Storydriven (State of Decay), level based (State of Decay: Breakdown) where you can reset the game to reach a higher difficulty in the next level, and last but not least the Military perspective (State of Decay: Lifeline) on a City map specific for that story.\n\nThe story told as well as the game in general emphasizes the building of a community of survivors and the teamwork required. Despite it being a Single-Player game only, they succeed quite well in portraying the everyday struggle of a (albeit fictional) Zombie Apocalypse.\n\nHowever it does get repetitive, the narrative could have been expanded upon. Especially in Breakdown this becomes obvious, but if you aren't annoyed by that one issue you're free to enjoy the game on higher and higher levels of difficulty with each new level you reach. I have noticed some glitches related to the graphics, specifically the lighting and shadows which is unrelated to the game functionality and I do not know if this is a problem on my system only or a general issue with the game. It is only noticeable in the early morning hours of each 24 hr cycle so I think it's a minor issue.\n\nIn Lifeline you get all the cool Military Hardware so desired in the other two versions of the game. Based on a story where a team of soldiers find themselves isolated in a City full of Zombies, their only support being Helicopter supply drops hence the name of the title; Lifeline. Once the storyline is completed you are given the option to continue playing and save as many civilians that you can find (still alive) or end the story and the game to finalize your score.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game. It's a shame there is no Multiplayer mode, though.","December 27, 2015","true","120.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't look bad for a lower budget game so I guess the art people did do their part, but the rest of this game has too much downside.  I can't believe are still like this almost 3 years after release.\n\nTL;DR = don't buy this game but I found it so annoying after while I am dropping a text wall here.\n\nHere is a *not even complete* list of annoying crap from the base game:\n\nDumb friendly AI:\n- Ally NPCs can provide backup, unless they randomly decide to leave you.  They also tend to leave at the start of difficult fights and mission sections with no warning or easy rule for all circumstances.\n- Ally NPCs are often dumb as stones.  Sometimes during fights/sieges you have to put yourself at high risk because they are so stupid the will do nothing but continuously board up a window/etc.\n\nEngine/physics problems:\n- Characters glitch into geometry.  Zombies glitch in geometry.  Occasionally this will screw you and/or a mission hard.\n- Climbing and jumping mechanics are sometimes crap.  Characters can get stuck on seemingly trivial objects/inclines, and can climb up certain objects which for some reason they cant climb down without taking damage (ladders work, but things like rocks do not).  Also when trying to jump down some areas you will "slide" in the air causing a farther fall and damage.  Sometimes will  also slide/fall off platforms when there is no reason, or fail to attach to a ladder when climbing down from something.\n- Cars sometimes flip from almost nothing.  Once I flipped by turning ~10 degrees not even going fast.  Another time I bumped into a zombie going ~5mph in a parking lot.\n\nGarbage design choices:\n*** No way manually save/reload.  This is ridiculous in general and total garbage when trying to learn.  Something really bad happen?  Made any mistake?  Now choose between the hours or days to redo everything or carry on screwed over often due to some game glitch (loved losing the main character almost fully leveled because a horde is glitching stuck on a cliff next to a feral I can't stealth past and oh look my dumbass NPC ally left me on a mission suddenly 10x harder than any surrounding content). Why not have a noob mode/story mode and a hardcore mode (and for such a trivial developer task...)?  "Authenticity" can go to hell (and there are already so many super-unrealistic aspects of this game). I'd prefer the thing called “fun.”  This single feature would lessen or negate all other bugs and aggravations but obviously some designer thought they knew better and wasting your time was OK with them.  Unbelievably stupid and worse than anything on this list my a mile.\n- No “pause” feature while trying to read UI options or journal entries.\n- No way to turn off AFK progression.  This is especially annoying if you are essentially forced to AFK/quit for a while to rest characters.  It is also just incredibly annoying in general.  Oh look bad things happened when you went to work or tried to have a life.\n- Very little explanation of what to do in the game past the most basic mechanics.  You learn mainly by trial and error and being forced to read online resources.  See also: no save/load errors--> massive waste of time to restart.\n\nTime wasting filler design:\n- The most interesting missions are probably story lines, at least to a newer player.  Except they are hard to get to because 99% of your time ends up devoted to the massive spamming of mundane threats and trash missions for lost/angry/depressed/sick/whatever NPCs so you will waste hours running the same crap over and over until you have a window.  Or you can just do them and risk ???/deaths by ignoring other tasks.  None of them show at all how important they are, what their time limit is, what consequences might be, if they are main missions or optional (though the standard spam ones become more obvious after a wile), etc. etc. etc..\n- Zombies sometimes regenerate stupidly fast even in non-infested  areas/houses sometimes making gameplay super tedious.  Have had missions next to random houses before where new crops spawn every 2 minutes forcing you to fight endless trash mobs and making near zero progress.\n- You take forever just to search a shelf, or can do it faster at risk of opening a black hole out of which zombies pour.  It's super fun searching slowly after hundreds of times.\n- Even the healthy characters have some of the worst run/jog endurance ever making travel on foot super slow and annoying.\n- You can carry several large objects/weapons, but 3 twinkies or bottles of aspiring apparently take up the same space.\n- Searched objects don't retain highlighting so if you leave anything behind ever and want it later you have to manually hunt and peck to find storage.\n\n\nUI:\n- Controls don't handle very well and mouse aim works different than most action games which is annoying (affects move direction but not attack direction).  Attempts to aim in crowded melee combat are garbage.\n- Hard to find relevant notices/mission text in journal list of everything from gain +1 to X skill or “bob took a dump +5 influence” and “bob accidentally shot bill in the face for no reason for the second time today -1 influence.”  Plus the game basically penalizes you for any trying to read these thoroughly (see: no pausing).\n- Cant change profile names.  So the more you lose for stupid reasons and try to restart the more confusing which horked saved game is which\n- Home management UI is sometimes clunky/unclear especially mouse-over text\n\n\nSo many cool ideas here executed poorly or 3/4 done.  Waste of decent visuals/sound on at best mediocre quickly repetitive gameplay and at worst infuriatingly awful rubbish that makes you pay for any mistake (or sometimes its own glitches) to the extreme and won't even stop taking a crap on your head when you turn it off.  Game had minor interesting moments but overall has been MUCH MORE ANNOYING THAN FUN = DOWNVOTE.","February 25","false","35.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

This game is not flawless (no game is) ocassional glitches are annoying but not a deal breaker, zombie hords are constant and never ending.  Anyone in this game can die, and I mean ANYONE! my biggest pet peeve is when the zeds swarm you and you have no way to stop a character from dying.  Zombies (zeds) are way too awair of their surroundings making stealth a moot point accept in the very beginning.\n\nThe story is not very compelling but still enjoyable.\n\nGuns are helpful but tend to lead to  more zeds coming to attack you, melee is dangerous and comes with it's own shortcomings.  This game is not for the ill-tempered or easily annoyed because you will have both happen to you.\n\nStealth needed to be better, more options for building forts all would have added to the enjoyment of this game.\n\nYou end the game walk away only to come back and discover that all your safehouses have been overrun, Half the people you rescued are dead, (for no reason) and in general moral sucks. Yet when you left the game everying was on a highnote, so not having everything you have worked hard to achive suddenly fall apart while you were not playing the game would definatly been better, no would make more sense.\n\nDespite all this I have still enjoyed this game and would reccomend it with a warning, its your fault if you put you fist through your monitor.","August 15, 2015","true","38.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is not flawless (no game is) ocassional glitches are annoying but not a deal breaker, zombie hords are constant and never ending.  Anyone in this game can die, and I mean ANYONE! my biggest pet peeve is when the zeds swarm you and you have no way to stop a character from dying.  Zombies (zeds) are way too awair of their surroundings making stealth a moot point accept in the very beginning.\n\nThe story is not very compelling but still enjoyable.\n\nGuns are helpful but tend to lead to  more zeds coming to attack you, melee is dangerous and comes with it's own shortcomings.  This game is not for the ill-tempered or easily annoyed because you will have both happen to you.\n\nStealth needed to be better, more options for building forts all would have added to the enjoyment of this game.\n\nYou end the game walk away only to come back and discover that all your safehouses have been overrun, Half the people you rescued are dead, (for no reason) and in general moral sucks. Yet when you left the game everying was on a highnote, so not having everything you have worked hard to achive suddenly fall apart while you were not playing the game would definatly been better, no would make more sense.\n\nDespite all this I have still enjoyed this game and would reccomend it with a warning, its your fault if you put you fist through your monitor.","August 15, 2015","true","38.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's the other side of the zombie game coin; as opposed to FPTS (First Person Trolling Shooter) LagZ, this game focuses on the community side of the zombie apocalypse. This game is essentially Post-Apoc Tycoon, for how you have to meet the needs of your human assets while pushing off the needs of the undead trying to destroy your brothers and sisters.\n\nOn a laptop, this thing runs fairly well; it doesn't freeze up or get the blue "crashing" wheel that we all know and loathe; it is particularly frustrating playing this thing on a laptop, though, for those of you on gaming laptops. It's possible and more than capable, but it isn't advisable\n\nFor a game spawned from the Xbox LIVE Arcade Store, this one emerged the untamable king, and spread its empire onto Steam. My heart goes out to those who feel scammed by repurchasing this or whatever, but you have it, so enjoy it.","September 14, 2015","true","56.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

Oh well..\n\nState of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition despite the negativity for this game due to previous owners concerns, it is a great game to play. Purchased the game while on sale and was not disappointed at all with the overall gameplay. While playing the run-through of State of Decay Year-One, it was rather challenging but yet balanced to keep up the stamina of the characters.  The Breakdown edition is very balanced as you get to higher levels. The Lifeline edition is a great story line to follow to the end twice since you need to in order to get both achievements.\n\nWith the Breakdown and Lifeline DLC with State of Decay Year-One edition is great package.\n\nMy personal complaints are:\nLily broadcasts seems to pester a little too much at times about other tasks when you wish to secure your home site stockpiles. The way I managed to search all the buildings and it helped to level up the characters Maya and Marcus with less difficulties, is to perform those searches before entering the church at the start. After sufficiently searched and found the needed stocks, only then enter the church to continue on with the storyline.\n\nThe characters and zombies can walk on water and do not swim.\nMy personal suggestions are:\nThe pick-up trucks and SUVs should have more available room then 6 slots since they do have more space in reality to toss the duffle bags inside. Something like 10 would be reasonable.\n\nIt would have been awesome to have multiplayer sessions of the game. To have a real community together to secure resources and defenses for the home site.\n\nWould like to have seen a home site big enough to implement all the facilities that you can add for the site. It could have had a home site requirement of 20 survivors needed and 75 building materials.\n\nHaving 8 outposts is sufficient but it would have been even better if they were setup as mini-sites that you could lock in survivors into position on the roof to snipe oncoming zombies and you must maintain their stock levels in order to keep up the defenses and not just placing the standard mines for the surrounding area.\n\nEven though the game map is big; it just still seems rather small after playing for a while. Having a bigger map area would have been awesome.\n\nAs mentioned in complaints above but now noted as a suggestion here, the swimming ability. If you were to swim in the polluted waters (filled with dead zombies) you could get sick compared to swimming in clear waters.\nI could continue to add to the list but it is still a great game to play. I do hope that the developers “Undead Labs” will continue with this game and create a great series/add-ons with it with all the suggestions made from so many players listed here and their forums.\n\nAlso, thank you to so many players on Steam that created great guides to obtain the achievements, it helped a whole lot.","February 25","true","134.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't really recommend it for anyone who already has State of Decay and I'm sure much of the negativity might be in relation to that.  Since I didn't have the DLCs, this was a value to me, but if you have the two DLCs, you will want to avoid this as it doesn't add a whole lot to the experience.  I rate this as a thumbs up because it's still a good game and should be judged on it's own merits.

The game is amazing and just like the cliche, I don't write reviews ever. I bought this game when it was released on Xbox and believe it to be one of the best games. I don't know why people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about bugs when the gameplay is perfect. You need to survive build and look for supplies. you need to sleep, rest, and eat. The game can get old after awhile but it is amazing to come back to. The last DLC where you play as the army is kind of constrictive because you dont have the ption to move your base arounda nd the map is smaller. However the overall experience is amazing, I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games but can't put 4 hours in at a time to get a game going. you can play the game for hours sure, but in small doses this game kills boredom.

I am really looking forward to a new release of this style of game. Possibly a larger world with more one on one interaction between survivors. Make coversations a larger part of the game. also allow for larger communities, maybe a little customization in designs for home base. It would be really cool to pick a place and try to make a base from raw resources (time being key) where you have to defend it as you setup walls, then hope your base is strong enough to defend against what comes at it. Zombie hoards and other survivors attacking it would be interesting. giving the AI more skill in self defense and attack as well as having other survivors attack your base you could be out rolling around doing missions that are so far out it takes days to get back only to come back to everyone being dead. Also allow camps to be setup for long missions that take days your buddies that are with you could stay up in shifts... maybe some of them fall asleep and you wake up to zombies eating them... some cool features this style of game has huge potential I hope to see that capitalized on.","November 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Another open-world zombie survival game, but with interesting sanctuary building mechanics and some RPG elements added in.\nI tried this game while it was in Early Access (Steam gave me a demo) and I have wanted to buy it since then. I'm glad I didn't, since it seems the developers pulled a fast one on the Early Access testers and didn't give them the new version for free. Well, those testers claim that this is the exact same game and they don't want to buy it again. I assume they still have the 'old' (exact same) version of the game, so they really have nothing to complain about.\n\nDon't bother listening to them if you only play games for fun, because this is a fun game. 8.5/10","March 21","true","32.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.\n\nThe base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one. You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc. Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.\n\nThe base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well. Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you. Do you want to be able to support more survivors? Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low. Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies? An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed. Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.\n\nThe Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor. This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre. I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about. Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!","May 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","0"

If I could impress upon you the "why" you play games, it'd definitely make you feel like a zombie apocolypse was something you could live through... Or not... There's just so much to this game...\n\nBut here are some things you might be expecting which will dampen an otherwise fun experience...\n\n1) The graphics aren't the most amazing. They're perfect for this game, but this isn't made in the Unreal engine and it's not that type of game. It's got a lot of things to put on the screen and very few walls between them, so expect medium view distances, and lots of "adequate" graphics.\n\n2) No seriously, the graphics. This was originally an indy download game on the XBLA, so it wasn't shooting for the stars. There's a lot of short cuts, like how blocky putting up baricades can be. The graphics repeat a lot, Not every limb will fly off a zombie in a unique manner, it's just not aiming for that kind of game...\n\n3) The action isn't fast paced. It can be at times, but for the most part, you're questing in a zombie apoc world. Running errands, or looting to keep your home base in order. That's the bread and butter of the game. If you're looking for scary wall to wall thrills, you'll find this game wasn't designed for you.\n\n4) The game isn't going to tell you how to play. There's a fun leveling up system... it won't tell you how to use it. There's a neat system for maintaining your home base... it won't tell you how to use it. If you're not willing to experiment on the game a bit to figure it out, this can be frustrating.\n\n5) There are glitches. About 4-5 times through a straight play through... you're going to get something that defies physics. Whether a zombie runs through a closed door, A car gets trapped in a porch, or a feral zombie goes flying across the gap between you... I know it sucks, but for the most part, the game is very fun, and those errors won't dampen the experience much if you're ready for them.\n\n6) You're determined to not like new things... If you want a game that could be described as "Like Call of Duty with..." or "Like Resident Evil... ", then this is the wrong game. I've honestly never seen such a good blend of action and strategy. You're gonna have to come up with a plan for how your team gets by. And your second play through will be more enjoyable than your first. Honestly, I'm on my fourth, and it's the most fun yet. You have to learn what you can slack on, and what you can't put off. It's a unique experience, and that's probably its best quality.\n\nIf you keep all that in mind, and don't forget that there's mods you can pick up on Nexus and stuff, this game is great. It's one of the only games I've bought that I keep returning to play. I play it again and again. I love the DLC... I love the alternate modes. And I love the voice acting. This game can be greatly engaging... Or it can be a disappointment, depending on if you're open to what the game is, and not what you hoped it would've been instead.","April 30","true","214.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Well, it's more of the same minus the most obvious flaws, that's mainly  the weirdly behaved renderer, which seemed to render at 720p internally, then upsampled everything to whatever resolution you had chosen, doing so without any sort of filtering. So it looks a lot better now. Still no antialiasing option in the game's menus, but you can always force that from your video-card control panel.\nThe engine still isn't very good at streaming the world geometry in a fluid fashion, so the fps still drops significantly at times, slowing the gameplay down A LOT in the process, but that usually doesn't last for more than a second. Might also be a lot less noticeable on a SSD, I'll have to give that a try...\nLastly, the quests' progression will still get stuck when some random zombies forget to get into the quest area and you'll still have to either chase them down or wait for them to despawn in order for the mission continue.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say it's not exactly the facelift I was hoping for. The graphics still look sort of dated, the engine still can't handle the size of the map (I could fit the game 8 times in RAM, but the engine insists on swapping and streaming from the HDD like it's 2008), the zombie AI still gets in the way... But you know what? It's still a great survival/resource management game, probably the best in the zombie flavor: numerous quests, some generic, some unique; nice story; great character management/progression system. Plus you get all the DLCs, which are pretty good. I'd say you get a lot of game for your money... even if some small part of me still wishes it would have been released as a free update for those who already had it, because if you only sort of liked the first iteration, I'm not sure what little changed can justify buying the game a second time. Me, I had a great time with it, and I'm having an even better time with this one.\n\nTLDR: Is it worth a buy? If you like the zombie survival genre and didn't get the original game, yes. Definitely. If you already have State of Decay, you may give it a pass, unless you really liked the game or you feel the horrible upscaling-with-worst-possible-filtering engine prevented you from truely enjoying it.","June 18, 2015","true","113.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

As far as a survival simulator goes this game is so much fun. Running a group of survivors brings a lot of challenges. I find it so gratifying allocating time and effort towards different tasks such as different missions, supplies and home dillemas. The game provides enough variety in it's gameplay to keep you interested for quite a while.\n\nIt isn't all rainbows unfortunetly. For one it's a fairly low effort PC port. I'd like to see some more effort towards optimization. Traveling at high speeds in a car can (well always) provides some substantial frame rate drops. When the frame rate does stay constant you have some glaring texture pop-in to enjoy on your trip. Draw distance in this game is extremely disappointing. I'd like to see the developers use the extra PC horsepower to their benefit. Unfortunetly they've skipped that part.\n\nI would recommend this game to new commers of the game if you're looking for a zombie survival type experience. State of Decay really nails the survival parts of it. It provides plently of hours of fun despite the graphical impetence in some regards.","July 20, 2015","true","17.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fallout7/recommended/329430/","fallout7","Fa11ou7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fallout7/","126 products in account","I'll start off by saying that I got the YOSE edition during the steam summer sale and it was worth every ~$8 that I spent on it. At this point I have 38 hours into it after beating the storyline, I haven't even touched the DLC yet. The best thing about this game is the gameplay, I would compare it to Left for dead with a little bit of GTA mixed in. I'll make list of my pros and cons so you don't have to read a wall of text.\n\nPros;\n\nVery enjoyable combat\nBASE BUILDING with some tower defense mixed in\nDecent ammount of weapons\nspecial combat/finishing moves that are learned over time\nhandful of drivable vehicles\nvaried missions\nlarge selection of playable characters\nvaried and unique attributes and quirks for the characters\na few unique zombie types\nCons; I'll write a bit more on the cons after\n\nported from console came\nthe game engine does not scale well\nquirkly environment\nstupid AI\nactually looks a lot like L4D2 (could be a pro or con)\na few bugs\nno minimap interaction\ndraw distance waaaaay to short\ntraveling becomes a bit of a chore, a fast travel system of some sort would have been nice\ninventory management is also a pain\nvehicles don't feel quite right\nmenus and team/base interaction is bad\nzero character management if your not playing them\nI think a lot of the cons boil down to the fact that the game is a console port. I have a beefy gaming PC with a brand new Nvidia 970, 8Gb of ram, and an i5 @3.2 which can run most games at 60fps on the highest settings. That said I had a lot of issues of texture and environment pop in, really poor draw distance, and just overall very poorly optimized for PC. In fact I turned on Fraps to check my frames per second to find out that if Vsync is enabled it locks the fps at 30. The biggest problem that I had was when driving, when moving at a higher speed the draw distance issue was really obvious and the game itself would lag witch made it even harder to drive giving the amount of invulnerable objects that there are to dodge.\n\nThe other big issue that I started to notice after playing for a few dozen hours was how bad the menu and management system is. There is absolutely zero character management if you are not playing a given character. In a game about survival and asset management that seems like a big oversight and missed opportunity. I imagine it was partially planned that way since many of the missions revolve around helping out or rescuing the other survivors that have left the base but it would have been was more fun to designate certain characters for scavageing roles or to be able to lock more important characters to the base. Special characters actually fill roles in the base and give your base bonuses if they are manageing the kitchen, farm, etc so it sucks to have them go out. I think I logged in one day to find all my neighboring survivors had died while I was out which kind of sucked. But realisticly in my playthrough I think I only noticed one of my survivors dieing and that was because we were on a mission together and he was torn in half by a tank mob.\n\nThe last think I would mention is that there really isn't a lot of explination for the dynamics of the game. There are a lot of things happening on the map at a given time and the dispatch character will constantly be reminding you that your running out of time to take care of certain things but for the life of me I couldn't tell what the consequences of my action or inaction were.\n\nAnyway, the cons seem big but the gameplay is fun enough that you should be able to make it through the campaign without too much work. Also there are some fixes out there for for some of the problems that I pointed out, if you tweak any of your PC games then you should be able to find them. I would highly recommend picking this game up if its on sale and it is probably still worth it at full price. It certanly scratched that Left for Dead itch that I didn't know that I had.\n\np.s. - If they skinned this game with The Walking Dead and fixed some of my cons it would be the ultimate zombie game.","June 20, 2015","true","46.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

Probably nothing, but as this was one of the games that got me back into gaming after a long hiatus I have to say something.\n\nIn a gaming market saturated with zombie survival games what interested me about State of Decay was the clear George A. Romero inspiration.\n\nThe zombies are classic Romero, a slow ponderous mass of dead flesh that are all kinds of messed up, and as such they often lull the player into a false sense of security with their weak, slow movements. This is their weakness but collectively this is also their strength.\n\nIt is easy to forget than more than a handful of these creatures are much than a match for the average player and often while allowing yourself to get carried away it is easy to overstep and find yourself face to face with a zombie horde. The results of this are obvious and as you struggle fruitlessly for what seems like hours the end is inevitable.\n\nAnd it is an end.\n\nOnce a character dies they are gone for good and if you have not succeeded in bringing in new survivors the longevity of your community is in real question. This fact, coupled with the need to find recourses and protect your borders, can easily overwhelm even a well organised player; leading to ultimate destruction.\n\nThere’s a lot good about this game, but I am sad to say it also has a few negatives that grate on the player the longer they play.\n\nCharacters are almost non existent, use of dialogue is simplistic and does not allow for much variety and the result of this is that missions can become formulaic and lack interest. This is not as bad as it seems, as the open world provides a great deal of interest in itself; but greater character development would have improved my personal enjoyment a vast amount.\n\nThe worst thing about this game must be the pure stupidity of many of the character, partly this is due to the afore mentioned lack of variety but its also because the random nature of the story means that often characters take up residence in the most foolish of places.\n\nThis means that the player is sometimes frustrated by the need to protect characters who are simply too dumb to care about. On occasion prompting this particular player to wish I could put them out of their misery (or at least mine).\n\nAll this having been said, I enjoyed this game a great deal; in spite of some poor storytelling the game mechanics worked well to instil alternating moments of the habitually mundane and the fight-for-your-life terror that makes the game rather unusual. As in the Romero movies that I feel inspired the game, State of Decay is less about the living dead and more about how we react to them, the terror is not about death but about how we live.\n\nI, for one, am hoping that the poor storytelling and awful characterisations will either be fixed at some point with future updates or will disappear in a continuation of the game franchise.","June 23, 2015","true","31.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

You're pretty often running alone in sandbox or otherwise which is just unrealistic.\n\nThe map is really bare and pretty small. It gets repetitive quickly.\n\nGame looks fine and plays well. I really enjoyed most of the mechanics. Character progression could be a more in depth.\n\nThere is an influence systems which determines whether or not you can do anything outside of looting and killing zombies. This is a really LAME system. When you do convince someone to come with you it only temporary and they leave you if you start a mission.\n\nOverall the game is fine and youll enjoy a single play through perhaps more if you have the time to waste. There is a great idea hidden here in poor execution but any zombie game where it feels like you're alone doing everything is not okay. Give me more character development, more despair, more freedoms and a bigger map, and for god sake if you're going to give me a group of survivors to work with don't make them so freaking useless.\n\nBasically take the freedom and level of immersion of a game like Project Zomboid offers smash it into this game and removed a few quirky mechanics (such as influence) and you've got yourself a winner. As it is, this game has a great idea but they just didn't deliver.\n\nState of Decay\nProject Zomboid\nDayZ\n\nCombined these three games with an intelligent AI system so it seems like youre living in the zombies world then you've won it. You don't really need a storyline, but give me the freedom to create my own with.\n\nThis game SCREAMS for a coop or multiplayer mode. It really feels empty most of the time.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the storyline isnt horrible and you'll get your moneys worth if you like GTA sytle games + zombies. The breakdown DLC is neat but really sort of time consuming and repetitive, the lifeline dlc is meh.","August 8, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

I never played the original State of Decay, so this game is all new to me and I am loving it. I did run into one bug while playing the game, I kept crashing when trying to run one particular mission, but I ended up going back later in the game and finishing that line just fine. I bought the Breakdown DLC along with the game and I have to say, this DLC is what really makes the game worth playing. The stand alone game is really just a warm up to the challenges you face as you level through Breakdown. The stand alone game was good, just not challenging enough, so I really recommend learning the game there and then continuing through Breakdown. I have yet to try the Lifeline DLC, although it looks to be an interesting change to the story as well.","May 8, 2015","true","694.7"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

This isn't a sequel.  This isn't much more than a GOTY version, in fact.\n\nThe graphics are noticeably better than the original version of this game.  The gameplay seems a bit better (game is a little harder than I remember, but that could be my own perception being off).\n\nThat all said, I had the first version, but had never purchased the DLC for it.  If you already had all of the DLC, this purchase might be hard to justify at full price.  For me, not having played any of the DLC, along with the minor improvements made, this was a solid purchase.","June 2, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LjBlader/recommended/329430/","LjBlader","LjBlade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LjBlader/","139 products in account","First off, I ask that anyone who agrees with my review or likes it, please up vote it to help combat the people who're posting negative reviews and downvoting positive reviews to give the game a bad reputation for reasons that have nothing to do with Gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy Zombie Survival Immersion, State of Decay is the game for you.\nState of Decay is a Zombie Survival game that focuses on community building and management rather than pure Zombie Apocalypse Horror. You will have a group of survivors and a Home that you must defend and manage. You have to scavenge for resources such as Food, Medicine, Ammo Caches, Construction Materials, and Fuel. But you have to decide, "am I going to be quiet and take my time searching, or am I going to search really quickly and risk alerting every Zombie in the area that I'm in this house!", believe me, this can lead to many quick and painful deaths, which is only amplified by the fact that this game uses a perma-death system. If you die, then that survivor is dead, they aren't coming back. If you have more survivors back at home, then you can continue playing as one of them, but you won't be bringing back that dead survivor in any way.\nState of Decay is much more of a casual game that you can sit back and enjoy your Zombie Apocalypse with a few heart pumping moments like when you run out of stamina in the middle of a fight you can't run from.\n\nI personally enjoy this game because it has a higher level of immersion than most Zombie Survival games these days. The fact that it is free-roam while maintaining a linear progression so as to keep you moving, only adds to my enjoyment.\nThe survivors have their own quirky little comments that can give you a giggle or even a facepalm moment for how much a survivors comment can annoy the hell out of you. It brings to life the fact that each survivor really has their own personality and brings something new to the community.\nBeware, vehicles can and WILL be damaged to the point of explosion. And if that happens, RUN FOREST, RUN! Because that particular big bang, will bring the hordes running for a free happy meal.\n\nIn the main campaign, you start off up north in the woods, I like to call it Camping Central or Ranger Town. You're rather clueless as to what's happening because you've been outside of news broadcasts and such while out camping. You then proceed to the Ranger Station and things start to become clearer as you go, you will meet new people, and have to decide how to work with them. I'm trying to avoid too much info to avoid spoilers. After you get through the basic intro, you will be at a church with your group of survivors. You must protect them, the church and scavenge for supplies. After some time, it becomes your responsibility to move to a safer location, and eventually, leave the town to complete the campaign.\n\nIn the Breakdown DLC, you're in the same town/map as in the main campaign. Only with a bit more freedom as the main campaign missions have been removed. You start in the middle of nowhere and get given the choice on how to proceed, you can start a new community as a single survivor, or you can join one of three communities that are available from the get go. Items no longer respawn in buildings once you've scavenged them (not like they do in the main campaign). And this time when you leave town, you start all over again, so be prepared for it. Because each level of Breakdown, while there's a better chance for better loot, will also increase the spawn rate of Zombies and Special Zombies. Making it harder as you go along. Giving you more replayability to scratch your Zombie Survival Simulator itch.\n\nIn Lifeline, you take on the role of a group of soldiers that are trying to recover a means to combat the virus (very Resident Evil like if you ask me). You will be on a new map made up mostly of highways to get you around the map faster due to the lengthy distance for each objective. This DLC is rather fun to play once you've put a bit of time into the main Campaign and Breakdown DLC, it gives you some variety and new storyline and characters to follow.\n\nEach character in this game has their own personality, this has only been improved upon with the Year One Survival Edition.\nWhat YOSE has brought to the table is some old bug fixes for this GOTY-like release plus many other improvements such as:\n29 new melee weapons\n29 new firearms\nCleo Military Supply Drop Missions\n55 vehicles (34 in original breakdown/lifeline)\n8,275 new audio lines\n30 minutes new music\n\nThis is not to mention the higher resolution availability for YOSE compared to the Original SoD.\n\nBut the bottom line is, if you're looking for a full blown, balls-to-the-wall action game, State of Decay isn't what you're looking for. I suggest you go and play Killing Floor (Killing Floor 2 is now released as Early Access) or something similar.","May 4, 2015","true","21.3"," 20 of 48 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","20","48","3","0"

Deaths are always a tragedy since characters can be extremely valuable to your survival depending on how you upgrade them and building a base that can defend against the zombies is another fun task.

Don't see the issue really. This game clearly still has the same bugs since I've encounterd them. And they got the old version which I had rather had, since this one takes a lot more from my computer's performance so I do have lag at times. But really, it's not like Square Enix is gonna give me the Final Fantasy VII remake for free either cause I bought the original FFVII back then. Guess people always gotta Q.Q about something.\n\nAnyway, the bad reviews have nothing to do with the gameplay itself. The game itself is great. After playing through both Walking Dead games from Telltale, I was looking for something similar. Not just a brainless zombie shooting FPS game. Something with a story to it. This game, has that. I can definitely see it take place in the same universe as The Walking Dead, which to me is great.\n\nYou also have to make choices in this game that could lead to good or bad things, find other survivors, team up, people will die, you may have to relocate again, etc.etc. I haven't gotten too far in the game yet, but so far I am really enjoying it. If you like zombie survivals games with a story to it, or The Walking Dead games from Telltale then I think this one's right up your alley!","April 18","true","4.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The crafting and upgrades you can do to your safe house is increadable. this game is the first zombie game that i have played that actually has consecuenses to dying, the zombies actually post a threat and when you come across a horde it is quite challenging and sometimes sadening when your character dies because they dont respawn, you just play as another character. Everything you do in this game has cocequences which can be good or bad. This is the closest to a realistic zombie survival game i have every played.

The game throws a x amount of missions at the player at roughly the same time.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThe gameplay is good, really good and addictive but it ha it's rough edges.\n\nThe game starts with introducing the settlement mechaninc a settlement is a place where the survivors that you found live. For them to be able to live, they need food, medication and a place to sleep. Food and medication is able be found within the world itself, while you need to build a place for your survivors to sleep. Each settlement has it's own selected areas where you can choice what you want to build. If you want to have a survivor with you, well you gonna want to do a lot of side missions so you can rise your morale in your settlement, a low morale will make people leave your settlement.\n\nLooting is a big mechanic in the game, you do it like 80% of the time. It works but it's kinda weird. For some reason rushing a looting process makes more sound than shooting a zombie with a shotgun.\n\nThe "fighting" mechanic works more or less. Shooting feels good but actually fighting feels awkward most of the time.\nYou need to earn fame before you can take a weapon from your settlemet, yes you can find a gun and ammo in the world itself.\n\nMusic: 7/10\nIt's nothing special, but it's quite impressive when you can hear a gun shot in the distance.\n\nAI: 5/10\n\nThis is the "best" thing in the game. If I could earn steam money for every time where an AI used their gun instead of melee a zombie. Sometimes they shoot when a zombie is not aggresive, and making them and every zombie within 20 feet aggresive on you.\n\nTotal score: 7/10\nIt might seem like I'm hating on the game, and in a way that's true. The game is really good, but it has it's rough edges. I'm on a "mission" to find the perfect survival game and this game is on the top three on my list. It's funny and challenging at the same time. It could have been so much better if they had fixed some of the things that have told you about in this review.","June 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

For the people who have played the original and want to know what was polished in this edition, here are the definitive improvements I have noticed so far (in addition to the more obvious changes that were made):\n\n-  Ferals are nearly impossible to hit with a car.  They have some very responsive reflexes, leaping multiple times to dodge a moving vehicle and they will jump over your car if you kick it into reverse (so no cheesy brake kills in YOSE).\n\n- Characters you've spent Influence on so they will tag along no longer run back to base when they get tired or injured, and they will continue to help out even if you take on a mission while out.  Previously, a lot of missions immediately forced them to run back to base.  I have run several missions and wiped out half a dozen infestations without my companion heading home.\n\nEdit:  A friend of mine says his follower just ran off after accepting a Scavenger mission, so there may still be some missions that auto-kick the companion.  So sad.  Did some testing of my own and found that companions tend to leave when doing missions for survivor enclaves (scavenge, beseiged, etc.) but stick around during missions for your own community.  I have run several Ally in Trouble, Missing Survivor, Zed Hunt and 'needs a talking to' missions without my companion bailing.  Hope this elaboration helps.\n\n- Juggernauts seem to have less health than before.  I continued my game on BD11 and managed to take one out with less than a clip of .22 bullets to the cranium.  To counter that however, there seem to be more of them out there (at least on higher BD levels) and I had to take out 3 of them on my first Ally in Trouble mission.\n\n- Less Bloaters.  They were everywhere in the original on higher BD levels and they seem to have had a significant population reduction.  The number of Ferals and Jugs though seem to be higher than before.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd for some of the annoyances that still exist:\n\n- Zombies still clipping through walls.  I can see their heads but I just wasted a couple shots trying to hit them even though they are on my side of the fence.\n\n- Still getting stuck on sidewalks.\n\n- Fighting on hills can still be hazardous to your health.\n\n- Still having some trouble getting companions to get in the damn car.  Just have to drive back and forth here and there.  There does seem to be a semi-fix added to YOSE where a companion who is running in place due to bad pathing will try an alternate route after a handful of seconds and get in the car.  This is only if they are already in motion (doing the running man on the corner of the car).  A companion who is standing still will continue to do so until you can trigger a new response by moving the car a bit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all.  I still enjoy this game a lot and I hope they address some of the bugs that have existed from SOD's inception.  But for what it is, I still gave a thumbs up because those glitches were annoying, but not nearly as bad as the completely broken companion AI.  If you were a fan of the game and can look past those glitches, YOSE is still a lot of fun to play.\n\nI did have some issues with framerate, but I modified my settings to Maximum Graphics @ 1280x720 and it has become a hell of a lot smoother.  The draw distance isn't the best, but it's still a lot better than the original and the combat is much more fluid, the combat animations look much better and I love the improved variety of vehicles.\n\nNote:  I am set up in the Fairgrounds on my BD11 group so I have not experienced the returning Snyder's Trucking Watchtower problem yet, but from what I have read, it still continues to plague that home site.\n\nEdit:  I have decided to start over from BD1 on a new profile and will update this review as I progress through the breakdown levels again.","April 28, 2015","true","400.3"," 30 of 71 people (42%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","42","30","71","6","0"

Well, tried most of the old version at least. I downloaded the crack a month ago and I realized that the game was rigged, or in other words, has an anti-piracy gig were zombies attack you in multiple hordes every single minute. Yeah, it has like Hell. I totally regret my decision. So, I wanted to buy it, so I waited and waited. Until this version came along. What impressed me is that it has all the DLC's and includes more characters, vehicles, and extra weapons. All that for only 30$? Heck yeah! This game is awesome, even though I am a console dude. It is a must get if you are a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series with Gameplay like the Dead Rising series. And remember, instead of buying the old one for 30$, you can get this one with everything for the same price. Holla!

The game is solid.\n- If you own the original SoD, this is just a minor update. Read below to find out what changed, and decide based on those and the current price tag.\n- Shortly after release, there are bugs. New ones. I trust they will be fixed soon.\n\nReviewThere are many negative reviews from people who actually like this game, just expected something more from this new release of their old favorite. To them: please remember that Steam users might decide on purchasing the game based on your reviews. Your review should be about the game, not the maker's way doing business. This game is solid. Some say this is the best single-player zombie apocalypse survival game in the Steam market. I agree with them.\n\nSoD:YOSE won't bring much for the owners of the original game though. These new features are:\n- High-res menu items and icons\n- Better lighting\n- One new car type (SUV)\n- Varied car paintings\n- One new hero\n- Many cool new weapons\n- Some new combat moves\n- Some new textures and 3D models (don't expect a lot!)\n- You can re-case ammo in the original campaign and 'Breakdown' too, not just in 'Lifeline'\n- You can find and use the military vehicle from 'Lifeline' in the original campaign and 'Breakdown' too\n- Some new bugs, hopefully to be fixed soon (nothing game breaking to me)\n\nAbout the game:\n\nSoD is a third person open-world zombie apocalypse survival game, unfortunately only single-player, where you can manage a small survivor community, build and upgrade base structures, and research new items for your ongoing combat against an unlimited zombie horde. The game has perma-death, some RPG elements, a wide variety of weapons and you can use the environment to fight the hordes too.\n\nThe main campaign provides a mediocre story with a good atmosphere, and introduces you to the gameplay.\n\n'Breakdown' is a sandbox version of the main story - you play on the same map, without the storyline. You start in a random location, find and join a community, and then take on its management. When all resources were used up, or you are just bored, there is a broken RV you can fix and use to take a few key members of your community to another area. It will be the same map, with all resources respawned randomly, where you will start in a random point (from your broken down RV) and have to build up everything again. As you repeat the previous steps, the horde gets stronger and stronger, and you will receive new, stronger survivors to reinforce your team. This is my favorite game mode.\n\n'Lifeline' takes place on a new map, is more military-oriented and as such provides a different experience. It is a mixture of the previous two: there is some story, but you can decide to stay and continue saving people at an increased difficulty - with a global leaderboard.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n- If you don't own the original, but like what you have read here, definitely.\n- If you own the original and like it, maybe. You won't get much extra, so decide based on what I wrote earlier. Or wait for a sale.","May 4, 2015","true","54.7"," 24 of 59 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","24","59","4","2"

For the vet players who own the original SOD and are debating about buying this one, think about if the new additions are worth the price tag to you. The game itself is basicly the same except with a few tweaks, visual improvements, new characters in breakdown and some of the breakdown challenges changed.\n\nFor new players:\nState of Decay is a sandboxish zombie survival RPG. You switch between different survivors that have their own perks and personalities and try to gather supplies to help your group survive. There are lots of different weapons to use and there is a small RPGlike skill system. For example, if you spec a survivor in using blunt weapons then when that skill levels up enough you can pick 1 of 2 attacks for the survivor to learn. With firearms depending on what type the survivor specs in you can get better firerate, longer distance lockons, etc. The game also features perma-death so if your survivor dies, they are gone for good which adds a bit of tension when your trying to escape a horde or dealing with one of the "freaks".\n\nThere are 3 modes in the game that you can play and they are:\n\nStorymode:\nThe one you want to start with as it explains how you play the game. You follow the story of 3 survivors and without any spoilers, basicly work on surviving and expanding your base as you help other survivors out and start learning about whats going on in the world.\n\nBreakdown:\nThe main survival part of the game. You start out with a random survivor, pick an enclave group to join, then get to work surviving. The main goal is to find an RV and fix it up. Once you do that you pick which survivors you want to take with you to the next level and repeat. With each level resources become more scarce and zombies become more populated. There are also challenges that when you complete them, unlock hero characters which have their own special perks and bonuses. Theres a small escort quest to bring them to your base and from then on if you restart breakdown you can then choose that hero to start with instead of a random survivor.\n\nLifeline:\nThis mode is unique because you take on the role of the army inside a city crawling with the infected. Your job is to simply scavenge supplies while extracting key VIP targets and any civilians you find. The key difference in this mode is that after a period of time you have to fight of a siege of the infected which gets steadily more difficult as you move on.\n\nTo sum it up, State of Decay ( or SOD ) is one of the best zombie games out there at least in my opinion. If you've never owned the original SOD and were interested in grabbing it, then yes I would reccomend this to you 100%. As for vet players though, I know alot of them are angry about the support being dropped for the original and they do have a right to be. Its purely up to them if they want to buy this version for only a few new features.\n\nFor new players this is perfect for you. For the old vets, again just think if spending the money is worth for the extra features that they threw in.","May 3, 2015","true","69.1"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","10","29","3","0"

Big map, driveable vehicles, lots of items, customization, base/community building. Definitely worth the price in my opinion. Far from an 'AAA' title, but it has it's own charm.\n\nPros:\n*Graphics are better than original release (albeit not significantly)\n**Seems better optimized than the original release (from what I've tested I'm getting pretty-much a solid 60fps on Ultra)\n***Very easy to mod (hordes of zombies, zombies do more damage, remove lit-up containers, remove zombie radar icons)\n****Mods for the original game work on YOSE too\n*****Map is a decent size\n******Breakdown especially is very fun, lots of different characters, difficulty increases\n*******An abundance of different items, weapons, levelling\n********Different zombie types, adds to the excitement/fear without being too far-fetched\n\nCons:\n*No anti-aliasing\n**Assisted-aim with a controller can't be turned off\n***Lootable containers (wardrobes etc) glow white, which kills immersion. Google: No More X-Ray Eyes to disable\n****A hunger system would've been cool, but stamina forces you to eat which is an okay compromise\n*****Can be buggy, can't climb on certain objects, etc\n******I sometimes encounter a bug where if I die, and start a new character, a sound repeatedly replays which is incredibly irritating. Restart game to fix.\n\n7/10. Not the best game I've ever played, but worth it for a cheap price. I'd happily pay £20-$30 for it. Can definitely get a decent number of hours out of it.

The only complaint I have is having to listen to the repeated nagging from the girl that sits on her fanny talking on the radio.  It's virtually impossible to become friends with her and even though all you have to do is take a look at the map, she's right there nagging you about things that should be done.  I'd love to see a Mod that shuts her up at least half of the time she would normally be reminding you about something... lol\nThe new feature in "Day One" featuring the random supply drops is a great boost and a quest worth undertaking.  Unfortunately if you have a helper with you at the time, they will jump out of the vehicle when you approach the supply drop and run home leaving you there alone to fight off 20+ Zombies yourself.  I've never been able to kill them without using the vehicle as a weapon.  However, this updated version is one that will give someone that enjoys the game many hours of entertainment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyat101/recommended/329430/","Tyat101","TyAT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyat101/","62 products in account","There was a bit of debate and some doubt in my mind whether or not to get State of Decay: YOSE after reading a bunch of the reviews and seeing all the thumbs down. I have the older State of Decay and all the DLC for it already and I did enjoy that one greatly.I also had a few mods installed and I feel Yose adds what I already added in mods for the first State of Decay, which is a good thing. Now I don't have to add mods to get the experience I wanted with the first State of Decay. I like what they did with their zombie game, third person, having perma death, having to run a community of survivors the whole lot. I have gladly wasted many many hours. I certainly recommend the first one. If you are on the border about getting or not getting this. just go to youtube and watch a few videos and or reviews, find out with your own opinion about this game by seeing actual gameplay.\n\nAfter playing this one for a bit I have no problem recommending this one as well. Sure i've seen a few weird zombie glitches, maybe a zombie gets stuck or you hit C to dodge and he grabs you anyways or you swing and somehow he manages to hit you brushing off your hit as wind in his hair, not really game breaking in my opinion, makes your odds less and in my opinion more fun as I welcome the challenge of staying alive. I also noticed the zombies like to spawn pretty fast even though I dispatch a ton and feel the area should be clear they keep on coming in waves appearing from thin air right in front of me. But I don't mind Killing zombies, it's fun and gets your stats up.\n\nMost people say the game has frame drops, that it isn't optimized, the previous game ran smoother and it doesn't look better than the previous State of Decay, or it's not worth $20 for the "exact" same game. I have not had any of these problems. I don't know what hardware people are using. I am on a modern mid level gaming computer ($600), I have my game settings maxed out. It does run smoother, it looks better, I have no problem with any lighting or shading, everything renders fine, and there is no black border in full screen as I read in one or two reviews, I also saw that people don't like the load screens or the load screens take too long. I have not encountered a load screen that was longer than a few seconds 20 or 30 seconds if even that, at the most, besides those everything is pretty instant in my experience. All I can say about this is make sure your computer meets the requirements.\n\nOnto the $20 is too much. I like what the devs made as a game and I am willing to support them so they will continue to make more for this game, or more games in general, sure you could argue this should be DLC, there's not enough content to resell it at this price etc. I haven't gone through everything in the game and encountered every single bit just yet, but so far I have used the SUV, I have an SKS w/ 40mm grenade launcher, i've used the new melee weapons and the new character which has new animations. I like what I have seen and used so far and I have confidence I will like the rest of the game just as much if not more as I reintroduce myself to State of Decay.\n\nConclusion: If you don't already have State of Decay and you like zombie games along with slight base and resource management, pick this up. If you want to upgrade and relive your older State of Decay adventures, pick this up.\n\nReview Update: 5/21/2015\n\nI would like to address the people who are "stuck" in windowed mode and have incorrect mouse coordination in game, simply hit alt+enter to go full screen and fix the mouse. Simple fix.\nAnother thing almost everyone is complaining about the fact they are buying the "same game" and it's not updated enough to be worth buying again. Why is everyone so surprised when they buy it? Guess what? it IS the same game, it is remastered, aka they added slight improved graphics, textures, more weapons, characters etc. but it is still State of Decay. This is not a new game, it is not State of Decay 2. Just like when they patch an mmo. Same game with a little more than before the patch.\n\nI have not had any game breaking problems with bugs, glitches, or crashes as of yet. I played through the first two levels of breakdown and have not lost any survivors, heroes, vehicles, whatever to any bug or glitch. I have completed all my sieges and have not had any special zombies come through closed doors. No followers get stuck due to bad path finding, or die from bad path finding. I have used the incendiary shotguns and the knife fighting which are both really fun in my opinion. I have also encountered most if not all of the vehicle paint jobs and vehicle variants which I find sort of funny and nice to see at the same time. I like the new variety, but I feel some of the paint jobs are a little much, but still fun.\n\nI am still enjoying the game as I wrote in my first part of the review. and I still recommend the game if you have not owned the original or if you enjoyed the first and are buying it for a second time.","May 9, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","0"

Then I saw all the negative reviews, and really didn't know what to think. All the improvements tehy made (https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition.47074/) looked pretty cool, but the reviews were all pretty bad. I decided to buy it nonetheless, especially since I didn't own Lifeline, so I thought "why not?"\n\nSo here is what I think:\n\nAll in all, if you're new to State of Decay, go buy the YOSE, it's great. On the otherhand, if you own the original and both DLC's, I'm not so sure. All I can say is, I didn't regret buying it, but I only owned one DLC before.\n\nTechnical problems are still there, but all the small changes and improvement make it worthwhile for me. Game looks better to me, I get a lot less graphical glitches, I like the new unarmed knife mechanics, I noticed some ncie new animations, Gurubani Kaur is awesome, and the overall gameplay feels the same, if not better to me. Also: blood and gore looks better now. That's really cool. I don't know if its worth 20 € for you, but I most certainly don't regret buying YOSE.\n\nI hope this helps if your unsure.\n\nBest regards and have fun smashing zombieheads :)","May 2, 2015","true","30.4"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","8","26","4","0"

There are no significant improvements to the game, it's still the same game with a few nice changes. These changes do make the game more enjoyable but are probably not worth the full price. Improvements include:\n\n-Enhanced graphics and draw distance, and new textures. The graphics aren't significantly better, but the difference is noticable.\n-Improved effects, with dust, fog, and fire effects...\n-More animations have been added. Zed's move differently, and they changed the unarmed combat.\n-Cleaner looking interface.\n-Some of the features in Lifeline have now been added to the main game and Breakdown.\n-A new mission type, with new special weapons.\n-Grenade launcher attachement and incendiary shotguns.\n-More vehicles and some new skins.\n-One new character is included (if you bought the original game).\n-You can now play as Hawkes, Kilo, Vince and Sasquatch. (More dialogue was recorded for Breakdown).\n-More music in game.\n-Increased number of Zeds.\n\nThere are still some problems with the game. Zed's can pass through doors, and there are pathing problems (Surviors can get stuck when trying to enter vehicles).  Unfortunately there is still no support for 4k or 2k monitors. I have a 1440p monitor and I find it dissapointing (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) that I have to play the game at 1080p.\n\nIt may be better to wait for a discount, before considering to buy this game. Having glanced at some of the negative reviews, I agree that this game is not a major improvement, and there are still the same bugs. I suggest you buy this game if you haven't bought the original (or you bought the base game but not the DLC). For others, I suggest you wait for a discount. I still like this game and the improvements (particularly the new mission type), but graphically I expected it to be better.","May 2, 2015","true","91.6"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","8","26","3","0"

To begin, THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME EVER. No doubt about that. I love every inch of it. It's got everything I love in video games: freeroam, zombies, guns, scavenging, base-building, leveling up, permadeath, stealth, and that's just to name a few of my favorite aspects of it.\n\nNow to my suggestion... Should you buy it or not?\n\nWell let me answer that with another question, do you have the original game or not?\n\nIf you do not have this game already, get it. Get it now and don't think about any other game. This game is absolutely amazing, and in this pack, you get all of the DLC's. It's fantastic! :) You can spend many many hours playing this game without boredom (at least for me). I can do the same stuff over and over, and it's a crazy fun experience each and every time. So great.\n\nIf you already have the old game, I would waste your time on this "upgrade" if you even want to call it that. I paid $20 (33% off for having the original) for very slightly better graphics, one or two new finishing moves, and a new character. That was not something that I was pleased about. I had the old one too, but I personally loved the first game so much, that this version is more of a collectors item for me. But from a player's point of view, if you're not 100% crazy about this game, I wouldn't waste your money.\n\nMore of my thoughts on THIS VERSION OF THE GAME and a gameplay video are below.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe graphics in this game don't seem to have improved that much. They seem like the same ol' graphics from the original, just a bit brighter and now you can see guts in detail. It's not that big of a difference.\n\nThe combat had a few new added techniques. You can now slice down on zombie heads and there are some new finishing moves based on the melee weapon you're using. Which is pretty cool. You can also chop off body parts it seems. Also pretty neat.\n\nI heard there were new weapons, which I never really got to find during this 45 minute session, but I'm sure they're there somewhere. The new weapon you get from the van is cool enough, though it shoots like a normal gun.\n\nHonestly, the coolest thing for me was the new character, Gurubani Kaur. She was pretty bad ♥♥♥, wielding her suppressed rifle and sword. Very cool!\n\nWould I suggest this game? Well, it depends. If you do not have State Of Decay already, GET IT. It's awesome! This version in particular will even save you money if you plan on getting the DLC's with it. However, if you have State Of Decay already, it's more of an opinion type thing. If you REALLY care about graphics and stuff, go for it. Because that's really the only major change (although the UI looks pretty neat too). If you truly love State Of Decay like I do, get it. It's like a collectors thing at this point, though.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eYWVz1cQwxU","April 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","7","24","2","0"

IMO if you already own State of Decay and its associated DLC this is nothing more than a 1080p graphical update and is not worth the upgrade.\n\nPC Specs (just in case):\n\nAMD FX6300\nNVidia GTX760\n8GB of RAM\nPlayed on a Microsoft Xbox 360 controller\n\nWhat can I say about State of Decay other than it is the best zombie survival game in the market. It does a number of things really well:\n\n1) Make every character feel unique\n\nWhile you will always start with the 3 same characters, the community members you can acquire and how you build your characters can differ tremendously playthrough to playthrough. My first go at this game (in the 720p version) is completely different than my just finished 15 hours of playthough (on the Vanilla campaign). This game rewards smart play, some characters are more suited to melee and some for gunplay and building your characters around these strengths can help greatly or you can take the added risk of building evenly on every character. By the end of the campaign, I had three characters suited for gunplay, three for melee and two all-rounders and tasked each group to specific mission types. Everyone had a backstory and I tried to incorporate this into my decision making as I roleplayed them for what I thought each character would do in real-life. Each character also suffers permadeath and nothing is more heart-breaking than watching a character you build get destroyed by a silly move in a routine scavenging mission although after one or two deaths, you'll usually know when to pick your fights.\n\n2) Simulate a zombie apocalypse.\n\nResources are scarce and while there are ways to end up not having to worry about resource A or B more often than not you'll run short on Resource C or D (there are five in total Food, Medicine, Ammo, Materials and Fuel). These resources are also consumed as the game is turned off meaning that you'll have to log in to check on the health of your community and to scavenge what you need. Which segues well into my next point. This game requires resource management. While you may be overflowing with food, not having enough medicine to stave off the flu or materials to maintain your defenses can and will spell certain doom. Adding to that is the fact that you can and will run out of resources, so it is a battle against time to stockpile resources and find a way out. Additionally, you will need to balance your time out as well. You will need to decide whether you want to clear the path around you or pursue story or community missions or scavenge for resources. You can roleplay as the hero of the community or the leader of your own isolated community depending on what you choose.\n\n3) Combat is kinda awesome\n\nThere is nothing more awesome IMO that kneeing a zombie's skull open, or taking an oar and beating the crap out of multiple zombies. Melee combat in this game is great! You have your attack, dodge or (as I call it) space making moves that allow you to dictate melee fights with zombies. However, get overrun and surrounded and you will die. On the controller the Left Bumper (forgot the keyboard equivalent) allows you to add more power to your attacks, dodge further and finish grounded enemies all with the added cost of more stamina meaning that you can't just spam the attack button all the time.\n\nGunplay is tight as guns react as you'd expect forcing you to choose the range of engagements depending on the weapon you choose. Pistol's can't one tap enemies from as far as a rifle can, but rifles don't have the rate of fire as pistols do. Assault weapons are a happy medium but ammo for them is scarce and automatic firing will burn through ammo. There are plenty more weapons and I enjoyed using all of them, none of them felt particularly overpowered (though any weapon that can take a silencer should be top priority picks) and filled each niche appropriately.\n\n4) Story\n\nThe story was in my opinion strongly average, there are some bits where you have to fill it in with your imagination but the game's narrative is relatively realistic with well-written dialogue. Needlessly to say, this is the most subjective part and I'll leave you to make this decision on your own.\n\nIn short, this is in my opinion the best zombie game out there and you should buy it if you are new to the series. Hordes of zombies can be either terrifying or exhilarating to fight against depending on how prepared you are to face them. In between all the fighting there's managing your community, resources and characters. Sprinkled on top of all this is a great melee combat system and great gunplay. The story is what you make of it honestly, I found it adequate to keep my playing and motivated to finish the game but it isn't going to win awards. Some technical stuff below.\n\nTechnical stuff\n\nGraphics: Decent looking. I had everything on the Max preset (there's the Ultra preset after Max) and the game looked beautiful at times. What really detracted from the experience was the game slowdowns as you moved from area to area. It almost felt like the game kept reloading assets of the upcoming parts of the map leading to some noticeable stutter.\n\nSound: I liked how everything in this game sounded. Zombies whether aggressive or not sounded suitably dead and menacing. The guns sounded great, melee weapon effects were also pretty good. The ambiance came together very well for me.","May 3, 2015","true","15.1"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","7","24","3","0"

I just found out about State of Decay, and so far the game is quite good. TL;DR The game doesn't really match the complexity of other open world survival games, and the PC-port is subpar.\n\nThe game is focuses more on being a sandbox. The story is very light, and dialogues brief. The voice-acting is good most of the time. Graphics are ok, but animations are quite cartoony, and there's never any really scary environments or events.\n\nThe world seems kind of small, most locations are just a stone's throw from the base, and distant locations take less than a minute to drive to. Scavenging is mostly about finding special lockers (about 2 or 3 per house) and looting them. There's no way to gather natural resources, or construct makeshift weapons on your own (ie. no crafting). Focus here lies instead on maintaining base happiness, upgrading facilities and managing resources. This is not entirely obvious how it works though - the interface is clunky, uninformative and its far too easy to misclick and start deconstructing rather than upgrading, thus wasting precious resources.\n\nThe interface and controls are painfully poorly ported. They do the job, but it's obvious that it was designed for a console controller, and very little effort was put into adapting it to a mouse and keyboard (even Skyrim did it better).\n\nWhen it comes to zombie survival games, my main go-to game is Project Zomboid. In comparison, this game is easier, more cartoony; but also more immersive with the 3D environments, has some good NPC dialogue and adequate AI. For these reasons I think this game is entertaining enough to recommend, although some better controls would make it easier to recommend.","May 4, 2015","true","9.0"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","7","24","2","0"

Decided to go ahead and get the game. Not a 100% bust, but it really needs fixes, as did the previous version. Glitches, unexpected vehicle, item, and general game issues cause me to lose more people from my community than anything else. Also, even after clearing buildings, icons still show as though something is there when the building is clear. Bonus Survivors no longer populate and the "Saving" feature will no longer turn off, causing lag every few seconds, making the game nearly unplayable. I waited until now to watch the forums and see what dev's do about any issues. To be honest, I have not seen much change. You got my money (twice). How about fixing the game issues and addressing the reasonable player questions?\n\nOverall, I do love the game for what it is intended - an open world Single Player Zombie Apocalypse World. A couple of things to make the game better -\n\n1. Multi-Player (at least LAN-Based) Of course if you add Lan, Online play is right there as well.\n\n2. Expansions outside of the Valley. Let's face it, Breakdown is by far the best of the three choices. Keep expanding the Valley. If I can play for hours, killing zombies, collecting supplies, and rescuing others, I think I can skirt around a few vehicles blocking the road to leave the Valley. Maybe add a Tow Truck so I can clear it? Just a thought.\n\n3. Dont hype up what you know has issues. Fix the issues, Beta Test them with players like me, then release when it is ready.\n\n4.

I've burned, I've savaged, I've salved, I've saved, I've cried, I've praised. It is the community by which we're raised.

You play a community trying to survive in what ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ walled building you can lay your hands on. The game itself is split into three gamemodes if you will: the main story, breakdown (loot the map and move onto a harder version of the map) and lifeline (I have played much of the last).\n\nGraphics\nSimply put the visuals feel clearer and more polished then the original game. There are a few dodgy textures here and there that feel like temp/hold overs but with some luck undead labs or modders can fix them. Also now supports 1080p which is nice.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is much the same, you'll get the same dialog as before and you'll likely ignore it now like you did the last 100 times. A few new guns have been added (least I've been told) and there seems to be a pre-order character you can play now.\n\nOverall\nI'm not going to go nito the debat about if this one's better then the original or not. State of Decay: YOSE is a HD remake of one of the best zombie survivals (most likely the best one) that brings this two year old classic back from the dead (no pun intended =P).\n\nWhat remains to be seen is what Undead labs will do with this new version of their game? Will they add more content (hopefully co-op, not holding my breath there though)? or just leave this game to rot in gaming hell (ok, that one was intended :D)?","May 1, 2015","true","6.2"," 9 of 29 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","9","29","2","0"

But many of those "bad reviews" recommend purchasing this game if you have not played the original. I agree with them to purchase this addition.\n\nPro:\n1. they have updated the User Interface. Not to say the original was bad, but it was too gritty, along with much of the graphics.\n2. They are still updating this game. That means It is just going to get better.\n3. They added new content, that doesn't include the pre-orders, the bonus of purchasing the game early or the bonus of having the original game.  They added new gear. and added some characters from the last DLC to the second DLC.\n\nCons:\n1. they do have some glitches and bugs. I encountered much of them, but what makes it better is all the fun they are, much like skyrim. They are not game breaking glitches, they are just something that make you laugh. Like for example I had someone floating while sitting down. or had a zombie fly against the ground against it's back.\n2. I do admit that the graphics may not be as advertised, but it is still much better than the first game. the opening background is much cleaner and more interesting then the first.\n3. there was one glitch that I did encounter that was rather upsetting, but upon further review I realized I may have caused the glitch and it can be avoided. I began a mission and then immediately I started another action (searching a cupboard) that made it impossible to finish the mission. I just simply restarted and it came right back before I started the mission once again.\n\nOverall, if this game seems appealing, or at least the first one did and you are thinking about buying this game. I would recommend it. I already put around 25-40 hours into this game in a week and I am still enjoying it. I just cannot get enough from this game.\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","106.2"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","3","16","0","0"

I'm a previous owner of the game and all the DLC and thought it would be a great opportunity to see some of the graphics in a higher resolution with more detail. After some tweaking and some strangeness with the way the game changes resolution, I now have a great looking game running at 60+ FPS.\n\nI had no problem spending $20 for the upgrade in graphics, the truck, survivor and weapons.  Great value for more high res fun.\n\nIt's a shame so many others are disappointed with this upgrade. I really thought it would get a better bunch of traction. Unfortunately, many don't share my belief that value is perceived differently by different people. This, this right here is great value.

State of Decay year one edition actually went into stoers because of it's success and basically it's just a way to get more attention to a great game.\n\nI spent almost 240hours on the State of Decay, reaching level 13 on the Break down DLC and making it into the top 100 players. So this was an easy buy for me, just simply because I enjoyed the game so much, or too much. Now I'm on breakdown 28 or something and in the top 14 players.\n\nImprovements?\nThe graphics are maybe 5% better\nFighting seems to have minor differences\nMore guns and you can craft your own bullets which improves gun play\nSUV's and the army truck is added from Lifeline. The cars and trucks have new skins as well\nNew Characters\nA bonus drop system called CLEO is in the game which is going to play into state of decay 2...You learn nothing about it.\n\nIf you really enjoy the game, get it for breakdown. Being able to make your own bullets now made guns a great weapon now and you feel like this bad a$$ pulling combos than going to slow-mo and killing zombies wtih your rifle...Rifles are the only guy really worth having in the game.\n\nThe game is a bit easier because of this, but also more fun.

Play is fairly open as to how you go about doing things (slow, stealthy, fighting everything in sight, etc).   To me, it feels more like being in a real situation as compared to some of the "action only" zombie games out.  Graphics are good, I much prefer the lighting in the YOSE version compared to the original, much better for my old eyes...  There is some clipping at times, nothing worse than I've seen in other games and nothing that bothered me.  I've not had any crashes (except vehicles..hehe).\n\nI highly recommend State of Decay.   If you don't have any version yet, go with YOSE version.   If you have the original but not the DLC from the original, this is still a good deal  (if you haven't played it to death).  If you have the original and the DLC you won't get as much out of this version so it's kind of iffy.

If you expected anything different than that, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nThe game plays like the original game, because *gasp* it is the original game.  All that was promised was improved graphics and a few little tidbits to make the game more fun.  It's basically a textures overhaul mod you'd expect to see for Skyrim, except its official.\n\nI've heard complaints about the bugs, and all I can say is that they were neither better nor worse than the original game.  I'm guessing they were bugs that are driven by intricacies of the Cryengine version used be SOD, but that's just conjecture (it's all physics related and a few random crashes that honestly shouldn't happen, but I couldn't care less.)\n\nAs for the improved graphics, I noticed a huge improvement.  Everything was far less dingy, and undead labs seriously toned up the lighting.  While I can sort of get the realism of not being able to see at night, I'm glad they fixed it because for me the game was virtually unplayable during 'night'; if you want to be unable to see for 50% of the game I would then of course recommend the original.\n\nThey probably added new character traits, and definitely added new shirts and pants and hats.  This mixes up what sort of characters you will see and increases playability.  Similarly the vehicles were diversified and given new textures, which again makes for more replayability since there are more than 6 distinct cars in the valley.\n\nI did in fact notice the higher res textures.  The original was grainy as heck.  The menu and maps have been cleaned up significantly, which is really good.  I'm so glad they kept the physical journal interface (the game menus look like pages in a notebook) ====== very cool UI.  Plus you can now tell which item you have selected!\n\nIn closing, the Year One edition is worth it if you liked the original game (or if you never played it, I suppose).  If you go in expecting a vastly different setting and feeling and a bug free game, then you'll be disappointed.\n\nGood luck, it's a brutal game.\n","May 1, 2015","true","12.4"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","5","21","2","0"

Well. State of Decay is a great game. This, right here, is a new edition of a great game. There aren't too many changes - this is, after all, a very slight upgrade which is primarily to make State of Decay available to X-Box One owners. On PC, the changes aren't too obvious, but there's a different engine running things in the background. There's a new knife-wielding mechanic for characters without weapons. There are new bits and bobs in various game modes, but again, they're marginal - new heroes, some bits of hardware from DLC being offered across all game mods, that kind of thing.\n\nThe 'consumer revolt' is entirely out of proportion with what this is, and with what this is advertised as. It's State of Decay running on an updated engine - same game, significantly different back-end... but it's the same game.\n\nAnd it's a really, really good game. I bought it as an excuse to replay it, and I'm enjoying it. I think the developers did a pretty good job.","May 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","4","19","0","0"

You have to search boxes within structures for loot instead. I don't own the original game because I got this one by mistake (I meant to get the first game), but it still plays great despite it's quirks. Not to mention killing the zombies feels great. I'm on the fence about recommending State of Decay: Year One to anybody else, but if others say the first game is better, I can't argue with it since I don't know.\n\nI'll see about editing this reveiw with an update later once I've completed the game.","May 1, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","4","20","0","0"

I've played the hell out of this game and I love it even with its flaws.\n\n\nThe game looks nice. Maybe not 2015 Assassin's Creed, Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, etc. nice but it's not terrible. The effects are overall better and I enjoy the new look a lot. Unfortunately the textures break a lot and flatten out to look very low-res.\n\nCars handle better. Now that being said, they still handle really wonky at times. Car drives beautifully for a while and then you hit a small pebble or stick and car shoots into the air, slingshotting my character into a swan dive. Sometimes it does this for no reason at all. Textures on the cars break when my character is in them. Going from decent to low-res the second my character climbs in and sits down. There is no reason why a car sitting still should develop a case of the blurries. I do like the new vehicles UL added, they give the game a bit more variety and flavor.\n\nSome pathing has improved. Some hasn't. I still get stuck on curbs and sandboxes and anything that is ankle height. I think my characters must all have weak ankles and thus have developed a fear of short objects.\n\nGame difficulty seems cranked to 11. I started over instead of importing my save and opened up Breakdown lvl 1 (I prefer Breakdown to story TBH) and I was getting swarmed constantly. I lost one guy to a feral which is totally something that happens but a lot of survivors are getting mauled by packs of two and three zombies who glitch through doors and seem to hit like they migrated from a much higher difficulty. And OMG HORDES. Upon starting my game and moving into the Alamo, 6 hordes spawned. And each time there is a horde announcement, there are between 7 and 8 hordes. Half of these will almost instantly infest a house. It's kind of daffy.\n\nOverall however, I feel this game is still wonderful. I do wish there were more features added - more home base sites, perhaps city access like when you choose to move on in Breakdown you could wind up in a Breakdown version of the city instead of the valley - more base-building freedom (Seriously. I'm looking at all this negative space in my bases wondering WTH I can't plop a garden planter here or more beds there..) and maybe a toggle on mission frequency. (STHU LILY. I'M BUSY!) But it's still a terrific game overall and I love it just as much as I did when I first played it.","April 30, 2015","true","111.7"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","8","29","0","0"

Somehow, these amazing graphics run on my computer (more like a toaster, but ya know what I mean) with very little lag.\nThe gameplay is FAR, and I mean REALLY FAR, smoother. There is no glitches that I've found (yet), which is awesome. The game actually looks epic, and the gameplay is too. While my game was downloading, I was reading the reviews, and was not feeling to good. I started to regret buying it, but now that I've played it I know how full of dog turd some people are. Whether it's your first time joining the State of Decay or you're rejoining it from the previous game, this is WELL worth the 29.99 USD (or the 19.99 USD for returning players).\nI'm looking to enjoy hundreds of hours on this within a couple of months.\nIf you are looking at this game and want it, DO NOT hesitate. It's amazing. You WILL NOT regret. There is one thing about that though, this game is not for people who only have 5 minutes of game play time a day and who want to be an OP 'boss' in 2 minutes. You can't buy premium stuff, only the DLC for 2 extra game modes (Well worth the money).\nThis game WILL get boring over time.

You have to realize what you're buying here. This is not a new game, never was advertised as one. If you spent five seconds researching what this new edition consists of, it is essentially a GOTY edition that you've seen on a hundred other games before. For those that already have the game, there will be little gained aside from minor visual and technical fixes alongside what could be considered a slight DLC addition, the new weapons/vehicles/etc. For those that don't have the game, it's a complete steal to pick it up now.\n\nThis game is as awesome as it always was. Considering the size of Undead Labs and the size of the crew that made this game, it is a very well done job. Considering the fact that I picked up the first game for $20 and this one for $20, I don't think I was ripped off in the slightest. This game is by far worth $40.\n\nTo all the people that hated all over this game, let me put it this way. Does it have paid mods? Does it have microtransactions? Was it made by EA?

It's a clever idea that still holds a lot of potential, the devs could still do very much with this game especially since they just 'remastered' it.\n\nI played the original and I deffinately notice a difference with graphics and frame rate, mainly because I have a computer that wasn't exactly built for gaming. I can run the remastered game on ultra and 1080p just fine without frame drops, in comparison to me running medium to high graphics with violent lag and occasional crashes at times in the original.\n\nHowever this does not constitute the developers charging (quite a bit) for a remake, several bugs are still present from the original but overall it's still very nice. It would have been nice if this remake was a free upgrade to whoever bought the original and It would also be nice if the devs were to add more content in the form of updates (In all seriousness, this is a huge oppurtunity to release some more content).\n\nOverall, I'd say proceed with caution. This is still a very fun and enjoyable game. The game runs a lot smoother for me in comparison to the original and I noticed a few little changes. I'd say that if you didn't buy the original, buy this version.

Its the only real single-player driven zombie survival experience you're really going to find that delivers on the survival front AND gives you some interaction with the world itself in the form of other NPC survivors.\n\nWhile I've played 7 Days to Die (and I do recommend that game) and Project Zomboid (another great game but it still has a long way to go) and a few others, I found myself playing this one out of the batch the most.  Mostly because the worlds in those games are...well, empty currently, though I intend to revisit them when NPCs survivors are added.\n\nWhile the world itself is solid and interactions with it are limited (you can board up houses, establish outposts, rescue other survivors but you can't say, build an entirely new building from the ground up) it delivered what I had hoped and that was a zombie experience with some drive beyond, "I'm going to go on and on and on..." because while survival is fun, it is not inherently interesting if that is all you're doing (in a virtual space, mind you).\n\nPlus, the game gets downright difficult as time progresses; there are some serious heavy weight zombies that you don't even want to run into while you're driving a vehicle.  Your insurance won't cover it, trust me.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDay Z (can't blame you, its a long ♥♥♥ deathmatch not a zombie survival game) not your thing but you want a zombie focused survival game? Pick it up.\n\nAlready own it? Pick it up on sale because the fix to the draw distance, graphical tuning are good but not worth the full price if you already own the original and all the expansion packs.  I agree with the notion that this is how it should have been to begin with but I disagree that the developers should be "punished" for that, especially since they were primarily focused on a console released way back when.","April 29, 2015","true","16.4"," 8 of 31 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","8","31","4","0"

I really just couldn't disagree more. I played a LOT of the original version of this, and there is clearly a great improvement on the graphics qualities. Texturing of wood is noticeably better, and details and shadowing of characters and zombies are improved as well. The trees look fantastic (not that they were bad before.)      It's easy to hate on a game, but you won't see me doing it with this one. There are new animations, new sound effects, vehicles... the menus have been revamped (i.e. inventory)        I love it. I've experienced no glitches yet either. And if they arise, Undead Labs has always been good about fixing problems. Love it.

If we are to review ONLY the new parts of the game, then it's one thing. But if we are to review this as a whole game, for new and unaware players, then all this criticism are misplaced. Therefore these negative reviews is a shot to the head on a really great game.\n\nIf you are new to this game and you like the Zombie/survival genre, then this is (in my opinion) one of (if not THE) the best game there is to date. You get to survive/live in a pretty realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic zombie-virus outbreak. Vehicles, basebuilding, team-management, permadeath and scavaging. Done in a really genial way. Even with some RPG elements!\n\nWhat needs to be fixed is the framrate/optimization issue. When travelling by car the game does not run very well, a problem I never had with the original. And a very personal opinion of mine, as I understand the hordes (maybe zombie overall) spawnrate has been increased. One of the (by me) strongest sides of SoD compared to other games in the same genre is that there is peaks of intensity. Your not overun 24/7, the world can seem silent and peaceful one minute and then hell breaks loose the next. I really hope it will stay that way.\n\nSo. If your into the Zombie/survival genre, for the survival ideas, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game and worth every penny! Can't wait for the sequel!","April 28, 2015","true","19.9"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","27","10","37","5","1"

A majority of the negative comments are going to be from people holding grudges against Undead Labs for a "paid upgrade". Something people do not realize is nobody is holding a gun to your head, dont want to pay for this edition, then don't buy it, its that simple.\n\nWith that said, in terms of graphical improvements, from the original PC edition it is crisper and smoother lines all around, not enough to be called a full HD remaster (IMO) but decent enough from where it came from. The gameplay is still a bit rough around the edges and zombies still bug out (gametime only 20 minutes and I saw 1 stuck in ground and another in a tree). The sound from what I heard is cleaner and the control input is smooth with no input lag (I use 360 controller).\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to someone who has never played SoD before.

It includes all previous DLCs as well as some new missions, characters, vehicles, and weapons.  The graphics have been enhanced with better textures and animations and combat and base-building mechanics have seem some improvements as well.  The Year One Survival Edition also includes 30 minutes of additional music.  I've included my original review for State of Decay below since this is and enhanced version of the same great game.\n\nYOSE was clearly designed as a release for people who have never played State of Decay on PC and to put the game on Xbox One.  If you've already had your fun with SoD and the DLCs, you may want to wait for a sale as there isn't a significant amount of new content.  As with any "complete edition" game, the target market is new players and hardcore fans.  Happy surviving.\n\n----\n\n(State of Decay, original review)\nThis is probably the best zombie/survival game out there. In short, it's like Grand Theft Auto set in the zombie apocalypse. But even better, it includes RPG elements like upgradeable skills and special abilities for your characters. You get to choose a home base, fortify it, and upgrade it. You can play as any character in your group (you'll have to keep changing to keep them rested) and increase their stats and skills.\n\nThe story is virtually non-existent and ends abruptly, but the real treat is surviving, upgrading, gathering, recruiting, etc. Playing State of Decay is similar to Skyrim with an open world and never ending side quests. Be warned: the beginning is a little slow and underwhelming but once you get into it, it can be quite addicting.","April 28, 2015","true","142.5"," 33 of 94 people (35%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","35","33","94","7","0"

The game looks nicer (goodbye, harsh shadows), the animations are slicker, and the colors are more vibrant. They've added a new set of animations for "unarmed" (now knife) combat, which seems to include some takedown animations, which is a welcome additions. There are new vehicles, weapons, and a character. Overall, it also performs better.\n\nThe only major problem I've identified so far is the fact that it lags horrifically when driving. Hopefully this will be patched, but until then, it's REALLY bad. There's also a really stupid motion blur effect when your vehicle is in motion. It blurs the car itself, and nothing else.

The story makes the survival immersive and you really get the sense of accomplishment when you work your ♥♥♥ off trying to gather those resources.

(so it's not OP and there's still reason to carry a melee weapon!)\n\nAnd the graphics looks AMAZING!, the developers did great job with bringing State of Decay to the 1080p. plus there's an improved lighting, textures, and shadows which makes the game beautiful more than ever before.\n\nAlso the UI looks so clean and good, really love it! :D\n\nTo sum up, you're going to enjoy the game so much, there's a lot of new stuff to do and much to discover! :)\n\n\n\n\nReviewed on http://scop3scout.webege.com/State_of_Decay_YOSE","April 28, 2015","true","29.1"," 12 of 58 people (21%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","21","12","58","7","0"

It is an unpolished diamond and you should not miss it.\n\nIf you have the game it's a maybe....\n\nSee I played the original without the DLC and loved it, and for me this was worth it just for the DLC.\nIf you have the original game and the DLC this is not worth it at all.

It's still good, but as unpolised as it ever was.\nThe bugs are still there and  so all the other problems.\n\nYet it is still an entertaining experience and if you do not already own it you should pick it up.\nShould you already own the base game, wait for a sale and buy it then.","August 22, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donniepcgames/recommended/329430/","donniepcgames","Beach Head","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donniepcgames/","130 products in account","I should probably point out that the original state of decay was the first ever open world zombie apocalypse game that I played. Long before DayZ, H1z1, etc. I put 46 hours into the original version of this game. I bought this version hoping for more, but basically just got the exact same game with updated graphics and sound and some general improvements to gameplay. If you've never played the original state of decay, I would suggest you play this... but I think the price of $30 is too much. Buy this game while it is on sale.\n\nPROS:\n-You are in an open, zombie infested world and can essentially go wherever you want and do basically whatever you want as long as you live. You have to rest though and the bigger your group is, the better off you are, as long as you keep supplies stocked. There is a story and you have to follow it if you want to beat the game, but technically you can just survive and explore as often as you prefer.\n-You can grow a garden, build a medical center and can craft sniper towers in your base. There is some customization of bases in this game and it is interesting.\n-You must maintain supplies such as food and medical. You can raid houses, factories, schools and collect weapons and loot.\n-You can recruit other AI players that you meet, or you can deny them. You can let them into your group and if they start acting crazy you can send them packing or help them. You can control several different characters in the game and can decide who you want to play as, as you go.\n-You can establish a base where you can build a small community of survivors.\n-There are vehicles throughout the world you can take and drive. You can use the trunk to stash extra supplies to transport to your base. Driving around in this game feels a lot like the open AI world of Grand Theft Auto\n-Different types of zombies provide various levels of challenge to kill. Sometimes hoardes come upon you while you are raiding a house for loot and you end up having to barricade yourself inside "Night of the Living Dead" style.\n-The story, acting and soundtrack are all excellent. They keep you interested and engaged in the game.\n\nCONS:\n-There is no online mode. You cannot play co-op or with anyone online. This is a single player game only. This is a massive strike for some people, but understand that this is still a great game without online.\n-You have to play this game in 3rd person. There is no option for 1st person.\n-There is no way to customize your characters. You have to play as the survivors on the game. Lack of customization. You can techincally mod the game unofficially, but it can cause crash problems.\n-The map lacks very large structures to loot inside of, such as a large hospital or large schoolhouse. You spend most of your time looting houses and small shacks or warehouses.\n-There are no real destructable environments. Sure houses burn down and cars explode... but that's about it. You can't pull a fire axe out and chop a hole into a wooden house.","April 28, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
