The developer is a scam artist.\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nNot a single person has solved Chapter 1 as of this review, other than the developer.  Just check\nthe achievement stats.  It's quite possible that there simply is no solution and that the game does not actually have content.\n\nThere aren't adequate instructions or hints in the game itself.

This game is NOT the hardest game on steam, it is the most OBTUSE. Puzzle creation is a fine art where you need to be able to introduce the player to the mechanics, what can/cannot be done, and give them an inkling of what the outcome is supposed to be. Whatever "puzzles" are in this game are horribly conceived, as you will likely quit before knowing what the puzzles are!\n\nIn Journey of the Light, you are a glowing blob of light stuck in a small forest map and you can interact with objects with the "E" button. You are supposedly given a sentence at the beginning of the game that serves as a clue to what you're supposed to do next, and then you are left to your own devices, to wander around the tiny map, mashing your interact button hopelessly at anything that may look like an interactable object. So far the only interactibles I've found are lanterns and I cannot begin to understand what am I supposed to do with them. Something tells me there is an arbitrary sequence to how you interact with them that is known only to the developer. Fun.\n\nThe developer supposedly put clues in a starter guide and trading cards. The starter guide is part of the "puzzle" as it is on steam but it is hidden. Finding it was anticlimatic as it gave as useful a hint as something from a magic 8 ball.\n\nThe hints on the trading cards were equally useless. I tried positioning myself similar to the viewpoint displayed in the trading cards (you will need to enlarge them) and tried pressing the interact button but to no avail.\n\nI lasted for 40 minutes before quitting. The looping music will drive you crazy within a minute, so mute and put your own thing on. I will come back in a few months to see if anyone manages to solve this "game" to see if there is actually a solution or is this just a scam.","July 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 423 of 435 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","423","435","13","7"

This includes physical copies bought. In a way, it's sad. Someone took an idea they may have truly believed in, but executed it in the worst way possible. The description was intriguing. It set up a challenge to the world with the promises of puzzles and clues. What was delivered, was instead the 'clever' obtuse cryptological nonsense of a grade schooler who alone holds the nonsensical key to the solution. I imagine the puzzles started out relatively solvable. But the more clever and tricky new ideas that sprung into the developer's mind, the more 'impossible' they became for anyone other than themself.

It has 8 Steam Achievements, each for completing one of the 8 chapters, however, the statistics suggest no one actually can obtain them - the 0.3% usually indicates they were just unlocked using the Steam Achievement Manager outside of the actual game.\n\nThe developer is very intelligent and puts so much effort into keeping up the smoke and mirrors act that it's hard to believe he doesn't spend time creating anything.  All of his answers and explanations come down to circular reasoning.  For instance, people bring up the fact that there are no actual clues in the game so he created a starter guide to give clues to make the game a bit easier.  The starter guide then refers back to the game for clues.  I pressed him for more information and he referred me to look at the images on the trading cards and better yet, referred me back once again to the guide, which he 'updated'.\n\nHe did the same thing with the game itself by releasing a "Major Bug Fix #1" which adds "new hints across the forest."  But wait, "if you have difficulties of finding them, check the Starters Guide."\n\nIt's all in plain site if you look past the nonsense.  The video and screenshots on the store page are all from chapter 1.  Same thing with the images on the trading cards.  All the content that exists in this game is you move around as a blob of light within a very small map, where a few light sources toggle on and off globally upon hitting the "E" key.  There is no actual interaction with anything in the environment.  There is no story.  There really isn't even a Chapter 1.\n\nEven the beginning of the game states:\n"Where should I seek the path?\nClues are worthless...\nMaybe if I think harder?\nThe easiest solution is sometimes the answer..."\n\nHe admits at the very beginning that any hints or clues are meaningless and the solution is the answer because the answer is the solution.  The game play is literally going around in circles looking for clues because the game tells you to.","June 17, 2015","false","1.5"," 116 of 121 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","116","121","3","6"

I began the game with a friend as we toyed around and explored the mechanics of the game.  However, it wasn't long before we realized that there were no mechanics to the game.\n\nAs we explored Chapter 1, my friend and I used pen and paper to draw our own rendition of the map.  In doing so we discerned quite a familiar pattern.  It became apparent that the map was obviously heavily inspired by Summoner's Rift from popular MOBA League of Legends and games similar to it.  The map consists of three pathways (lanes) in a diamond shape with lanterns (turrets) lining the sides.  The flat, circular area in which the player spawns is mirrored on the other side of the map.  There is a river running through the middle of the map for Christ's sake.  Not only did the developer market an incomplete game, but they couldn't even put in the effort to create an original map.  There is also a lantern that cannot be toggled and a lantern that shines red in the jungle of the map, both of which are unimportant and placed there soley to confuse the player.\n\nEach pathway of the map is lined with several lanterns all oriented in configurations respective to each individual lane.  I will illustrate the configurations through use of symbols. (Location of lanes corresponds to facing away from the spawn in-game)\nDiagram Key:    0 = Lamp off   1 = Lamp on\nMiddle Lane: 0 1 0\nLeft Lane: 1 1 0 0\nRight Lane: 1 0 1 0\n\nThe diagram is simply inverted every time the player "interacts" with the environment.  The developer was even so lazy as to allow the player to make this one single interaction at any location on the map; the player does not have to stand in front of any one lantern.  Pressing "e" does not interact with any one specific object and merely inverts the lamp light (i.e. Lit lamps change to dark lamps and vice versa).\n\nMoreover, there are locations on the map in which blue light shines onto the ground.  These do not alter the outcome of "interacting" with the environment in any way and only exist to confuse the player and manipulate them into believing there is something more to this scam.   The dialogue in the introduction sequence is extremely ambiguous and intentionally obscure.  The "starter's guide" was a nice touch.  It consists of few words and the promise of future updates which have yet to happen.  This guide is also vague and only pertains to Chapter 1 (probably because it is impossible to complete the first chapter).\n\nThere is a reason that the developer is vague throughout the game's description on Steam, the dialogue in the introduction, and the Starter's Guide.  It's because the developer is making a rather lazy attempt at masking the fact that the entire game is a scam.\n\nVerdict: 4/20 Meh, it was alright.","July 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 93 of 94 people (99%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","99","93","94","5","1"

In reality, it has 1 level. He made that level unbeatable to hide the fact that there are no other levels, and passed it off as a hard puzzle. He didn't think someone would decompile the game and get proof that there are no other levels. When he got caught, he claimed that an update removed the levels, the assets, and even the triggers to load the levels. I don't know how stupid the dev must be to think that a bug fix can remove every last trace of 7 levels, or that anyone will believe him. Now he's saying he will revert the update to bring the levels back. That would've taken less than a day. No, it's taking so long to "revert the update" because the game never had 8 levels. It's had 1 level since the beginning. When he got caught, he made that excuse to give him time to program 7 other levels in a mad rush to cover his tracks.\n\nHe did the same thing in his other game, Vozelized. He made an achievement so the store page would have the "steam achievements" tag. The achievement isn't even programmed into the game. And the dev refuses to say how to get it (As I'm sure you can figure out, it's because the dev doesn't know how to get it either).\n\nSpeaking of things the dev doesn't know how to do, the only person the have the achievement in this game for beating level 1-3 is the dev. He hasn't beaten 4-8. Then again, he hasn't beaten 1-3 either.\n\nFor some reason, there are Voxelized levels in this game's coding, but not levels 2-8. I wonder why those levels weren't wiped in the bug fix. And let's not forget that the interact button toggles ALL the lamps in the first(only) level, which is how he made the first level unbeatable.\n\nOh, and the best part? He's tricking people into losing their chance for a refund. He says there are hints on the trading cards (Spoiler alert: There aren't). And instead of looking in the steam community market, he's counting on people getting card drops. Now, with steam's new refund policy, you get an automatic refund if you have played a game for less than 2 hours. But cards don't drop until AFTER 2 hours of play time, to avoid people getting cards and then refunding the game. The dev knows this, and blatantly lied to trick people into losing their refund.","July 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 70 of 71 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","70","71","0","1"

There is only one level. Many players have tested this by checking the coding and files. (The dev is now harassing these gamers) Look to other reviews to find the links. This game is a scam! If you buy the game you are supporting a scammer. I originally bought this game for the puzzle and the cards. The puzzle was a lie and the cards offer me little comfort against the knowledge that I cannot remove this game from my library and I will forever have this stain on my account.\n\n--To the Dev--\nAfter long and careful consideration I have decided there is only one befitting hell for your actions against gamers. You should be hogtied and thrown into your first level and told that your only way out is to solve it. Enjoy karma as you listen to your god awful music that never mutes.\n\n**Update on Final Post** Steam recognizes scam!!! Refunded my money and the stain is gone!!!\n\n(Origanal Post)\nGot it because I love puzzle games. Often times people complain that puzzles are impossible when the truth of the matter is that they simple want easy puzzles to make themselves feel smarter and are not up to real challenging puzzles. I was so hoping this was that kind of game.\n\nAs of this point I cannot testify if this is a fun game because I cannot play it.\n\nList of issues making this game literally unplayable:\n\nDOES NOT WORK WITH DUAL MONITORS!! My mouse keeps sliding off screen causing issues with other objects running.\n\nInteract only seems to turn off and on the light posts... nothing else. Perhaps this is a bug or a part of the riddle? The problem is that it switches ALL light posts at once on entire map. (Edit - It was recently announced that parts of this game were broken due to the first update. IE: there were no other levels after the first one. Odds are that the interact button is also flawed making this game impossible to beat. As of this point no one has seen the second chapter)\n\nThe music will not stay muted. After 1 minute you find yourself wanting to pull a Vincent van Gogh to escape the repeating high pitched pings of piano music at its worse.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a hidden first puzzle to make the game work? If so, then this puzzle has truely gotten the best of me.\n\n\n--To Developer--\n\nI will be more than willing to play again in the future. I do love puzzle games and would like to see if this game lives up to your hype. I will check in and again to see if issues are fixed. I will also continue playing to see if I am wrong about Interact and if I can find something (anything) that I can interact with.

However, it gives you nothing at all to work with and it's meant to have riddles and puzzles, clues etc but it doesn't tell you what type of clues or riddles you're supposed to be actually looking for and you just end up going around in circles forever and ever and it gets very very boring, very very fast. The idea is nice and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The graphics are nice. The soundtrack is nice for 5 minutes and then just gets annoying.\n\nI would advise you to not buy this game whatever you do. You'll be doing nothing the entire game and if you do manage to finish a chapter. It might end up just being through luck since the clues and riddles aren't obvious at all.","May 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","45","57","0","0"

There is nothing else there, no way to switch lanterns in a specific sequence (what the author said was the solution to the puzzle), nothing else you can interact with...

If someone takes their time to pull out a scam like this is because it is worth him, he's profiting from the scam, and I might not be a master in economics, but I know money doesn't spring out of nowhere, if I am profiting from the cards money and the author is profiting from this scam, someone, somewhere, is losing their money. That wouldn't be Valve, that's for sure. From what I saw down the other reviews there are players who actually bought this for the promise of a good puzzle game and have quit before playing 2 hours. I guess they are the ones who are losing their money for the author's profit - unless they ask for a refund, like I have done.\n\nI am now worried about how many other poorly created, rushed penny games out there are also scams.

The first level is the only level in the game code, and there's literally no way to beat it. You can read all about it here: http://imgur.com/a/yceJt\n\nY'know, I was wondering, as long as you're planning on scamming people, why don't you at least make a good game build to convince people? Not something where you just wander around, with your sole ability being to turn all of the lamps on or off simultaneously. Seriously, that's not even imaginative. At least add a jump button.\n\nNow, something that confused me is that if the developer didn't even bother making chapters 2-8, then why the hell did he release a soundtrack containing music for all 8 levels? Well the truth is, that's just part of the scam. If a Steam game has a soundtrack for sale, I guess it appears more legitimate. It also helps sell the idea that additional levels even exist. As it turns out, he puts as little effort into tracks 2-8 as he puts into the annoying and repetitive track of the first (only) level. And, as the album goes on, he tries less and less, with the final four tracks being only 30 seconds long each.\n\nAdditionally, the soundtrack tracklist reveals the titles of the supposedly remaining levels. They're listed as follows:\nChapter 1: Don't Go In To The Light\nChapter 2: In The Mine\nChapter 3: TheForest\nChapter 4: In The Cave\nChapter 5: Closer To Home\nChapter 6: Lost In The Woods Again\nChapter 7: What A Journey\nChapter 8: Reunited\n\n...Is it just me, or does that list, as it goes on, sound more and more like somebody's just making up level titles on the spot in order to have a tracklist? This lameness culminates in possibly the most pathetic level title (or fake level title) of all time: "What A Journey". When I read that one I wanted to literally laugh out loud.\n\nSo, yeah. Scam game with scam soundtrack. Don't buy either.","July 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","3"

Steam actually offered a refund for this game to everyone, regardless of how long they've had it, or how long they've played it, and it is being pulled off of steam.","August 20, 2015","false","5.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olboyfloats/recommended/371440/","olboyfloats","Olboyfloats","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olboyfloats/","680 products in account","Journey of the light is advertized as being "one of the hardest games on steam."\n\nMany are now accusing it of being a scam.\n\nI don't think that's the case. Hear me out.\n\nThis game is a game, but not like one ever put on steam. That's where the difficulty lies, in our preconceived ideas of what a "video game" are. You see, this is not SIMPLY a video game, it is also a alternate reality game, or ARG, a genre of game recently made famous by the band Death Grips.\nAllow me to outline how I see the 8 Levels of the game.\n\nLevel one- You are told to interact by pressing "E" and to "not go into the light." Many tried to play this level by falling off the edge of the game board into darkness. Many tried switching on and off the lights. A large number of people are saying all the game contains is one unbeatable level. What most people fail to see is that by "not going into the light," the dev was taunting gamers to go into the game's core files and code. It's a well known gaming mechanic to instruct gamers by reverse psychology, such as a door marked "do not open" being the win state of a level.\n\nLevel two- The dev posted in forums that the trading cards provide hints on how to beat the levels. This is a big hint, and a few really smart gamers took the time to visit the locations show on the trading cards, and pressed "E," and saw that nothing happened. Now, the really smart gamers at this point had already beaten level one by looking at the download folder, and one really smart gamer ran each level file in a program that let him see something fishy, (as outlined here: https://imgur.com/a/yceJt ), there literally is only one level build with no win state in the files. Uncovering that secret beat level two.\n\nLevel three-  The dev posts an announcement ( http://steamcommunity.com/gid/%5Bg:1:8806469%5D/announcements/detail/781724583348895625 ) explaining the "missing levels" as simply "an mistake with builds," pleads his case as "not a scammer" and gives the biggest hint yet "All i wanted is to create a new kind of gaming experience for all of you." This was posted after well known youtuber "Jim Sterling" posted a video called "Scam or Stupidity - Journey of the Light" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LBG51Pafig ). If you look at the developer's profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordkres ) you will see that even he only has beaten level 3. I believe this means that to beat level three, you have to figure out that the game itself exists not only as a playable .exe file, or a folder in your downloads that has files to dig through, but that the game also exists in larger cyberspace. The game is our interaction with all of the elements involved, the dev's twitter personality, posts on forums outside of steam, every comment on reddit or imgur, it's all part of a bigger, meta game experience unlike ever seen on steam.\n\nLevel four- I like to think of level four as the same as thinking of the fourth dimension. Level one is a flat thing, just a single level of play on a single file. Level two extends to another dimension by forcing players to look deeper into their own computers for the rest of the download files, and to use the software needed to test all the files. Level three extends into the third dimension by extending out of steam and your own computer into the wider internet. Level four extends to the real world, a dimension outside of the computer all together. I don't know how to beat level four personally. Maybe it's beaten by living a good life, or being a good person? Maybe every good deed you do gives you achievements much more meaningful and personal than any achievement you get playing steam games?\n\nHere's where I get serious.\n\nLevel five exists outside of the life we live. Level five is the total imprint we leave on the world when we die.\n\nLevel six exists outside of this lifetime entirely. Level six is when you are reincarnated and are given karmic rewards and punishments from your last life.\n\nLevel seven exists outside of this level of reality. Level seven is alternate universes. The universe where you are your perfect self and everything you ever wanted happens for you exists in level seven, and when you transcend all forms of terrestrial life, and become something more akin to pure energy, you will finally be able to experience that life.\n\nLevel eight exists even further out than the realms of imagination itself. Level eight is the Godhead. The pure quantum DMT particle that is everything and nothing at the same time. In our course of existence we will all eventually get to this level, the place we came from, and the place we are all heading.\n\n\nMy final scores:\n\nGraphics: Unity Asset Flip/10\nSound: Will Drive You Insane/10\nControls: Completely Revolutionary/10\nStory: The Greatest Ever Told/10\nOverall Fun: Riding Five Hookers High On Cocaine/10\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Because you're already playing "Journey of the Light." You've always been playing it, and you will play it forever. So yes, I recommend it, and I hope you have fun with it.","August 5, 2015","true","2.1"," 80 of 294 people (27%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","27","80","294","112","18"

Most games I buy are puzzles, so frustration is something I can handle...to a point. Considering offline play I'm at around 4 hours...of going in circles. But the exploration is REALLY cool, though repetitive by its nature.\n\nI see this as something I will revisit every few days out of curiosity, then less and less when I have to go through the ENTIRE opening over & over, then no more. But I hope not. I hope to have the sense of purpose necessary to accomplish ANYTHING of value.\n\nIt's unfortunate that so many of those reviewing JotL do not know what "may be the hardest game on Steam" means.\n\nBut the music in Chapter 1, though very beautiful, grows tiresome too fast for something that one will be exposed to for an extended time.","May 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 23 of 224 people (10%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","10","23","224","9","10"

Got it for pennies for the cards-badge...joins the other penny bundle games in the hidden section..lol Not saying that makes it alright for devs to scam , even for pennies, just saying, least it has cards which is more than many develpers/publishers will do , even for AAA games out there (Lazy azzes who use Steamers and our  community and won't even participate in said community with a 2 hours to make card set).
