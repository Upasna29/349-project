I don't see any patches to remove GfWL in the future either. Additionally, licensed racers like this usually have a limited time of distribution anyways.\n\nSadly, the game itself is not really enjoyable:\n\nThe weak AI, wonky physics (especially during collisions), a dry and shockingly boring campaign (considering what amazing assets they had to work with!) with difficulty spikes early on and nothing to motivate the player to keep playing the same event over and over and over again other than the fact that almost the entire content of the game is simply locked away otherwise doesn't make for an overall great experience.\n\nMultiplayer is an ultra-barebones afterthought and 100% dead.\n\nIt's not terrible through and through and I had some enjoyable races, but the bad outweighs the good.\n\nThis game could have been truly great, but in the end it's just full of fun-killing design decisions and overall a massive disappointment.","December 30, 2013","false","2.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","2"

With multiple eras of Ferraris, from classic to modern, and a full campaign for each, as you attempt to accomplish various objectives, such as showing off certain vehicles, win certain races, and so on.\n\nYou will be at first, be distracted by eye candy aplenty, then you realize the game has excellent driving models that portrays convincing weight transfer, throttle while turn, drifting, and so on, but also has full driver aids like auto brake, optimum line, and so on. The catch, of course, is you are basically doing the equivalent of GT races and test drives where you need to negotiate chicanes, hard braking turns without spinning the car, hairpins, and so on, often with competition.\n\nBeware that even "easy" is not easy on a track when any sort of cutting across a corner may earn you a warning, and repeated offense will earn you a DNF / DQ (did not finished, disqualified).\n\nEach era as mentioned before, has a lot of vehicles to try. Think the old EA "Porsche Unleashed" and you're not far off, except there is no point to point races, only circuits, and evolution is combined with factory driver, but cut up into multiple eras, each with separate progress.\n\nThe main problem is the AI is not very tunable, and with races of only a few laps, any mishap will mean you fail to achieve your goal. Furthermore, some of the missions are next to impossible given the required car. For example, one of the missions I got stuck on was "dodge the simulated debris on track, while still achieve required laptime". There are like six different "debris" sets and they are in the driving line, so you can no longer take optimal line to retain speed, and your car is not exactly a speed demon (but an 1950's UNsporty Ferrari) and I'm always 2 seconds short and I can't find any way to make up the time any more. And that's on EASY. There's also medium and hard with even tighter time requirements.\n\nOn the races, I can usually beat out the competition. It's these timed races that got me.\n\nThe game is basically GT racing, so braking and precision maneuvering through tight corners and chicanes is expected, and that, I'm not very good at. You may do better.\n\nWith dozens of Ferrari vehicles to unlock in career mode, and a dozen tracks to experience, this driving sim really needs a wheel for full enjoyment, and some patience. Don't expect to jump in and master the cars just like that. Ferarris are race cars, and deserve some respect.","October 27, 2013","true","16.0"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Also has good force feedback that transmits plenty of road feel to the wheel.\n+ Teaches you about Ferrari's history by providing a wide variety of Ferrari's creation throughout the eras. All of them are meticulously detailed and sound nice as well.\n+ Robust replay feature that allows players to watch the race from AIs' perspective as well. What's more, replays can be saved too.\n+ Better physics than Shift 2: Unleashed so you don't have to turn all the aids on in order to drive clean.\n+ Great damage both visual and performance-wise on Formula 1 cars.\n+ Good graphics that makes you awe from time to time despite being a tad rough around the edges.\n+ Lots of contents for the current discount price of $3.99.\n\n- NFS: Shift physics. There's no getting away with that. Classic cars feel quite good but the experience deteriorates in the faster cars. Make even the slightest contact with other cars and you'll have to brace for a somersault.\n- No option to individually tune driver aids. Auto-clutch and ABS can't be turned off at all.\n- DUMB AIs. They're very slow and are prone to amateur mistakes. Expect to overtake all of them before even getting into turn 1 and build a 15 second gap by lap 2. I managed to fall to last place twice in a 3 lap race and STILL managed to win at the hardest difficulty setting.\n- Lackluster damage in all the cars excluding the F1 cars. Slight scratches, dents, and misalligned steering rack is just about all the damage you get.\n- Time trial in hard difficulty setting requires you to set ridiculously fast lap times, but there's NO incentive in playing the missions at higher difficulty or completing bonus objectives. So why even bother?\n- Missions are mandatory to unlock the wide roster of tracks and cars. Yet only about 20% of them provide unlocks upon completion. Other 80% have no rewards whatsoever, giving a feel that developers crammed in missions just in order to keep the players continue playing.\n- Repetitive. All missions are either 'set a lap time', 'overtake your opponents before the race ends', or 'get a podium finish'.\n- You'll most likely give up on pursuing on unlocking the cars and tracks because of its tediousness. It's strongly recommended that you use a mod that unlocks all the cars and tracks.\n\nIn conclusion, it's Need for Speed: Shift, but with slightly worse overall gameplay and Ferraris. It's a great buy at $3.99, but there's no reason to bother spending $20 or so.","December 31, 2013","false","11.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Enjoy!\n\n\nIn my respect this game is mainly for all non arcade racers out there.\nI couldn't believe that arcade racers would rate this over Need for Speed Most Wanted (1)/ Underground. ;)\nThis is not an arcady game- it's a game for players trying to perfect their driving skills!\n\n\nThe greatest strengs of this game are clearly it's very convincing driving model and\nit's variety of Ferrari cars from the beginning of their\ncareer as a racing car manufacturer, to what they are now.\n\n\nI use a Xbox controller and the steering works fine but the steering customisation options (there are quite a few)\ndon't provide you with the in my respect perfect setup I'm used to from Grid (1).\n\nIt is ok to drive but for me it's bit a pain having to fling my left thumbstick around ever so slightly not to oversteer or force it in one direction not to understeer depending on the vehicles speed.\nYou can turn the speed regulation off,\nbut unfortunately the steering vector is bound to a\n(beginning of a sine wave)-inclination-vector so you have the same problem with over and understeering\nand there is no way to change that. :(\n\n\nThe selection of tracks isn't bad and they are all very authentic, but let's the demanding players a bit down.\nMe the most out of the non implemented Nürnburgring! :(\nAtleast the great Nordschleife is there.\n\n\n\nI haven't tested the single player extesively but it seemes to be pretty standard for a racing simulation.\n\nAll the cars and tracks you sure DO want for multiplayer, you actually have to unlock in the single player camplaign.\nFor all you multiplayer-racing-geeks!! Here's the download-link to all the cars and tracks: http://www.nogripracing.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1666910#post1666910\nYou only have to complete the first mission in first place and then you got them!\n\n\nThe multiplayer is quite straight forward and bound to the games for windows live service.\nYou can change all needed settings for the race except for driving the track backwards\nand you can't drive at night. You can't let it rain either!\nIt's also a shame, that you can't get damadged in multiplayer wich is actually a nice feature when you drive alone!\nAlso there are some bugs (very rare), that if you drive with certain cars on certain tracks they will just collide with "nothing"\nfrom time to time! xD\n\n\nThe graphics can look very nice.\nPerformance isn't bad for a Xbox port but I wished there were more options to tweak.\nThe dynamic reflections are hitting my system quite hard and look ugly at low settings anyway!\nThe game, for me, is running at 28-60 FPS at the lowest settings in 1600:900- depending on the tracks detaildness.\n\nMy System Specs: 2,4 GHz Harddrive, NVIDIA GT 600m (not overclocked) and 8 GB Ram.\n\n\nI hope I could provide you with an good overview of the games pros and cons.\n\nCheers!","December 7, 2013","true","11.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

But you cant accomplish the goals because AI cars screw it up often\n- I had a hard time controlling the cars, they felt like soapbox cars to drive. While being drunk. Didnt make it easier to stay on the track, especially on advanced stages with higher speed levels\n- Unlogical physics. Though it is nice to have some physics in the game (basically, looks pretty good), most of the time you crash with an opponent, the opponent will stay on track while you spin round.\n- Career Mode. You have to win one race after another, you're not allowed to fail or skip an event, and if you're stuck on a mission, that's it. No more proceeding (Well, to be fair, that the usual way a game works, but with the aspects above, it gets tough after some time), no more new cars and tracks.\n\nIf you're into Ferraris and the history of the Scuderia, this could be a game for you however.

I decided to pick it up not only because I am racing fan in general but also because I love Ferrari.\n\nSo here is my take on the game.\n\nThe graphics in my opinion are staggering. The amount of detail put into the cars themselves in this game are beyond anything Ive seen in most racing games. Not only has every level of intricate detail been placed outside the car, but the interior is where it shines as well. Having sat in several Ferraris, its amazing to see every dial and vent modeled in 3D with shadows and texture. Reflections and detail ripple off the cars. The racing circuits themselves are just as good. Possibly due to my hardware, but I have not seen any graphics problems or anomalies whilst racing.\n\nFrom the cars Ive ran so far with, the sound is on par. Each engine has a different subtle tone between cars that helps with the realism.\n\nThe actual controls of the game, at first, seem something to be desired. I picked up an Xbox 360 controller before I bought this game, and I planned on using that from the get go. That being said, I ask you this question: How many high performance (300+ HP) cars have you driven lately? If you can imagine the amount of power these Ferraris generate, you will soon learn that the actual physics of the cars are actually quite good. While not perfect in any real sense, after several laps I was able to properly handle the car and start pushing lap times.\n\nThe AI is ok. Ive raced better. But it works and still makes for an enjoyable race.\n\nThier is no car customization other than paint colors. Ferrari wanted you to race the car how they designed it. Fine with me.\n\nAnd to finish my review off, yes this does use GFWL, which may in the future be removed, however, it didnt ruin the game for me nor take away the beauty of the Italian made sports cars.\n\nRecommended for people who enjoy racing or Ferraris in general.

Nice physics, works well with a steering wheel and the graphics are nice.\n\nThe difficulty level, though.. urgh. Starts out nice, but after 2-3 hours of play it all of a sudden just whacks right up on the difficulty like a wall. It's all of sudden brutal, giving you only just enough time to do an absolutely perfect run at full speed or failing and having to try again and again. Do a 3 lap race and if you stray too far off the track for even a millisecond, it'll disqualify you and end the race. Honestly, it's just unnecessary. Also, GFWL (Games for Windows Live)... urgh. It'll work, but it can be a pain to get GFWL working nowadays.\n\nThat said, the game is OK and worth it if it's on super sale. I won't recommend it, though, because of the difficulty wall. They should have balanced it better than this.\n\nNOTE: I had a problem with the trees not displaying properly (guessing it's an ATI incompatibility issue) but it was easily fixed.

The game is a port from the Xbox and it never saves your controls. There are only a few positives on my side. This game is mainly focused on Ferrari as the title says.\n\nFirstly I don't like how the game is just a failed port from the Xbox 360. The mouse doesn't work with any of the UI unfortunatley but you just have to figure out how to configure the keyboard with the buttons at the bottom that say "X, Y, A, B". I found navigating it quite easy because I used to play on a 360 but now im not sure why the kept that all in the PC version. The game only starts you off with a few cars and tracks which all seem impossible to play.\n\nNow the reason why im writing this negativley is because the whole game feels extremely hard on easy difficulty and to drive you have all of these buttons that don't have any tutorials. I used a save file with the game because unlike games where all of the tracks and cars are unlocked and you just have to get money to buy new cars (Forza motorsport 4). The game has a nice graphics engine which is easially run on any computer. My older computer (Dell 9200) could run it at around 60fps. The reason I didnt list the settings is because there is none, no resolution change or motion blur disable. The game is designed to be on the Xbox with its simple graphics and forward facing sprite crowds. The sounds in the game are ok, they sound like a car would but the fact that the crowd is so loud you can hear them over the car sometimes. I would reccommend disabling all of the hud so that you can see the entire track ahead of you. The game is rather old now and it still has a community of around 200 people.\n\nIf you wan't a realistic driving game that has nice graphics I would reccomend a game like "The Crew" or "Forza motorsport" (it can easially be emmulated onto the PC). So overall; if you like Ferraris and one type of car only then this is most certainly the way to go, if you wan't a nicer more modern game that isnt ported from the 360 in such an awful way go for the games that I listed. This game isnt the greatest and I can understand that porting from the 360 wasnt to great back then, niether was the graphics. The game is not worth buying, unless you're a massive Ferrari fan who has an extra £15 or £3.75 to spend on the game then go for it.\n50% I would say, not the best but a semi decent game.","November 29, 2015","false","14.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Ferrari Racing Legends is a sheer driving pleasure. Slightly Mad Studios have done a fantastic job with the driving physics and making the game both accessible and exciting, as they did with Shift. The car roster is huge, and has a lot of variety too. There are some great tracks here from classics like Monza and Silverstone to favourites like Nordschleiffe and Mugello GP. The sound of the engines and life-like interior views coupled with refined driving mechanics make this a blast for racing enthusiasts. The controls are great and there is extensive support for wheels, controllers and keyboard. The events are scenarios, so you could start a race on the 3rd lap in last or it could be a more arcade-style overtaking exercise, where you have to pass all the cars within a time or distance limit. The variety in cars, tracks and races is surprising. But make no mistake, this game is pure racing nothing more, nothing less. There are no upgrades or RPG elements it's just you, the car and the track, although you have to unlock most of the cars and tracks through the campaign. There are no distractions, and there are of course time trials, quick races and multiplayer alongside the very long campaign. The only problem I've found with this game is that environment textures are terrible trees keep popping in and frequent graphical glitches with the scenery when using certain anti-aliasing. Other than that, it's exactly what a racing game should be.","December 21, 2013","true","22.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I understand some people need or prefer to use the electronic assists but in this game even the most novice driver would be wishing s/he could tone them down.  They have ruined the game completely though, for example no matter how many times you select a gear it will always select the gear the computer wants you to use and the brake assist just causes you to lock up all the time and the traction control seems to have recently escaped from a mental asylum.  The worst thing though is the steering assist, even with the car parked and not moving the steering assist is frantically moving the wheel in an attempt to put you somewhere it wants to be (although I have no idea where that may be).\n\nUltimately there is a lot of good in this game (e.g. tracks, cars and story/career mode) however the driver assists are so horrible that they ruin the game completely and the fact you can't turn these assists off just kills the game completely.\n\nWorst game ever.","July 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I knew I wasn't getting a superb product for it's a pricetag, but I expected a tribute to Ferrari to have at least an okay quality. A shame that they fail to deliver the minimum expectations.\n\nIf you like Ferrari's and think you at least get a nice collectable... it's not worth it. Go watch youtube videos or read the wikipedia.

For a Ferrari-lover, this is a dream come true!  This is an outstanding title, with plenty of excellent tracks and a huge selection of beautiful Ferraris!  The graphics are great and can be improved further by editing your graphics config file in the game's user folder in your Documents.  By default, the game doesn't set the graphics to full blast.  Then tweak your graphics card settings for the game and behold the Ferraris in all their beauty!  Also, if you're having crash issues, set your controller up as a "custom" and you won't have any more trouble.  Gameplay is fun and challenging, but not too difficult for the average sim racer.

It's probably not a bad game but the port from xbox feels like it's made by a failed student. When using the mouse to navigate the menu in-race your mouse curser will end up on your secondary monitor, or it'll make the menu flicker back and forth. Also you can't remap controls from inside a race, and since you don't know what button the 'a' and 'b' buttons from an xbox controller are represented by, chances are you're going to use the mouse I just mentioned didn't work very well.\n\nOn keyboard, you can't really play though. The driving aid will constantly try to correct your movement, which means you're never truely in control of the car. Sometimes it'll turn way more than you expect, sometimes way less. Sometimes you'll do wheelspin, sometimes you'll understeer. And you can't know in advance. It's frustrating.\n\nThe cockpits in the game looks awesome though and I think on an xbox the game might be rather good.\nIf you want to buy this game, at least make sure you've got an xbox controller.","December 16, 2013","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a Ferrari-lover, this is a dream come true!  This is an outstanding title, with plenty of excellent tracks and a huge selection of beautiful Ferraris!  The graphics are great and can be improved further by editing your graphics config file in the game's user folder in your Documents.  By default, the game doesn't set the graphics to full blast.  Then tweak your graphics card settings for the game and behold the Ferraris in all their beauty!  Also, if you're having crash issues, set your controller up as a "custom" and you won't have any more trouble.  Gameplay is fun and challenging, but not too difficult for the average sim racer.  The AI can be beat.  I'd say it's just about right for difficulty.  Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends is one of the great bargains on Steam.  This title is highly recommended!","December 3, 2014","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's probably not a bad game but the port from xbox feels like it's made by a failed student. When using the mouse to navigate the menu in-race your mouse curser will end up on your secondary monitor, or it'll make the menu flicker back and forth. Also you can't remap controls from inside a race, and since you don't know what button the 'a' and 'b' buttons from an xbox controller are represented by, chances are you're going to use the mouse I just mentioned didn't work very well.\n\nOn keyboard, you can't really play though. The driving aid will constantly try to correct your movement, which means you're never truely in control of the car. Sometimes it'll turn way more than you expect, sometimes way less. Sometimes you'll do wheelspin, sometimes you'll understeer. And you can't know in advance. It's frustrating.\n\nThe cockpits in the game looks awesome though and I think on an xbox the game might be rather good.\nIf you want to buy this game, at least make sure you've got an xbox controller.","December 16, 2013","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure why the reviews aren't higher.\n\nThere's nothing like driving an F40. It's a good racing game, I would consider it a simulator but I use some of the assists like automatic because I just find it more enjoyable in this game.\n\nThe legend mode is well done and is a good challenge.\n\nThe only bad thing is that most of the cars are locked and there is a ton of work to unlock them.  At least the F40 is freely selectable early on.","October 18, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
