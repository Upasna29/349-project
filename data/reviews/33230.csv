"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/33230/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction:We have all heard the phrase that “nothing beats the original” at least once in our lives. Assassin’s Creed II is a living testimony against these wise words. It is the much-improved sequel to its 2007 predecessor published by Ubisoft, and the first of a new trilogy of games (II, Brotherhood, and Revelations). While the first game in the franchise had a huge amount of potential, it fell a little bit short in the eyes of many. However, Assassin’s Creed II earned an almost unanimous critical acclaim - and with a good reason. Like the original installment, ACII remains an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. Setting it apart, however, is its new approach to less repetitive gameplay combined with solid story development… And yes, it does take the time to fill the majority of the plot holes left open from its forerunner.\n\nAs a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the first game, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first installment of Assassin’s Creed.\n\nStory: This game picks up precisely where the first left off. Abstergo. Desmond remains a prisoner of the modern-day Templars, as he begins to comprehend the significance of his genetic memories - and the danger of the Apple of Eden falling into the wrong hands. Before he has too much time to brood, the game kicks off with a fast pace, springing Desmond from Abstergo, and introducing him to the modern-day Assassins. With their help, and their version of the Animus, Desmond submits himself to relive the experiences of another ancestor in hopes of becoming an assassin for their own cause.\n\nThis time he finds himself in 15th-century Italy, at the height of the Renaissance, following the life of another ancestor called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio is a noble who finds himself betrayed by the cities rulers, and sets out on a quest for vengeance.\n\nGameplay: There is a lot to be said about the mechanics and gameplay elements that Assassin’s Creed II introduced. Too often, a sequel is just a repeat of the first game, with a different storyline. This is not the case here. Ubisoft did an excellent job immersing the player in what is now a believable world, retaining some of its original mechanics. The beautifully designed free-running system from it’s forerunner has returned, only this time it permits the player to move faster: Thus, cover more ground in less time, and make exploration much more satisfying. As additional encouragement to explore the region, they have hidden treasure chests in every location - Low on coin? No problem! Either go find these hidden goodies, or just kill a guard and pick his pockets.\n\nI’d also like to take a moment to pay homage to the improved battle system. The combat aesthetics are absolutely stunning, making almost any fight appear brutal and bloody. Furthermore, you now have numerous weapons to pick from at the blacksmith shops, each offering its own selection of kill animations.\n\nThe quests also have a more modernized efficiency to them, and appear on the map as exclamation marks to guide the player to the next objective. As I have previously stated, they are also a lot less repetitive. You no longer follow the same formula in each quest, which is hugely refreshing. Should Ezio run into trouble during any of these missions, he can opt to blend in just about any crowd of people, or purchase assistance from his allied factions: thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries. Just be careful not to draw too much unwanted attention, or you’ll have to go tear down wanted posters to reduce your notoriety.\n\nThe purchasing system is really enjoyable. You can change the color of your robes, buy upgrades, weapons, armor, health potions, and even artwork. Once you reach the village of Monteriggioni, you can begin the process of renovating the city to generate your own income through your investments.\n\nFinally, keep an eye open for glyphs by using eagle vision. You won’t want to miss out on the story that their puzzles will reveal.\n\nControls: The controls are relatively friendly, but no longer offer support with re-arranging your buttons. A controller is still the best way to get around, in my opinion, although you cannot re-assign your button placement at will this time. I still do not recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse, but if that suits you, by all means do so.\n\nTargeting remains a bit tricky, and you can’t always be sure that you will hit what you’re aiming for, but it is something you can work around. From time to time, you might find yourself changing your viewpoint and inadvertently targeting something else, oops!\n\nGraphics: Assassin’s Creed has been known to focus a lot of attention on their atmosphere, so it is only fitting that the graphics are as polished as they are. This game offers beautiful and breathtaking sights, and paints them in a realistic light. It is really hard to criticize this aspect of the game, because they did such an amazing job with fine-tuning the scenery to fit their setting. I absolutely love how the game looks and feels, and I’m pretty sure you will too.\n\nSound: The music is beautiful, and the voice tracks are considerably less annoying than its predecessor. The combination of assassinating a target to the score of dramatic music can only be described as a rewarding experience. Though it should be noted that the entirely optional use of subtitles will help with translating the incorporated use of the Italian language. Overall the sounds contribute immensely to the games atmosphere, which is something that I will likely continuously praise in this particular franchise.\n\nReplay Value: Assassin’s Creed II is among my favourites in the series, thus far, and I would definitely recommend a replay at some point. Then again, replay value is entirely dependent on the person playing the game.","November 13, 2014","true","49.1"," 135 of 137 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","135","137","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifeellikeasir/recommended/33230/","ifeellikeasir","Like[A]SiR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifeellikeasir/","1081 products in account","Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.\nPlot  – If you haven’t  played the previous game yet, like I did, you’ll probably be confused on what is happening during the first part of this game. But even so, the writers did a great job of giving out stories about the happenings during the previous game, giving you at least an explanation on what is going on.  Similar to first one, you will still play as Desmond Miles. But instead of tracing back to Altair, you will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance period. You will discover your father’s secret and join the Assassin Order to help them end their feud against the Templars and finally achieve true peace.\n\nThe game is long enough for you to be satisfied, as I’ve poured more than 20 hours to finish the story. Even though it may sound generic to some, but I assure you that this will leave you pleased as this is one of the greatest stories told in the franchise.\n\nEnvironment and Design  –  It is exactly how the Renaissance was pictured in the paintings we can see on museums. The game also boasts the popular and fictional landmarks that are found in different parts of the map. Other than the resemblance, most of them were also a big part of the main story. And this is a great way for players to learn about these historical places.\n\nThe cities have the golden yellow effect, though it is probably just the sun, giving it the nostalgic effect. With five different maps that you can go to, you’ll have a huge sandbox to roam and play on. Thus, they’ve included fast travel stations for you to switch into different maps trouble-free. And this will come handy as you progress towards the game when you start jumping into different maps or going back and forth to your own villa. In this, you can manage the infrastructures to be built and a chance to increase your income.\n\nGameplay  – Even though the game is about being on stealth to pick off unguarded enemies, parkouring from different rooftops to get to your objective, it also offer an impressive close combat fights. Even though there are times that the game doesn’t give you choices on how you want to assassinate a target, it is still satisfying task to do. If ever you’re in help, there are three different factions that you can rely on. Obstacle course or puzzles can also be found in-game, even though they aren’t that easy they are also not that too hard. But in fact, during the start of each puzzle, the camera will give you an idea on how to complete the course. For a game during its time, these features are awesome and very satisfying.\n\nControls  - I had trouble playing the game for the first time, I even had some trouble towards the end. First, the buttons shown in HUD aren't clear. I had to check the controls in the options just to see what keys to press to do a specific action. I didn't know how to sprint not until I finished the first fight of Ezio. And I'm a little impatient person, and the game punishes you for that. Specially during free running, I tend to hold down the Spacebar, even if I don't really have to, resulting for me to fall down.\n\nConclusion  - If you haven't tried any Assassin's Creed game before, just like me, I recommend that you either start with this or the first game. Whichever, you can assure that you will have a great time on finishing them. And for me, this is one of the best story this franchise has.\n\nSince this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.\n\nThank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood - Review\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review","October 23, 2015","true","26.7"," 150 of 157 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","150","157","14","5"

The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.\n\nYour hero in Assasin's Creed 2 is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note (you can even switch to playing the game in Italian with english subtitles!).\n\nThe gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.\n\nAlso, it easily has one of the best soundtrack! The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc). The developers really went out of their way with this one.\n\nThis remains one of my favorite series of all time and I highly recommend it to all gamers. You might even learn a little italian too. xD\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0i6YFrSs6c\n","December 4, 2013","true","24.5"," 184 of 206 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","184","206","0","14"

Despite his lack of training, Ezio immediately sprints out the batcave and begins to clean the streets (a broomstick is a viable weapon in this game, apparently). With the help of his good friend Leonardo DaVinci (French for Pennyworth), Ezio sets out with a positive arsenal of exotic weaponry; from an early Batarang, which due to technical limitations of the time, only has 1 hyper-sharp blade, and doesn't really come back after use, to the grapple, which instead of attaching to buildings from a long distance, functions as a way of holding close targets in place - with optional fatal injury.\nWhat unfolds is a spellbinding and beautiful tale of family, redemption, revenge and mass murder.\nYeah, the whole "no killing" thing hasn't really been established yet - but  let's be honest here, I think slamming someone in the neck with a car door and leaving them, broken, miles from the nearest hospital also counts as murder.\nAlong with a majestic soundtrack, the game also improves immersion with a launcher inspired by renaissance-era technology. I found the 30 or so minutes I had to spend getting the piece of horse dung to work highly immersive, which, coupled with the painfully intrusive notification system, really made me feel the wonderment and awe of the renaissance.","July 10, 2015","true","44.9"," 334 of 454 people (74%) found this review helpful 625 people found this review funny","74","334","454","625","17"

It was during these modern day sequences that we were introduced to Dr. Warren Vidic, who heads up the program where the memories of ones ancestors are accessed through a device known as the Animus. It is here that Desmond Miles was forced to experience his ancestors memories from the time of the Third Crusade - An assassin known as Altair who would break the three tenants of his Assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the Templar, Robert de Sable, who was said to be after a powerful artifact known as the Piece of Eden.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205740584\nKilling de Sable would reveal that the very man at the head of the Assassin's Brotherhood was a Templar himself and one who was already in possession of this powerful artifact. Confronting and finally killing his leader, the artifact would later reveal a holographic map showing Altair/Desmond where the other artifacts were hidden throughout the world, artifacts so powerful they could change the very destiny of man. Artifacts that Abstergo would kill to get their hands on. It would also be revealed that a former test subject had been leaving cryptic messages only Desmond could decode that would foretell the end of the world.\n\nAssassin's Creed II wastes no time in picking up where the first left off. Having discovered that Dr. Vidics assistant Lucy Stillman is a mole, she eventually breaks Desmond out of Abstergo and ferries him off to a safe house where a group of her colleagues have developed an improved Animus. Desmond must once again enter the Animus and access his ancestral memories in the hope that more pieces of the artifact will be revealed before Abstergo can learn of them. This time around we are witness to late fifteenth century Florence as we are introduced to a young nobleman by the name of Ezio Auditore da Firenz who after witnessing the death of his father and brother - brought about by a corrupt official working for the Templar's - is then forced to flee to his Uncles villa with his life and that of his mother and sister hanging in the balance. It is here that Ezio is taught the ways of the Assassin's Creed by his uncle who eventually sets him on a course of revenge\n\nHistorically recreating locations such as Venice, Tuscany and Florence the player is introduced to this wonderfully created digital world through main missions and side missions (Rocksteady could take a leaf out of Ubisoft Montreals book on how to create a living and breathing digital world that is a pleasure to explore and not a bore). The world we get to inhabit as our playground is a wonderful recreation of late fifteenth century Italy even going as far as introducing us to a lovable Leonardo Da Vinci who Ezio befriends early in the game and who exists to help decipher the many numerous codex's Ezio comes into contact with. Spanning a period of twenty years the game is a particularly massive one and to be honest this sometimes acts to the detriment of the actual game itself. Assassin's Creed II requires a lot of dedication and patience from its players to progress through and to be honest it starts to suffer near the end because of it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204341941\nWhilst most certainly a massive improvement over the original in terms of scope, design and story telling it does come at a cost where the game gets so wrapped up in its own awesomeness that it starts to make itself rather redundant, sluggish and dare I say - boring - towards the end with missions that simply exist to pad out an already lengthy game. Just as you think the story is starting to wind down to its conclusion the game will throw another mammoth task your way that will lead into another mammoth task and this may try a very few many gamers patience and tolerance levels as it did mine. Having to find out that I needed to kill nine Lieutenants of the Templar Order towards the end of the game made me want to curse to the heavens after already inhabiting this world for a good 60+ hours. For all the frustration the game induces near its end, it's carried forward by a serpentine plot that is less over the top than the original but far more thrilling and engaging. The ending is a little bit of a disappointment when you finally have Rodrigo Borgias in your assassin's sights. After all the build up this encounter is rather dull and lifeless but thankfully is concluded by a spectacular sequence I will not reveal for those that have yet to complete the adventure.\n\nSpending so much time in the shoes of Ezio what ultimately emerges is a gaming protagonist for the ages. Voiced impeccably by a first rate cast, Ezio is immediately likable and enduring and emerges as a fully rounded and developed character that one becomes incredibly vested in early on in the game. I can see why Ubisoft was a little reluctant to pack him away after the adventure concluded going as far as creating two fully fledged sequels continuing his adventures alone. Where as Altair was a one dimensional figure from the past and not particularly likable it's the exact opposite when it comes to Ezio who can be ruthless and cunning but also generous and incredibly warmhearted.\n\nAssassin's Creed II when looked at holistically is an impressive game indeed with the graphics looking quite spectacular for the most part although you can see the games original console limitations with muddy textures abound everywhere. Audio, however, from the clash of swords to the sweeping and epic soundtrack through to the incredible voice cast is all top notch throughout the entire game. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed II emerges as a game I loved for the most part where it not for all its irritating inconsistencies towards the end (those final missions were a test of endurance and patience and frankly I could have done without them as it employs one of my pet hates in gaming where more and more enemies are thrown at the player to try and give the illusion of a suddenly ramped up difficulty). This ended up being a slight killjoy rather than the thrill ride I was expecting for a conclusion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=209759072\nI still thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time spent in Ezio's company and I look forward to continuing my adventures with him in the future, just hoping and praying slightly that his remaining two adventures are a much tighter affair than his first one.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 13, 2014","true","70.6"," 118 of 155 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","118","155","0","12"

A whole bunch of new tricks have been added to help you live our your fantasies of being an assassin.  Some sorely needed tricks missing from the original game was the double execution, and the double jump while climbing.  Also the you can loot fallen enemies for money and an occasional refilling of your consumables.  You can now buy upgrades to your armor, which improve your fighting ability.  Another new addition to the game is new weapons, no longer stuck using predetermined weapons assigned by how far in the game you've gotten.  If you want to use a mace... have at it.. want to use a sword... you're golden pony boy..  Feeling like a two hander..  find your locale guard and slay him..  You can now roll around like the executioner.  Chopping and Slopping all over town..\n\nThe story..  You return as Desmond Miles, a man captured by Abstergo Industries and forced to relive the memories of his ancestors.  Easy enough...  except the fact Abstergo plans to use Desmond until he's no longer viable..  (ok that's totally not cool)..  All is not lost as the first mission in the game sees Demond escape the clutches of Abstergo with the help of the sexy and talented Lucy.  He escapes from the comfortable confines of Abstergo industries to the truck of a car...   Meeting with a group of assassins who want Desmond to go back into the Animus so they can stop Abstergo.. (Wait I thought he was rescued so he didn't have to go back into the Animus... umm alrighty then)  This time around you step into the shoes of Enzio Auditore, a playboy, slacker, layabout... Although he's the son of a wealthy banker in the 1500's so what else would you expect from him.   After a major betrayal (I won't spoil it) he goes off to do what anyone would do when they are betrayed, get revenge by killing anyone involved.    The rest of the story is your typical, kill this person, rescue this person, kiss that person, while along the way building up your Uncles home town.  As a side note I personally found the Enzio story to be far more interesting than the one presented in the original game for Altaire.\n\nGameplay..  The game play moves away from the repetitive nature of the first game.  Where the first game required you to fulfill 3 our of 6 events to unlock an assassination, this game abandoned that in favor of a more or less story driven progression system.  Now you do story missions to push forward the game.  Plenty of stuff aside from story missions exist, such as Assassination contract, races, fighting events.  Aside from those events the game also has collectibles, gone are the flags and  in their place you have Feathers, View Points, Weapons and Armors.  New execution and climbing animations have been added...  No more killing enemies one at a time with the double execution..   You also have an upgrade-able base, and the inclusion of money, which has some effects early on in the game, but about the mid way point you'll have far more money then you could ever spend, so don't fret too much if you're only pushing a few thousand after a few hours...  Once you get your city upgraded a decent bit you'll start pulling in money hand over foot.\n\nCombat..  Numerous changes to combat made AC 2 seem like a totally different game.  Double executions, no more regenerating health bars (you'll need medicine to heal yourself this time around), the AI has improved slightly, no more sitting and waiting to counter attack, this time around you can button mash provided you have decent enough reflexes to counter attack enemies.  A few new tools added to the arsenal as well..   You now find yourself with a (very limited) pistol, and what good assassin would be caught dead without a smoke ball (perfect for killing high ranking officials... or getting caught with your much larger best friends wife).  Old classics like throwing knifes make a return but they are almost as limited as the pistol in terms of usefulness.\n\nI'll recommend Assassin Creed 2, compared to the first game, AC 2 is like night and day, for being one of the earliest entries into a fairly long series I would personally say it's held out quite nicely in almost every category that matters.  So when asking yourself if you should buy AC 2, I'll leave you with a single question..  Do you enjoy fun video games?  If you answered yes!!! Then by all means buy AC 2 and let your inner killer out..  just remember no shame exist in throwing pesky archers off high rooftops..  It can be the most fun you've ever had :-)","January 25","true","23.4"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","50","56","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/33230/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Ubisoft Montreal left plenty of room to build upon the core concept established in Assassin’s Creed, developing their burgeoning modern day story of Desmond, a test subject who is made to regress back in time to former lives through the Animus. Assassin’s Creed II begins where the last game left off, with Desmond still confined to the Abstergo laboratories, staring at a wall of indecipherable code.After a hasty escape from Abstergo with Lucy in tow, it’s not long before you’re willingly lying back on an upgraded Animus, ready to delve into the life and times of yet another assassin. The assassin in question is Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman living in Renaissance Italy amid great political turmoil, brutal violence and emerging transcendent art.Unfolding over thirty years, Ezio’s story is far greater in scope, seeing the young petulant noble suffer through family tragedy, taking him on an epic quest for vengeance as he adopts his father’s mantle of master assassin. While the transformation from immature teen to super assassin seems awfully quick and more than a little unconvincing, there’s no disputing how much more fluid and satisfying to control Ezio is when compared to his medieval predecessor, Altair. Your protagonist isn’t the only aspect of Assassin’s Creed II to be expanded since the previous game though – every single facet of the game has been enhanced to an astonishing degree, far exceeding our expectations by a considerable margin. Not only have the fundamental mechanics been refined, making ACII a more pleasurable experience than the first game, but the sheer depth, breadth and variety of activities on offer is utterly staggering.Renaissance Italy itself is a glory to behold – a stark contrast to AC1’s cold grey and blue alleyways – Assassin’s Creed II’s regions are liberally draped in a startling palette of warm, sun-kissed hues all rendered in intricate detail.ACII’s Italy is not only home to Ezio’s story-led missions, but a host of other distractions, like courier deliveries, races, viewpoints and non-story related assassination contracts. Item collection still features heavily, but is nothing like the 400 or so flags you had to gather in the first game.Still the crux of the game remains in the assassinations and with the array of weapons and new combat opportunities available to you, the number of methods you can utilise to dispatch your targets is massively increased. Abilities such as aerial assassinations, ledge kills, poison blades and more give you a greater variety of options, some of which are unashamedly cool.Assassin’s Creed II is something altogether unique in its uninhibited size and wealth of ambition, few games managing to measure up in terms of depth and detail. Boasting a suitably grand soundtrack, majestic aesthetics and masterful level design, Assassin’s Creed II is everything you could have ever wished for and so much more. Overall 9/10.","October 15, 2014","true","28.9"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","45","49","0","1"

Assassin's Creed 2 is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed.\n\nDesmond Miles was about to be executed but were saved due to the intervention by Lucy Stillman. It appears that Lucy is an assassin in disguise. She helps Desmond escape Abstergo. After some rough journey, Desmond finally reach the assassin's hideout. There he meet Rebecca and Shaun. Desmond needs to learn how to become a real assassin. So there he goes again, into the Animus. This time, Desmond will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, an Italian Nobleman.\n\nThe gameplay then. Ubisoft really learned their mistake this time I think, and not just that, the gameplay aren't just no longer repetitive, but really expanded. You can now earn money and buy weapons and upgrades to improve yourself. You're going to pickpocket letters no longer, but you're going to steal money instead. Notoriety system are now included, which mean, the more bad things you do, it will get you wanted and will make the guards aware of your present and at some notoriety level, will attack you on sight. You can also now hire a thief or some mercenary to help you do some task or distract the guards. Ezio can now swim in water.\n\nThe graphics are also improved. Ragdoll physics are even better than the previous and the Italian environment are really much detailed and feels more alive. The water effects, the skies, the textures, the lightning, everything is better. The animation may look pretty much the same with the previous game, but with better physics.\n\nThis may be the best Assassin's Creed game yet. The game is very stable, giving you much freedom while the story still quite linear. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","June 1, 2014","true","34.8"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","1"

I stated in my review, though, that it felt like a disjointed collection of minigames.\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 ("AC2") takes those individual game elements from the first Assassin's Creed, and remixes them to create a game that's far more entertaining.\n\nFor this second game, the developers kept the stuff that works (climbing towers, free-running), and eliminated the things that were less fun (eavesdropping, picking pockets, long combat sequences). You're doing a better mix of stuff in AC2.\n\nThere are several indoor locations in this game, and the addition of storefronts on the city streets makes these Italian cities feel much more alive than the dusty, beautiful, barren cities of the first game.\n\nAC2 offers a variety of things for completionists to work at. Weapons and armor to purchase, art to collect from city merchants, Investments to be made in the infrastructure and services of the city around your family's villa. Feathers to collect from high city ledges, and a conspiracy theory to unravel. So many things to do! Bopping between them is great fun.\n\nThere are typical side-quests: assassinate so-and-so in service of your mentor, beat up someone's cheating husband, race through the city against a timer, deliver package from point A to point B. Yada yada yada.\n\nHowever, there are also a few exceptional sidequests in the guise of raiding underground tombs or Templar hideouts. These are masterful puzzles, in which you must make your way carefully through a maze of acrobatic leaps and climbs to obtain a special prize. This style of gameplay in AC2 is reminiscent of Mirror's Edge or Portal 2, in the way it challenges you to puzzle your way through an enclosed area that is reluctant to reveal its secrets. These special side quests each take about 45 minutes to complete. They were a high point of the game for me.\n\nI have two complaints. First, I would have preferred more stealth gameplay, and an option to complete the game without murdering hundreds of innocent city guards. Don't get me wrong; I found it very satisfying to pull an unsuspecting victim off a rampart and watch him fall to his death. But the body count is very high in this game, and the gratuitous murder sprees don't really mesh with the main character's “reluctant hero” personality.\n\nMy other complaint with AC2 is its excessive length. The gameplay here is fun, but it doesn't change much over time. What you're doing in the 5th hour is very similar to what you're doing in the 30th hour. I spent over 40 hours in this game, and I was hoping for a finale after 20. This is a rare example of a game where too much of a good thing makes the overall experience less pleasurable, less memorable.\n\nBut don't let that stop you from playing. AC2 is frequently on sale for $5, and I can't think of many games that deliver better entertainment at any price.\n","July 30, 2013","true","45.5"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

And it's really hard to describe it without going into what the game improved upon AC1.\n\nAC2 introduces a lot of things to make the world much more interesting. The sidequests are significantly more varied and dynamic. The guard AI more competantly follows the player and checks nearby hiding spots. The guards themselves come bearing different weapons and tactics to attack the player with. Assassinations can now be completed in several different ways. They added an economy to the world that not only allows you to customize your equipment and outfit but also utilize coins as a means of distraction. To top it all off general pathfinding and movement is a lot faster and more pleasant.\n\nAC2 in general is just a really pleasant sandbox game, and one that's worth playing for that. It's an effective mesh of well designed mechanics and polish, and there's little wonder why people consider it the best game in it's series.","November 17, 2014","true","30.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","0"

Of course, it helped that my internet connection was down for a few days so it was just my and my backlog of games.\n\nWhile in the technical department it becomes obvious the game was held back by consoles, some texture pop in can be seen and the shadows, while full dynamic and very complete, they are also pretty low res, with no way at all of fixing both issues through configuration files.\n\nI really don't want to spoil it for those that still don't play it but suffice to say, the story kept my interest up all of the time, the missions being varied and enough side quests available to cover around 20-30 hours of pure content, with a few hours set aside to pick every single item available.\n\nNow, this UnotPlay thing, when I got my internet connection back, it decided not only to lock me out of accessing the Uplay specific unlocks for the game, it also removed every single Upay "units" I had. Uplay units are a kinda neat idea in that instead of mere achievements, you gain points to unlock additional game content. Be that media, wallpapers, songs, or actual ingame stuff.\n\nAt least I used to think it was a good idea, because now I have no way of accessing that last side quest that you can unlock with UnotPlay points. So, my nearly flawless experience was somewhat spoiled by a totally unnecesary layer of DRM that is poorly maintainted by UBI.\n\nEven with that, I still fully recommend everybody to play this, and the entire Ezio Trilogy, if anything, so you can appreciate the decay in the direction the series was taken to, and also the terrible efficience with which UBIsoft ruins their IPs.","November 14, 2014","true","29.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/33230/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Right out of the bat I'm going to say it... Assassin's Creed 2 manages to improve on (and in most cases) correct a lot of the 'mistakes' made in the first Assassin's Creed. The story flows more naturally, the environments are lively and invite you to explore... and there's no horrible 'hub' map that seemingly is just home to a horde of angry guards guarding pointless view point towers!\n\nEzio as a character has more life and soul too, which only helps the story along. It allows you to easily get to know him and makes his pimping actions across Italy enjoyable. There's just something fun about running around the roof tops of Italy and generally acting like the biggest lad in all of Rome. I can't really explain it, but it's there - 'fun'.\nThat was an element I felt was lacking in the first Assassin's Creed game where everything felt like a chore; a long drawn out chore with little reward.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed 2 there are no 'chore' out moments to progress the game's content, the memory cores are all linked together and essential - so there's no climb a viewpoint, evesdrop on this guy and pluck a chicken style build up to Assassinations. Instead all story elements are told through memory segments, which allows the game to flow and the pace to build and fall in such a way that the game doesn't drain you emotionally or bore you to death.\nHowever, having said that I personally found Memory Block 12 & 13 to be totally out of place and to ruin the pace of the game. I found out that these 'chapters' were the added DLC, which would explain to the tacked on feel they had and the horrible pacing.\n\nAll things considered looking back that was my only real issue with the game, which is amazing considering the mountain of issues I had against the first Assassin's Creed.\n\nPersonal highlights for me were just the random events that would happen due to the Havoc/Ragdoll physics going a bit strange. Not in a terrible buggy kind of way, just natural mistakes happening such as people falling off buildings or running into each other. It was those natural unexpected events which caused me to laugh the most, it made the world feel alive. Also, I get some sort of sick enjoyment out of seeing Ragdoll death mechanics contort bodies... I'm not entirely sure why I've admitted that in written form, but there we go.\nI'll go seek help.\n\nThe story was another bonus in Assassin's Creed II, as it expands on the strange historic, yet future pretense blend set in Assassin's Creed. Drawing influences from Templars and... Tron?! Well perhaps. There weren't too many Desmond scenes in this game, but the few you have are interesting and finally expand on his connection everything happening with Assassin's Creed.\nI don't want to say much more as it might spoil content, but I really enjoyed it and the ending... and the credits strangely enough.\n\nOverall, if you've been interested in Assassin's Creed but have been weary, I would recommend checking out an edited Youtube video of the Assassin's Creed cutscenes as a lead in towards actually playing Assassin's Creed II. The rest builds up and hooks in to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations.","December 6, 2013","true","29.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","6"

I, however, had a great experience with the game. The wonder of playing an open world game set in an historical era was such a mind-blowing experience that I found it easy to look past the repetition, the janky climbing mechanics, and the various other problems the game shipped with. Honestly, new IPs as ambitious as the first Assassin's Creed game deserve a little leeway anyhow, since they're attempting to accomplish so much while starting from scratch. Nevertheless, the game was severely flawed, and it rightfully got some flak for it.\n\nAssassin's Creed II, when it released, was a perfect example of why the medium of video games is filled with successful sequels. It's difficult for a studio to nail everything in their first try when, many times, they're starting from the ground up by building things like graphics and physics engines from scratch. So much time focused on the building blocks of a game leaves little time to flesh out the more dynamic aspects on top of those, which is why the first game featured so much reptition. Assassin's Creed II, however, improves upon everything that the first game promised. The graphics were superb at the time they released. There were literally no other open world games that looked this good, and they even stand up pretty well today. The cities were beautiful, they were alive. Florence is not a city that's changed much, and they completely nailed the feel of what I imagine it would be like at the turn of the 15th century. Platforming is improved, it's quicker, and it's more intuitive, but it's unfortunately not fully polished in this effort. When it works, it's improved massively over the previous game. The campaign itself is a meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. You're visiting multiple cities here, you're visiting the beautiful Tuscan countryside, and the game is spanning decades. As somebody who's visited most of the areas depicted in this game, I can confidently say they've nailed the feel of the entire region. Ezio as a character is interesting, he's charismatic. He's an easy guy to root for, and his story begins personally and eventually emerges into a grand scale. He's been dealt a raw deal, but he lets things slide in a way that feels simultaneously incredible and admirable. Combat and player management has been expanded upon from the first game as well, as armor management, weapon and gadget management, and new costumes are all greatly designed. Customizing your Ezio is one of the most satisfying parts of the game. Combat is built upon from the first game, and now feels far more in depth. Probably the single best mechanic in the game is the build-your-own-stronghold aspect with Ezio's family villa. It's very addictive, and the visual change you experience in the small city is one that's immensely satisfying. As you invest money in building up your walled city, the population increases, the streets are cleaner and brighter, and the city is louder and more bustling as a result. I didn't realize quite how much it changed until I began a new game and saw how murky and depressing the place was when you first arrive there.\n\nOne specific thing I'd like to highlight here and really stress is just how good the soundtrack of this game is. It's been mentioned before but I haven't seen anybody truly do it justice, yet. Jesper Kyd absolutely kills it, and sets the bar so highly here that he can't hit the same heights of quality in AC: Brotherhood or AC: Revelations. The music all fits the settings so superbly that I really can't imagine playing this game without it. Half of the reason the world is so immersive is the setting, the ambient nose, the lighting, and the architecture. The other half is all soundtrack. No exaggeration. The music is all ambient, and very low-key, but it flows like a satin ribbon, enveloping your brain and keeping you floating through the streets like you're walking on air. It's just so effective at immersing you into Ezio's world. It breathes life into an already beautiful world, and Kyd's dismissal as the series composer is a big part of the reason why Assassin's Creed III seems dead and less alive to me. The Florence theme in particular is utterly spectacular.\n\nThough it's a good game, it's certainly not without its flaws. Free running control has aged poorly since 2009 and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly. This makes any races and chase sequences an annoyance at best, and downright infuriating at worst. Ezio simply doesn't always go where you want him to, and story mission chase sequences are often purely trial and error as a result. Most frustrating would have to be Ezio's tendency to inexplicably stop when scaling straight up a building, and look the left at nothing in particular. I had this happen a dozen times while being chased by guards, which is frequently fatal and controller-throwing rage inducing. At the time of release, bugs in general were a problem, but this can be written off as typical open world jank. At times the camera is a massive pain during combat sequences, getting stuck behind buildings and spires. I also had an issue with the lack of a quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints. It makes the light stealth gameplay here a frustrating experience at times.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say there are plenty of nice things included in the package here, but these drawbacks could have been addressed with some more play-testing and tweaking from Ubisoft to make this a far better game at release. When it's good, it's fantastic, moody, beautiful, and utterly immersive. It's an experience. But when it's bad, this game is downright infuriating to play. I had a very love-hate relationship with Assassin's Creed II. There were times when I marveled at how good it was, but there were also several moments that saw me rage quit in utter frustration after a death that was due to a free climbing or camera bug rather than poor play on my part. It's still definitely worth a playthrough, though, as the highs of the game are often far more memorable than the lows.","December 6, 2013","true","19.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Instead of collecting information on your target because of the story, you assassinate your target as it is part of the story. And like last time, there is an amazing feeling about running away and hiding from countless gaurds on your tail right after a majestic assassination. Parkour in this is similar to the last with sweet Architecture to climb and run across, giving off a completely different vibe than the original. What's the best indicator that something is a sequel? Well the number 2 of course! Which is why you now have 2 hidden blades! Some combat animations are quite satisfying although i think its become quite easy and i still enjoy the slower paced clashes of the original with close ups of bringing down your enemies. Music has also seemed to be toned up this time around, and the mood just always feels right and nostalgic.

This will not be spoiler free, as the plots in these games are not worth anything so there is no value lost in spoiling them.\n\nThis time, there are no frustrating, repetitive repeating missions, or bland cityspaces. No awful dialogue and no terrible sound quality.\n\nYou will find here that, unlike the first, this game could be described as functional and playable for upwards of 10 minutes.\n\nAssassin's Creed II is, unlike it's predecessor, a working game. I will argue, however, that this alone does not make it a game worth playing.\n\nYou will find an admittedly more compelling and engaging story here. We are told the story of Ezio, a young Italian noble enjoying his youth amidst family rivalries and conspiracy in Florence. Ezio's voice acting is leagues above Altair's awful, monotone American accent. You may notice Ubisoft's laziness in making Desmond's and Ezio's facial models exactly the same.\n\nAnyway, Ezio's family is betrayed by someone thought a friend and his father and brothers are executed.\n\nOne of the stronger moments in the series in Ezio discovering his father's assassin robes, the track 'Earth' playing in the background, meant to evoke a feeling of discovery in the player and prompt you to appreciate Ezio's transformation.\n\nThe soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd(who is excellent) is likely the strongest point of the game. The atmospheric tracks like 'Home in Florence', the story and character-development tracks like 'Ezio's Family' and 'Earth', and the chase tracks like 'Venice Rooftops' are all fantastic.\n\nIt is music one can love consistently and appreciate for how it establishes and reinforces the setting of the world. One can quickly come to appreciate the detail and beauty of the game's depictions of Florence and Venice supported by the fantastic music.\n\nThe story is centered around a convoluted web of conspiracy motivated by revenge and a desire to discover the truth. The larger sin of this game's story, one that many AC games are guilty of, is putting the player in situations where they could solve the central conflict of the plot nearly instantly.\n\nMore than once, Ezio is tasked with eavesdropping upon the game's villains gathered in a particular location or walking around the streets, completely vulnerable. They do not possess advantages or knowledge that would stay Ezio's blade, it is just some notion of absurd tension-building that seems to have prompted the inclusion of these scenes.\n\nThe supporting cast is mostly ridiculous. The Ezio saga seems to have this weird habit of insisting that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, mercenaries, and thieves are all delightful people misrepresented by those in power. I would guess that it is a way of emphasizing that Assassins believe in humanity/are optimistic about human nature while the Templars are not.\n\nBoth groups, however, see objective truth/reality, religion, and ideology as illusions and lies, so neither group is inspirational or compelling in any way, no matter what any fanboy wants to claim.\n\nOne can summarize the conflict as 'secular humanists who believe in humanity and thus advocate freedom' versus 'secular humanists who don't believe in humanity and thus advocate order'. It seems the more interesting discussion and debate happened off screen and our position on the matter has already been decided for us.\n\nAnyways, the 'supporting cast' are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, thieves, and mercenaries. One tells us that prostitution really represents love and that she is doing God's work in running the brothel. Close of the end of the story, all of them jump out of the metaphorical bush and yell 'we were all secretly assassins guiding you the whole time, Ezio!' It's pretty poor writing. They then defeat the primary antagonist of the entire game and let him get away for no reason.\n\nThe story, split into 14(really 12) sequences, skips years arbitrarily. My favorite moment is at the end of sequence 10, the game decides that the protagonist, with every reason in the world to pursue his enemies, sits on his ♥♥♥ for TEN YEARS in Venice, starting sequence 11 by lamenting that he'd been sitting on his ♥♥♥ like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot for 10 years. Really odd stuff with the timeline like this really makes you wonder about Ezio's character and motivation.\n\nAt the end of the game, you travel to Rome to assassinate the Pope -- the same character who could have died numerous times before by Ezio's hand. After stabbing him through the throat, his papal staff apparently allows him to..not die from that? Christ these games have terrible writing.\n\nEzio wielding the 'Apple of Eden' and Rodrigo Borgia(Alexander VI) his papal staff, they duke it out, Rodrigo paralyzes Ezio momentarily, and takes the apple. Ezio now completely vulnerable, Rodrigo logically decides to not kill him and just hurt him a little bit because that always works out really great for the main antagonist in any movie, book, or game. Seriously this ♥♥♥♥ is terrible.\n\nAfter that, Ezio chases him down to the vault and challenges the 60-something year old to a fistfight, Rodrigo posessing a massive upper hand in possessing both artifacts, it naturally makes sense for him to give up every advantage and enter a fist-fight with someone superior in terms of muscle strength and fitness -- potentially losing all progress towards the goal he has been working towards for around 25 years or more.\n\nAfter defeating Rodrigo, Ezio, being emotionally mature and intelligent and developed, decides not to kill the antagonist responsible for all the death and misery that allowed for the plot in the first place. Ezio was totally willing to murder hundreds of guards who who more or less innocent and just doing their jobs, but when it comes to the person most at fault -- no, not having any of that. I'm going to let you live in an overly-dramatic, angsty move that illustrates just how stupid my character is.\n\nSo yes, this game's plot and characters are atrocious -- but that's the case in nearly every game in this series, so this game is not any worse.\n\nThis game is worth playing for the atmosphere and high amount of content. You can enjoy the various side missions like the assassination contracts, underground tombs, and collectibles, free from the pretentious characters and stupid story, but with all the atmosphere of the music and character of the city.\n\nUltimately, as I said, the game is still mediocre when compared to games that are truly great, but the amount of content, soundtrack, and atmosphere make the game worth playing -- there is something to enjoy here, unlike the first.","February 12, 2015","true","26.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/33230/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Just under a year ago I reviewed  Assassin's Creed 1 where I ultimately felt it was... alright... but multiple shortcomings and poor design choices held it back from true greatness. This time around, they've somehow managed to do almost exactly the same thing but in almost completely different ways. They've handled the story very differently, but still haven't improved it, they've tweaked the gameplay but inadvertently only served to highlight its flaws in the process, and they've given us lots of new toys to play with, but merely replaced one set of inconsequential features for a whole bunch of different ones. It's kind of both impressive and baffling how little actual progress they seem to have made from so much work.\n\nThe first time around, the story shifted constantly from a future setting to past, exploring a particular family lineage, but it was such a mess of writing, acting and mishandled plot that it was easily the least interesting thing the game ended up doing. This time, the future setting is pushed way into the background and largely just bookends the game and its story, coming across as baggage the developers grudgingly tried to deal with as little and as best they could. To that end, we play as Ezio in 15th century Italy as he is unwittingly drawn into the midst of a dangerous conspiracy, learning of the struggle between Assassins and Templars as they try to shape the players and politics of the day to take over the country, and ultimately the world. There's more to this as the game makes call backs to the mysterious artefact at the heart of the first game (among other things *wink-wink*), but it never feels as grand or as crucial as they probably mean it to be, and just as with the first game, I couldn't bring myself to care about the whys and found myself increasing checked out of the story, my interest having already long since departed way before the anticlimactic end. Only two games into a thirteen game series, I'm already done with the lore and wish it wasn't a thing anymore. The kernel of a good idea is tangible, but it frustratingly never seems to become anything more than that.\n\nThe gameplay fairs little better in its changes. The previous game had three large cities and a large hub area of towns, fields, canyons and various other sights connecting them. There was little to do here, though, so unless you really loved collectathons and sightseeing then you were bang outta luck and just had to endure the trip between main events. Thankfully, the hub area has been removed and we're instead given two very large cities, two small cities (with surrounding fields and swamplands) and your very own town to renovate. Once you're let loose to roam free in these places that's where the fun really begins, and also where the heartache hits, too, as what should be a simple joy becomes a near constant struggle and an increasing source of frustration.\n\nMy memories of traversal in the first game are good ones, always having a really nice sense of effortless flow to movement. Whether it was leaping across rooftops or scaling up walls, it just felt right, and very rarely did anything bad about it ever come to my attention. Here, however, I literally could hardly go a couple of minutes without encountering some kind of issue. Ezio seems magnetically drawn to damn near every object and you can barely run anywhere near a vertical surface without him trying to automatically leap onto it. Dislodging yourself from anything takes way too long, and he pretty much only jumps from anything in a 90 degree, X or Y axis direction. So, many times I wanted to jump one way but it was impossible because it wasn't aligned exactly with the limited directions he could jump. Add to this the camera that constantly insists on "helping" you into new angles or straight up removing your control of it completely, plus its annoying sensitivity that was never decent no matter how I adjusted it, or the frequent frame rate stutters, and the whole thing was a never-ending battle to control adequately, leaping to my death on several occasions because of the bad camera and jumping/climbing/grabbing system.\n\nAs with the previous title, the world itself and its scale is the star of the show which impresses most. The fact that there's only brief loading between main areas and cut scenes or missions is something I feel the games probably don't get enough credit for. Ditto with the sound design that really stood out to me on many occasions while they'd largely go unnoticed for me in other games. Visually, most of the areas are very "busy", which may make everything a bit of a blur of visual white noise, but I still greatly appreciated the effort once again in crafting such a fully realised world when they probably could have gotten away with less, between the overall layout, texture detail, and abundance of NPC models that fill the world. But, sadly, as with many other aspects, the busy-ness of the game also worked against it as there was a lot of what I can only think to describe as architectural clutter - basically lots of structures and pieces sticking out of every building in one place or another and getting in your way. It's clear they were placed with the intention of helping you get around faster or more gracefully, but it had the opposite effect on me as Ezio would continuously bump into stuff or grab on to out-of-the-way objects then take an age to let go of them. It just killed so much of the momentum and pace, and a lot of the fun along with it.\n\nLike I said, there are many new features, like upgrading your small fortress town, but aside from some aesthetic changes that you probably won't even notice, rather than unlocking new things, they only generate more money for you. But since it's such a non-issue in the game and you'll rarely ever find yourself wanting for more, this seemed useless to me. As too where many of the additional weapons and abilities. Again, the combat is a chore. I never felt engaged or threatened, just like I'd hit a tedious roadblock to endure rather than enjoy. But one of the most notable additions were tombs, extra challenge areas of sorts where you had to test your agility across obstacle courses and receive a small reward at the end. But, really, all these actually did were remind me of the game's main influence once again, Prince of Persia, except not nearly as fun as that masterpiece.\n\nFor all my moaning about it, again, as with its predecessor, I'm rating it up not because I necessarily loved it, but because there isn't enough to truly hate on it. It never infuriates so much or for so long that it's ruinous, just occasionally annoying. And really, its worst crime isn't that it's bad, just that it's kinda dull and never becomes all that it could be. It has one trick that it repeats over and over, that makes it fun for the first five or so hours, but which I was completed done with by hour forty... go some place, climb some stuff, kill a guy, on to the next one. That's it. I wish every area was its own separate space, in its own time period and with its own character that only he or she would operate within independent of the others. Each would have their own skills or abilities (or lack of) and would require the player to play differently with each one, switching back and forth as preferred and completing every mission in whichever order they chose. It would mostly kill off the feeling of repetition and maybe even make the cities themselves have a greater sense of functional purpose rather than suspiciously coming across as filler impersonating content. Until that day comes, while I'm sure many will adore this, I ran out of enthusiasm for it far sooner than I ever should have. So, maybe don't read this as an endorsement of Assassin's Creed 2, so much as a recommendation for Prince of Persia. Seriously, those games are awesome.","February 21","true","43.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

After rescuing Desmond she relocates him in one of the secret assassin hideouts. This time Desmond must go inside animus once more and locate and aquire the apple of eden and become a true assassin through the memories of Ezio Audotore. Ezio is florentine nobleman who lived during the renaissance. At the age of 17 he witnessed his father and two brothers being executed which forced him, his sister and mother to flee to Tuscany, Moteriggioni at Villa Auditore. After learning about his heritage from, his uncle Mario, Ezio began his assassin training and set on his quest for vengeance against templar order, and their master Rodrigo Borgia who ordered the execution. Even though the game follows the cliche of "muh revenge" it's still pretty good story and gameplay wise plus you get to visit many iteresting locations like Venice and Florence and meet interesting characters of that time including Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe gameplay in first installment wasn't really polished, but in AC2 controls are responsive and movement is fluid. The animations are smooth, wide variety finishing blows and finally you get to chose what weapons  and armor you equip. You also have new tools to make your assassinations easier and more interesting like double hidden blade, pistol, poison blade and now you can fight with hidden blade and won't get pushed back and lose HP like in the first game. I also enjoyed the assassin tombs which where rather interesting and rewarding. Once finished all tombs you get Altair's armor as a reward for your work. What I really hated is lack of stealth in this game, considering the first game clearly established how assassins operate: they're never seen or heard and kills only key target. I also disliked how guards were guarding seemingly uninportant locations which does no good to the series and breaks immersion. Overall it's pretty fun to play but could be better polished with more possibilities like stealth for hardcore fans.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is cancer named uPlay. When I purchased the game there was no mention in store page about 3rd party software. It is really annoying to punish paying customers by making trilions of accounts just to play one game. In this case it's Uplay. I don't know why I am required to register ANOTHER account just to play a game I already purchased on steam, don't make me use another platform. It is the only downside of the game, the DRM so if you're OK with purchasing it on steam and then adding it on Uplay go ahead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/recommended/33230/","93juantheone","Neutron John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/","785 products in account","Assassin's Creed 2 Retrospective Review Sort of...\nThe Assassin’s Creed franchise is almost dead and buried at this point to some, but for me, a huge fan of the series, the franchises rest gives me a chance to go back and experience all the Assassin’s Creed games, before the eventual one to release next year in 2017. First, I started with Assassin’s Creed 2. I tried to get to part one, but for some reason it kept crashing every 15 minutes on my PC, and there was really nothing I could do that I didn’t already try. I do suggest however, that if you do go back to play the franchise, just stick with starting at AC2; AC1 is so far behind the technical curve of it’s sequels, that it feels like a PS1 era game compared to it’s contemporaries.\n\nAssassin’s Creed 2 is often lauded as the best in the series and for good reason. After the simplistic and formulaic repetitiveness of Assassin’s Creed 1. AC2’s diversity is a breath of fresh air. And diverse missions and combat mechanics are the name of the game  in AC 2. However, there are some outstanding issues that have occurred in AC2 while I was playing, that is probably due to just the age of the game itself. First, when it comes to story, it’s great! Ezio’s story is engaging and often keeps you emotionally hooked, but I do have to say that I feel as far as Assassin stories go, I think Ubisoft got better at telling an Assassin's story as the series went along. My only problem with the story in AC 2 is that it tends to be exposition heavy, but what I do appreciate is that it does have some time for heartfelt moments. The other little nag is that the story overall raises far more questions than it answers. It’s a shame since everything about the lore is incredibly intriguing, but for it’s mysteries to be revealed in such a piecemeal manner (which is actually something the series becomes notorious for doing as it goes along) it tends to leave more of a pain to want to know just what the hell is going on. At last the reveal that comes near the end, while exciting and probably opens the series for amazing opportunities (opportunities that have seemingly been squandered in the sequels) is not entirely satisfying.\n\nNow when it comes to graphics, the game is still a technical marvel. The environments and armors are so detailed that it makes them really feel real. Also another thing I’d like to bring up is the fact that people have started to complain recently that the series, in the more recent entries, has done all it can do to make it feel less like a real place and more like a game, but I’d quickly argue that AC2 feels like a game just as much as the others due to the fact that the Animus’ features cover up the screen in the same amount as the other later titles. Quickly, back to graphics, the game while still being beautiful in spots has terrible performance issues and some minor but irksome graphical glitches. When it comes to performance, it’s terrible across the board. Sometimes the game will drop below 60 to the 40’s for no apparent reason. I can output the game to 4k resolution and it still runs the same with the same inconsistent drops. It leads me to believe that it may be a CPU issue or something, but it is entirely annoying given that the game is pretty old. As for the graphical hitches, I fixed them with Nvidia Inspector which included better Anisotropic filtering, better VSync, and better anti-aliasing as all of the base features included in the game don’t work properly.\n\nThe gameplay loop of Assassin’s Creed is a kind of all over the place, since Ezio at this point for the next two titles isn’t as nearly as fast or agile as his successors it usually takes a while to reach place to place. This is  helped by the game providing horses and some minute way of fast travel. The fast travel works only if you go to a different city so it’s kind of useless and the horses unfortunately are only useful for the country sides. The good thing is that the horses are fast and not slow. However, if you come up near objects and obstacles you can slow down considerably as the game’s parkour system desperately tries to determine whether your horse is jumping off a cliff or jumping over a fence even when faced in front of the fence. Now when it comes to collectibles, it can be enjoyable since they are really easy to collect and are often in near proximity of each other, which makes the act of collecting them all into an activity that lasts for about 5-6 hours. However I’m glad that a couple of the future titles opted for a “kicking the chest to open” mechanic that makes treasure collecting far less tedious. The feathers are another collectible that you can’t find in a considerable amount of time without a guide, but also provide and emotional side activity. The feathers in AC 2 actually have meaning as Ezio’s mother who stops talking won’t communicate with her family. Ezio collects these feathers in hope that his mother changes. It’s a nice hook that gives collecting the things more meaning, something that the future entries fail to do.\n\nThe side missions are another part of the gameplay hook of Assassin’s Creed 2. They are enjoyable for the most part, but unfortunately ere on the side of repetitiveness a bit too soon, especially the assassination missions. In the main storyline the Assassination missions are quite diverse and unique, which set up a variety of ways to assassinate your foe, but the side missions which you collect from pigeon coops are not as consistent. There are some cool diverse situations, but unfortunately most of them turn into a simple run-to-this-location-and-then-assassinate-with-your-blade.\n\nIs it the best game in the franchise? Yes and no, for the most part I think most people have rose-tinted glasses on when they compare the supposed “♥♥♥♥♥iness” of the future sequels with the greatness of AC2. AC2 is great, but the future games in the series eventually surpassed it on a gameplay level, and arguably on a story level. The one game I think that definitely improved from a combination of the two is AC 4. On a technical level AC2’s controls just pale in comparison with the other games. Recently in AC:Unity I actually felt that for the first time being an assassin was an actual viable option. In AC2 being an assassin usually comes down to dumb luck, at least from my experience. The soldiers FOV for instance just varies greatly. Sometimes I would jog to them and assassinate without a fuss, but other times when I’d jog to them they would turn around instantly and detect me in which would at times turn into an automatic desync, which is incredibly annoying, as the game pulls the camera out and shakes violently  in a way that almost feels like if it’s telling you, “You lost!, Stop you lost okay, Just shut up, you lost! Restart your checkpoint, you incompetent assassin!.”  While in my head I’m thinking, F**k you game, F**k you. It’s pretty safe to say that the game’s controls aren’t the best nor is it’s AI consistent. Thankfully these things aren’t incredibly annoying as to deter you from playing, but your mileage may vary depending on what kind of games you play.\n\nWhen it comes to Assassin’s Creed 2, you can’t go wrong, you got a great story, detailed open-world, gameplay that is enjoyable, and a mythology to unravel. It may not be the best game in the franchise, but it’s pretty darn close. If you got $19 or better yet wait for a Steam sale, AC2 proves to still be an enjoyable experience that is still worth revisting.\n\nSome interesting points\n\nI played about 75 hours\nI got 100% synchronization\nI unlocked The Truth\nI also took too many screenshots\nAlso I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1 computer","March 3","true","75.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

After playing it's repetitive and disappointing predecessor, ACII was exactly the kind of experience that I was looking for. ACII involves all the elements of a great game: elaborate story, beautiful visual style, exploration, character development, action, fun side missions, rewards and smooth mechanics (which were not that smooth actually, but later about that). Deluxe Edition includes all the original DLCs, so there're hours and hours of gameplay. For few euros/bucks on sales or even full price I highly recommend purchasing this game, if you already haven't.\n\nPROS:\n\n- fascinating story line\n- collectibles, upgrades and secret areas – it's all integrated in the story line, which not only makes exploration and side missions meaningful, but also constitutes a sort of economical management microgame, as all your progress in terms of collectibles reflects on the value and features of Monterigioni Villa – Ezio's HQ\n- unlike its predecessor ACII actually feels like a stealth game and there are multiple strategies for approaching and assassinating your enemies\n- tons of content\n- opportunity to explore realistic virtual representations of some of the most famous cultural landmarks of Renaissance and to find out about their history\n- epic final battle\n- da Vinci's flying machine\n\nEssential improvements compared to AC1:\n\n-no annoying beggars and crazy people\n-no hordes of citizens\n-faster and more versatile battles\n-no repeating patterns in the storyline or sidemissions\n-more elaborate surroundings\n-more weapons\n-ability to hire factions for your advance\n-treasure maps\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n- in the beginning, Ezio always is out of money, because equipment, repairs and collectibles are overpriced, but towards the end you're a millionaire, and after you have purchased everything you could, treasure hunting and villa upgrades become pointless; it's the same thing in AC3\n- I mostly used the sword, assassin's blades, throwing knifes and smoke bombs throughout the game, also occasionally the pistol; but the dagger and poison did not come in handy – fun to try, but other weapons are just more practical\n\nCONS:\n\n- camera rotation – it does not always follow Ezios directions, which is especially problematic in narrow surroundings inside buildings (e.g., secret areas) to the point that it takes multiple attempts to succesfully perform a back leap\n- Ezio freezes while sitting on corners (a problem in chase scenes)\n- sometimes the eliminated targets do not disappear from the mini-map, which is a bit confusing when you need to find the next one\n- the missions towards the end of main game story were too simplistic and with some notable faults in terms of layout, AI's behaviour and navigation, as if the developers rushed the game to release it on time; but luckily that changes after you proceed to the DLC part of the game – the story is fascinating again and even the gameplay itself is much smoother\n- some puzzles do not make sense or the clues are hardly visible\n- it's not possible to change Ezio's outfit after Altair's costume is acquired\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10.","November 21, 2014","true","57.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It improves on the original foundation set by 2007's Assassin's Creed, and lays the ground work for a great game.\n\nSet in 15th century Rennaissance Italy, the game contains many beautiful locations, which are packed with content. Florence, Venice, Tuscany, and smaller cities, such as Romagna/Forli and Rome (which is briefly shown). Also shown are the Apennine Mountains, akin to Assassin's Creeds' Kingdom.\n\nWith a charismatic protagonist, Ezio, a great world, fun and interesting side-missions, a decent story, great characters, this is easily my favorite in the series and I highly recommend it to anyone. It takes everything the original did right and multiplies it by a large amount. It's what a sequel should be.\n\nMy main complaints are that Assassin's Creed II doesn't support a gamepad natively (you have to download an external .dll) and it includes Uplay DRM. Still, it's a game I recommend.","January 5","true","60.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Unlike Altair, Ezio is far more lovable and i feel that the developers put more time into developing his character then they did with Altair.\nThis time, you visit renaissance Italy. The game world is simply beautifull, you can see almost all of the well-known buildings from that period like San Marco Basilica, which is absolutely gorgeous. The only flaw was minor issue with fps drops, but nothing that really affected the gameplay.\nGameplay is similar to the first game in the series with some upgrades but sometimes the bad camera angles can make you hate the game (happened to me that while performing the leap of faith i crash in front of the pile of hae). I found the fighting to be pretty easy, when surrounded by the enemy, they just basically wait for you to kill them or watch as you kick the **** out of the other guards. I really like the side activities you have in the game, you will rob the templar hideouts, find missing artifacts, rebuilding the old family villa. You can also buy a new armor, color your outfit which seems like a good addition to the game.\nThe thing i really liked is a story, which kept me playing the game and made me do all the side stuff it had. There are a lot of well-known people from that period like Leonardo da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavelli which really adds the charm to the game.\nTo sum up, i really liked the game, but for me a really big flaw was that it was too easy and fighting is not good as i expected to be. Still I reccomend buying this game.\n8.5/10","September 16, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Brilliant story line, somewhat improved controls, and much more longevity given the amount of side-missions available.\n\nFar less in-and-outing of the animus, something I found incredibly annoying in the original, and when you are out, you actually have things to do as opposed to listening to someone speak, 'sleeping', then waking up and getting back in (AKA pointless time wasting to make the game seem longer).\n\nThe fact that you can live Ezio's life, by making money, speaking with family members, using different character types to assist you in missions, means you become more invested in the game. If I had one gripe about a certain character type it would be that the courtesans automatically leave you to 'distract' gaurds when they're near one, even if you didn't want them to and you were only passing by. I find thieves to be the most effective distraction personally, even if they do accidentally die falling off rooftops a lot.","May 6, 2014","true","157.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/33230/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","I now remember why I uninstalled the first installment of Assassin's Creed: finicky controls and restrictive kill conditions made combat a chore. In this sequel, Ubisoft couldn't fix the controls so they loosened up the combat mechanics, making your protagonist a match for even a crowd of enemies out in the open while removing much of the restrictions for a successful assassination. Instead of fixing flaws, they gave you more tools to navigate through the same engine.\n\n"More rather than better" seems to be the theme of the day. You can collect around 30 different weapons but darn if I can figure out why I need that many when there are only three types of enemies and you're encouraged to commit your assassinations quietly. There are a ridiculous amount of hidden chests but the bulk of your income will come from your villa and frankly, it's ridiculous that your main money pit (villa restorations) serves to increase your revenue. Between endless assassination side quests, puzzle deciphering and collectibles, I have over 25 hours of gameplay and am still roughly in the middle of the main storyline. This game is positively bloated with filler.\n\nWhat you lose from all of those extra combat mechanics is your overall sense of vulnerability in being a shadowy assassin. Who needs stealth when you can take on a crowd of enemies and still win? All I wanted was a fix to the backstabs from the first game; suddenly I'm face-stabbing a full company of armored brutes with only a couple of smoke bombs as my cover. Cheap, plentiful medicine makes health hardly an issue. All your methods for hiding in plain sight have been kept from the previous game but they've added ways to decrease your aggro from the guards, making your hiding techniques superfluous!\n\nAn especially heinous mention needs to be given to the uPlay DRM which kept crashing on updates and various occasions. Obviously, I've managed to circumvent this problem if I've coped this far but it's still a frustrating experience to figure out why you can't play your own game. I also believe it's messing with my Steam Achievements, as in uPlay's Achievements are written over the Steam ones.\n\nThis isn't sounding like the most enthusiastic of endorsements but Assassin's Creed 2 is merely a flawed game, not an outright unenjoyable one. The characters you meet are engaging, the exploration sequences filled with secrets and those assassination side quests might be filler but they offer some fun challenges along the way. The problem is that you don't *need* to do any of these extra side quests: your reward for those is money and you can get all the money you want simply by waiting. You play this game for the story, the variety of content and the opportunity to roleplay as a Renaissance hitman. Good enough.","October 22, 2015","true","45.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The game is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The story takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. In ACII there is a lot of new abilities that the player has access to that were not available in the first AC. Now you can now use Eagle Vision in third-person view and while moving and you also now have the ability to swim. Now you can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to help you fight, distract, or lure guards some thing that the first AC game never had. A day and night cycle has also been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. ACII has added a lot of new side-missions that you can access any time throughout the game like now they have added Assassin Tombs which is an optional side-mission to find all of the Assassin Seals to unlock the legendary Armor of Altaïr. Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is a huge improvement over the first AC game and I reckon it is probably the best AC game out there. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just fantastic I am absolutely 100% sure that this game will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.","September 10, 2014","true","35.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

I can't stop myself to measure it to the first game. But generally I liked it.\nFirst of all, the first class work what the team of the Ubisoft done with places, clothes and conversations is magnificent. It really makes you feel, that you are in the renessaince. The good old fighting system don't make any dissapointment and the guards' AI has got better, there are fast ones who can outrun you and there is inteligent ones, who can find you, and there are more fighting style of them too. And what was a great relief for me, our main character finally can swim. Yeah! It was really annoying that the almost super human assassin drowned in the every little water.\nThe beginning of the story is quite good, it just continues where the first left off. But Ezio won't be my favorite: a spoiled kid at the first and that won't really change untill the last chapters. Altair was a complex character with serious character development. Many times in the conversations, when Ezio tries to think, I just thought 'Oh, man'.\nBut stories' rhythm is quite curious I felt aprox. three-four time a peak, where I got the feeling that the game will end now and... It did not end, it was ok once or twice, but after that it was too much for me.\nThe side quests were interesting and the restauration of Montereggioni Villa was quite a good idea. I really liked and waited when can I pay the last of my money on her.\nThe assassins tombs were a good basic idea to take some dexterity game in the thing, it made the game more diverse. Searching for codex pages and the truth was exciting too, but the glyph puzzles were not balanced, some of it is too easy and some is really hard, and it do not really have a order, that it goes from the easy to the hard.\nAn another thing deserve a word. I think Leonardo is the best sidekick ever. I like his style and he was useful, but did not pamper Ezio.\nThe thing, that we can choose weapons, outfits and even the color of our clothes are convinient, while it let us choose our  fighting style, wether we like heavy or light and fast weapons, it is up to us. And the developing of the handblade season it too.\n\nSo in summary I liked this game. There were really good ideas, which made interesting side lines for the player. We could explore a little beside the main quest line. But Altair's character is more complex and more interesting than Ezio's. And rhythm of the last chapters were not the just the real thing for me.","January 2, 2015","true","79.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now that I've finished Assassin's Creed 2 for my second time (and on PC this time), I still firmly believe this is the best AC game that I've played so far. Story, characters, music... all excellent! The visuals are well done, not ground breaking but they're very decent. And the PC version does offer better graphics.\n\nAs for the gameplay aspect, I played AC2 mainly with the Xbox One controller and no issues whatsoever. The Keyboard + Mouse scheme wasn't too bad and much improved from AC1 but I still preferred to play AC2 with a gamepad. The gameplay mechanics were refined too from AC1. The parkour works better, the combat is slightly more fluid than AC1.\n\nWithout giving you too much detail, this game improved in all aspects from AC1. It is a fantastic sequel and if only the other AC games were that good...\n\nPROS:\n+Strong narrative, impressive and deep story, Renaissance setting.\n+HUGE world to explore.\n+Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a strong new protagonist in the game.\n+Secondary characters (npc) were well implemented.\n+Jesper Kyd music composer (THE BEST AC SOUNDTRACK TO DATE).\n+More weapons, more ways to kill enemies.\n+Greater variety of missions / side-missions in AC 2 (Many side missions too if you want to play them (assassinations, courrier, races, etc).\n+Many Tombs, Templar lairs to uncover and they unlock the most useful item in the game.\n+Lenghty playtime. Just the story can take you a good 20 hours at least.\n\nCONS:\n-At the game's launch, it required a permanent internet connection. Totally unacceptable for a single player game. Granted, Ubisoft Montreal removed that draconian DRM but years later.\n-Uplay DRM.\n-Too many treasures and feathers to collect. The feathers do unlock a useful item once completed but I had no patience to recollect them all over again. Done it once on the PS3 and that's that!\n-Graphics aren't top notch. A few glitches here and there time to time but nothing gamebreaking at least!\n\nOVERALL:\nA close to perfect sequel! If you loved the first Assassin's Creed game, you'll love this one even more. If you disliked AC1, give AC2 a shot, you may like it as it improved upon the weakneses of AC1.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSi! Even if you never played it, Assassin's Creed 2 is a very good game.\n\nRATING:\n9.0 / 10\n\nAnd now, time to revisit Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood...","June 14, 2014","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story begins with a noble man named Ezio Auditore where his assassin's days begins. You will also meet a test person named Dismond Milles. He seems to be connected to Ezio Auditore. I won't say so much more since I won't spoil anything. But I can tell you this you won't get disappointed with this story. Well there is one thing you need to this game and that is patience. Why patience you think, I will tell you why. Some of the mission can be hard so you need to take your time before you strike if you don't do that you have to start over again. You can be frustrated in this game so don't buy or play it if you are a person who gets easy frustrated.\n","July 17, 2014","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't stop myself to measure it to the first game. But generally I liked it.\nFirst of all, the first class work what the team of the Ubisoft done with places, clothes and conversations is magnificent. It really makes you feel, that you are in the renessaince. The good old fighting system don't make any dissapointment and the guards' AI has got better, there are fast ones who can outrun you and there is inteligent ones, who can find you, and there are more fighting style of them too. And what was a great relief for me, our main character finally can swim. Yeah! It was really annoying that the almost super human assassin drowned in the every little water.\nThe beginning of the story is quite good, it just continues where the first left off. But Ezio won't be my favorite: a spoiled kid at the first and that won't really change untill the last chapters. Altair was a complex character with serious character development. Many times in the conversations, when Ezio tries to think, I just thought 'Oh, man'.\nBut stories' rhythm is quite curious I felt aprox. three-four time a peak, where I got the feeling that the game will end now and... It did not end, it was ok once or twice, but after that it was too much for me.\nThe side quests were interesting and the restauration of Montereggioni Villa was quite a good idea. I really liked and waited when can I pay the last of my money on her.\nThe assassins tombs were a good basic idea to take some dexterity game in the thing, it made the game more diverse. Searching for codex pages and the truth was exciting too, but the glyph puzzles were not balanced, some of it is too easy and some is really hard, and it do not really have a order, that it goes from the easy to the hard.\nAn another thing deserve a word. I think Leonardo is the best sidekick ever. I like his style and he was useful, but did not pamper Ezio.\nThe thing, that we can choose weapons, outfits and even the color of our clothes are convinient, while it let us choose our  fighting style, wether we like heavy or light and fast weapons, it is up to us. And the developing of the handblade season it too.\n\nSo in summary I liked this game. There were really good ideas, which made interesting side lines for the player. We could explore a little beside the main quest line. But Altair's character is more complex and more interesting than Ezio's. And rhythm of the last chapters were not the just the real thing for me.","January 2, 2015","true","79.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were major improvements in this game. If you loved the first game (Assassin's Creed 1) you are going to love this one. Everything that you had in Assassin's Creed 1 is still here, just improved and a lot better.Running, climbing and the assassinations. This sequel fixes most of the flaws from Assassin's Creed 1. Bigger cities, better visuals  and a better protagonist. Assassin's Creed 2 is better than the original. Just like the end of Assassin's Creed 1 was  shocking, Assassin's Creed 2 is even more shocking. The setting takes place in the 15th Century Renaissance Italy. Throughout the whole game, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Your family are bankers and you soon find out to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Ezio is an assassin and you watch him age throughout the game and perfect his skills in every way. The story is much clearer. You get to use the Animus 2.0 to help you identify people, documents, locations and etc... This a free roam word. So you get to kill guards, pickpocket and hire mercenaries, courtesans and thiefs. Ubisoft also added a day and night cycle, economic system to buy armor, weapons, paintings, maps, etc...There are definitely more combat moves than just strike and counter and definitely a lot more weapons and customization. The characters in the game make you express your emotions whether you feel overjoyed about a character or want to knife the character in the face. The story was not as repetitive as the first one. The story is very intriguing. I would give this game a rating of 96/100.","January 21, 2014","true","234.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I’ve punched my desk and cursed like a sailor – Ezio tends to make stupid things occasionally, with tragic effect.\n\n7/10 for me\n\n+ beautiful cities full of activities\n+ plot of the game connected to history\n+ shops with armors, weapons and all kinds of stuff\n+ medicine to stock\n+ autosaves in the middle of the missions\n+ better control on protagonist than in AC1 – he’s not a block of wood now\n+ soundtrack in general\n+ you can run and kill all those stupid archers\n+ Ezio\n+ better free-running than in AC1…\n\n- …but still Ezio sometimes decides to do some idiotic things like jump all the way down when you’re in the middle of the platform sequence\n- this one ♥♥♥♥ing song (named The Vault) - I've rushed through most of the game, until I had to collect codex pages, then I stopped and decided to make all sidequests, viewpoints etc., my main quest at that moment was "collect codex pages" and I guess creators of the game connected that one song to this quest and I had to listen to THIS ♥♥♥♥ING SONG for 15 hours, over and over again, with little brakes\n- all Italians speaking English with some Italian words, it seems so false and unnatural that keeps you from feeling like this is more than just a stupid game (acctualy it just screams “I’m just a stupid game” all the time), ruins immersion\n- the whole animus idea\n- Desmond\n- no difficulty settings\n- stupid weapon change system (in villa)\n- “I just killed you, let’s have a long conversation”\n- can’t skip cutscenes (even when watched 2nd time and even when it comes to Villa cutscenes, like with Da Vinci)\n- frustrating fighting system (you can win all fights just by pressing X repeatedly)\n- you are taught about all these fighting techniques (counter-attack, dodge, disarm etc.) but when it comes to the battle and when 5 people attacks you in the same time, you have no chance of remembering about some stupid disarm\n- interacting with things while chasing people\n- posters of Ezio placed on towers, high buildings – who the hell looks there?!\n- hilarious cutscenes with paralyzed protagonist:\n\n1. execution of Auditore family – Ezio just stands there for 1 minute and does nothing, he would have made it on time to save them without a problem – I understand that this is a part of a plot, but it’s just made wrong\n2. templars attack on medici – vieri’s father slashes his targets, attacks Lorenzo and Ezio is completely paralyzed while standing 5m from him, unable to do anything, save anyone, assassinate Francesco de’ Pazzi","August 3, 2015","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were major improvements in this game. If you loved the first game (Assassin's Creed 1) you are going to love this one. Everything that you had in Assassin's Creed 1 is still here, just improved and a lot better.Running, climbing and the assassinations. This sequel fixes most of the flaws from Assassin's Creed 1. Bigger cities, better visuals  and a better protagonist. Assassin's Creed 2 is better than the original. Just like the end of Assassin's Creed 1 was  shocking, Assassin's Creed 2 is even more shocking. The setting takes place in the 15th Century Renaissance Italy. Throughout the whole game, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Your family are bankers and you soon find out to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Ezio is an assassin and you watch him age throughout the game and perfect his skills in every way. The story is much clearer. You get to use the Animus 2.0 to help you identify people, documents, locations and etc... This a free roam word. So you get to kill guards, pickpocket and hire mercenaries, courtesans and thiefs. Ubisoft also added a day and night cycle, economic system to buy armor, weapons, paintings, maps, etc...There are definitely more combat moves than just strike and counter and definitely a lot more weapons and customization. The characters in the game make you express your emotions whether you feel overjoyed about a character or want to knife the character in the face. The story was not as repetitive as the first one. The story is very intriguing. I would give this game a rating of 96/100.","January 21, 2014","true","234.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ezio Auditore has become one of the greatest protagonists in video games for his charm, wit and brute force. The masterful writing in this sequel solidified the AC series as a successful franchise that Ubisoft has clearly played with.\n\nThe graphics? Stunning, even years later. The gameplay? Perfected swordfighting. Some might disagree, but it was so fluid and seemless in a number of the fights. The story? Remarkable. The writers have done their research and not only created characters, but also used historical characters in the correct context.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/33230/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","Assassin's Creed II is an open-world Third Person Action/Stealth game that takes place in Renaissance Italy. You play as Ezio Auditore, an Italian noble, as he seeks to gain revenge on his enemies and further the causes of his faction, the Assassins. Much like the first game, gameplay is split between modern times where you play as Desmond (and not a whole lot happens), and historic times which is where the majority of gameplay takes place.\n\nThe game is vastly superior to the first in the series, expanding on nearly every single area - collectables are still present but are not so meaningless, there's an economy of sorts, the missions are not as repetitive, and the combat has been opened up some. However, with the combat becoming more accessible, being stealthy/unnoticed is no longer as important - the game has taken a serious step in the direction of more action game than "assassination," a trend which continues throughout the series (but which in many ways improves it for how most people would like to play).\n\nI played and beat this game on the 360, hence my play time, and I highly recommend it.\n\nNote: This game is excluded from Steam's Family Sharing service, and it requires the use of Ubisoft's Uplay program. If either of those bother you, then I would avoid this game.","July 1, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have bigger ones at your disposal (such as two-handed swords, axes and hammers) that have different animations and make the combat look even more exciting.\n--Your protagonist, Ezio, can actually swim this time. This is a must as you'll go to Venice and you have missions where swimming is necessary or just helpful in order to get rid of enemies.\n--To be honest, I was not familiar with the era of the first game. Now, when it comes to the 15th century the second installment takes place in it brought back memories from history classes. It's actually quite cool that Ezio regularly visits Leonardo Da Vinci and at one point in the game you get to use his flying machine.\n--There are a lot of cities in the game with TONS of side missions. You even have your own mansion surrounded by several buildings. You can upgrade these and the economy system incorporated provides you with a steady income.\n--Obviously, the game employs better graphics and you also have night-day cycle in the sequel. Horse-riding returns and it still looks cool.\n--Enemies are more varied and you are required to use different tactics instead of just bashing the counter key when it is necessary. Also, countering is easier this time.\n--The incorporated notoriety system requires you to lay low for a while after a fight with the soldiers in town - otherwise you are recognised as the local villain and immediately get attacked by the next group of guards.\n--No more eavesdropping and pick pocketing as mandatory missions! There were far too many in the first game and after a while they became annoying and very repetitive. Thank God the sequel has more varied and exciting missions and locales.\n--The plot is more interesting this time and while Altair you got to know from the beginning as an assassin Ezio now starts out as teenage boy of a noble family unaware of the conflict between the Templars and Assassins. You follow his story from the very beginning and it is nice to see how his personality develops as the plot thickens.\n\nIt may be the best in the series. This episode introduced a lot of new features that have since become the signature components of every Assassin's Creed game to date.","April 8, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/recommended/33230/","deathwing107","Deathcon 4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/","125 products in account","Considering this game is quite a few years old now, I'm probably looking at this from a different perspective than most. But in Summary, it's a good, almost great port for PC.\n\nFirst the Good:\nThis game's graphics have aged pretty well. Not totally, but enough where it ever bothered me. I understand the time it came from, so just have an open mind if you've never played this game before. It's more colorful than the first game. Textures and models still look good. Character models are a little dated but not too bad.\n\nThere is plenty of content, most of which is compelling and/or fun enough to actually bother with. You can do anything from races to assassination contracts to collecting feathers to even flying with Da Vinci's invention just for fun. You can look for hidden loot, do the assassin's tomb side quests (which are great fun and grant you Altair's armor after you do all six), to courier missions, to taking down thieves and runners.\n\nThe main story is very interesting, and you start out, once you're in the Animus, as Ezio as a baby, so you practically see Ezio's entire life unfold. The story is more character driven than paying attention to the big picture, which really isn't at the forefront until almost near the end of the game. You'll go to many different historic locations in Italy as the story unfolds.\n\nThe game difficulty is relatively easy, so it's accessible to new Gamers. It never felt overly easy where I felt bored, though, and by the end of the game it brought on a decent challenge, as it brings about everything you've learned and gained to full circle. The AI is also decently balanced and well programmed with some exceptions, as when in need to be stealthy, they won't unfairly spot you... most of the time.\n\nNow the Bad:\nThe controller input was a huge pain to set up. It's weird really, it recognized that I was using an XBox One controller (literally, it didn't think it was a 360 controller) but inputs are read as "Button 1, Button 2, etc." So they were a pain to set and often I had to go back and change them because they still felt uncomfortable. The controls in the HUD are also not identified as "A, B, X, Y, etc." instead they are identified as symbols, which gets very confusing until you use them after a few hours and commit them to memory.\n\nOn top of that, the camera can screw up a jump incredibly easily, or if Ezio isn't positioned right at times he'll jump in the complete opposite direction you wanted him too and either die, get found, or lose a lot of health. This got annoying but not to the point where I wanted to stop playing.\n\nAlso... Uplay. This is a negative because of how weird it acts. A few times Uplay crashed on me, sometimes it wouldn't start up the game, other times it actually froze my computer. Also it's mandatory to have it run to play this game.\n\nNow the (not so) bad:\nThis is almost like a feature (The series as a whole is known for their glitches), but there are glitches galore, but never to the point of game breaking and usually they end up being really funny. The AI will push each other, sometimes dead bodies spaz out, at one point my target accidentally killed itself, etc. Sometimes it ended up costing me, like there is some collision detection issues when assassinating guards on the edge of a roof, but sometimes I would end up having them stuck in the wall with their legs hanging out, so I got a good laugh from that.\n\n\nAll in All I highly recommend this if you missed out, as you're in for a real treat. Returning players who lost/sold their console versions can have this as a good alternative if they have a moderately decent computer, even if they may have trouble setting up the controls on a gamepad.","June 4, 2015","true","30.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I recommend this game, it's a good game with a very good story.\nI began with Asssassin's Creed 2 because before buying I toke a look at the forum of the game, and saw several reviews about  Assassin's Creed "1", and several people say the game is very good but with a lot of repeatitivy missions, and can be boring after some hours of gameplay. In the other side, I read good reviews about AC2, then I did a option to take Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and with it get a game and two after with the same protagonist, Ezio. I bought the games during a steam sale, and thought good to take 3 games at same time with a good price.\nAt this time when I write this review, I have finished AC2 and started Brotherhood yesterday.\n\nWell, it's an amazing game with amazing story, I really like the game and sure recommend it.\nPros:\n* Amazing story, based on Italy near 1490, 1500.\n* Some historical persons like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavel, and others.\n* Good mechanical of fights, with a variety of weapons, swords, and the hidden blade \m/\n* Good side missions, some timely chalenged, some stealth. I didn't get bored with them.\n* Several hours of gameplay.\n* The evolve of habilities in fight and parkour during the game.\n\nCons:\n* The 3rd person view sometimes sucks. Sometimes the camera changes, you didn't view the back of your person, view by the side, the controls change too. Sometimes it sucks a lot to do right directional jumps, and sometimes when a jump is wrong you need to return and restart the mission from the beginning, very anoying. Fortunatelly this type of problems begin when you are at +-80% of the game.\n* Because last explained, some missions is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to finish. Imagine like you play for 5 or 6 hours just to finish a mission with 5 minutes of duration. And when you go youtube for help, you see other players saying the same: some anoying missions are really very, very anoying.\n* The mechanism of stealth in this game seems some broke. I had played Far Cry 3 some time before, I really like stealth way of play, and in Far Cry 3 the AI and stealth works very better.\n* The way the game shows controls during the game: the game don't show the keys (like E, shift, button 2, space), and instead shows icons related to the actions. Not a big problem, but take some time playing to fixing in mind these associations. I noticed it is better on Brotherhood that shows the keys instead of icons. A tip: I swap right mouse button with shift key, I think is better to run by holding the shift key (like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and other games) instead of holding mouse button.\n* Uplay DRM. It's not really a cons for me, fortunatelly I didn't get problem with uplay, but several people don't like uplay.","March 17, 2014","true","117.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Escaping from Abstergo Industries and joining a crew of Assassins, Desmond relives the life of another ancestor, Ezio Auditore, an Assassin from Renaissance Italy who sought to avenge his family's murder at the hands of Templars while uncovering a conspiracy of his own.\n\nPros: This game builds on what made the first Assassin's Creed a success, while introducing a new climbing and combat mechanics. Although less numerous, cities are larger and taller than ever before, gaining access to new areas almost up until the end-game. You have a home base, Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, in which you can invest to get recurring in-game revenue. The story is interesting and intriguing, and missions are less rinse & repeat than the previous game. Although the graphics are some years old, they still hold as ok by today's standards.\n\nCons: There is very little development with the overarching plot that made Desmond travel back to Altaïr's and Ezio's memories in the first place. If you invest early enough in Villa Auditore, money becomes trivial quickly, making sidequests like races and assassination contracts pointless, and you will make little to no use of the items you get from collecting feathers. Fighting can get somewhat repetitive, and late-game bosses pose no more challenges in a fight than the average guard, albeit taking more strikes to get rid of. There are no random events, so you will pretty much fast-travel all the time as soon as you've been to a region once.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nOverall, this game is a good followup to its predecessor, finishing on a cliffhanger much like the first game. It remains nonetheless a satisfying playthrough, and I'll recommend it to anyone who haven't already played the sequels.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","April 20, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Absolutely amazing. Incredibly fun.\n\nEDIT: I would like to come back to this review and give an honest opinion on what I think about the game. I originally made the "review" above when I had only a few hours of game time.\n\nI'm going to say it right now, this is probably my favorite game in the series, or at least top two, as of August 9th, 2014.\n\nTo start off, the story of Assassin's Creed 2 is above and beyond what I would have expected after playing the first game. It's not just a linear "go kill this person and come back" type of story this time around. There are genuine reasons for killing the people you kill, the cutscenes have many, many times more emotion than in the first game, and the voice acting is superb. In the first game, Altair's voice is monotone the whole way through. You could chalk this up to his serious personality, but if you have ever played games showcasing Altair later, such as in Revelations, you'll know this is not the case. It shows that Ubisoft really put many more hours of effort into making the story in Assassin's Creed II the best it could possibly be.\n\nNow, as far as content goes, the overall content in Assassin's Creed I can be smushed into 15 hours at max, and 8-9 hours if you just play the story. However, as you can see, I have 50+ hours in Assassin's Creed II as of the time this review is being written. I have replayed the game once now, but many hours were spent dicking around in the unique environment that is Renaissance Italy. There are endless possibilities for things to do in Assassin's Creed II, even after finishing the story. The best part is though, that even after finishing the game, I can start a new game and not be bored. That's the beauty of this game to me, and all of the Assassin's Creed games really.\n\nOverall, this game is worth the money twice over, and if you're thinking about buying it, you really should. I can honestly say that you'll have a hard time regretting it if you give it a chance.","December 29, 2013","true","52.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And Ubisoft really learned the lesson about the second one. Each city is huge, very huge, with hundreds of side-missions, places to explore, objects to search and collect, a village to improve and much more. The plot gives a turn, showing for the first time was is really going on, and mixing science fiction with a touch of fantasy. And the multiple plot details, based makes the story much more credible. The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life. One thing is disliked is that the game feels stretched, and when you think is going to be over soon, still has at least 3 hours of plot related gameplay. With only that "flaw" aside, the second title of the Assassin's saga is a game that I won't stop recommending.","December 17, 2013","true","25.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/33230/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Assassin’s Creed II is what the original Assassin’s Creed should have been. With the inner workings of an engine already in place and two years to work with, the developers were able to produce a game that proves the potential of the series. AC2 successfully builds on the formula that was established in the first game and manages to improve upon what worked and fix most of what didn’t. The story picks up where the original left off, with Desmond Miles (and some new allies) on the run from the Templars. But this time he’s going back into the Animus willingly to re-live the memories of another ancestor, an Assassin named Ezio Auditore, in order to brush up on the Assassin skills that he’ll need for the battle ahead. Ezio’s story takes place in 15th century Renaissance Italy, primarily in the cities of Florence, Forli, and Venice.\n\nThe environments are, as usual, the most interesting element in the game. The sheer scope of the cities and all of the activity going on within is amazing. Just exploring the city, climbing buildings, etc is pretty fun in and of itself, but what you actually get to do in those cities is what elevates AC2 so far above its predecessor. The missions are no longer a series of boring identical tasks cranked out of some tedium factory. Instead, there is a huge variety of mission types and new game mechanics to go along with them. You now have the ability to blend into crowds at will, hire groups to assist you, and much more. Another welcome change is the addition of a “notoriety” system, where you gain notoriety by performing suspicious or illegal actions. Guards will typically only attack you on sight if your notoriety is high or if they see you doing something illegal. This is a huge and most welcome change from the first game, where you’d end up being attacked for the most ridiculous of things (you know... atrocities such as walking too fast). Combat is also improved from the first game. Although it’s still ultimately really easy, it remains fun due to the sheer variety of things you can do (there are lots of different weapons to try and a whole series of new techniques).\n\nIn addition to the main quest, there is also a ton of other stuff to do. Dozens of optional side missions are available, as well as a series of levels that take place in unique environments that utilize the free-running and platforming elements of the game to great effect (think Prince of Persia style tombs). There is also a “home base” Villa area that you can spend time upgrading and exploring if you wish. Doing so awards you with income that can be used to buy further improvements, more weapons, paintings, etc. This can potentially add hours of playtime and is completely optional. Such is the scope of this game. Perhaps my favorite “extra” bit this game offers is a sub-quest dubbed "The Truth". Hidden throughout the environments are glyphs that grant access to a series of puzzles, that when solved, unlock tiny portions of a mysterious video (which, when fully decoded, truly expands the mythology underlying the whole series).\n\nWhat really makes all of these elements come together so well is the main character of Ezio. He is just a likeable guy and is fun to play as. It’s really as simple as that. All in all, it’s hard to ask much more from a sequel. While yes, there are still some flaws here and there, there was nothing that ruined the experience for me to any large degree. Maybe part of it is just how leaps-and-bounds better AC2 is than AC1 that it’s easy to be more forgiving of any blemishes. I suppose that could be it. But then again, it could just simply be that a good game is a good game... I’m inclined to think that’s probably the case here.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.","February 7, 2013","true","47.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, with everything said I have a couple of problems with this:\n\n1: The free-running was not always responsive and sometimes I run straight off in the other direction making me seeth with rage and no longer willing to play for the next 30-60 minutes.\n2: The requirement to have a U-Play account was seriously stupid and annoying because for some reason the launcher always crashes now whenever I put in my log-in information.\n3: You need internet to play this game, you can't play it on the rode like plenty of other games which is also because of U-play\n\nSo all-in-all this game is excellent, I would reccomend it to everyone who I know.\n\nP.S Does anyone else have that glich where the launcher keeps crashing whenever you try to log-in?\n","January 2, 2015","true","84.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More interesting than ever.\n\nUp to every detail the game is awesome.\n\nRecommended for sure!","July 21, 2011","true","89.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It will continue to do so everytime you start it.\n4) To solve this, you will need to Uninstall Uplay from your PC, restart and reinstall the latest Uplay client from the Ubisoft site.\n5) You will now be able to start AC2, and register the game.\n6) If you are using the Controller as recommended, you will soon realize the controls are messed up and you will have difficulty getting it to work.\n7) The only way I managed to get the controller to work was by downloading these files and putting them in the Ac2 directory.\n\nhttp://www.fileplanet.com/212510/210000/fileinfo/Wireless-Xbox360-fix-for-Assassin's-Creed-I-and-II\n\n8) Now you are ready to start the game.\n\n\nPlaying this game requires you to go through the Uplay client even though you are using the Steam client.

UPLAY!!!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optomization, horrible frame rate drops when there shouldnt be, taking me 2 HOURS to setup the game because it wouldnt turn on 5 TIMES, so i had to uninstall it and do it all again, its just total bs.\nThe fact that it has a third party program to run of meaning Uplay, HA more like Usuck, get it??? anyway this is only minor but jesus christ is it annoying\nSometimes there are moments where the textures wont load in at all, and lips wont move when the characters are talking , which really takes away form the enjoyability of the game\nOverall, this game is Beautiful and i was suprised about how much of a step up it was than 1, it has great graphics, for its time anyway, solid gameplay and a Wonderfully crafted story\nyou SHOULD play This on console, because of uplay, at least on console you cant access uplay without xbox live so YAY!!!!\nFINAL VERDICT: 9.5 OUT OF 10, A REVOLUTIONARY GAME, MY FAVOURITE GAME OF THE TIME","October 27, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay and controls have been revamped ever so slightly, combat upgraded, and improved, but are still similar enough to the previous game that you can transition seemlessly from one game to the next.\n\nThe story continues in Rennaissance Italy from the perspective of the Assassin Ezio Auditore and you learn much more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the plot thickens...\n\nUnfortunately, the vastness of the world and the limited means of mobility (running, horseback, sparce waypoints) lead to a lot of time spent just travelling around and this can become tedious, but not enough to detract from the adventure.\n\n9/10","December 1, 2013","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can overlook Ubisoft's awkward game launcher, it's certainly worth picking up when it's on sale. There's no better way to learn about Italian architecture than getting up close & personal, so trade in your gelato spoons and salad forks for a hidden blade and flintlock pistol!","April 15, 2015","true","69.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where is the 'Hell Yes' button?\n\nIf you are new to the series, this is a great place to start. The controls will be taught to you in the early stages of the game very clearly, unlike some other games in the franchise which teach some things but expect you to know others already. This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you don't feel like playing through the first one. (this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.)\n\nI've owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. I'm sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too 'retro' feeling (This review written in 2015). I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamer's game. Stuffed so full of content, I didn't even do all the extra missions (not even close) and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really can't recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic. It won't play when you start a new game and the opening cinematics in these games are very good.","March 17, 2015","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gone are the same repetitive side quests at every turn. Instead we get a game more expansive and with more depth than its predecessor and a beautifully crafted medieval Italy to explore and experience. The protagonist, Ezio, is also an improvement over Altair feeling more like a protagonist rather than a puppet that the player guides through the game world.

Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more "wise" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a ♥♥♥♥ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more "bad" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox...\n\nIn the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the "best game ever" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that. I give it a 8.5/10","July 26, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having only played 10 minutes of each before moving on, I'd always felt I hadn't given it enough of a chance. So this week I decided to do that and sit down for a proper go. I couldn't find my AssCre disc 1 so I went with this, the second one.\n\nThe controls were putting me off when I first started to play, with some really confusing layouts which meant I was constantly hitting the wrong keys and getting stuck. Once I started to master it though, it became second nature. I'm pretty certain anyone that plays this will feel the same way and will want to give up after a few failures but don't, stick at it. The controls are fine once you get your head around them and allow you to do quite a few different things with only a few key presses.\n\nThe story is absolutely amazing. Set in the 1400's in Italy it tells the revenge story of your character, who witnesses the death of his father and brother. This takes him around the country finding the perputrators. Voice acting is second to none, some of the best and more like watching a film it's that well produced.\n\nGameplay can get a tad repetitive with a lot of, kill this person, hide here, steal that but they are joined by bucket loads of side quests which break up the monotony. That's not to say it's boring, but more varaity would've been nice.\n\nGraphics are great but are showing thier age a bit now, especially when you look at AssCree 3 and 4.\n\nAll in all, I'm sorry I never played this before now. I can really understand why there's a huge cult following for the series. The price you can get this at, you'd be a fool not to play it. It's one of the best games I've played, easily in the top 10. Make sure you DO stick with it though as I mentioned. Just fight through any frustration you might come across.\n\nOh and one last thing. It's LONG! I thought it was about to end on around 4 occasions, then it sent me on another quest! There are 12 chapters in the normal version, and 14 with all DLC. I didn't realise I had the 14 chapter version so got to play the lot. Still, without those 2 extra chapters the game is extremely long.\n\nGet it!","September 30, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can never get over that).\n\nThe good:\n- Better interface than Assassin's Creed 1. Better everything than in the 1st game.\n- Great atmosphere. Cities look great.\n- When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun.\n- There is enough stuff to do.\n\nThe bad:\n- It is not open-ended when this kind of game clearly should be\n- You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!!\n- Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok.\n- Some faces look/animate pretty badly\n- It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really.\n- You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore.\n- Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support.\n- When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better.\n- The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.\n\n\nSo yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.","June 20, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The environment, particularly the cities, are lively, there is a lot more to do, from objectives, to interaction, to managing an entire city. While the "collecting this to achieve that" is still there, the overall dynamic is increased a lot. References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.\n\nI think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined. It takes a little getting used to the new fighting style, and I could have done without the "swoosh visuals" of hack'n'slash games, but hey, the additions, including an enemy's health status, are worth it. You certainly don't have to complete every single "grind" quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.\n\nMoney plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known. On top of that you will meet well known historical figures, even befriend them and enlist their help!

Buy AC: Brotherhood which is a better game in gameplay and level design. This I recommend only to those who want to start the Ezio Auditore da Firenze plotline from the beginning. For the subplot(modern day), one propably could go for this or the first. The subplot doesn't advance that much during one game, so it really doesn't matter.\n\nEzio plot isn't that great in this game, it's a bit illogical revenge story. It's feels occasionally quite forced and all the side quests feel like just "something extra to do, but not relevant in any way to anything". I understand the game has a bit long time scale, but it still kind of feels funny that Ezio would be spending his time running races on the rooftops against random people just for few florins. Especially since florins are quite useless after 1/4 of the game.\n\nLevel desing is good most of the time and the cities are quite interesting places. On the other hand, player spends most of his time on the rooftops. There's not much to see on the streets apart from walking people, so there's no reason to walk around just for fun. Also this game takes place in many cities, so one does not get familiar with any of them. General flaw in a sandbox game I think: make the city so big that no one never learns to recognize anything else but the minimap screen. Then again the game artificially constrains some areas as "not available" until later in the game.\n\nI also recommend having a controller to this game. I played my first with kboard and mouse and now I played with controller and it felt so much better, even though not as good as AC: Brotherhood. Especially since this game doesn't have a proper key mapping.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, it just has some annoying flaws and almost everything is made better in AC: Brotherhood. So I say I recommend this game, but with a grain of salt.","September 24, 2014","true","91.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/33230/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on January 3, 2011\n\nAssassin's Creed II is a sequel that improves on it's predecessor in many ways. That being said, the game still does many things wrong. As a PC game, it is really frustrating for a variety of reasons.\n\nCONS:\n\nFirst, the UI is clearly not made for PC. It seems every multiplatform game these days has to use like size 24 font or the equivalent. I understand that consoles need this because people sit farther from the screen and the control input is imprecise, but PCs do not and the fact that developers don't make this very simple change to adjust the UI for the PC is really frustrating. Assassins Creed 2 is very bad about it. In the menu, you don't have a mouse cursor, instead you use directional keys to navigate, but the mouse's movement still swings your navigation wildly, which makes doing anything in AC2's menus really annoying and consolized.\n\nSecond, the control interface is also heavily influenced by consoles, but not only is it clunky or unresponsive at times, but it actually misinterprets commands wildly in some situations. So much of what you do in the game is contextual (to compensate for a controllers' lack of buttons) that it is very annoying to use on PC, where people are used to one button generally meaning one thing. I found myself accidentally jumping backwards off buildings or not " locking on" to landing areas when free running, which gives the player a sense that he is not really in control. I have learned to anticipate this over time, but I wouldn't call what I have learned a useful gaming skill. The controls are really counter intuitive. For example, the spacebar, which combined with right click, allows you to sprint and freerun, also makes you jump, and since you are sprinting everywhere constantly in order to get places faster, this means you accidentally jump quite often.\n\nAnother minor gripe is the use of a weapon wheel and no keyboard numbers for weapon selection. While the wheel is all good and well, nothing is quicker that pressing a single button and instantly bringing up the desired device. The lack of this and the lack of mouse scroll wheel controls is a clear mark of consolization.\n\nFinally, the controls tutorials are atrocious in this game, and the tooltips that pop up reminding you how to perform special actions are nearly useless. This is all for one reason. The controls are not labeled with their keyboard equivalents, but with symbols. This means that before the player learns that holding right click means going into high profile mode, the player must first learn what the games' silly "fist" symbol means by looking it up. Remembering exactly what these symbols and their combination do is an unnecessary hassle, and should have been gotten rid of altogether. They are however, labeled with colors, a reflection of controller buttons, and this is yet another piece of sloppy console porting.\n\n\nThe Camera is another aspect of the game which is frustrating for PC users. While normally, it stays comfortably in position behind Ezio, like in any Third Person game, there are times (mostly in platforming sequences) where the camera flips around wildly, which can be really disorienting. This is designed to help people see what they are doing in platforming sequences. The problem is that for some reason, moving forward means moving in the direction the camera is pointing, not the direction Ezio is pointing. This means that if you are running along a beam and the camera suddenly switches angles, you will start moving in a completely different direction and probably fall off.\n\n\nOne final consolization lies in the graphics engine. Like in assassin's creed 1, the shadows are still impressive, but the character models, poly count, texture quality, and draw distances are not. The engine is looking really dated, and as they open up the gameworld, it really starts to show. That being said, the game still looks really great, especially in motion and compared to other multiplats. It hasn't lost anything since AC!, but it also hasn't gained much either.\n\nMy final gripe with the game is the plot and character development. The silly plot about "genetic memory" and a grand Templar conspiracy throughout all of human history has been expanded to include supernatural elements including aliens and ancient technology. I suppose it has gotten a little better now that Desmond finally does something, but it is still really goofy. The glyphs and their attached puzzles are mind numbingly awful in this regard. The Templar and the pieces of Eden were apparently behind every conspiracy theory since JFK and the Moon Landings. Next they'll bring in 9/11. It's just absurd. In addition, the characters are really underdeveloped and in places, hard to believe. Ezio's mother, a Florentine noblewoman in the 15th century, tells him crassly that he needs to find "other outlets for his energies besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥s." REALLY? I found that and many other lines delivered by characters to be absurdly out of place. Not just for the time, but for the believability of such characters as modern interpretations of the past. The delivery and scripting of many such encounters are really hard to believe. In addition, the Assassin techies in the present helping Desmond apparently miss the fact that connecting unknown bits of technology to your system and not protecting it will have consequences as well.\nOverall the game pushes the limits of reasonable suspension of disbelief well beyond their maximum.\n\n\nPROS:\n\nThe being said, the game does many things right. Like in AC1, the actual atmosphere is great. You really do feel like you are walking the streets of 15th century Italia. The crowd dynamics, minor AI interactions, sounds and artwork all are great.\n\nThe villa, fast travel, less generic missions, not dying in water, improved blending mechanics, and less generic collectible quests all make for a much better gameplay experience by fixing flaws from the first game. But I'm not going to praise these things too much because the 1st game was AWFUL in many of these regards. Fixing them is simply what should have happened, nothing more.\n\nI will say there is a lot to do here. The game is very fun, and it is a good buy for the $10 I got it for. Wouldn't have paid $20, however.\n\nUltimately, if you liked Assassin's creed but wanted it to be fixed, that's exactly what you'll get with AC2. It's just still a sloppy console port with a really silly plot.","December 31, 2013","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This Assassin's Creed is without doubt the best in the series. "How so?" you may ask. Well, let me answer that question for you.\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 starts in Florence, Italy, a truly beautiful city. You play the character of Ezio Auditore de Firenze. As you begin, you are just a young Italian noble, but you'll soon learn a family secret, and become the most deadly and awesome assassin that there ever was. When Ezio learns of his past, he sets out to assassinate other men who were conspirators against his family. Along the way, you'll travel to several different cities (Venezia, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, Florence) and explore them, assassinating the men you're after and even make new friends.\n\nThe game really outdoes itself with it's amazing soundtrack. Listening to it makes you feel like an assassin just like Ezio, but you'll never be as cool nor as good as he is. There are miles and miles worth of city to track and explore. There's also several unique assassination techniques that are extremely satisfying to pull off. As you complete missions, you will earn yourself some cash and be able to buy better armor and weaponry. The weaponry is also very interesting indeed. You can use smokebombs to make quick getaways. Throwing knives to kill those pesky archers on rooftops, use poison on one of your enemies by injecting them with it via your hidden blade. You can also use a neat little gun attachment on your arm, which is extremely useful for making assassinations quick and sword-free.\n\nOne of the best things is the combat system. When you're engaged in hand-to-hand combat, you can dodge, taunt, and perform epic killmoves. Are you one that likes to use swords, daggers, or even your fists? Then you'll enjoy the combat system very much. Another thing that the game executes very well is in the "free run" system. This running system allows you to climb onto objects and get onto rooftops and perform some very darn good parkour.\n\nBut if there is but on reason to play this game, it is the storyline. The great voice acting and fun and touching storyline are what make or break games. But Assassin's Creed 2 has done that very, very well. If you are one who enjoy the Assassin's Creed series, or even if you're someone who has never heard of it yet, you should definitely pick the game up. You'll enjoy amazingly detailed cities, great combat, amazing story, and an overall satisfyingly spectacular experience.\n\n9/10","December 31, 2013","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the process of course he uncovers his true identity, and advances the story and plot that was introduced in the first game.  The story that revolves around the animus is also here, however its emphasis is greatly dimished from the first game.\n\nThe elements that made the first game so fun are still here: Open world parkour, vast cities to explore, fun combat, mini games such as time trials and beat up events, overlook climbing, etc.  However adding to the mix are several new weapon types including a pistol, a customizable "home base" mini-city to generate wealth and keep your "stuff", upgradeable armor, paintings to collect and display, and the introduction of currency "florins" which you can loot from dead bodies or find in chests that are scattered about.  In short there is a LOT more to do than before, resulting in a more immersive experience.\n\nThe character animations and sound design are both excellent.  Cut scenes are rendered in real time as before and character emotes and voice acting are superb.  I use the XBOX 360 controller since clearly the controls were designed with the console in mind.\n\nGraphically the game is an improvement over the original although at times the textures show their age during cutscenes.  A remastered version of this game would be fantastic.\n\nThe level of historical content is huge, with additional info available from the abundance of database entries accessible at any time.  I actually learned a lot of things I did not know.\n\n3D Vision support is superb with the HelixMod update.\n\nHere are a few things I found a bit frustrating:\n1) Flaky controls at times, particularly during the "lara croft" style tomb raids.  Advanced parkour moves are typically not necessary for the rest of the game, so learning them during the tomb raids can be frustrating and require a great deal of precision.\n2) Checkpoint saves suck in general, and here there are moments where the checkpoints are too far apart, requiring you to replay quite a bit.\n3) The frame-rate will frequently drop, especially in cities.  I have a nice mid-range system (780gtx/i5-4850) so I should not be seeing drops in the frame rate, which strikes me as just poor PC optimization.\n\nStill despite some annoyances this game kept my attention through many, many hours.

In the process of course he uncovers his true identity, and advances the story and plot that was introduced in the first game.  The story that revolves around the animus is also here, however its emphasis is greatly dimished from the first game.\n\nThe elements that made the first game so fun are still here: Open world parkour, vast cities to explore, fun combat, mini games such as time trials and beat up events, overlook climbing, etc.  However adding to the mix are several new weapon types including a pistol, a customizable "home base" mini-city to generate wealth and keep your "stuff", upgradeable armor, paintings to collect and display, and the introduction of currency "florins" which you can loot from dead bodies or find in chests that are scattered about.  In short there is a LOT more to do than before, resulting in a more immersive experience.\n\nThe character animations and sound design are both excellent.  Cut scenes are rendered in real time as before and character emotes and voice acting are superb.  I use the XBOX 360 controller since clearly the controls were designed with the console in mind.\n\nGraphically the game is an improvement over the original although at times the textures show their age during cutscenes.  A remastered version of this game would be fantastic.\n\nThe level of historical content is huge, with additional info available from the abundance of database entries accessible at any time.  I actually learned a lot of things I did not know.\n\n3D Vision support is superb with the HelixMod update.\n\nHere are a few things I found a bit frustrating:\n1) Flaky controls at times, particularly during the "lara croft" style tomb raids.  Advanced parkour moves are typically not necessary for the rest of the game, so learning them during the tomb raids can be frustrating and require a great deal of precision.\n2) Checkpoint saves suck in general, and here there are moments where the checkpoints are too far apart, requiring you to replay quite a bit.\n3) The frame-rate will frequently drop, especially in cities.  I have a nice mid-range system (780gtx/i5-4850) so I should not be seeing drops in the frame rate, which strikes me as just poor PC optimization.\n\nStill despite some annoyances this game kept my attention through many, many hours. Overall heartily recommended.\n9/10\n","February 8, 2015","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly this game marks a fall from the grey morality featured in the first game, with rather simplistic villains and side characters, with Ezio being the only character that truly stand out in the game, reverable in the same lines of Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr.\n\nThe gameplay and mission design has been signifigantly imrpoved in this iteration, including side missions. Although some of the side missions are rather mundane and don't make sense overall with the story, they are nice deviations and most of the side missions are rather enjoyable.\n\nDesmond's story falls short in this one, barring the introduction of side characters such as Rebecca and Shaun, because you are restricted to the Animus for most of the game and you aren't free to get out and walk around whenever you wish.\n\n91/100","October 20, 2013","true","186.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The environment, particularly the cities, are lively, there is a lot more to do, from objectives, to interaction, to managing an entire city. While the "collecting this to achieve that" is still there, the overall dynamic is increased a lot. References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.\n\nI think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined. It takes a little getting used to the new fighting style, and I could have done without the "swoosh visuals" of hack'n'slash games, but hey, the additions, including an enemy's health status, are worth it. You certainly don't have to complete every single "grind" quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.\n\nMoney plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known. On top of that you will meet well known historical figures, even befriend them and enlist their help! If you liked the first Assassin's Creed, even a little bit, you will not be disappointed by this one!","March 17, 2014","true","57.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In many aspects it is better then the first Assassin's Creed.\n\nPros:\n- Captivating story. Although you can sense a little bit of what might be coming, I was still amazed that they went full blast on that concept.\n- Not as repetitive as AC 1.\n- Great graphics, and environment in general. History lives and breaths in this game. From music, through architecture, details and famous and fabulous painting. Even weaponry of the era.\n- Eagle vision is useful!\n- Interesting characters.\n- Decent length of game play.\n\nCons (not many):\n\n- Combat is very similar to one from the original game. Can feel clumsy a bit sometimes.\n- Although you have a wide variety of weapons to chose from, I hardly ever used throwing knives (unlike AC 1) or felt necessity to use short blade (unlike AC 1 again).\n- From time to time you might get irritated when camera's twists and turns mess up your jumping or other acrobatics.\n- Although far less bugs happened, I've captivated pretty hilarious one. In Venice you may encounter legions of guards on one tiny bit of rooftop. Out of the sudden. They just HAPPENED there. The more you killed trying to clear out the area, the more would pop up in their sted. Creepy.\n\nApart from that, the game is one of the rarer kinds when you have a blast playing and can learn some history. This is of great value as well, and AC series so far has been also educative. I know I'll be fishing for other titles of AC now. Yeah, I've heard the rumours about meh protagonist in AC III but... I must yet get disappointed by any game of the series. So far so good.\n\nRecommended!\n","December 22, 2015","true","61.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it is still bogged down by a lot of design choices that leave me puzzled.\n\nFirst of all, I just wanted to say that similarly with the predecessor, the modern day stuff just blows the big one. None of the characters are likeable. Desmond is really boring, and just does what he's told without a single thought. That Shaun guy is just a huge prick. And the computer girl just gives me "2edgy" vibes all the time. Lucy is okay because she's nice, but that's honestly the best trait any of the characters have. It still doesn't make me care about her.\n\nNow, most of the game is done in the past storyline which is great. Lots of likeable and dislikeable characters which made me care about them. The protagonist, Ezio is a lot of fun, Leonardo de Vinci is impossible to hate, and all the supporting characters are interesting. The vast amount of history available in the database on the real-life locations and characters also make this game very unique. (Though sometimes the history tidbits sound like they were written by some angsty-and-trying-to-be-cool teenager, which is very off-putting.)\n\nI also really enjoyed the updated weapon variety and the toned down reliance on repetitive mission types. What I mean by that is in the first game, 80% of missions were just eavesdropping, or pickpocketing (in other words, something incredibly trivial). In this game, there's a larger variety of missions, and the dependence on a single mechanic isn't really as present.\n\nNegatives? Combat is simple (which is fine) but somehow they still manage to make it incredibly finnicky and not smooth. Same with wall running, I found myself jumping in the complete opposite direction to what I wanted or jumping off of a building way too many times. Also the HUD is very annoying; it's incredibly ugly, intruisive and distracting. Anything that reminds you that you're in the Animus was such a headache to look at. The only other thing on the technical side of things is the texture pop-in. Holy ♥♥♥♥ it's awful. At least this game runs better than the first one.\n\nAnd while the story is interesting at points, it really just cumulates in the last quarter of the game. The first three quarters is just "kill this guy for revenge" over and over again. And the ending is incredibly nonsensical. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWhile it's an improvement over the first game, I still can only recommend this as a buy when it's on sale. To me there are just so many strange things that bring the quality of the game down. I really don't get the hype around this series when there are so many poorly executed mechanics right up front and center. I give this a 7.0/10. It's a good game, but not much more.","December 29, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They took the original concept and polished it to a mirror finish. This game is utterly fantastic.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first game at all, you owe it to yourself to play this one.

The actual story I loved easly 30 hours of gamplay and I allways wanted to play on to see what would happen next.\n\nExtras: Admitedly the side extrtas allthough fun to start off with get a bit tireing towords the end as it's pretty much just the samethings a bit of varity the more you play through the game but mostly the same things.\n\nMap: One of my favorite things to do in this game was just climeing over roofs trying to stelthily take out the guards It was great fun. Plus you dont have to put up with the same map for long as the game quickly moves along to new areas where the land scape is diffrent to an extent.\n\nControlls: The controlls for this (on a keyboard) are relitivly easy the grasp the parkour elament of it is rather simple may take a bit of getting used to but not that hard. The combat is where I had some difficulties basic returns and blocks are easy to manage but some of the mroe advanced moves are acward to do apart from that it is a pretty smooth controlls\n\nAll said I do still love this game by far a great collection to the series and I recomend it to anyone who likes the stelthy approuch to things 9/10 (apologys for any incorrect spelling I'm dyslexic so bound to have some incorrect spelling in there I try not to have too many but some slip past me)","September 3, 2015","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, it is difficult to play on the keyboard. It took me awhile to get the feel for the settings. I bought this game on sale because I never played any games in the series and I heard this was the best one. I am very interested in Renaissance Italy, and I found it fun to just explore the different cities, especially Venice and Florence, which were sculpted with amazing accuracy for a game made in 2009. The story is quite compelling and it took me about 30 hours to beat, but most people take 20ish.

In fact, I can't really think of another sequel that improves more on the original than this one.  Whereas AC1 had you repeating the same types of missions over and over, AC2 has a huge variety of missions right up to the end.  Likewise, combat also has more variety with upgradeable armor, weapons, and home bases giving the gameplay a tiny bit more depth.  But perhaps best of all, while AC1's plot was silly, AC2's plot takes things to a level of complete insanity that is kind of charming in its own unintentionally absurd bat-♥♥♥♥ way.  I can't think of another game, for example, that let's you storm a medieval castle, beat up a pope, and (mild spoilers) hob-knob with alien beings all in the space of a few minutes and all with a completely straight face.

Ubisoft managed to take everything that was great from AC1 and fix everything that was bad. More variety in missions, good and charming story, excelent presentation, better combat, better climbing, stunningly beautiful cities and interesting characters. It's very hard to find cons in this game! I loved it, especially the soundtrack! Except maybe, final boss fight, its was a bit dissapointing, but nothing major. This game will entertain you for at least 24 hours just like the first one, but the content is much richer and there's tons to discover and side-quests to do.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nStory 9/10\nSound 10/10\nGraphics 9/10\nPolish 10/10\n-------------\nOverall 9/10 (outstanding game)","June 8, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is probably still the most fascinating and awesome in the series, and so is the setting. I am italian, so seeing the historical sights of my country in this game is even better than it already would be for others. The main character is generally considered the most interesting protagonist in the series, and for a whole bunch of good reasons. The gameplay has its highs and lows: parkour is sometimes broken and combat is kinda boring and waaaaay too easy to put up a real challenge. And yet, this game manages to be a vast, varied, interesting, fun to play open world that has enstablished a very high standard for the series, a standard it did not always live up to. Brotherhood may be more refined, AC III may possess a (way) better graphic and technology, AC IV may have an overly awesome pirate setting with sailing and stuff, but this is still the episode that stays in my heart, and one of the last where the plot still made mostly sense. If you love this series but have only played the recent installments, buy this one ASAP.","December 3, 2014","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I can't really think of another sequel that improves more on the original than this one.

Likewise, combat also has more variety with upgradeable armor, weapons, and home bases giving the gameplay a tiny bit more depth.  But perhaps best of all, while AC1's plot was silly, AC2's plot takes things to a level of complete insanity that is kind of charming in its own unintentionally absurd bat-♥♥♥♥ way.  I can't think of another game, for example, that let's you storm a medieval castle, beat up a pope, and (mild spoilers) hob-knob with alien beings all in the space of a few minutes and all with a completely straight face.

Compelling story. Very immersive. Step into the well equipped role of Ezio Auditore. Stalk the streets of Italy and end yoru prey. This game is a must play.\n\nThat said, keep in mind that no game is Portal (read "damn near perfect"). There are a few caveats that make this game annoying. First and foremost: UPlay. Even the retail version of this game is wrapped in Steam, then has a second layer of UPlay. You're efectively running two game platform clients that effectively do the same thing in order to play this game. The only difference is UPlay doesn't have a store. Second is the controls. It's clear that the game's primary SKU was a console system and the PC controls suffer for it as they did in the original. After a while, they become easier to use, however the occasional jumping off a building unintentionally, grabbing the wrong ledge, or jumping the wrong direction will happen all the way to the last level.\n\nI encountered a single progression break where one target kept standing back up after killing him and the other that was supposed to be there did not spawn. It was a simple matter of restarting the memory, so it wasn't a big deal. I also encountered a UI bug where the Windows working cursor was visible. This happened often when I accessed UPlay while in game. It's not a deal breaker, but it IS distracting.\n\nEven with these faults, the game is spectacular. It gradually introduces you to the tools used by Ezio while keeping you enthralled by the story.","January 11, 2014","true","51.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story really succeeded to catch from the very beginning; starting out as a (somehow) normal guy with no weapons and later on obtaining more weapons as you play and collect Codex pages, with which you fight your way through several great cities, to finally defeat the Pope of Roma and thereby avenge the murder of your family.\nThis game really has amused me with both graphics, voice acting (accents!), the beautiful areas, the atmosphere, and the gameplay - sure some missions were almost identical, but you also get to do a huge variety of different tasks such as attending a carnival.\nAlmost nothing for me to put a finger on except a few rarely occouring glitches.

It was during these modern day sequences that we were introduced to Dr. Warren Vidic, who heads up the program where the memories of ones ancestors are accessed through a device known as the Animus. It is here that Desmond Miles was forced to experience his ancestors memories from the time of the Third Crusade - An assassin known as Altair who would break the three tenants of his Assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the Templar, Robert de Sable, who was said to be after a powerful artifact known as the Piece of Eden. Killing de Sable would reveal that the very man at the head of the Assassin's Brotherhood was a Templar himself and one who was already in possession of this powerful artifact. Confronting and finally killing his leader, the artifact would later reveal a holographic map showing Altair/Desmond where the other artifacts were hidden throughout the world, artifacts so powerful they could change the very destiny of man. Artifacts that Abstergo would kill to get their hands on. It would also be revealed that a former test subject had been leaving cryptic messages only Desmond could decode that would foretell the end of the world.\n\nAssassin's Creed II wastes no time in picking up where the first left off. Having discovered that Dr. Vidics assistant Lucy Stillman is a mole, she eventually breaks Desmond out of Abstergo and ferries him off to a safe house where a group of her colleagues have developed an improved Animus. Desmond must once again enter the Animus and access his ancestral memories in the hope that more pieces of the artifact will be revealed before Abstergo can learn of them. This time around we are witness to late fifteenth century Florence as we are introduced to a young nobleman by the name of Ezio Auditore da Firenz who after witnessing the death of his father and brother - brought about by a corrupt official working for the Templar's - is then forced to flee to his Uncles villa with his life and that of his mother and sister hanging in the balance. It is here that Ezio is taught the ways of the Assassin's Creed by his uncle who eventually sets him on a course of revenge that includes killing a number of Templar figureheads all involved in the death of his father and brother with the trail finally leading all the way up to the top of the Vatican itself with Rodrigo Borges - otherwise known as Pope Alexander VI - a powerful man who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the remaining pieces of the artifact. Before doing away with Rodrigo, Ezio is inducted into a secret brotherhood of assassin's having amply proven his worth to the cause.\n\nHistorically recreating locations such as Venice, Tuscany and Florence the player is introduced to this wonderfully created digital world through main missions and side missions (Rocksteady could take a leaf out of Ubisoft Montreals book on how to create a living and breathing digital world that is a pleasure to explore and not a bore). The world we get to inhabit as our playground is a wonderful recreation of late fifteenth century Italy even going as far as introducing us to a lovable Leonardo Da Vinci who Ezio befriends early in the game and who exists to help decipher the many numerous codex's Ezio comes into contact with. Spanning a period of twenty years the game is a particularly massive one and to be honest this sometimes acts to the detriment of the actual game itself. Assassin's Creed II requires a lot of dedication and patience from its players to progress through and to be honest it starts to suffer near the end because of it. Whilst most certainly a massive improvement over the original in terms of scope, design and story telling it does come at a cost where the game gets so wrapped up in its own awesomeness that it starts to make itself rather redundant, sluggish and dare I say - boring - towards the end with missions that simply exist to pad out an already lengthy game. Just as you think the story is starting to wind down to its conclusion the game will throw another mammoth task your way that will lead into another mammoth task and this may try a very few many gamers patience and tolerance levels as it did mine. Having to find out that I needed to kill nine Lieutenants of the Templar Order towards the end of the game made me want to curse to the heavens after already inhabiting this world for a good 60+ hours. For all the frustration the game induces near its end, it's carried forward by a serpentine plot that is less over the top than the original but far more thrilling and engaging. The ending is a little bit of a disappointment when you finally have Rodrigo Borgias in your assassin's sights. After all the build up this encounter is rather dull and lifeless but thankfully is concluded by a spectacular sequence I will not reveal for those that have yet to complete the adventure.\n\nSpending so much time in the shoes of Ezio what ultimately emerges is a gaming protagonist for the ages. Voiced impeccably by a first rate cast, Ezio is immediately likable and enduring and emerges as a fully rounded and developed character that one becomes incredibly vested in early on in the game. I can see why Ubisoft was a little reluctant to pack him away after the adventure concluded going as far as creating two fully fledged sequels continuing his adventures alone. Where as Altair was a one dimensional figure from the past and not particularly likable it's the exact opposite when it comes to Ezio who can be ruthless and cunning but also generous and incredibly warmhearted. Assassin's Creed II when looked at holistically is an impressive game indeed with the graphics looking quite spectacular for the most part although you can see the games original console limitations with muddy textures abound everywhere. Audio, however, from the clash of swords to the sweeping and epic soundtrack through to the incredible voice cast is all top notch throughout the entire game. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed II emerges as a game I loved for the most part where it not for all its irritating inconsistencies towards the end (those final missions were a test of endurance and patience and frankly I could have done without them as it employs one of my pet hates in gaming where more and more enemies are thrown at the player to try and give the illusion of a suddenly ramped up difficulty). This ended up being a slight killjoy rather than the thrill ride I was expecting for a conclusion.\n\nBut with that being said I still thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time spent in Ezio's company and I look forward to continuing my adventures with him in the future, just hoping and praying slightly that his remaining two adventures are a much tighter affair than his first one.","October 8, 2014","true","21.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The plot continues from the original Assassin's Creed, where Desmond once again enters the Animus and this time takes control of Ezio, an assassin who is out for vengeance against those who killed his father and brothers, while also trying to discover the truth about who he is and what he must do.\n+ Set during the 15th Century across many cities in Italy, this game has a unique feel. Graphically it's not that great, but the colours are really nice and the towering, iconic buildings have lovely architecture, giving you the impression that you're really in a Renaissance era town.\n+ You can purchase new weapons and upgrades for your armour, along with treasure maps to locate hidden chests of loot, which encourages exploration. You can upgrade your own city and learn new fighting moves in combat training. Raid assassin tombs, clear out templar lairs or complete assassination contracts. There's so much to do.

As such, they decided to use the exact same formula here. Fortunately, it's not a total disaster. The tutorial is better this time and explains key usage much more thoroughly. Assassin's Creed 2 does a much better job of anticipating your actions and this results in free-flowing, natural movement, making the game enjoyable. The controls could still be simplified and significantly more efficient though. It is obvious this game was once again poorly ported from consoles and it's disappointing.\n- The graphics in this game could be improved.\n- While the movement system is fluent mostly, it falls apart when you want to move fast in combat and switch between targetting enemies. There's multiple keys involved here which are too complex to grasp in the small reaction time available.\n- Travelling between locations within a city can get tedious and boring. There's a lot of climbing, running and leaping in this game, which has its benefits and drawbacks. There's no fast travel option to accomodate players who don't wish to lug themselves across the city every single time.\n\nOverall Score 7.5/10\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 is a lot better than the first installment in the series. By no means is it fantastic or ground-breaking as many would have you believe, but a good action game nonetheless.

The beginning is probably the logical answer to that.\n\nOk so, I have never played the first one. They all went on sale some time last year, and I got from AC2 to AC4 for like 23 British Pounds, it was great. Like an idiot, I forgot about the first Assassins Creed. This wasn't a problem until some smart ♥♥♥♥ from school told me they all follow a story which is intertwined in all of the games. By which time I had already got further in Assassins Creed Black Flag that any of its predecessors. As you can tell, I was off to a good start.\n\nThat aside, I vowed to myself not to play ANY Assassins Creed games until I finished them in order, which is a pain because I hate the era of Assassin's Creed 2. Well, to the review I guess, I have rambled enough.\n\nI can't remember the dates, and I can't be bothered to look it up for the sake of the review. We can make it a little interactive review, look it up yourself :) (Here: https://www.google.co.uk/ )\n\nLet's settle with 1400 and cabbage, that's a start. Assassin's Creed is set in an era before guns, which is enough for me, it put me right off. You play as an Assassin. His name is Ezio (Microsoft word thinks it’s Elliot), god alone knows how you actually spell that. Much like all other games in this franchise, you are taken on quite an interesting story to uncover mythical Assassin and Templar secrets from the forgotten past. It sounds really exciting doesn't it?\n\nI can't give this game a 'no' because the game itself is pretty good. I just don't like it. It is well made, and the graphics are horrible. I understand it's old, but they do make me cringe a bit. The accents on the speech are horrible, no offence to Italian people, you don't all sound that bad. The gameplay is like all other assassins creed games, where the missions are often rather over complicated and you have to parkour everywhere and lunge on people and kill them. They have everything they need, they ought to make a parkour simulator, really, it's a hidden talent.\n\nThe story itself is quite repetitive, though it is good. There is a lot of 'kill a bunch of enemies and then do it again and again and again' and it gets BORING, but hey.\n\n8/10. I cannot fault the game without being an idiot. It is a good game; I just don't like it. A lot of time went into it, and for its age it is quite impressive. I have to re-enforce though, that I hate that era. Black Flag is my favourite so far, though Assassin's Creed III does look brilliant too.\n\nP.S. You wouldn't believe how may times I had to edit this...all the typos I made.

This game is a must play one of the best in the year and really took a turn in graphics. It had an amazing story following the first game with a new character named Etzio (I think i spelled that right). Still Desmond must fight in the present time to defeat the templars and go in "baby" to see his ancestors past secrets. Great game I wish I didn't waste as many time on the side missions, but hey i completed it and it was good. I would say all is good except one problem I hope they do fix is when you climb buildings and such that you kind of have a tendenacy to jump off when pressing the A buton.

The problem with the controls is that they never mention the key you need to press for a certain action. For example, they'll show a "hand icon" to steal money, and not the actual keyboard key to use for the action. So you have to go into the menu, to learn which key is bound to that icon. Its really annoying and had me waste a lot of time, trying to memorize all the keys.\nOverall the game is amazing. I really like the gameplay.

This game takes the excellent ideas in the first one and makes them fun!!! Yea, what we've been waiting for.\n\nThis is most people's favorite of the Assassin's Creed games. It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist (perhaps because he has a personality!) This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasn't old hat yet.\n\nThe new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different (Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals), but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence.\n\nOne of the bigger additions to the game was money (a staple in the series now.) Money is f*cking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as f*ck!\n\nEven though that sh*t's dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before. It has gone from 10 hours of tedium (and some fun) to like 30 hours of fun.\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nAlso, the final boss is the pope, so that's a plus if you're into channeling your papal anger.","December 21, 2014","true","93.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They looks pleasing to the eye.\n\nSound: 9/10 - The music is perfect for Italy and sets the mood perfectly, that includes during fighting and exploring.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 - I like the gameplay a lot, but since it's a PC port, the controls can be really, really awkward. You also have to use your memory to remember the controls because instead of telling you, "Press C to crouch" for example, it will tell you "Press the Foot Key to crouch." then you must remember what button you set as the foot key.\n\nLasting Appeal: 8/10 - Decent replayability here, if you really like the story and just like the progression of skills and the game in general, you may want to replay this, maybe 100% the game. Either way, it should keep you busy for a long time as the average time for this game to be completed is around 18 hours, and that's not including the people who 100%'d the game.","January 1, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you were like me and quit AC1 half way through because of boring gameplay then this game will not disappoint! the atmosphere is much better and more real.

Desmond has uncovered the location of "The Apple" a rare piece of eden that has the power to manipulate and enslave other humans. Desmond escapes Abstergo with one of the workers who reveals herself to be an Assassin named Lucy Stillman. After they escape Lucy tells Desmond their struggle against the templars and they're losing, with Desmond she explains it'll help their and for him to become one of them he has to go through "training". With that he must go through another of his ancestor's and one of the best main characters in AC to date: Ezio Auditore Da Firenze, an Italian noble starting his journey as an Assassin in 1476 at the age of 17. Desmond also meets Shaun and Rebecca, Rebecca provides the animus 2.0 and gives tech support to desmond while Shaun provides historical information, people, events, letters, etc to Desmond while he's in the animus.

I didn't feel at all hindered by this game and I always kept smiling everytime I kept playing. Again thank you so much Ubisoft for putting in so much effort into this sequel. 10/10\n\nCONCLUSION: This is the definition of sequel, with an amazing story, surprisenly better graphics, and so much gameplay changes and ideas that worked.

AC1 was a good game, yet was repetitive. " Altair, go here, do this. " Is the majority of the dialouge you would hear. With the new release of AC2, the game is undoubtly the best in the series. The graphics were improved, missions were no longer repetitive and the combat was improved. New moves were added, new weapons, and the feature of shops. Blacksmiths, Tailors, Painters, Bankers and many more shops are located. The game is very non-linear with the chance of looking for artifacts to unlock a special armor. The voice-acting was amazing and as the story progressed, you felt for the character. Although during missions the timers are annoying, and some of the city of Florence is spaced out, I give the game a 9/10. This is an amazing game that you should buy.","March 14, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it's a game 3 years ago but it's still beyond many many ACT games nowadays. Graphics is good, plot is long enough and attractive, combat process is fun, riddles are not very difficult to solve, and the exlporation process of assassin tombs reminds me of my  happy memory of Tomb Raider series. Besides these, AC 2 provides many side quests for you to complete, and gathering part (such as treasure boxes and feather, etc.) of the game is much less boring than many games because you can climb or jump beween buildings, which entertains me a lot.\n\nAlthougn I haven't finished this game yet (85% completion), I can't wait to recommend this game for who haven't played it, and I'm looking forward to playing AC 3 after I finish 100% completion of this game, and if AC 3 can still give me the same or more fun, I won't hesitate to buy AC 4.","January 5, 2014","true","50.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I mean everything. The climbing, combat, music, etc ends up being miles beyond what ACI offered.\n\nPlaying as Ezio Auditore, you'll explore Renaissance Italy on your personal quest to avenge your family, but there's much more to Ezio's character arc than just REVENGEANCE.\n\nACII is quite long, it'll take you more than a few hours to complete, and that's if you don't bother with any of the side stuff. Of which there is a fair amount of.\n\nCombat is rather simple, but it's satisfying and visually entertaining. No real difficulty to it though. Brutes are a needed addition to the enemy combatants, but they really aren't very intimidating in comparison to how they need to be.\n\nThe PC port works fine in my experience, though the Uplay client can be a bit frustrating.\n","July 1, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The gameplay is pretty good, the graphics are nice, even today, and the entire feeling of the game is really good.\n\nPresentation: 8/10 - Really feels like I am exploring area's of Italy. The game comes together nicely, sure some of the menu's are slow to load and a little clunky and sure the options menu may be a hassle to get to sometimes, but that shouldn't spoil the game for you. The reason I didn't give this a 9 instead of an 8 is because of the horrendous control scheme.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 - Nowadays the graphics aren't amazing, but they are still really solid. They looks pleasing to the eye.\n\nSound: 9/10 - The music is perfect for Italy and sets the mood perfectly, that includes during fighting and exploring.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 - I like the gameplay a lot, but since it's a PC port, the controls can be really, really awkward. You also have to use your memory to remember the controls because instead of telling you, "Press C to crouch" for example, it will tell you "Press the Foot Key to crouch." then you must remember what button you set as the foot key.\n\nLasting Appeal: 8/10 - Decent replayability here, if you really like the story and just like the progression of skills and the game in general, you may want to replay this, maybe 100% the game. Either way, it should keep you busy for a long time as the average time for this game to be completed is around 18 hours, and that's not including the people who 100%'d the game.","January 1, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Be prepared to  possibly go through what I have gone throug, which is installing and updating uplay, activcating this game, and then not even be able to play it.\n\nEvery time I try to launch this game whether through steam or Uplay, it attempts to launch and then hangs at a black screen indefinitely, and forces me to either sign out of windows or restart to gain control, because it wont even let me end the process once it hangs.\n\nAdd to this the troubling occurence of Uplay disabling my sound driver forcing yet another restart, and you begin to see why I'm not recommending this game and it's DRM within a DRM issues, absolutely no developer support, and lackluster programming preventing it from even starting, and why you shouldnt even bother with this hassle.\n\nI have tried all the suggested fixes including refreshing Steam, verifying game integrity, witch-hunting all the uplay files after uninstalling and then installing the updated version, etc. Nothing has worked and so I have come to the logical conclusion that this game and Uplay in general is just broke, invasive, and doing things that it probably shouldnt be doing, similar to a root kit, or a security policy bypass.\n\nSave your money and give it to a company that deserves it.

The gameplay is redundant, sticky, glitchy as a pre alpha.  I haven't played the console version in awhile but from what I remember these glitches were mostly nonexistent.  Ubisoft seemed to accidently put the alpha on steam or something.  Not to mention to use a controler (which you pretty much have to considering the controls are about as good as playing it with a potato) are almost impossible to map out I had to download some sketchy .ini files of the internet just to get the game to work.  Ezio never seems to do what I tell him to do when I click buttons and the parkour never works I've found walking gets me places easier.

This quite possibly could be the best game in the series, unlike the new ones there is no repetitive missions, the story is meaningful and it makes you want to come back for more.\n\nA few things that are a bit annoying is that the controls are very bad if you are using a keyboard, it does not tell you which keys to press but rather icons, this can be a tedious task flipping back and forth to the controls menu and the game but once you get used to it it is pretty good.\n\nGuards are very hard to kill in this game, I cannot stress that enough. The guards come in different sizes and it is sometimes very annoying and boring constantly spamming the hit button. (But perhaps that's because I'm not as skilled)\n\nOverall, a very good game. I am looking forward to the next segment of the Ezio trilogy.\n\n9/10","July 4, 2014","true","20.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Problem was quickly solved with their customer service.

The gameplay videos on Youtube look amazing and the game comes with a fair prize during Steam's campaign sales. AC2 and AC:B are available on OS X as well so there was no second thought about purchasing it.\n\nBut it doesn't all smell of roses.\n\nWhen you buy the game, they don't tell you that you can't play it before a forceful subscription into Uplay which seems to be some kind of Ubisoft's own gaming platform/environment thing. And if this does not feel enough like Big Brother breathing down your neck, then check this out: you have to agree to some freakin' long legal document before they let you play. Now, what if I didn't want to agree to it? Would I get a reimburse? I won't answer that. Basically Ubisoft kicks in some extra demands AFTER you've paid them.\n\nThe game starts off pretty awesome and you get the feeling of a great story unfolding but once the intro videos end and you receive control you'll get exposed to a really complicated set of controls. I found myself spending more time in options page during the first hours of gameplay than in-game. Overall I felt very stuck and it was not fun at all. AC discards many 101's of gameplay controls for a reason unclear. It would not even be a problem if the game would give you time to get accommodated with it's specifications, but instead the game starts off with a competition where you have to put those newly learned combos into full use in a tight race over rooftops. It took me full 30+ times to complete it and there was nothing fun about it.\n\nBEWARE! As if this was not enough, PC and Mac users have another major obstacle to deal with. After 30 minutes of gameplay it's quite likely that your keyboard or mouse stop working. There's especially high risk that the game starts to conflict if you're using Logitech hardware. If you don't believe me, google something like 'Assassin's Creed 2 keyboard not working' and you'll see that there are whole forums full of guys in trouble with this problem. Ubisoft's own homepage has a topic on this with no suggestions or help from their side. Don't expect any solution or help if you face this problem, you're on your own. I exchanged my Logitech mouse to a Microsoft one and now I can play for about 15 minutes, after that the mouse freezes and I have the option of either to continue playing with Mac's touchpad or restart the game. I have given up any hope to receive better performance out of the game.\n\nThe game is very mission-based and there's not as much freedom as you would expect if you saw the gameplay videos. I constantly have the feeling that if I only play a little more, it will all become more relaxed and free but I know it's an illusion. It's nothing like Elder Scrolls or Gothic.\n\nBig brother Ubisoft really screwed me with this purchase. It's been a very bad experience for me and I know to keep away from Ubisoft products in the future for sure.","January 1, 2014","false","83.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The App Store's "Joystick Mapper" won't get you anywhere for now, though the developer claims to be working on a workaround.\n\nUbisoft oughta face up to the fact that they have, possibly by accident, made a video game which offers an occasional glimpse of The Sublime.

However I noticed the following problems early on:\n\n-you must hold three buttons simultaneously just to run.  Not one, not two, but three.  This is a cumbersome mechanic and I can't even tell you what the "profile" button does.\n- the main tutorial for the control keys consists of a one minute review of your character's birth.\n-at no point in the game does it actually say what key to press in the game to do something, sans the control mapping screen.  Instead, for just about everything, from attacking to exiting out of a game menu, there is an icon which corresponds to what the control key does.  So instead of telling you hit x or enter or whatever to do something it will tell you to hit the fist button or the legs button.  Wow, I use the legs button to kick and run?  The head button to taunt?  Very helpful, game designers!  I never would have guessed these things!  Talk about being lazy!\n-while scrambling up a wall, several times I could neither see the footholds and handholds, nor would my character figure out where they were.  This made climbing the wall frustrating and several times my character jumped to his death instead of moving forward.\n-you're pretty much thrust into the first few fights with little chance to adjust to the learning curve.","March 28, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The only reason I won't recommend it is the fact that Uplay isn't available EVER, and I've installed/uninstalled it over and over again with no help. Took about four hours to install this just to have it deleted and REINSTALLED AGAIN as an attempt to get Uplay working. Don't get this if you don't want to risk losing 20 bucks, just play it on the PS3 instead.","April 9","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It looks fantastic. But because I own a Mac it takes a lot of tampering with my computer to get this to run. Then, it's a battle with U-Play and a bunch of trial and error to see if it will even connect to U-Play even though your internet connection is fine. And once you do get it set up to actually run, you find that you can't have a controller, mouse, or anything plugged in, because if you do, the game locks all your controls. Meaning that if you want to play this game and you're on a laptop, you're stuck with a keyboard and trackpad. This game was not designed for a keyboard and trackpad. It's almost impossible to play. I don't have access to a Windows PC at the moment so I'm stuck with this horrible port that I paid for because I wanted to see if I could get my Creed on.","June 29, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I did finnish 1 playthrough because when I buy a game I must try to finnish once to get moneys worth out of the game. I liked the game story itself but hated the view and controls. I have never been so angry and frustrated playing a game. I played both Darksiders (video walkthrough needed) and they were the hardest games I have and are linear and would recommend them over this game even though the story may not be as good\nAfter all of that I just picked up Brotherhood Deluxe for 7.98 reviews say controlls better. I am a sucker for punishment lol. I want to like this series it could have been so good. I wonder if it was more designed  for console and not pc\nI remember the reason I quit playing I am stuck in a dungeon with water and have to jump to a few poles then bounce of a wall then swing around on some bars back to a door to open. I hit the lever to start and am unable to jump off the 1st pole to 2nd. I can jump in water I can jump back to landing  but will not jump to next pole. Have tried a few time since Dec and finally this week after trying again I said forget it. I have enough other games that work!

Having heard great things about the series, I chose this as my starting point and was a bit disappointed.\n\nThere are so many poor development choices here, and I'm really hoping they're addressed in other AC games because I'd like to try at least one more out. But here are my criticisms:\n1) The game uses Uplay, which sorta sucks. I thankfully haven't had a lot of the issues some of the other reviews here have had with it, but I did run into issues on initial startup (some Uplay files deleted themselves and I needed to reinstall it, for example)\n2) Freerunning..while it's pretty awesome and can be at times fantastic, there have been a lot of situations where Ezio just did the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ and really frustated me. Trying to jump off a roof towards a hay stack and for some reason jumping two feet out onto the cold hard floor and dying. Trying to drop two feet onto a balcony to get a treasure chest and INSTEAD jumping 30 feet down into a haystack. Trying to catch someone on a rooftop and jumping slightly too far off to a side instead of onto a little foothop. You get the drift. In a game where you need to be swift and precise the precision just doesn't feel there quite a bit of the time...Not that often, but often enough that it gets frustrating. Along with that, the puzzles aren't even really puzzles, but more of a "can you look around and then hold the freerunning button in the correct direction".\n3) Combat is atrocious. Foes are constantly blocking and sometimes counter you (which doesn't hurt you much, so there isn't really any reprecussion) so you have to whittle down their health tediously or just sit around waiting for them to attack so you can counter, which sometimes barely hurts them. Allies hit each other (had a quest character hurt another one 3/4 of her health). Stealth killing sometimes launches you off roofs when you just wanted to look cool..Also random posts get in the way when you drop in for stealth kills. Why wouldn't it just make me jump differently so the stealth kill worked? Who knows.\n4) You can't switch weapons or armor without going back to your main villa. This is stupid as hell. If I buy a weapon that is worse than my old one just so I have everything bought why do I automatically equip it and why do I have to go all the way to a transport station so I can get back to the main villa, go to the equipment room, and reequip my better weapon/armor? So stupid.\nSome of the dialogue is just laughable (you need outlets Ezio 'I have outlets' OTHER THAN ♥♥♥♥♥♥S haha lol) and the plot is a little contrived. I'd much rather just have the plot center around Ezio and not have the simulation aspects (also the decoded video segments are ridiculous looking and stupid in my opinion). Following people around for missions is boring. Money comes way too easy and you'll have more than you ever need after you start upgrading the villa. There's no sense of tension since you can heal yourself at any time.\n\nThe game isn't all bad of course. There's still some fun to be had and there's plenty to do and collect. It just seems really pointless at times...there's enough playtime here that you'll 'probably' get your money's worth, there's just plenty of better things you could be doing or playing.","June 15, 2015","false","29.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the main characters was different in the first game so you won't lose a mountain of back story but you might feel a little confused sometimes when past events are mentioned.\n\nAny games released after this (Brotherhood & Revelations), before Assassin's Creed III are essentially pure story. The gameplay and setting are very similar but story keeps on going. This series is a like a book in game form. ACIII has different main characters than the games before it and the setting was changed as well.\n\n----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----\n\nStory: 5/5\nGameplay: 4/5\nChallenge: 2.5/5\nDiscovery: 3/5\nReplayability: 3/5\nAesthetics: 3.5/5\nVisuals: 5/5\nAtmosphere: 2.5/5\nMusic: 4/5","November 26, 2013","true","42.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Slightly flustered, but eager to finally jump into the game I had been waiting an entire day for, I clicked the icon in Uplay to launch.\n\nIt crashed.\n\n\nMoral of the story: Either Ubisoft needs to fix the ♥♥♥♥ out of their delivery service or Valve needs to get a contract with them which avoids the necessity of downloading Uplay.","December 10, 2014","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
