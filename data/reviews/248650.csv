There are also games that are created, with the most innocent of intentions, to just be a game. Draw a Stickman EPIC is certainly the latter, and for that I give them credit as it’s becoming harder and harder to find a game you can just buy once and play all the way through. Unfortunately, this is where the positive points about the game end.\n\nThe game will start you off drawing a rudimentary stickman which you will then guide around a series of levels in a top-down view, looking for the exit to unlock the next one. The levels can branch in different directions, meaning that you could end up unlocking a different level depending on which exit you took during your time playing the last one. Each level has various environmental puzzles that can be solved by drawing a specific object to use such as drawing an axe will let you chop down trees.\n\nThe premise seems solid, but the final product will put you to sleep. Now that you’re vaguely familiar with the gameplay, let’s discuss what’s wrong with it. For starters, the drawing mechanic is kiddy-pool shallow. There are roughly 5 different things you can draw, in addition to the axe you can also draw fires, rain clouds, thunder clouds and keys. If you thought it would be a game like Okami where you draw bridges to progress, or Scribblenauts huge selection of drawings, you’re out of luck.\n\nDrawing keys is completely redundant, it’s not a puzzle to put a key in a lock, it just wastes time to keep having to draw them and they simply aren’t necessary. Additionally, each thing you can draw has its own pencil. The game isn’t smart enough to know what you’re actually drawing, so it determines what object you’ve drawn based on the pencil you’ve chosen which brings up the question, why do you have to draw the object at all? You can draw anything from a straight line, to a Salvador Dali replica but if you did it with the “axe” pencil, it will only ever see it as an axe.\n\nThe next thing wrong with the gameplay is how monotonous it gets. One stage in particular stood out with this, where you had to use a key operated robot to plough through a wall. No clues were given on this, but there were a huge number of chests, barrels and boxes around, and yes you had to just keep breaking them all open one at a time until you found the right one (by drawing an axe, which breaks after 3 swings and needs to be drawn again). Once found, along with finding the control box in a similar way, you needed to use keys to turn the robot in 90 degree increments until it was facing the right direction (keys, again, get 3 uses before you need to draw a new one). Additionally, you needed keys to operate the control box to make the robot move forward, then turn it yet again after it moves to re-align it with the target. Dull as a butter knife, because it’s obvious what you have to do, it just takes so long to do it because of having to redraw all your tools, but then why couldn’t you have just made it so the robot can be turned around without keys at all?\n\nThis is the main issue the game has, in fact. Everything is so straightforward, but it’s made difficult and more time-consuming from having to stop every couple of steps to “draw” something. You can’t move while drawing, so it’s essentially little more than padding so that the game will last longer than 30 minutes.\n\nPoor level design ensures that tedium is never far away, with most puzzles boiling down to destroying everything you can, looking for clues in the environment (such as using a lightning cloud over a gravestone with a lightning symbol on it) then clicking on any interactive objects until you find the exit. The best way to describe the gameplay is like a point-and-click adventure with no plot… or colour.\n\nThe graphics are abysmal and I don’t buy the “it’s the style” argument. If you set out to design a game that looks like this from the start, then you probably should have changed the concept before you began working on it. Justifying bad art does not make it any less bad.\n\nEach level is a static, flat image completely devoid of colour or artistic talent. Everything that moves does so with animation tweening of a single frame in the same way bad Flash animations do.  This would be excusable if any of these actually looked like some effort had been put into drawing them, but no. The style dictates that everything has to look like it was drawn by a 5-year old, but it’s not even doing that right, it looks like a game drawn by a grown man to LOOK like the drawings of a 5-year old.\n\nDraw a Stickman EPIC barely qualifies as a game, being the digital equivalent of those baby toys with shapes that fit into specific holes. And just like those toys, I cannot possibly recommend this to anyone over the age of 3 due to choking hazards.\n\nPros:\n~Doesn’t crash very often\n\nCons:\n~Grotesque graphics and animation\n~Painfully repetitive gameplay\n~No replay value\n~More time spent in the pencil UI than solving puzzles\n~Drawing mechanics have the depth of a pancake","June 14, 2014","false","15.3"," 137 of 175 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","137","175","9","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/248650/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Draw a Stickman attempts to occupy an area between Scribblenauts and Drawn to Life, but by subsidizing its biggest selling point with a plethora of terrible design decisions it completely misses the mark. This is not a game for those looking to flex their creativity as there is little needed or allowed, and it is not a game for fans of point-and-click adventures as the puzzles are anything but and the story non existent. So who exactly is this intended for? Well, I would have to say nobody as it is just not fun and far more trouble than it is worth.\n\nFor a game seemingly based around drawing there is a shockingly low amount of it here. You begin the game by creating your own stickfigure, a task which somehow evolved from a mundane diversion on restaurant napkins into a frustratingly imprecise procedure, as the pencil takes on a mind of its own and places itself at random several points from where you intended. Considering MS Paint did it better more than a decade ago, I have no idea how the developers managed to screw up such a basic and integral part of the game.\n\nOnce you have your character you are placed into a sketched out world and given a handful of different markers with which to get past obstacles and enemies. The problem is that while you are encouraged to draw something resembling the item that will come out of your chosen marker (for example a raincloud or key) the game makes no qualms about what shape you actually end up with. This was disappointing as I was hoping for something a little more involving, but when you have to draw the same four items dozens of times it becomes trivial to actually flesh them out when a simple straight line acts much the same way. Worsening this is the speed at which you must draw to stay alive, as you can withstand but two hits from the numerous enemies, and a death means restarting the level from the very beginning.\n\nThis in itself would be annoying and the terrible controls only escalate the problem. I frequently got stuck on the environment and has animations break, as well as often getting hit by my own creations. Despite the backgrounds being drawn with an illusion of depth the markers don't adhere to it, acting more like stickers placed on a glass pane than something being drawn into the picture. It makes drawing even more of a chore than it already was, forcing you to frame the screen at awkward angles, and adding an unfair challenge to the challenges which are never explained in the first place. A repeated task involves making yourself bait to lure enemies toward certain areas, which is neither fun nor often works correctly and usually ends up with you getting killed and repeating the process several dozen more times.\n\nWhatever I expected out of Draw a Stickman it didn't deliver on any front. The controls and gameplay butchered any potential it could have had and left me with a sour taste in my mouth when I beat it in about two hours. Not because of the short length, but for how quickly I grew tired of it and wanted out. There are hidden levels and collectibles to find which may extend your playtime, but I can in no way recommend it in the first place.\n\nAs yet another example of what happens when a good idea doesn't get off the ground, Draw a Stickman in no way lives up to its exaggerated subtitle which given the quality of the game, almost writes the joke itself.","December 22, 2013","false","1.8"," 82 of 116 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","82","116","0","9"

I've played this game for more than 8 hours to get 100% achievements. I wanted to recommend this game, but I really can't.\n\nThis game is based on the novel idea of drawing your own character and your own tools to progress the game. The idea is good, the artwork is decent, there is a plot, and even there are additional puzzles and Easter eggs.\n\nBut, there are quite a couple flaws in either the design or implementation of this game, that makes playing this game very frustrating quite oftenly:\n\nWhat you draw is irrelevant in most cases -- you actually click to choose a pencil from a couple to indicate what you are trying to draw, and for most of those you can just draw a straight line for axe, key, cloud, and fire. This makes the entire "drawing" concept meaningless. Plus, most of the things can only be used for once or three times, so if you are trying to draw perfectly every time, it may take you a few extra hours to beat game.\nIt's actually 3D-in-2D game, but this game deals with collision quite bad -- sometimes it looks like there is no obstacle but you just can't move.\nThere is no pathing implemented, if you want to go to point B from point A, even if they are connected by some path, but as long as there is some obstacle lying in the connecting straight line, clicking on point B will just lead you to the obstacle -- you need to bypass it yourself.\nThere is no saving inside a level, and if you take damage twice within a short time period, you will die and have to start over again. And it's really easy to die without even knowing why due to the two issues above, and some levels take ~10 mins to complete.\nThere is the Paul Bunyan achievement which requires you to chop down 500 trees, but at the time I got all the other achievements , I have only chopped down 40 trees. Seeing that woodcutting isn't an important part to win this game, I think this achievement is quite obnoxious. I basically did nothing but to chop 460 trees for 40 minutes.","February 21, 2015","false","8.4"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","45","58","6","0"

The art style is cute. It's not a long game (there is one achievement in particular that requires a lot of grinding, and I think this accounts for the number of hours a lot of people have in this). Some of the puzzles are challenging, and all have extra collectibles to find or things to do.\n\nThe bad: Poor damage & combat mechanics make the game somewhat more difficult than it needs to be. You can kill yourself quite easily with lightning or fire, and if any monster gets ahold of you it is generally lights out quite quickly, and with no checkpoints or saves in levels, this can mean some frustrating restarts.\n\nGeneral info: You play a little stick person trying to rescue your friend (coincidentally, another stick person) and questing through a sketched world. The actual artistic skill required to play this game is zero (all your "tools" can be straight lines if you wish), but it's definitely more fun if you take the time to sketch and enjoy. Replay value is low, once you've figured out the puzzles.\n\nOverall: I don't know that I'd purchase it at full price, but if you pick it up during the Steam sales, I would recommend it!\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","December 11, 2015","true","19.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Off on a quest to rescue her best friend (a potato with hair), there was ample satisfaction gained by wielding mustachioed keys and smiley-faced axes.\n\nAlthough the early levels are easily played by children, the latter half of the game is not (and we resorted to a FAQ for the final level).  Fortunately, the death screens are greatly amusing.  In the end enough amusement was had by all to make the experience well worth it.\n\n---------------------------------\nPotato: A Fable\n\nOnce upon a time there was a girl whose Daddy nicknamed her "Potato".  This was quite annoying, for her father was quite absent-minded and would occasionally pluck at her cheek thinking he was grabbing a chunk of potato to eat.  "Daddy!" she would squeal.  "I'm not a potato!  Potatoes can't talk!"  Upon this reminder his face would sink in shame and he would promise, promise, to remember that his daughter was not, in fact, a potato, and then five minutes later he would pluck at her cheek once again.\n\nDaddy was a very nice Daddy, the girl decided, but not blessed with an over-abundance of brains.\n\nOne day they were at the local park, walking along a quiet trail that wended its way through a dense forest.  The girl was eyeing her father's hand suspiciously as it crept ever-closer to her cheek when suddenly a loud Boom! shook the treetops and knocked them to the ground.  Confused and unsure, the girl and her Daddy slowly got back to their feet, coughing and waving the clouds of dust away.  And as the dust began to settle, they saw what had appeared in front of them.\n\nIt was tall, twice the height of the girl.  It was heavy.  It was pocked with weird-little marks like eyes.  It was dull brown.  It was a potato.\n\nThe potato grabbed the girl's father with spindly black arms.  "No!" the girl shrieked.  The potato turned as if daring her to do something.  It still held her Daddy, who had fainted and gone quite limp.\n\nThe girl took an involuntary step back.  For an instant she considered fleeing - after all, what could she do against a potato twice her size?  But then she saw the potato use its free hand to poke at Daddy's cheek, as if wondering how much it could pluck away. . .\n\n"No!" she shouted, and leapt forward.  The potato reared back in surprise, but the girl already had it in her pincer-like grip. . .\n\nWhen her father came to, they were once again alone in the forest.  "What happened?" her Daddy asked.  His eyes remained unfocused, and the girl tensed as he brought his hand close to her face - only to pat the top of her head.  She sighed in relief.\n\n"Oh, nothing," she said breezily.  Then she belched, long and deep and full of flavor.  Her Daddy turned green.  "But," she added as he struggled not to throw up, "can I skip dinner tonight?"\n\n------------------------\n\nI think I need more sleep.","July 17, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game offers you a pathetic attempt at a story, tosses you some hand-drawn 5-year old levels and then asks you to "puzzle solve" your way through them by combining the functions of different colors with the few objects that those functions are actually capable of interacting with in the level.\nSo, realistically, this game isn't actually about solving puzzles or even progressing through anything so much as it is an interactive hide and seek between your functions and the objects those functions affect.\n\n...I'll pass.","May 15","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have this game on my Kindle Fire HD, and I know i haven't played this much yet on the pc but I just could not resist the deal ( Which was 50% Off By The Way ) and the story of this funny game is that you need to go and save your friend who is being kidnapped by a stickman with a magical pencil that can draw anything. You also have a magical pencil too, but, you have a couple of different one's for different levels and also you get to draw anything like you can draw a cat as fire of a burger for a sword. That's not the best part of it. You get to create your own stickman your own way and also your friend and it is entertaining ( in my opinion ) for all ages. if I have to rate it out of 10, I would give it 8/10.

Considering there are free versions of the game on other platforms I am not sure why its normally valued at $5. I know five bucks is cheap, but the game really isnt worth more than a couple dollars in my opinion.\n\nGameplay-Stickman felt like it was designed for either a younger or less experienced gamer. The Idea of drawing your own tools and items was the primary selling point for me. Unfortunatley, its actually just about 5 options the entire game- axe, key, cloud, fire, and armor. You cannot be creative and draw anything outside of that criteria.\n\nSound-The music was fantastic and catchy. No complaints there. The main menu's music sounded oddly similar to the menu-tune from "The Wolf Among Us" by Telltale games.\n\nGraphics-The game delivers exactly what you would expect from a stick-figure title. however, the customization of your character was slightly dissapointing due to the bulky lines you had to doodle with. A fine-point pencil/pen would have been better in my opinion.\n\nReplay Value-The game was too short and the only challenging level was the final boss fight. I cant see myself replaying a game this quick and easy.\n\nI cant recommend this game to most customers.

You have to make your way through a series of levels by using a limited number of tools that you draw using magic pencils.  The game isn't too difficult, but the first time solving a new puzzle can be tricky, but once you get it, that solution method will often work in other levels.  The tools do change between levels though, so sometimes new solutions are required.  Finding at least one path through to the end also isn't too hard, but if you want to find every path, puzzle piece, and color buddy, it can take a while.  Still, this is probably a 5-6 hour game rather than say twice that.  And there are achievements, should you want some additional challeneges after completing the main story.  Overall, a nice game -- I like games like this that give some challenge, but aren't too difficult or too long.","December 30, 2013","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a silly, amusing little distraction where you make a guy and waggle him around doing stuff, setting everything on fire, accidentally blowing yourself up, and never actually killing anything. If you've got a little kid who unwisely chooses to hang around you, it's probably one of those rare games that you can both enjoy together. The devs are neat, and keep throwing stuff out there just because it's apparently fun to make.\n\nI mean, yeah, it's not Skyrim, but if you're expecting a deep, creative and complex action-RPG with a concept like this, you should probably look into that gushing head wound.","March 10, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the concept of drawing the tools to solve puzzles sounds Scribblenauts-ish, that is where the similarity ends.\n\nEven though drawing the same doodles repeatedly grows tiresome after a while, Draw A Stickman's strength lies in some of the more challenging puzzles, and its surreal, illustrative graphics. There are also a number of hidden levels, a nice touch for the cheap price!\n\nIt's perfect for you if you enjoy casual puzzles, but not if you are a puzzle enthusiast.

In the game you need to draw tools, weapons and elements to clarify puzzles and to affect obstacles.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you need to draw a character which you play and your friend. But your friend gets abducted when you’ve finished drawing your friend. At the beginning you can use the element: fire. With this element you need to burn an wooden fence and to set fire on bombs which are somehow on the ground waiting for you to explode.\n\nMy impressions of the game.\nThe game isn’t really  exciting as you think it would be, because the game gets boring when you play like four minutes.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of the game.\nPros:\n- The game has creativity (not much, but I can live with it)\n- The game has trading cards\n- The game has an interesting beginning\n\nCons:\n- The game gets most of the times boring\n\nI don’t recommend this game, except if it is in a sale for a great price.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

This game is like a piece of candy: cheap, enjoyable, but don't expect it to last. Some levels were challenging, others not so much. The greatest pleasure in this game comes from the creative characters. Funny watching yourself get saved by your own dog, or a wierd creature trying to save a dalek. I also enjoy making very "creative" keys, axes, and other things. you can watch your character chop down about three targets with a stapler if you want, or make it look like an accessory while your character holds it. However, "challenging" puzzles weren't quite as fun since you are basically wandering around aimlessly if you can't figure out the next step. It can be painfully annoying, rather than tricky in the fun way. I think with a lot more options, both in crayon types and in world build, it might be more fun. Some (even the later levels and the Christmas one) are simple, and go by very fast. I have already beat a vast majority of the game in 8.5 hours, albeit I peaked at a few solutions after the "challenge" was no longer enjoyable. I would like to see a game with more strategy options, where if you are confused you are still trying things, rather than wandering around aimlessly.","December 4, 2013","true","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've played this game for more than 8 hours to get 100% achievements. I wanted to recommend this game, but I really can't.\n\nThis game is based on the novel idea of drawing your own character and your own tools to progress the game. The idea is good, the artwork is decent, there is a plot, and even there are additional puzzles and Easter eggs.\n\nBut, there are quite a couple flaws in either the design or implementation of this game, that makes playing this game very frustrating quite oftenly:\n\nWhat you draw is irrelevant in most cases -- you actually click to choose a pencil from a couple to indicate what you are trying to draw, and for most of those you can just draw a straight line for axe, key, cloud, and fire. This makes the entire "drawing" concept meaningless. Plus, most of the things can only be used for once or three times, so if you are trying to draw perfectly every time, it may take you a few extra hours to beat game.\nIt's actually 3D-in-2D game, but this game deals with collision quite bad -- sometimes it looks like there is no obstacle but you just can't move.\nThere is no pathing implemented, if you want to go to point B from point A, even if they are connected by some path, but as long as there is some obstacle lying in the connecting straight line, clicking on point B will just lead you to the obstacle -- you need to bypass it yourself.\nThere is no saving inside a level, and if you take damage twice within a short time period, you will die and have to start over again. And it's really easy to die without even knowing why due to the two issues above, and some levels take ~10 mins to complete.\nThere is the Paul Bunyan achievement which requires you to chop down 500 trees, but at the time I got all the other achievements , I have only chopped down 40 trees. Seeing that woodcutting isn't an important part to win this game, I think this achievement is quite obnoxious. I basically did nothing but to chop 460 trees for 40 minutes.","January 26","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Actually so casual that it hurts your brain. You start out by drawing your character and proceed to draw your mate that get's captured by evil book as soon as you're finished with his sketch. Next thing you know you enter an area that is roughly drawn like a childrens book that no children wants to look at.\n\nYou are tasked to set stuff on fire by drawing with a red pen. You can lit a TNT bar by just making a red mess next to it or right on it. This is where the pain hits you. Is this "game" really this hollow? You blow rocks away with that TNT to move forward and possibly light every sigle tree on fire. It's not fun but you do it because you can. Then you find a secret puzzle piece that is not hidden well enough to qualify as a secret and move on to next level.\n\nAs soon as you notice that the next level is pretty much as deep as the first one you quit the game, delete it and sell the cards way too cheap just to get rid of the bad memories. Do yourself a favor and ruin your life some other way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aguji/recommended/248650/","aguji","babycakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aguji/","66 products in account","What a cute game! The childish art and music are delightful. The premise of the plot is that you and your friend, both of which you get to draw (MS Paint style), are hanging out until a book falls out of nowhere. As soon as your friend takes a look at it, he or she is sucked in and kidnapped! You jump in after them, and thus your journey begins. Each level is a map which you explore in order to uncover collectibles and more levels. Puzzles must be solved in order to get to the end of each level.\n\nSo far, the puzzles I have completed are not too hard. There is a decent amount of collectibles per level, such as new colors for your palette, so exploration is recommended. Different "effect" colored pencils are available per level, such as fire, rain, lightning, and keys. Sometimes you use them directly to complete a goal or damage an enemy, but other times you use them to manipulate the environment.\n\nThe sound effects are funny (such as when you accidentally burn yourself), and the background music fits the game well.\n\nI haven't encountered many bugs, but sometimes my character gets stuck on a rock or tree. It's easily solvable by clicking away from the obstacle.\n\nOverall, it's a charming and enjoyable game.","June 2, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has diffrent types of pens that you need to use to solve puzzles Keys, Axes, Fires and Rain pens to be exact. The game also has multiple level exits so you can go a diffrent path all together. Also there are Colour buddys and Puzzle pieces to find in every level so you can find them and unlock some stuff for the game. The game has a few minor issues. The game is quite challenging for a kids game and plus some of the controlls are hard to use at first but overall a really fun game that all of you should check out.

I played a fair bit considering it was on mobile and enjoyed it to a reasonable degree (again considering it was on mobile). I don’t know exactly what I expected when I first booted it up on Steam, but what I got was just a blown-up, keyboard and mouse version of the exact same game I had already gotten my enjoyment out of.\n\nNeedless to say, there is nothing here that is not in the mobile version. I only got about an hour of enjoyment out of it and I don’t think it would be worth investing any money in.

The art and sound are very well done and work together really well to create a fun, creative world that is a joy to explore. The level design is spot on too. Every level has a unique feel, and solving puzzles and uncovering secrets is legitimately satisfying.\n\nAnd I have to say that they got puzzle solving right. The solutions are always logical. None of this weird point and click logic where you put an onion in a shoe and TA-DA a secret passage way opens. No, every puzzle made sense. Even when I was stuck, I just had to ponder it a bit longer to figure it out.\n\nAlso, the game is solid, technically speaking. Everything worked perfectly, and no bugs in sight. My one gripe is that it's a bit short, but hey, it's only five bucks.\n\nOne aspect of the game that really stuck out to me was how it let me create my own story. I didn't think much of it at first, but when I saved that ugly, hunchback mutant I had drawn hours before, it genuinely brought a smile to my face. I cared more about him than I have for characters in plenty of AAA games. Something about the fact that I made him got me invested into the story more than I usually am. There's something to be said for that, and I'd like to see more games explore this idea.\n\nTo wrap things up, get the game. It's a fun experience and worth every bit of five dollars. It'll get your creative juices flowing, make you think a bit, and bring out your inner child.

Limitations of those skills will disappoint a bit.\nCons: Stiff movement and movement limitations (yeah, you're a stickman, but STILL...). Some places are more difficult than they need to be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/248650/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nDraw a Stickman: Epic has an interesting concept behind it, allowing you to draw your own hero and send him on an adventure to rescue your best friend kidnapped by Zarp, the game's villain. The story has no continuous plot as it only presents you with the situation at the beginning and gives you the finale once you've reached the end of the last level, making the entire adventure seem like a struggle without purpose as you will travel through all sorts of terrains without ever finding anything new. As long as the adventure may seem from a narrative perspective due to the lack of information or plot, it really isn't as you can reach the final level in less than an hour, without rushing the adventure at all. There are some additional levels which you can unlock by finding alternative exits in a level, which is great since those are some of the most unique and challenging ones, but even so they do follow the same pattern with the same pencils and tools at your disposal, which might get boring after a while. Even though there aren't that many levels total, the game encourages you to replay them as there are secrets, alternative exits and collectibles in each one of them, which proved to be way more entertaining than the main adventure itself.\nRating: 6\n\nGameplay\nEpic looks like it will give you quite an adventure with endless possibilities that end only with your imagination, which is something that's far from the truth, and even though the concept is unique and fun at first, the possibilities end once you realize that you can only draw one thing using a specific pencil, as there is a blue one for clouds, a yellow one for keys, a red one for fire and a brown one for axes, and that's pretty much everything that you can draw. Using only those elements, Epic creates a unique adventure, but one that falls short as there is a limit to what you can do using those things alone, and even though you will be surprised every once in a while when something like a key can be used to power up robots and change their movement direction in order to solve more challenging puzzles, you can only imagine how much more it could've been done with a larger inventory of items to draw. However, more important than anything else, Epic works great as you don't have to be Leonardo da Vinci in order to draw, as the game recognizes any drawing as the correct item since it is mapped to specific pencil, but at the same time that allows you to draw a simple line for everything, something that you will probably do since it is less time consuming, but not as authentic as it looked in the first place.\nRating: 6.5\n\nGraphics\nDraw a Stickman: Epic has the right feel to it, as everything feels where it belongs next to something that you can draw on your own, and even though the colors used are monotone and the backgrounds look the same from one level to another, they feel like something anyone with spare time can draw on a piece of paper. A little more variety would've been welcome when it comes to the objects and backgrounds encountered in your adventure, but for what Epic is, it definitely has the right design to fit its gameplay.\nRating: 7\n\nAudio\nThe background tunes are not the greatest you'll hear, and even though they do become repetitive after a while, they are catchy and in mood with the action and the theme of that certain level. The overall quality and design of the audio elements matches the drawn animation theme, and even though there was place for improvement when it comes to effects, they do stay in line with the theme as well.\nRating: 6.5\n\nExtras\nIt takes around three hours to finish Epic with all its levels and secrets, add another three if you're willing to find every puzzle piece, color buddy and alternative exit in order to unlock all the achievements and rewards, but afterwards there isn't much to return to.\nRating: 8\n\nVerdict\nDraw a Stickman: Epic is definitely a game worth trying, even without its limited gameplay concept and short adventure as it really is something different, but unfortunately that concept never reaches its full potential, making the game feel repetitive after a while.\nRating Overall: 6.8\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Draw a Stickman: Epic at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=353","June 30, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/248650/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Ooh. Tough one. This game's biggest issue is lack of content. The only reason I have any substantial playtime is because I'm a completion freak, but otherwise... there's not much there. 13 levels, all of them can be cleared pretty quickly and none of the puzzles are terriby mind-boggling. There are only 4 different pencil types too, pencils being the main puzzle-solvers in the game, and their uses are fairly limited, so it becomes repetitive pretty quickly. Worst of all is that you don't really need to draw anything at all. The main character can be squiggles. Fire is squiggles. A /key/ is squiggles. It doesn't matter in the slightest, though with how imprecise the drawing element is anyways maybe that's for the better. Oh by the way if you die in a level (and you die quick) have fun redoing the entire thing! With how tedious some of the levels are, dying for dumb reasons (the majority of all deaths) take it from boring to frustrating. And it's not even a hard game...\nThe graphics look alright, the music is okay though there aren't too many tracks and it's not much above MIDI quality most of the time. The game isn't terribly interesting though and certainly doesn't warrant EPIC in the title.","January 13, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seems I have run into a lot of games recently that just lack depth of any kind and end up being really boring because of it. You dont have to actually draw anything here (Other than lines). You dont have to draw something that looks like fire for it to work, a cloud can just be a line or even a dot, a axe can be a line, a key can be a line, Its easier to just make everything a damn line. Why not just call the game draw a line?\n\nThe animations for your stickman are just jarring. I found it hard to move around because of this. I would have much preferd a selection of pre rendered stickmen if the animation would be improved.\n\nWas this a mobile game before coming to steam? It seems like it would work alright there.

Example you  can only draw a key on a certain level. I really want to like this game but it does everything it can to make me mad at it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enegra/recommended/248650/","Enegra","Cactus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enegra/","58 products in account","A few days ago I picked up Draw a Stickman:EPIC on Steam sales. How did it turn out? Definitely it is a cute game. The locations look like they were drawn on recycled paper, which adds to the charm. The monsters and objects in the game are drawn very cute – the dragons almost seem huggable – but trust me, they’re not, same as the bees. Only the bunnies are innocent, but the for some devilish people it’s possible to hack them away with an ax or incinerate them. Many ways to kill a poor bunny!\n\nThe drawing system in the game are somewhat hectic. I didn’t like it when I was drawing my stickman, the mouse cursor was pointing at one pixel and the dot was being created elsewhere… Quite hard to draw a decent-looking stickman this way, and I think even using my drawing tablet would not improve the precision as it was the pen tool itself having problems. Other complaint is that it could have been less square-ish when drawing the stickmen, some people actually wanted to make them nice, hey! In game I didn’t notice the wonkiness so much, but it also mattered far less. You don’t even have to draw a proper cloud with all the half-circles on the edge, it can be a plain oval and still will be a rain cloud. Fire could be a few strokes of pencil instead of a flame and still would work out as one.\n\nOther complaint would be the walking. When I would point the way with my mouse, mr Stickman would often end up getting stuck in something in the way, even if originally the path was clear. Towards the end of the game I found out (accidentally by laying an elbow on the keyboard) that he can be moved with WASD/the arrow keys. That one actually seems to works much nicer, as long as you can predict how mr Stickman would move – so I guess having the legs drawn properly is essential.\nThe adventures themselves… in the intro you draw your friend and I would advise that you draw him or her properly, unless you want to spend the entire rest of your journey in the search of a gooeyling or something alike. The first few maps are very relaxing and fun. Then suddenly… This map can kill me? Ouch. Dragons like stickman lunch? Not flame retardant? Bees in my face? Ouch ouch ouch. Such a sudden transition from easy to hard is not too good, the devs should have made the difficulty climb rather than it becoming a huge jump. There is also that element of tedium when you end up being eaten right at the end of a map and have to do it all over again from the beginning. One would like to see some sort of checkpoints there instead of it being just on the beginning of the level. The puzzles themselves are mostly entertaining. Some solutions actually make you smile. Some others may make you want to pull your hair out. Controlling robots is tricky for example. Sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem, which I found nice. The game has lots of hidden content as well – sometimes hidden too well, that you either find it by accident or some ingenious enlightenment.\nOne thing that I discovered when I decided to listen to the game sound. Somehow I only liked the Stickopolis theme, rest sounded a bit annoying to me. Also the clicking sound of the pencils is not something that I consider nice, but that can be turned off, so not considering it as a major flaw.\n\nI would recommend picking this game up while it is on the sale, for the price it’s listed it’s worth. It’s a light game for killing the time, for people with some gaming experience it’s quite relaxing. For casuals it might come hard at some points, but if they don’t give up too easily, they could enjoy it as well.\n\nPros: cute art, riddles, hidden content, fun story\nCons: wonky drawing controls, movement issues, lack of balanced difficulty raising\n","December 29, 2013","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would have to be innebriated of course.\n\nAnyways-To the review-The point of this game is to draw a hero (whom you control), then a lover. The lover then somehow gets seperated from the hero and you must reunite with them, solving simple puzzles by drawing pictures along the way. For instance, a tree blocks your path, you can then draw an axe and proceed by cutting it down (Burning it is also an option). Its cute. Mainly the type of game that is  preferred to be played while in solitary confinement in a top security prison, with a life sentence, as with most games of this nature.

It's a HUGE waste of money unless you are 8. This game should be on the app store, not on steam. Basically you draw your character and you draw someone you have to save. You save said person by using your magic pencils to draw things to help you along the way. Sounds like a scribblenaughts clone right? Not exactly, this game doesn't even come close to being as good as scribblenaughts and you will get bored fast. Theres a set amount of things you can draw, I only ever got to draw clouds, fire, and keys before I got bored out of my mind. And no matter what you draw, the game still counts it as what the pencil says it is. Also the gameplay is literally just drawing fire on top of things and making a key whenever you need one.

It would be cute for a web browser game, but the gameplay here is not worthy of being on Steam in my eyes.  The drawing mechanics aren't even polished.  Granted, I find it hilariously fun to draw crayon ♥♥♥♥♥ heroes and make them waddle around in this game world.\n\nThere aren't many pros to this game, but the ability to create crayon character drawings which waddle around is kind of a novelty.  By novelty, I mean it gets old fast.  It's hard to draw anything accurately in this game, because it doesn't let the crayon stroke go where you click.  The crayon stroke is randomized as you move the mouse cursor.  I don't appreciate this randomized stroke feature!\n\nAlso, the cons include frustrating collision, which causes you to die from explosions when you're far away from them and also makes your character get stuck around corners sometimes, and a poorly implemented menu/GUI design that can be a little unintuitive at times.  Granted, the game isn't difficult, but there at times when you kill yourself because you are unable to draw far enough away from a piece of dynamite to stay clear of its explosion.  This could be remedied with some kind of zoom-in-and-out or pan camera functionality.","April 21, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't play the game that long because so many stucks to get you on, no hints no such. I can say this is poor copy of Scribblenauts, where you write a word and got things, they're much better and more creative.

That sounds cheap of me but honestly I do not believe there is 5 dollars worth of content in this game.\n\nAt 75% off sale you might get some entertainment from Draw a Stickman: EPIC with 20 minutes of screwing around, but on the whole it's a fails to perform.","June 21, 2014","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game does nothing interesting with it all. It doesn't matter what you draw. It ends up being a simple action game with questionable hit detection.\n\nThe actual gameplay here is lacking. You can easily be killed by clipping through dangerous areas or enemies. But it's never clear how close you can get. Although the artwork is 3D, it has you bouncing through 3D levels.\n\nAnd, yeah, you bounce. Actually having your custom stickman somehow come to life with real animations would be a pretty amazing feat that this game doesn't come close to handling.","May 31, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a HUGE waste of money unless you are 8. This game should be on the app store, not on steam. Basically you draw your character and you draw someone you have to save. You save said person by using your magic pencils to draw things to help you along the way. Sounds like a scribblenaughts clone right? Not exactly, this game doesn't even come close to being as good as scribblenaughts and you will get bored fast. Theres a set amount of things you can draw, I only ever got to draw clouds, fire, and keys before I got bored out of my mind. And no matter what you draw, the game still counts it as what the pencil says it is. Also the gameplay is literally just drawing fire on top of things and making a key whenever you need one.
