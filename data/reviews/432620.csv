Although I just bought it on Steam, I've spent TONS of hours playing this game. (I was fortunate to play it at tons of parties and events over the past couple years as it was developed.)\n\nThis game is super fun. Usually results in lots of yelling, throwing of controllers, etc., which is always a good sign. (It's one of my son's favorite local multiplayer games.) It's really well balanced and pretty easy for new players to pick up. It has that secret sauce of "easy to learn, difficult to master".\n\nInfiltration is easily my favorite game mode. CTF is probably one my favorite game styles is this is a really novel twist on that type of gameplay. Same kind of strategy, planning, intensity, and so forth. That feeling when you snatch victory from the enemy at the last second... oh man, love it. :D\n\nAnd the art! Feels like something straight out of the Tron games grid, but with an alien twist that I love. And the music is perfectly matched to the gameplay. Keeps the intensity high.\n\n10/10 - definitely recommend, super fun, easy to learn, perfect for parties and with friends","May 18","true","1.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I played this at PAX last year in an  indie game arcade machine and people were lining up to play it even though it wasn't a part of the show floor. (Came back multiple times to play more too!) Got it in a Groupees Greenlight Bundle and I'm glad to see that it's finally launched! Can't wait to get some friends together and play the hell out of it! :D","May 18","true","0.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Weird enough to be labelled with Nidhogg and Samurai Gunn, we'll definitely pull it out again. Great concept!\n\n...Also, give us more maps. My only major con.","May 18","true","8.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
