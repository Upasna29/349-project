In short, I didn't have to pay twice for the same game I was promised.\n\nThe other important thing to rember is that this is a game that's closer to Heroes of Might and Magic, and shouldn't be compared to more complicated 4x games. It's about the fighting, not the statecraft.\n\nPlease see comments for community driven clarifications, there're awesome people on here who want to help make this review even better.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREVIEW:\n\nPlanar Conquest is a re-imagining of the classic 4x, Master of Magic.\n\nFeatures:\n- D20 strategy game. What this means, is that every time you cast a spell, a virtual die is cast, and the result is determined by the stats of everything involved. So, casting a fireball on a fire elemental won't mean it will never damage it, but it does mean that it'll be pretty hard to hit it. Consequently, casting the same fireball on a human unit will probably have a much higher chance of sucess.\n\n- 7 different map types which represent different elemntal planes. You can choose to have all 7 present during a game, and travel freely between them.\n\n- 8 different races, ranging from the standard high fantasy humans and orcs, to less traditional dragons and hive mind insects. All have different units, and play differently due to racial traits like slow population growth or bonus production in cities.\n\n- Chose from over 12 or 15 pre-made sorceror lords (basically another layer of customization for your empire) OR create your own,\n\n\n\nPROs:\n-GREAT tooltips. Everything has a stat and everything's explained. Never wondered what a spell does.\n\n- Immense spell, unit, and map diversity. There are dozens, if not close to a hundred some spells, and your sorceror lord dictates whether you'll play a summoner, calling up zombies and elemntals during battles, or if you'll fling fireballs and bolts of necromatic energy. Maybe you'll have a small army of units with 15 blessings each, making them hit harder and faster than your opponents.\n\n- More polished UI: this one's sort of hard to defend, because the game is a re-release, and while I prefer the old UI personally, the new one is much cleaner.\n\n- Stayed true to MoM: probaly not a plus for most who haven't played the original, but the sorceror lords and units are a faithful recreation of the original.\n\n\n\nCONs:\n- unfortunately, due to the size of the team and massive scope of the project, the battle animations are not on par with the rest of the game's visual polish\n\n- while I haven't played enough, there was a legitimate problem with the game devolving into a city spam. This is endemic to the MoM system (the original DOS game), but I'm surprised that the developers chose to use such an archaic formula. Cities are carbon copies of each other and usually serve only as military production sites. This isn't civ by any chance, no tiles, but then again, this isn't a Civ game. Apples and Oranges.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR: this is a faithful recreation of the first fantasy 4x that was a commercial sucess, to the best of my knowledge. Despite the game being rough around the edges at times, the sheer level of content, literally almost more than 100 spells, 8+ different units per 8 different races, and a generally staggering amount of army customizations makes this game hard to dislike, as long as you don't expect a deep economic simulator.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8/10 for letting me play D&D general.","May 30","true","19.0"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","58","69","0","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhorthex/recommended/449300/","vhorthex","Medieval Nerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhorthex/","354 products in account","What is Planar Conquest?\nAfter such a long journey, I think it's good to try and remind ourselves of a few things.\n\nFirstly, Planar Conquest is visual & interface overhaul of World of Magic. It is not a sequel to WOM. It's basically Worlds of Magic 2.0, reskinned and the interface done over.\n\nSecondly, Planar Conquest is a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic.\n\nCan this game be considered a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic?\nYes.\n\nWith a new take on the spell book library, the game hits all the markers of Master Of Magic, and takes it a little further without attempting to re-invent the wheel. Something I feel is at the root of the failures of past attempts.\n\nSpells\n\nThe new School / Specialization spell classification is quite interesting. I really like how they all intertwine, and focus on different aspects or playstyles. I was a huge fan of Life magic in MOM, using Stream of Life to crank up some insane income to dominate my opponents. I found that Mentalism was actually a better fit to my playstyle than Life was.\n\nIt's perhaps daunting for newcomers as the sheer amount of spells, and tiers, may make it seem like it takes a while to get a grasp of which school or specialization is the good fit for you. I would suggest you hop on the official forums, and I took the time to write down all the spells within and excel sheet. Where you can easily compare each school/specialization and get an idea of what combo might be good for you!\n\nThere were a total of 392 Spells based on the latest version of WOM. Each 'school/specialization' has about 62 spells.\n\nBuildings\n\nPerhaps nostalgia played a big role in this, but I was absolutely overjoyed to see that the very building tree was kept nearly intact from MOM. People who are familiar with the building progression of MOM will be right at home.\n\nRaces\n\nI've been infatuated with Dark Elves for as long as I remember playing MOM. So having them present was quite a treat for me. I was intrigued by the slight slavery twist they gave it, with lowly servants being your base unit. I rather liked that angle they gave them.\n\nOther race I played were the Undead, and this is probably the race that has the most unique playstyle. Forgoing both food & money, for 'essence'. I haven't given them a whirl in a bit, I'll definitely have to put some time aside for a playthrough with them.\n\nIn the end we don't have as many races as we did in MOM, but I think they spent a bit more time trying to create some nuance between the buildings and units. Whereas MOM each race had the same buildings, with the caveat that some races couldn't build all of them.\n\nIs this game for you?\nIf you've been waiting for something to scratch an itch similar to MOM, than there is a great chance this game is for you.\n\nIf you are looking for something that defies the genre, and forges a new take on Turn Based Strategy, than you might be disapointed. And buyer beware, this was never intended to be anything of the sort. It's meant to give us a 'modernized' MOM, and on those points it's delivered the features and mechanics.\n\nSure the game isnt' a feast for the eyes, if you've got issues playing with games that aren't top of the line modeling, animations and sound. You might want to check out some Let's plays first and see if this is your cup of tea. The gameplay is there, it's more of a question to make sure it's what you are looking for.\n\nIn the end, I really feel like this is as close to a spiritual successor to Master Of Magic as we will ever get. And I'm glad a company was able to finally make it happen.","June 1","true","2.9"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","1"

It uses the same overall formula that made MoM so great, and updates things based on lessons learned in the decades since.  If you've been waiting to see if Wastelands could patch up the buggy Worlds of Magic and make a great game, this is it.  Buy this game.\n\nLong version:  Most of the gameplay mechanics are either identical or nearly identical to WoM, so if you played that game, consider this a patched up and generally improved version.  The game uses the d20 system, so if you're familiar with that from any of its many appearances in games like KOTOR or the later AD&D CRPGs, then you know exactly how it's all going to work.\n\nPlanar Conquest has all the races you'd expect from a MoM-style game; elves and orcs and dwarves and humans and dragons and undead.  The units are almost identical to the Worlds of Magic roster, which is great, because WoM got a lot right, including the variety and style of monsters.  A few things have been tweaked, but generally speaking, the game feels like an homage to Master of Magic, and you generally get what you'd expect.  Orcs are brute force powerhouses, from their glass cannon basic units up to their durable and deadly Manslayers.  Elves are quick, and the Grey Elves still have the most powerful basic unit in the game, so if you're new to the genre and want to try an easier start, play Grey Elves, place cities on food-generating tiles, and crank out legions of Archers.  Dwarves are tough and productive; Draconians mobile and, though harder to get going than some other races, vastly powerful with their top-tier units.\n\nThe art style has been changed to be a little more colorful, a little more cartoony.  I don't mean that in a bad way - Heroes of Might and Magic 3, one of my favorite games of all time, has a cartoony art style.  Done right (as HoMM3 surely did, and as PC does, also), there's nothing wrong with this art style.  Treasure chests, which dot the map, contain mana, gold, or experience; this also adds a slight HoMM feel to the game.\n\nThe AI is improved, and now poses a bit of a challenge on the highest difficulty levels.  It can also navigate the planes better than it was doing in Worlds of Magic, so you really need to stay alert.\n\nSpeaking of the planes, I love the variety.  Not just the visual difference (though it's great) and not just the functional difference (which is also substantial, from the food-rich Paradise plane to the nearly barren but abundantly gold-generating Earth, or charred Power-soaked fields of Fire), but the fact that there is just so much to explore.  It was great fun in MoM to hop between the Prime and Myrror - that freedom is magnified fourfold with the variety of planes in Planar Conquest.  You can turtle up, block entry at the gateways, and sit in your home plane while you research a win, or you can spread out across the worlds, fighting and befriending other Sorcerer Lords until you win.\n\nDiplomacy is still a little weak.  The AI still occasionally does things, even on the hardest difficulty, that just aren't good ideas.  I'm not saying this is a perfect game in all respects.  But I'm not finding any bugs, and this is a modern version of Master of Magic that belongs up there with that old classic.  If you loved Master of Magic, or Fallen Enchantress, or Warlock, or Endless Legend, or Worlds of Magic, buy this game.  It's so very worth your time and money.","May 30","true","2.8"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","1"

It does have that only one more turn feel so far. AI seems pretty good so far also.

I played the original Masters of Magic (and remember waiting for Microprose to send me a patch disk in the mail so it would work). This is no Masters of Magic.\n\nThe original WoM has an attrocious Metacritic score and a Steam review score under 50%. Sadly, PQ is destined to share the same fate.\n\n------\n\nLong version: I've held off commenting prior to now because I hoped PQ would get better prior to release after playing it in beta. I'm sad to say that it hasn't. PQ may very well be - with the exception of Stardock's original Elemental that didn't work at all - the worst 4x game I've played in the last 25 years. I'm not trying to be mean or subscribe to hyperbole. It's an informed, measured opinion and I simply can't think of a more uninspiring, clunky 4x game than this.\n\nSomeone commented that if Mircroprose made a sequel to MoM in the 90s it would look like PQ. They're right. The graphics are - and I'm not kidding - something I would have been disappointed in around the time of Civ 3. Here's a sample screenshot with every setting on max:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007300752/screenshot/447359296984739818\n\nI don't find them appealing AT ALL and I actually quite liked the visual style of Worlds of Magic. Actually, I really liked the visual style of WoM beyond the fact you couldn't zoom out. Now you can zoom out but it looks like a bad tablet game and it looks even worse in motion. The ground textures are muddled and bland. The units look blocky, generic and unintersting. The whole art style has taken a massive step back. The UI is quite ugly, click-heavy and obtrusive without actually being helpful. At least they added right and left clicks ot the UI finally.\n\nSounds and music are fine. Generic but acceptable.\n\nThe biggest issue is simply the gameplay.  I asked Les - whom I have a lot of respect for - a simple question during beta. Why should I play this over AOW3? I really didn't get much of an answer then and I haven't found one since. The gameplay is exceptionally generic and bland. The prime limiting factor continues to be gold as it was in WoM. If you have enough gold all is fine. If you don't, you lose. That makes things like city placement exceptionally boring - find the most gold or otherwise you can't support your city to build the advanced units. City spam has been reduced somewhat from WoM with the 10 city soft cap but it's still the prime way to advance. The buildings are generic. With all of these factors I don't feel like I'm building an empire worth building.\n\nI have yet to find any unusual, interesting spells to cast here. We've seen all of these before. Stoneskin. Fertile Soil. Bless. Repeat ad naseum. I don't really feel that I'm advancing in power. I feel like I'm researching the same spells I've researched countless times from many games. And when you cast a spell, well...in a magic game I should get a rush out of casting spells. Except the spell animations are probably the dullest I've ever seen. There's simply no way to adequate describe how bland they are. A little puff of red powder is supposed to convey a fire spell. Casting Fertile Soil results in....nothing. This is a cardinal sin of any magic game.\n\nThe tactical combat is miles less fun or interesting that AOW3 - it's still line up on an empty field and have at it. The AI still seems to dumb in both the strategic and tactical apsect o fthe game. Diplomacy still seems to be exceptionally limited. Thus far I have not encountered even one unique gameplay aspect that's been brought to the table. There's nothing here that's been done in a new or interesting way.\n\nI simply can't find a reason to load up or play the game. Every single aspect of the game has been done, and done better, somewhere else. It has all the failings of WoM - a game with an attrocious Metacritic score and a sub-50% Steam score - all over again with (IMO) even worse graphics and a less friendly/attractive UI. There are no systems that have been substantially improved IMO and some things like the UI and spell animations that reflect the mobile port.\n\nComparing it to AOW3 is like comparing your local pizzaria's hand-crafted pie to the cardboard discount pizza you'd get in the frozen section of your supermarket.","May 30","false","3.2"," 94 of 154 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","94","154","10","17"

Worlds of Magic was not an amazing game. It wasn't exactly buggy, but it was blatantly half finished. Menus didn't work, scrollbars didn't exist, the entire thing chugged along like a fat man trying to roll up a hill.\n\nNow we have Planar Conquest, made by the same people who decided to come back for another go. Frankly, the difference between the two games is actually quite scary. The first thing I noticed in Planar Conquest is the fact it goes like a stabbed rat. (For those of you who don't speak South End that means it is very, VERY fast.) My PC isn't exactly modern. Or fast. Or working.  It was forged by Ur-Dwarves from slabs of hand mined Obsidian in the before times. On a good day I can claim that 'it isn't completely on fire'. Planar Conquest however, everythings fast. Starts up, loads saves, processes turns, everything. Compared to Worlds of Magic which ran so slowly windows spent a lot of time convinced it had stopped responding, the difference is incredible. I'm genuinely including some sort of fell sorcery in the list of possible ways they could have gotten it working so well. Quite possibly the machine they used to compile the code for this game is powered by the still beating heart of a forsaken child or something, it's genuinely amazing.\n\nWhat does it look like? well, better than its predecessor. Graphics are clearer and easier to make out, it's much simpler to tell what is on the map now, and it also allows you to double click on visible features to see what is inside them and what rewards are possible. Actually, we'll just move onto the game menu's because yeah, everything I just said goes for them to. Clear, responsive, easy to use and navigate, it's all nicer. There's more stuff in the city screen, but that's because they sorted everything into its own section which works better. I also haven't seen anything with missing or broken descriptions yet, something that Worlds of Magic had a great deal of. I'm not going to check because I don't want to spend eight months loading the damn thing, but you could frequently expect to see fleets of UNIT_BOAT_GAL_01 or something floating by. Not so here. Everything has its own name and suchlike.\n\nWhat happens when you actually play though? well, the neutral AI seems much more agressive now - I've had to fight off several armies attacking my city, so no leaving it undefended for hundreds of turns like in a certain other game. I'm not far enough in to have met another Sorceror Lord yet, so I can't say what that'll be like unfortunately. I'll update when I do.\n\nAre there bugs? Well, the first time I fired the game up a pair of hero units and a cannon I hired vanished into the aether, but that hasn't happened again so fingers crossed that was one of those one in a million bugs and not a 'don't play till it gets fixed one' I haven't run into anything else yet. Oh, and the game has no problems if you tab out to do something else for a bit, like check the interwebnets. Or write a Steam Review.\n\nWould I reccomend this game? I'm going to cautiously say yes, and then go play some more. Hopefully the only change I get to make later is to remove the word 'cautiously'.","May 31","true","6.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mhaeric/recommended/449300/","Mhaeric","mhaeric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mhaeric/","156 products in account","I have easily put at least 1000 hours into Master of Magic over the years since I first opened the huge purple box with an eye on it almost 20 years ago. Likely far more. The Prima strategy guide was my bible. Since then, I've been looking for a game that is worthy of being called a sequel or successor to that game, but have had no luck.\n\nUntil now.\n\nA single player turn-based 4x strategy game, most similar in style to the Age of Wonders series, it focuses on empire building by building cities through expansion and conquering. You take on the persona of a Sorcerer Lord vying for complete control over all the planes of existence. There is a detailed character creation process which lets you decide your Sorceror Lord's abilities and spell knowledge, and this has a huge impact on your game's playstyle. Unlike most empire games, your persona takes a very active role in shaping your empire, making the spells you know a very large part of the focus of the game. There are two possible win conditions: defeat your foes by completely destroying their cities, or cast the ultimate magic spell granting you dominion over everything.\n\nThings I loved from Master of Magic that are still here:\n- A huge variety of spells with a lot of customization for your wizard. This makes every game you create play very differently.\n- The feel of the game is the same. I realize this is subjective, but it really does feel like I'm playing a game in the same series made by the same developers. The pacing feels the same. The variety of customization options, while greatly expanded, feel like they're a natural extension of the original options. The controls are very familiar. Other games I've played that have tried to modernize Master of Magic have failed at this.\n- Combat is just as strategic and varied. I can't tell you how many hours I spent poring over the strategy guide figuring out to-hit and damage numbers.\n- The surveyor tool. This thing is just amazing.\n- Tool tips. For everything. This was a HUGE deal 20 years ago when this game first came out, and still is to this day.\n\nThings they've added that improve the game:\n- Customization. They added the concept of grouping spells by effect in addition to element, so now if you want to create a Destruction wizard or a Summoning wizard then you can. You can also mix and match elements with effects, so if you really like buffing your units with spells, but also want to be able burn your foes to a crisp then you can put spellbooks into both Augmentation and Fire to get lots of both types of spells, especially fire based augmentation spells. The level of customization this opens up is huge.\n- Additional planes of existence. Gone are the simple days of Arcana and Myrror. Now, every game can have from 1 to 7 planes of existence. Anything from the prime plane much like our own, to elemental planes of fire or air, to paradise or corruption. Each plane can be separately customized with the type of land mass and it's overall size making the size of your world potentially massive in scale. If you want a short quick game then choose a single plane with a smallish land mass. Want an epic, seemingly endless, plane-spanning battle? Then choose all 7 planes with large landmasses and settle in for the long haul.\n- UI elements. Most of the UI elements are pretty similar to the original game, which for some means that they'll likely feel a bit dated. There are, however, some more modern elements that have been added which players of the original game will really notice. Most notable of these are the spell storage and favourites features, the auto-explore setting for armies, and the city build queue.\n\nThings I miss from the original game:\n- A visual representation of your city in the city window. It was really cool how you could see all the buildings you created show up in your cityscape as you built them. It certainly made cities feel more dynamic as opposed to a list of numbers and stats.\n- Spell animations. There are spell animations in Planar Conquest, and the battle ones so far are pretty good. The overland ones, however, are not that great. For example, most of the city spells that I cast while out of combat end up having their visual effect hidden beneath the surrounding objects and terrain. The only one I've seen that is visually very apparent is the Strands of Power enchantment.\n- All of the information windows we used to be able to call up. Primarily the historian and astrologer windows which showed the relative strengths between you and your opponents. Also, I can't find a way to view your enemy wizard's stats yet like you used to be able to do in the diplomacy window.\n\nAll in all, from the perspective of someone who is a huge Master of Magic fan, this game hits all the right buttons. I definitely recommend it.","June 4","true","10.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

Very much like the original Master of Magic released so long ago.  It varies from some other games like this in the market in that the magic system is very expansive and strategic / tactical.  Knowing what spell to cast when and where is so important.\n\nThe different armies and abilities means you can play the game in so many different ways.  City development is fairly linear, but it is quite deep and gives you good room for specialisation or generalisation as you desire.\n\nThe AI is strong!  In fact, I don't think I could play against archmage and win (well perhaps I might be able to, but generally the highest setting is very difficult).  There are some ways the AI could improve, however I would imagine the AI programming at the moment is an extremely complex entity.  Tactical battles finds me trying to protect my weaker casters, and I never completely blitz an enemy.\n\nHeroes are Strong, and perhaps too strong at end game due to equipment and the abilities they give them.  But they are a fun unit in the game, that adds to the RPG feel of the game.\n\nGraphics is ok... It is pleasing to the eye.  I would not say it is cutting edge lol.  But I don't play this game for the graphics.  In saying that, I do enjoy the graphics, but I am not falling over in my reviews based upon the graphics.\n\nOverall, this is an addictive, complex and deep spell casting, city and army building fantasy strategy game, that leaves me wanting more!\n\nIf I was to score it myself I would give it 8.5/10!","May 30","true","140.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","2"

It plays almost identical to Master of Magic. Everything is there, the races, the planes, the tactical combat, the item creation, the way that mana and spellpower works. They even have a premade wizard named R'jak because of course they do. If you never played Master of Magic, it's the granddaddy of fantasy 4x strategy games. Like Civ before it, it pretty much invented it's own genre and games like Fallen Enchantress and Worlds of Magic have been trying to ape it ever since but never quite getting there. After I play it a few more hours I will update this with a more in depth review. So far my recommendation is if you are looking for modern Master of Magic this may just be as close as you are going to get. If you have no idea what in the world I have been babbling about for this entire lengthy paragraph then you should give it a go if you enjoyed games like fallen enchantress (Or if you didn't because, as I said earlier, it never quite got there).","May 30","true","1.3"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","26","37","0","2"

I thought I got the concept, that I understood the rules and that I was way better than the AI.\nSo I tried again, this time with more focus on preparation, deeper causal understanding, better and smarter kingdom managment. Ok, AI keeps cheating...but is there a way to cope with low income and still deliver fatal blows?\nCan I find a way of success by keeping true to my personal choice ? (choosing only life magic, or only death magic or only fire magic) ...\n\nFirst after the complete a utter defeat of all enemies I started to really enjoy this game. AI was still unforgiving and dungeons were still full of dragons, so hard to take down. But I already knew what spells to research and how to use them to be more effective than cheating AI and unforgiving environment.

This game totally took me by surprise. So much fun!! It sucked me in and I found myself in that "just one more turn" mode, just like many of the Civilization games, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Age of Wonders have done in the past for me. There is an awful lot to keep you playing; here's a brief summary:\n\n- treasure chests with loot dotting the landscape encourage exploration\n- the different planes\n- the numerous challenges / adventure locations with rewards\n- the difficulty : for me, just right. Ex: wandering enemies have mixed stacks of units and use the spells / skills at their disposal. Your cities are defendable through careful planning, but the wandering monsters remain a challenge throughout the game\n- heroes and unlockable perks\n- combat is fun and addictive / reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic III with a wide variety of spells and tactical options to explore and discover\n- researching new spells; weighing the cost vs. reward, immediate vs. long-term benefits\n-so much potential as well for development and expansions\n\nI heartily recommend it.\n","June 2","true","17.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The graphics are nice, the music is nice as well.  The game runs smoothly, and I haven't experienced any gameplay bugs so far.   The gameplay, UI, mechanics etc.. all take a bit of time to get used to, but I was able to get into it and didn't find it too difficult - though I have only played with a premade Lord, and on one of the lower difficulties.\n\nIt seems like this game is a marathon, not a short walk in the park with very extensive and detailed custom options, and multiple plains to play around with. If you're a fan of 4x games with D&D flavour and mechanics, and you're prepared to give this game the time to shine, then I recommend you give it a go.\n\nWhat this game currently lacks IMHO are more detailed  diplomacy interactions - interaction with other lords is almost non-existant in the few hours I've had with the game.  Maybe a bit of civilization style interaction wouldn't go astray.  It also lacks flavour and lore text and context.  Still it is a charming game none the less.","June 1","true","11.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I like Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes or AOW3  much better but this game has a lot of potential. This is the first time I have given a thumbs up to a mobile port, yes it was a computer game first but then ported to mobile and now ported back.\n\nPROS - Many different spells, items, styles of play. If you like this genre then you should think this is at least decent. The different races play very differently. I find the game to be pretty difficult which is usually nice. It has good replay value since most of the races are so different and there are endless spell/trait combos for your Lord. Heroes are nice and neat to get but the regular high end units are better until you can get your heroes all decked out in good gear. The heroes allso seem to have a wide variety of classes, skills and spells which is nice that they aren\'t just a few cookie cutter guys with different names. AD&D based spells and monsters.\n\nCONS - It needs polish. Many little things like errors in the game manual, example is one trait that says it gives units a +25% exp bonus when in game it says +5%, some graphics need to be reworked, example the summon spirit spell summons a spirit that looks like it\'s a pencil outline with blue color added, The AI seems to cheat, example an AI lord can have many cities, armies etc much faster than possible even if you play the same Lord on the same settings and try it yourself, that shows on even the easiest settings. Lack of options - yes there are a zillion Lord setup options but the game world and oponents there are not so many and even though the devs are actively involved and fixing bugs etc. they consider the game fully complete and I don't think that it is. The planes options when starting a game, you can only pick a maximum of one of each plane, what if you wanted a game with 3 paradise and 3 negative planes to make it life vs. death kind of thing, it's not happening, no settings to make the neutrals more or less aggressive, world events more or less common, can\'t disable spell trading so the AI's can sit there and trade ack and forth with each other to far out do your research. There are many popups which is great but they need more detail and more of them. I click on some funky shrub on the map and it shows a figure and an up arrow, I have no idea what exactly that means and there\'s nothing anywhere explaining it. Do I need to build a town there or just have it in my borders? Borders don\'t expand. There is no campaign of any kind, it\'s a skirmish game only. No options that I can see for your camera, if you have 5 scouts set to auto the camera will zoom all over following each one, maybe I don\'t care what the scoucts are doing and I just want them clearing away the fog, No option for the camera speed, set 5 scouts to explore and you'll have a headache from the camera ripping around to follow them, that's even with fast movement turned off. No option to set unit behaviors, like scout for exp chests or scout for mana/gold and leave the exp chests, can't tell the scouts to auto interact when they find unguarded locations or to even always fight like an agressive mode.\n\nSo that's it. I think it\'s ok and I'll play it some more. I think that it could be a great game though with some more work. Even if they just polish up the little things and then do a DLC to add more options/content then it could be great. It is good enough that I can give it a thumbs up.","June 1","true","59.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I’ve currently played for 10.7 hours.\n\nThe game is set in a fantasy universe in which there are seven different planes of existence. These are: earth, air, fire, water, death (called Shadow), life (called Paradise), and prime (fantasy equivalent to reality). Each plane is different in terms of fertility, terrain, resources, etc. They are represented in the game as maps (yes, you can travel between them). On these maps you build cities, explore new lands, research new spells (of which there are about 300), raise armies, conquer other cities, and so on. When your Sorcerer Lord gains enough Fame he can start recruiting heroes. They come in seven different classes with different sets of skills, spells and abilities.\n\nWho's the Sorcerer Lord you ask? He/she is you, the player. You can either pick a premade one, or you can customize one to your liking (starting spells, spell circle specialization, traits, name and portrait). Your enemies are, as you probably have guessed, other Sorcerer Lords. Defeat them all, and victory is yours. You can also win by researching and casting the “Spell of Domination”. You also get to pick what race you want to rule over: Dwarves, High Men, Grey Elves, Dark Elves, Draconians, Unhallowed (the undead), Orcs and Myrodants (humanoid insects).\n\nSome pieces of the soundtrack are quite beautiful and the art style is colourful (i.e. cartoon-like). The gameplay I find to be very addictive.  Needless to say I definitely recommend this game!","June 1","true","12.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

No quests or linear paths in this one like many of the others in this genre.  I personally like the graphics, animations in battle are ok (and fairly quick which is nice after a while).  The interface is fairly unobtrusive but there is a lot of info hidden at your fingertips (once you get used to how to find it).   Down the road, I'll figure out the hot-keys to move around the menus, but for now, I find the interface fairly usable... a little slow for me now, but I didn't read the manual and I am ok with that.   There is a good deal of help functionality currently (and I understand they are working on more/improving tool tips which will be nice).\n\nTechnically, no crashes for me (W10 machine) and no noticable or major bugs to slow me down.   Game turns seem to move quickly (although I am only playing 2 plane, normal sized maps currently).\n\nThe original goal (and why I purchased this game) of a updated MOM is actually fairly well realized at least early in the game.  AI is putting up a fight, they've made me some offers of spells, want to make war and peace; basic diplomacy is fun.\n\nFor those worried that this is a light "tablet port"; you shouldn't worry, there is nothing "light" about this game... actually the other way around... I will likely grab this on my Android tablet as well as it's rare that you get a complex PC game ported over to a tablet.\n\nI hope to update this after getting through a few complete games, but so far.....GREAT!","May 31","true","6.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Planar Conquest endlessly reminds me of both Master of Magic and Lords of Magic--two games I spent an insane amount of hours playing in ages past. There are some overtones of Populus in the general map designs as well.  City management and unit production remind me greatly of Infinite Interactive's Warlord's series--in particular Warlords III. Planar Conquest is rife with memories of previous titles.\n\nOverall the interface is decent and fairly intuitive (the one prime caveat to this is the need to unselect something before selecting something else--which is to say the left mouse button selects when nothing is active but does actions when something is active. It is very common to miss-move an army when you are trying to select another army). There are a few random gui issues when you surpass your city count as well, but restoring to a previous save seems to correct such.\n\nGraphics are decent and in keeping with the multiplatform nature of the title. Sounds/music are reasonable, though I found too much repetition and thus have turned down the background music.\n\nThe vast number of trading cards--for any steam badge hunters--will be a minor deterent as there are 14 in total.\n\nAchievements are reasonably balanced and geared more to replay value to acquire them rather than raw grinding. Speed of achievement aquisition is sufficient to afford a sense of accomplishment and yet not give away everything in a single playthrough.\n\nOverall, play value is very much in keeping with traditional titles from the 90's and is very much welcome. If Endless Legend is a high definition 3D movie, then Planar Conquest is a crisp and refreshing black and white copy of Cassablanca. It is well put together, touching on all of the things that made several old school titles lasting favourites.","June 3","true","29.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

YOU MUST BE A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF WIZARD TO APPRECIATE THIS GAME IN FULL!  WAIT AWHILE UNTIL THEY FIX IT!  THE UI IS CURRENTLY VERY COUNTER-INTUITIVE!  DO NOT TRY TO BE HARRY POTTER JUST YET!\n====================================================================================\n\nI would give this game high marks in pretty much everything except UI design.  What really grinds my gears is that your mouse doesn\'t function like you\'re used to.  In previous genre names like warcraft 3, your mouse would work like this:\nhttp://classic.battle.net/war3/basics/specialcommands.shtml\nessentially making most selection functions limited to the left click, while interacting functions work with the right click.\n\nI\'m sure many Americans like myself were exposed to the strategy genre through this game and other gateway games like it.  But this is so extremely different, it makes basic interaction with this game a terrible headache.  I don\'t want to have to click a unit a second time to unselect it, I\'m conditioned to just clicking the next unit I want to control![/b][/u]  I want more tooltips and cues like a changing cursor to show me what will happen when I left or right click, or target an enemy in the battle mode.  It just doesn\'t feel smooth enough to make me want to play too long, even though I really want to!\n\nI think the devs hit the nail on the head with everything else, but because I can\'t sit down for long periods of time wrestling with the UI or trying to figure out the nuances without being able to reconfigure anything or even see what my mouse clicks are going to end up doing.  I think the most telling evidence of this lack of foresight is that the input subscreen of the options menu doesn\'t show your mouse, just your keyboard!  They themselves can\'t figure out how a mouse is supposed to handle commands!\n\nBasically this whole game seems to have no bugs or staleness.  It offers a bunch of things to the 4x genre, but wildly deviates in more fields than it needs to.  I\'m too tired to take another whack at it, so i\'m just gonna leave this here for now.","May 31","true","6.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zorbaz/recommended/449300/","Zorbaz","Zorbaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zorbaz/","37 products in account","First off lets get a few things staight about this game. It is a work in progress based on a game that has been pulled from the store and will be rolled into this game. However, there is still hope! If you are a fan of the old Master of Magic or any games of that similar 4X genre, I would say hold on to you hats. the UI on this game looks like something you might find from a game from ten years ago. If you are looking for a fancy looking cutting edge whoopdiedoopie Civ VI this is not for you. Once you crack this dusty old arcan arcanis book off the shelf it brings a truly breathtaking depth to it. The combat can be resolved on a almost battle chess board feeling arena. You will be able to reign superior on this field based on many factors. Will you have hordes of orcs at your command charge straight into the teeth of enemy that darkens the sky with thier arrows? Perhaps you prefer standing behind a stout hammer weilding line of dwarves while you blast the emeny with might cannons and spill the enemy upon the ground before you. You as a mighty magical lord are able to blast your enemies with deavistating magicks, but is the cost worth the victory or dire threat of defeat? Like any self respecting deep core 4x it thrives on the managment of your cities. Will you choose to lead with a iron fist and a love of darkness or will you build up your cities across the relms. With a bit of imagination and a gritty look at the fate of the universe this game can have a small charm cast upon you in a short bit.\n\nWell then! Now that we have had that bit of lore cast about to properly get you in the mood. Let us dig deep and look into the rotten underbelly of this game shall we? This game has many flaws, the UI is a bit dated but that doesnt take away from the charm of the game. The learning curve on this game will be mindblowing to anyone who is not at least basically familier with the 4X genre. For me as a user of the old Civ legends, it was refeshing to head back a bit. However, the magic system is a hum dinger! Spells, counterspells, summoning spells, fireballs, icebolts, darkness across the whole land, the system inplace here in mindblowing! I don't think I have use the word enough; MINDBLOWN. The game is still full of some what whimsical to downright gamebreaking bugs and errors. This is to be expected with any product. As I am writing this we are finishing up the final days of the early release. The devs here are on a good track record of finding and killing most bugs as they are pinned down and exterminated.\n\nFinally, for me this is a HUGE step forward on the iOS side of things. I intially found Planar Conquest on iOS about a month ago. After picking up the game on my iPad i was stoked to finally get a respectable deeply magical and heavily strategic game. Much to my enjoyment I was able to become part of the process for testing this game on PC.\n\nSo in review I would give this a solid 3 of 5. There are a few things I would like to see that I hope are on the devs road map. Multiplayer, this would be great this alone would if well exicuted would raise my rating another +1! Also, if they fixed all of the bugs it would also adjust my rating +1. Crossplatform connection for my saves and maybe in the future battles against other players.","May 31","true","1.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Thats great! Planar Conquest is now a good member of the family of 4X games for me and it is clearly a much better product than Worlds of Magic. Good Work, Wasteland Interactive!\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\nEverything in this game is pretty standard (through planes, very big maps possible and 300+ spells are above normal), a typical 4X game, except the AI. And this, i think, is the most important part for a 4X game.\nThe AI cheats like hell, pays no upkeep, can spawn what it wants when it wants, has unlimited ressources and items and can generally do what it wants (teleporting around included). I have no problem when the AI cheats a bit, but here it is completely out of control.\nYou want to be killed at Turn 15, surrounded by dozens units? Then this game is for you.\nYou want to be attacked per surprise without declared war? Then this game is for you. Maybe the enemy declares war the next turn to you, after it killed all your engineers previous turn.\nYou want loot without fighting? Then this game is for you because the enemies send you gifts. Most of the time they just declare war on sight, but sometimes they do not, and then they start to trade with you. And such a "trade" looks like: you give him one level 1 spell (one of your starting spells), and he gives you: 300 mana, 300 gold, 3 level 3 spells and a few superior items. After such a trade my level 10 hero was able to conquer cities with 15 flying defenders. Alone.  Now you are sad because your other heroes look so poor compared to your killerhero? No problem, the AI sends you even better things in the next few turns. And then, suddenly it kills your engineers and declares war next turn. Yeah, the balancing is weird.\nThat said it is still fun to play, i like that random elements, i like the gameplay, the great variety of spells (even if you never need them), the strategical and tactical part, but the AI-Behaviour is horrible. It is a tough decision for me, but i cant recommend it, its good for ioS but not enough for PC.","June 3","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","10"

Since the hot-fix patch, turn loading time have been reduced (on my machine by over 70-80%) making the game not only more playable but now enjoyable as well. Load times for loading a save game and starting the game are still quite high but acceptable.\n\nI still believe more information in the UI is needed for spells and summoning so that it is less trial and error via save, test, reload, test, reload, ah ha but some people like this kind of learning curve so I won't penalise the game for it.\n\nNotable pros:\nCrafting using mana and gold.\nOverpowering heroes makes sending time on them worth it\nLots of possible strategies in combat to get your units through a tough battle - I tend to rely I spamming Slimes to soak up damage allowing my main units to get out of battle with the EXP completely unscathed =)\n\nNotable cons:\nUnable to change key-bindings... I prefer quick save on numpad + and quick load -\nUnable to turn off auto-scroll. I prefer using wasd and would prefer the game window static.

Extremely long loading times in both start up and game-play (playing largest possible, may be why but my computers a beast...), unchangeable key bindings and lack of information made quit in less than an hour of play.

God, has it been that long. So it is interesting that I choose to write my first review centered on this game... interesting to me anyway.\n\nI suppose allot of that has to do with my desire over the years to see a successful remake of MoM... starting with the graphics which were most in need of repair. Sadly, this is not it (and I am one of the not so proud owners of Worlds of Magic). And while there are many successful fantasy/strategy games available... each with its own flaws, but playable and enjoyable all of the same... this game is not that either.\n\nFor me there are a number of deal breakers starting with the graphics which are at best subpar and removes any experience of emersion. Moreover the interface is clunky and it is easy to select and move the wrong units. And while it may well be there is a game hidden somewhere under the hood, the lack of feed back makes this a difficult thing to discover, and given what I have already written the discovery process a labor that is in my opinion not worth the effort.\n\nFinally, as this is the company's second attempt to remake this game, and given the aborted effort of the first, I would not hold out hope that the flaws, which are serious and run deep, will be given more than a cursory make over.\n\nMy advice is to save your money as there are many more worthy efforts already existent including the original MoM.","June 5","false","7.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

It is apparently an overhaul of World of Magic, which I never played.  The manual and tooltips are uniformly poorly written and vague.  For example, the game states that each farmer in a city's population produces 2 food.  My city has a 40% food bonus and 3 farmers, but its food production is valued at 5.86.  There is no instruction on reconciling these numbers.  The designers obviously thought numbers were very important (they're flung about everywhere in the UI), but made no attempt to let the player see how these numbers are derived or precisely what they do.  The manual is filled with redundant, uninformative descriptions.  Actual, useful information is hidden or missing from it.  The city screen is an array of tabs and pictures that fail to suggest what is most important and to make it easily accessible.\n\nSymbolism, where present, is often misused.  Take the spell "Bone Aura".  The graphic is of a human ribcage.  What does that suggest?  Does it detect bone disease?  Maybe it buffs skeleton warriors?  Nope.  It raises your resistance to piercing damage.  Who'd have guessed?  The game is filled with these - names and references that give no suggestion as to the underlying effect or principle.  You can assign a unit to "Autoscout", meaning it will move around the map and uncover new areas for you.  Well, there is no "scout" command, so why call it Autoscout?  Why not just Scout?  Autoscout is for science fiction.  More likely, it is a programmer designation used during development, and nobody on staff had an eye toward the game's presentation.  Technical terms became game terms, giving the setting a distinctly software-developer-ish ambience.\n\nPlanar Conquest does not understand symbolism or imagination or artistry.  It is not meant to be a fun game; rather, it is meant to be a technically precise game.  Unfortunately, the UI does not explain itself the way, for example, Civ 4's did.  Sorely missing is the ability to right-click in order to close or cancel dialogs and movements.\n\nRewinding to Master of Magic, an old game indeed:  You move onto a dungeon tile.  It's a tense moment.  Will it be treasure or death?  A cheap, MIDI organ sting plays.  A heavily pixellated graphic unfolds.  It is Brax The Dwarf!  We see a gung-ho, bearded adventurer bellowing something.  He is tough!  He is short!  He is possibly drunk!  He is Brax!  He is YOURS!  Woohoo!  That is what made MoM a great game - it pulled rabbits out of hats and  made itself comically melodramatic.  As well, it provided good 4x play.\n\nPlanar Conquest is a slew of technical details (often carelessly hidden from the player), but it has no beating heart.  It makes no statement.  It just is.\n\nUpdate:  Not 24 hours after I wrote this, the devs made some progress on two of the issues I was critical of - missing numbers and right clicks.  Not solved, but definitely progress.  They obviously are working for improvement.  The game is absolutely playable.  I still do not recommend the game due to its failure to understand of symbols and themes, reflected in almost all its aspects.  A game with no spirit cannot possibly be a spiritual successor to anything.","June 2","false","5.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

With that said, the only downfall of this game is the AI difficulty.  Even on the lower difficulty, I get my face smashed in after about 30 minutes played.\n\nLet's begin by talking about the good:\n\nLoads customization to create your Sorcerer Lord with.  With many different circles of magic to choose from as well as traits, you can be sure that it will suit your style of play.\n\nMany different types of creatures.  Lots of times games do not put in enough different types of monsters, but not this game.  There are over 150 units to recruit and magical creatures to summon!\n\nEach map is procedurally generated.  Any time you start over or even visit the next plane, you can be sure that it will be much different than the last time you have played.\n\nEasy to understand city management.  Immediate feedback if you try to add another builder or sage and take away from your farmer pool.   Enchantments both positive and negative are listed for you to see on the right side of the panel.\n\nFighting is not overly complicated and is easy to understand.  You can even cast magic on the battlefield to help turn the tide or save your men.\n\nHuge worlds to explore with many neutral camps to fight when you're not taking on an enemy AI mage.\n\nNow let's talk about what's wrong with the game:\n\nActually there isn't much wrong with the game at all except for this one glaring thing:\n\nThe AI controlled units are currently much too difficult to play against even on the lower difficulty settings.  They have me backed up into my main base after trying to expand with my settlers and I do not dare leave to defend my base as the AI will pounce on your weakness the moment you are 1 step too far away to help.\n\nIt's not very fun when AI units are moving around your cities very easily and you're helpless to stop them.\n\nIn one example, I was able to defend my cities from attack for 2 hours straight as wave after wave of enemies were literally throwing themselves at my defenders.  Little by little I was chipped away and since I continued to take losses, I couldn't do much else but build military units - this truly became quite a grind.  However they eventually were able to take my cities because their units became stronger and stronger until the point where even my main stack was overwhelmed. Again this is on the "mageling" (easier) level.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hS6RKTY_DL8\n\nIf you're thinking about buying this game and have decided to play this.  Be sure to put this on the lowest difficulty setting.

Yes, there aren't any truly phenomenal ones especially if you want a fantasy themed game (there are sadly better sci-fi ones out there currently), but they're a good deal better than Planar Conquest in terms of graphics, game play, strategy, AI, and content. I thought the remake would bring significant changes but that's my own fault for not researching what was planned (because I really didn't care).\n\nIf you like tactical battles the most go get Age of Wonders 3. Its recent expansions have made it a very rounded game though its strength still remains solely in its tactical battles. If you want an overall balanced experience Fallen Enchantress' line of games is where you want to go, but it's arguably an ugly game and the AI is kind of terrible (aren't they all?).\n\nFor the best overall pick though,  Endless Legends is probably the best fantasy 4x game right now. I don't really play any of them much since I'm still searching for what I specifically want, but it's been very well reviewed and is more or less the best fantasy 4x game right now with the exception of its very basic and, in my opinion, boring tactical combat. Still, you can do worse than spend your cash on it.\n\nWhatever your choice there's really no reason to pick up Planar Conquest and they kind of know it which is why it's priced so low.","June 1","false","0.2"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","0"

While there are some video tutorials on the developers youtube channel, they're not complete yet. (Also, bizzarely, they're not on the developers site. You really have to go digging for them, and they're actually fairly decent once you find them.)\n\nWhile most of this game is pretty intiutive to people who are familiar with the 4x genre, there are a couple of elements that are atypical. I'd prefer to have those diffences highlighted up front without me having to read through a long manual to understand them.\n\nWhile the overall maps seem to be pretty, they don't render smoothly. Animations are a bit jerky.\nThe turn based maps look slapped together and are unimpressive.\n\nThere are just better games that provide the same gameplay.

The game links to an old-school manual 80 pages long. I thought those days were behind me.\n\n2) The interface wasn't terribly intuitive. It turns out this is a port of an Android game, which I didn't know at the time, and it kind of shows.\n\nEDIT: Reading the other reviews, everybody keeps talking about Master of Magic and World of Magic. I've never even heard of those games.\n\nThis game just assumes you've played those games, I guess. I haven't, and this game did nothing to try to convince me.","May 30","false","0.6"," 22 of 65 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","22","65","0","3"
