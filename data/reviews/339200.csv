The short answer would be "Yes and No"\nLet's get into it.\n\nThis is not the original launch of the game, first being released on iPad where it got good reviews. So first things first, how well was it ported to PC ?\nPlease keep in mind that my time with the game was through a pre-release version, that being said :\n\n-Frames locked at 60 max (Vsync on or off).\n-Vsync off will result in screen tearing.\n-Operates fine with mouse and Keyboard as-well with a controller.\n-Most of the keys are rebindable but not all. You can rebind the movement and action keys which are most important, but you can not rebind generic commands such as "Pause" , "Menu", Numeric for items (1,2,3,4) and you can not assign keyboard commands for mouse actions (attack, use item and turn camera). Overall i found this to be acceptable but not ideal.\n-No bugs, glitches, crashes or any issues from my time with the game\n-Decent graphics options for quality / resolution etc.\n\nThe developer claims that this was a huge overhaul and from my time with the game i found this to be true. So overall it's ok technically speaking. My only issue is with the frame lock and tearing, hopefully the dev will have this sorted soon. OR RIOT!!! :D\n\nNow that we are done with that on to the game!\n\nThe overall feel of Oceanhorn resembles the Zelda series, featuring a mute hero, a handful of magical artifacts that you will collect across very different environments in order to save the world!...what else ?... oh and find out what happened to your father!\n\nThe journey will take you from verdant landscapes to sun-scorched deserts to treacherous dungeons, all of these environments are beautifully crafted and never outstay their welcome.\nThe "I am on a adventure!" feeling is present throughout the game. A big part of that feeling is caused by the epic soundtrack which blends perfectly with your surroundings, never breaking the feeling and always adapting itself to the situation at hand.\n\nThe gameplay is rather stiff for a Action RPG and while it may be fine for ipad it's definitely sub-par for a PC title. This is a issue because from my point of view the actual combat-gameplay is the bread and butter for a game of this type. You start with a STICK for a weapon (yes a actual stick!) but you soon find your fathers sword and shield! You can block with said shield using shift and you can move around while holding block, but when you attack with your sword you are rooted in place, making for a bit of a frustrating experience when a enemy moves 5 pixels out of range you need to stop attacking, move and start attacking again.\n\nWhile you traverse Oceanhors worlds you will level up and unlock new items and abilities which will allow you to solve previously impassable puzzles. So if you are a completionist there is plenty of backtracking for you in Oceanhorn.\nSpeaking of puzzles...these are for the most part no-brainers, with the occasional brain teaser, i did not mind this to much as i never enjoyed being stuck on a puzzle but if you want something more complex you will have a hard time finding it here.\n\nWhat about the difficulty ?\nWell there is no hand-holding and the game rarely points you in the right direction.\nFor example, if you chose not to talk to all of the towns folk or read all the messages scattered across the land you will not get access to all the locations you can explore. A location will only unlock for you if someone tells you about it or you read about it somewhere.\nThe actual combat is not that challenging and you will have no problems dispatching creatures or learning a bosses patterns so you can counter it.\n\nLet's wrap this up...\nIf you are looking for a leisurely-paced enchanting adventure and you are not to fussy about combat then look no further.\nSure... it is not perfect and it may not be the embodiment of modern day ARPGs but it more then makes up for it in feel and style.\nOverall a good game at a very attractive price which i am happy to recommend!\nFor a clearer view on the actual game you can watch my first impressions video :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJyt0Q7TWY&index=1&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","March 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 221 of 251 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","221","251","15","12"

Technical\n3. Gameplay\n4. Pro's, Cons, conclusion\n1. Intro:Hello review readers! The fact that you're reading this review means you're either potentially interested in this game or have played it & want to get another guy's opinion on the game you have been playing. I am currently still playing the game and have not finished it, about 5-6 hours in.\n\n2. TechncialThe game has full controller support (using xbox 360 controller for pc) and I would recommend playing it in this way. It is possible to play with mouse and keyboard, after testing both I decided to stick with he controller.\n\nIt's possible to change some graphical settings (shadows, screensize, etc.) up to a given point, I would have liked to have seen a little more options for this to make the game prettier/uglier depending on your hardware, but the basics are there.\n\nWhat annoys me a little bit is that it seems to be poorly optimised for PC at this point. Meaning: even though you might have a high end gaming system, sometimes you will get the occasional FPS drop or screen tear here & there. Nothing major & gamebreaking though, but it did cause me to tone down the graphics a bit for more consistent FPS.\nNevertheless: the game has vibrant colours & is fun to look at, despite it not being "graphically advanced". The cartoony atmosphere grows on you, and I would not want to see this game with realisticly drawn characters & backgrounds, it feels fine the way it is.\n\nI have not had any crashes yet & the game runs flawlessly, people on the community forums have reported otherwise and I did see dev responding to these topics regularly. If you are unsure if you can run this game, better ask people on the forums with similar specs what their experiences are.\n\n3. GameplayThe gameplay in my eyes, at first, was a bit "easy". Meaning: if you're looking for a "hard" game you will find little joy playing Oceanhorn. I'm not sure what age group i'd recommend this game for but i'd say something in the lines of 6+. If you (or your kid) can play games like Spyro the dragon or Skylanders/Disney Infinity, they can play this. It's not very hard, but to fully play the game they will need to understand the English language, be it to follow the story or just to read clues / where they should go next. The game starts off easy & keeps on making the puzzles more difficult, having you look around & go "hmm, what now" at regular intervals, keeping it interesting.\n\nYou get some freedom as in where to travel at any given point, yet, until you get some basic things handed to you by following the storyline (*minor spoilers, mouse over to show* bombs, a bow, a jump ability, stuff like that), there is little to do other than follow the main route. It's a fake sense of freedom, but a sense of freedom nevertheless. After gaining a certain item or ability, you will often backtrack on the map or take sidepaths to reach areas you could not reach before.\n\nThe music is catchy at some points, making me hum it in the background while inside a dungeon / traveling around the world. They chose to not give the main character a voice in this game, as is common in a lot of these games, which I still kind of miss - I get that this is done to make the hero more relatable to you, giving you the option to give him your voice, but having a totally mute main hero has been done countless times and I find it more enjoyable when this isn't the case. That being said: the voice actors from the other people around the world sound kind of bland and I'm under the impression some bad/good guys were all voiced by the same person. They could have spiced this up a bit.\n\nThe story feels a bit cliché to me, as an adult, but what more do you need than save princesses and find your family to go on an adventure right?\n\n(I hate to say this, but the similarities with Zelda are at some a little too obvious, take this as a good or a bad thing, that's up to you)\n\n\nPro's, cons, conclusion\n\nPROCONNon-gamer friendlySometimes too easy for frequent gamersFull controller supportThe way the game handles your hardware could be optimisedMusic is very niceCharacter voices are kind of bland\n\nConclusion: Don't regret being curious enough to buy this game, have been having a lot of fun with it, albeit making the game/puzzles a little bit harder would not hurt. Very good step in game for friends/family who are not that experienced with gaming. Consider it a stepping stone into adventure/puzzle games to later hook them on something more complicated like Zelda, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, ...\n\nIf you must have a score, I rate this game 67/100, it would have gotten 70/100 if the voice actors could loosen up a little :-)","March 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 61 of 77 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","61","77","5","1"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nNowadays we see a lot of developers trying to cash in on something that's been successful in the past. We have a lot of "clones" going around in a few genres, and the action-adventure genre is no exception. Oceanhorn (previously available on iOS devices) looks and feels very similar to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. When I first saw the game, that's what I thought. After playing it for a bit, I still feel like it's similar to Wind Waker, but it has a few things that make it stand out from this comparison. Not much though!\n\n\nGameplay\n==========\nOceanhorn is very much like Wind Waker. If you'd played it, you know how this is going to work. The biggest difference is the top-down isometric camera angle. Everything plays off of this angle, especially the terrain. You have your sword and shield, and the variety of items you find as you explore dungeons, such as bombs. Combat is in real-time, having you walk up to an enemy and slash it with your sword--just like Zelda. These comparisons really can't be avoided, so I apologize in advance!\n\nAfter about an hour of story moments, you are introduced to the basic controls and mechanics, and after you obtain your sword and shield you are set loose to explore at your own pace. You have a boat, with which you can sail to any islands you've learned about and then explore them. You can learn about different islands by reading signs or speaking to NPCs. Once "learned", they emerge out of the sea on the World Map. You can then select them and auto-sail to them. You have no direct control over your boat, unlike Wind Waker where you have full control. You can, however, use any items you have obtained for your boat, such as a musket to shoot enemies or obstacles.\n\nIn dungeons, you solve puzzles and gather keys to open doors and advance, eventually obtaining the Master Key to get to the boss's lair. Defeating it "clears" the island and wraps up your mission there. Speaking of mission, your quest is to gather 3 specific objects of great power to combat the fiendish Oceanhorn, a monster that's survived since ancient times and terrorized the seas. These objects are hidden on specific islands, which are revealed to you before you start your adventure...but you need to explore other islands to obtain the items needed to clear the main islands!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nUsing a top-down isometric angle, the games play off of this for nearly everything. Terrain stands out a lot, indictating whether or not you can drop down to other ledges. The game uses a similar art style to Wind Waker, but sharper and less cartoonish. Everything is just as colorful as Wind Waker. Monsters look great, if a bit large and over-exaggerated at times. NPCs are all unique (as far as I've seen) and look nice. Environments are well done, with lush vegetation on the islands that call for it, and cactus and similar plants on the desert islands. The ocean is pretty, and so is the world map. As you sail along you can see some floating islands (no idea how to get to them yet).\n\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nMusic is nice, very fitting for each island I suppose. It does get repetitive after awhile, since exploring each island or dungeon takes a bit of time. Sound effects work for what they are conveying, but they aren't super memorable. Everything works for what they do. So far there hasn't been anything that stands out as particularly interesting in regards to the soundtrack.\n\n\nPerformance\n==========\nRuns near flawlessly on my rig (specs on my profile), and haven't had any random crashes. I did run into a few very short stutters, but they were minor. FPS stayed consistent throughout my playtime, even after playing for prolonged periods. I get the feeling it'll run well on any mid-level rig. Most players should not run into any issues. Not really much else to say here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nOceanhorn is the closet thing to a Zelda experience currently available on Steam, even if it is borderlining being a straight up copy. It's fun, easy to play, although it has a few flaws. The biggest of which is there is barely any sense of direction, leaving the player almost no hints of where to go or what to do next. So if you like exploring and figuring out things by yourself in a Zelda-esque experience, Oceanhorn is right up your alley.\n\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/vWGNg3-oaaI\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 5, 2015","true","12.1"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","44","52","2","4"

The game is pretty enough, voice acting is decent, but the gameplay itself is dull. The controls feel clunky, especially in combat where your hits do not always register if you attack the enemy too fast. Magic takes too long to be useful most of the time, and even when it is needed it feels underwhelming. An item you get lets you jump across small gaps and dodge roll, both of which are keyed to the same button. The game will let you fall from areas up to a certain height, which means you can be doing a timed puzzle and then inadvertantly (and commonly) dodge roll instead of jumping to the next platform and have to do the entire thing over.\n\nDamage is inconsistent, with bombs doing massive damage to some enemies but barely a scratch to others... and yet those other enemies will take a big chunk of damage from a random pot thrown at them. Speaking of pots, you have to either throw, shoot them, or throw a bomb at them to break them... your sword is evidently the sword of not smashing pots.\n\nBosses are few and far between, and most are unimpressive. I died a few times to them, not because they were hard, but because of completely unavoidable attacks, the boss freezing (status, not game freezing) the mechanic to damage it and the only way to unfreeze it aside from letting it time out is your magic with the very long windup, or just poorly designed.\n\nTravel between islands is set on pre-set paths, you tell the game to go and it drops you into a little shooting gallery where you spam the attack button to kill anything that gets in the way until you reach the island. On mobile I'm sure it was neat, tap to kill the things, but on pc its just feels like a boring, spam your mouse button and go add-on.\n\nOverall, the game is probably very good on mobile platforms, but not a very good pc game, and comparing it to zelda is like comparing a perfectly cooked steak to a $1 Banquet microwave dinner.","May 16, 2015","false","15.7"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","52","66","4","3"

What happened? Where did he go? It's your job to find out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjkNpmvSuxU\nOceanhorn is a port of a mobile game from 2013, rather then being a direct port much effort has gone into remastering the game for PC. Was it worth the wait? YES. Graphically speaking it's just as amazing as the first time you may have played it. Adding 4k+ res, realtime AO, soft shadows, AA, higher draw distance and 60FPS support among other things. While the game played well with keyboard+mouse or controller, everything was completely rebindable.\n\nStaying true to the Zelda formula while keeping a charm of its own, you travel the between islands on your ship gradually piecing together the story. Each island has it's own distinct themes and challenges while some just serve as hub points for restocking and gathering new information about undiscovered locations. Progress will result in level ups which unlocked a range of upgrades including a peashooter for firing off your ship. Later stages traveling becomes quite dangerous so these extra defenses are critical.\n\nDungeons generally consist of simple puzzles and key finding while backtracking to unlock areas you were unable to access earlier. Select islands contain boss fights and victory often rewarded unique abilities which also helped with opening secret areas. While you do spend much of your time traveling to locations already seen it's not a problem at all, as you will also find many new npcs and sidequests along the way.\n\nOceanhorn is a little on the easy side but the beauty of the entire package completely out weighs the lack of challenge. The game does ramp up in the later stages and you'll need to learn different attack patterns of enemies to guarantee success. Already mentioned the graphics are very distinct, the closest game to the mark would be Lili: Child of Geos (another decent phone port). With a captivating story, relaxing soundtrack and a whole bunch content to discover. For the asking price it's well worth the investment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblegrizzly/recommended/339200/","noblegrizzly","NobleGrizzly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblegrizzly/","107 products in account","Summary:\nOceanhorn tries so hard to be a good Zelda clone, that it forgets to be good at all the little things that make a Zelda game a good game.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time with Oceanhorn, I can give a thorough and fair review.\nTo give the game it's due, I will present the good before the bad.\n\nPros:\n-Great looking visuals (minus character models). Colorful, thoughtful, visually appealing.\n-A great game for particular gamers (Legend of Zelda fans, completionists, collectors)\n-Zelda for PC! VERY Wind-waker inspired, which is touching for the nostalgia.\n-A good wealth of game for the price. Many achievements and collectibles.\n-Sailing doesn't suck! A good idea to make it more of a mini-game than a chore.\n\nCons:\n-This is a Legend of Zelda clone that doesn't add or improve upon it's base material. The characters, the story, the puzzles, are all generally unappealling and forgettable.\n\nGames in notable concepts and mechanisms have been copied in the past with the aim of doing something different or better. Oceanhorn is not that game - it is unashamedly a Zelda clone. This point wouldn't be so bad if it Oceanhorn didn't go in the opposite direction at times and do things WORSE than Zelda - something to be examplified in further cons.\n\n-Puzzles are not challenging, and are often an exercise in tedium.\n\nMost puzzles are not difficult for the problem they present and how to solve them, but are often about a game element responding the way the player intends it to. This is further coupled with the next point...\n\n-Oceanhorn is arbitrarily made trying and longer with backtracking.\n\nThe game presents very early several problems that can only be solved after having particular items, which isn't anything new. However, one vital item to solving these problems isn't obtained until the 11th hour of the game, which presents the player with the (reluctantly optional) task of spending hours backtracking through every location for collectibles, treasure, etc. Without this, the game would probably have been about half it's actual length towards full completion, and with that in mind I can easily add that it outstayed it's welcome.\n\n-Bombs OP.\n\nTalking about a Zelda clone and getting down to brass tacks... When 90% of puzzles and encounters are solved with "bomb everything", it is a not a compliment to the other mechanisms present in the game. For puzzles, it feels like lazy game design, presenting the player repeatedly with, "Which wall do I blow up?"\nFor combat, this is largely a three-fold problem.\n1) All other combat abilities afforded to the player are slower and less effective than bombs. Spells are slower, sword-play is dull and risky, bow and arrows are slower and weaker.\n2) Bombs are plentiful! Often times, due to how the mechanisms work, you are rewarded a bomb for killing something with a bomb. You hold many and everyone and their mother has them too, so go nuts! Why not?\n3) It takes the guess-work out of encounters. Bombs work on everything from puzzles, to minions, to bosses, and after a while of slinging a sword and learning dodging patterns of enemies, it becomes increadibly simpler to chuck a bomb at whatever it is and win. There were two notable boss encounters where there were present some puzzle-like attribute in order to thwart the target, all of which was completely ignored because boss was vulnerable to bombs.\n\nConclusion:\nSadly doesn't live up to it's source material, despite so much effort going into the game to make it what it is. I don't blame anyone for being curious about the game, or interested in it's Legend of Zelda roots enough to warrant a purchase, but I can't deny that the game is disappointing. There are plenty of other minor complaints that I haven't listed in cons due to it becoming already apparent that I cannot recommend the game. Unintuitive obstacles and bugs aside, the game left me feeling more annoyed than satisfied.","February 28","false","13.7"," 97 of 156 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","97","156","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedpop/recommended/339200/","speedpop","Dr. Pyser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedpop/","557 products in account","Landstalker meets The Legend of Zelda. There are obvious nods to The Wind Waker in the world setting and locales right down to an ocean landscape dotted with islands, but that did not stop Cornfox & Bros from developing their game the way they wanted. The isometric view harkens back to an era that has long since disappeared in the realm of Z-targeting and free roam cameras - a programming art that was funnily enough perfected in The Wind Waker.\n\nThe story starts off simple enough with a young man's father having disappeared in the search for Oceanhorn. The main character sets off with an interaction level akin to the Zelda titles; jars are picked up and smashed on the ground, grass blades are slashed, boulders are blown apart by bombs. However there is an enjoyable yet simple physical meat to the main character in Oceanhorn. Even something as basic as wading in water brings about a speed penalty. A sign that the developers pay attention to the minutia of videogames.\n\nThe graphics are gloriously bright and colourful. The story won't set your imagination alight with wonder but it does the job. And the music is outstanding - sooner or later you'll be humming and whistling to the overworld theme.\n\nIt's a pity that this game may fly under the radar despite the reception it could and should achieve. Games like this don't come around too often anymore considering the monopoly of Zelda, so don't be deceived by the "smartphone game" approach by some commentators. Oceanhorn is a delight and I look forward to whatever else comes out from the Finnish caverns of Cornfox & Bros.","March 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/339200/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas caused a splash when it dropped on iOS back in 2013. It was plain to see that the game was an almost cut and paste rip, at least visually, from The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, but it's unfair to call Oceanhorn a clone. To me, 'Clone' is a pejorative term reserved for the scores of cheap knock-offs occupying iOS, Android and Greenlight. Oceanhorn is better than that. It's a love letter to the Zelda series that brings similar, high quality design practices and gameplay values to gamers on iOS and PC. It doesn't quite sail into the same realm as Nintendo's flagship series but it's the closest another developer has ever come.\n\nThere's not much worth knowing about Oceanhorn's story, it's much the same as any Zelda game - so, as deep as a puddle and just about as interesting .The fabled sea monster called "Oceanhorn" has come back to your island, leaving your father to go fight it while you sleep. You find yourself alone with nothing but your mothers magical pendant to guide you, and off you pop on a Windwaker-style adventure in your dinky little boat- which, thankfully, doesn't talk this time.\n\nYou'll sail to new islands, each inhabited by people with interesting stories to tell, explore vast dungeons, and encounter creatures that are most definitely not ripped off from the Zora or Rito people.\n\nEquipped with your sword and shield, you'll take on dangerous foes and some surprisingly well designed boss monsters. Combat isn't as tight as the Zelda games but it's an admirable impersonation, especially for a game that has made its way over from iOS. Controls can be a bit finicky and loose at times but they are otherwise fine, feeling just as good with the mouse and keyboard as they do with a gamepad.\n\nThe developers try their hardest to conjure up the same sense of adventure that can be found in A Link to The Past and Windwaker, and for the majority of the game they succeed. It's unlikely you will forget that you are playing a game very heavily based on a well-known franchise, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, opting to leave you wander off in your own direction with nothing but the words of other people to guide you. You are free to travel around and explore, neglecting the main story, if you so choose.\n\n\nDiving in to the meat of the game has you kill easy monsters in deep dungeons, solve simple puzzles, and collect elemental powers (where have we seen that before?). It's fairly standard stuff that even the Zelda franchise has dined out on for far too long. There's nothing particularly outstanding about any of Oceanhorn's action but its richly crafted, sun-kissed worlds are immersive and fun to explore. Ironically, for a game based around traversing large bodies of water, sailing isn't that fun. In fact, it's a bit dull - a complaint that was frequently directed at Windwaker, also. Any frustrations inspired by the mediocre sailing will at least be washed away by Oceanhorn's gorgeous soundtrack.\n\nAudiovisual presentation is an area where Oceanhorn zips past its, rather sparse, competition. A beautiful world-class composer crafted soundtrack and pretty landscapes are destined to keep a smile on your face and a tune in your head.\n\nIn truth, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas can be a bit shallow, but it's hard to dislike a game so lovingly crafted - and with such respect for the source material from which it was created. Temper your expectations and you'll find an engrossing adventure that pays homage to one of gaming's greatest, never managing to step out of its shadow.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclosure: Review key provided by publisher.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/339200/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is an action adventure heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda. To begin with the story, it's not anything special, so you'll just live with the fact that your father left you to destroy the expanding evil. As a good son, instead of being hateful, you become a powerful knight that will save the world and unite all races, surpassing your father.\n\nBut from what exactly you'll have to save the world? Well, from three types of steampunk machines and a possessed living fortress, and few native creatures like trolls or orcs, which also have pretty low variety. Overall, Oceanhorn is limited this way, as you'll meet just few distinct NPCs and beat them with one of two swords, bow, bomb or one of your five spells.\n\nThe steam page says it's also an RPG but I think that's overestimated. Even though there is a leveling system, there aren't many character levels and each level up brings you a passive bonus, e.g. increased amount of bombs or arrows you can hold. There isn't any inventory system and even though there is a currency system, you'll save money for later anyway, because only appealing items in shops are the (two) expensive ones. All cheap stuff in shops are arrows, bombs, mana or health refills but you won't need to buy these - anytime you are missing something, the game drops it for you from the next enemy, bush or vase.\n\nLow difficulty is something that really disappointed me. All puzzles are laughably easy and neither the combat is challenging, especially after you claim the second sword. Bosses might seem scary but they are easy too, it's like they want you to win with a single repeating pattern: Do something to stun them, tap your slash button until they stand up, and repeat two more times.\n\nThere are height differences on islands but the level design is pretty limited, you can't even jump down the cliff if it's higher than a block. After about 5 hours of playtime, you'll at least learn to roll and jump between blocks close to each other. Anyway, the game holds your hand in most moments so nothing bad can happen to you and if you fail anyway, you just respawn at nearest checkpoint and dead enemies are still dead until you leave the location. The game also have problems with occasional crashes, it crashed every hour in average but it's not a big problem since the game saves your progress often.\n\nIt's not complex, it's not hard, so what? Oceanhorn feels like a food for completionists. It has a good amount of achievements and it motivates you to explore all the areas, to find every treasure (even though you know it'll contain useless junk like an old shoe). There are a lot of secret areas and there's also a well-made challenge system - Each discovered island shows you three new challenges that you can beat anywhere in the game. Those challenges varies from "kill X enemies" through "drown your enemy" to "catch your first fish".\n\nThere are two minigames in the game, fishing and sailing between islands. Fishing is completely optional but the sailing, that's something you'll have to do many times... and it's annoying. You set the place to sail to and there are boxes, mines and sea creatures in your way. To get through, you have a gun with unlimited ammo and attack speed - it just shoots everytime you tap the attack button. It's a boring playtime filler where you are just mindlessly shooting everything, that you can't skip.\n\nThe colourful graphic design is something that definitely stands up for Oceanhorn in the amount of negative facts around. At least if you don't mind that all characters look like kids. The soundtrack is fine, it contains average positive melodies that you won't mind listening repeatedly, but you forget them immediately after you finish the game.\n\nConclusion:Oceanhorn comes as a disappointment by many features - low variety of everything, poor story, low difficulty, very limited RPG mechanisms. But it has its positives, as it'll make many completionists entertained for being able to explore all the islands with many secrets and challenges. That's why I think it's worth recommending to people seeking relaxing and easy game, just don't expect much from it. If you think 15 € for this is too much, wait for sale - There'll be another one for sure, as it already was in 1 dollar tier of Humble Bundle.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","May 8","true","13.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

However, it is not even close.  The only similarities are, bows, bombs, and swinging a sword.  It ends there.  There are no original gadgets, no compelling storyline, no challenging boss fights, and no challenging puzzles.  The entire game feels extremely limited.  There is no real mystery to character development and the storyline is petty.  All of the mobs require the same logic to defeat and there are very few variations of them.\n\nIf this were to be a clone, then where are all of the extra gadgets and related puzzles?  The only extra "gadget" you get is the ability to jump over 1 block.  There are a total of ~10 types of creature to defeat, but really only 4 different types: flyers, biters, sword swingers, and archers.  All of them are weak against everything.  So there is no real need to mixup your playstyle.  Bosses show a little bit of variety, but are too simplistic.\n\nThe competition offers variance between mobs.  Some mobs can only be killed with bombs, others with the bow.  You could use a boomerang to stun them or grab what they dropped.  The puzzles in the competition actually required thinking.  This game blatently points out what exactly needs to be done to solve just about all of the puzzles.\n\nSo, if you want an incredibly easy and boring ripoff, this is your game.  Otherwise, I'd only consider purchasing this during summer sale at the price it is worth - ~$3.","March 22, 2015","false","13.3"," 60 of 100 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","60","100","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutinize/recommended/339200/","mutinize","mutiny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutinize/","339 products in account","I like the game to an extent. It certainly plays like a Zelda title (dungeons, chests, heart pieces, obtainable items) and I suppose it would scratch the itch if you're wanting to play one. I compare this to that because it's blatantly obvious what this game is trying to be. While it succeeds to some amount, there is something that it does not do correctly. I think this game falls short on atmosphere. The world almost feels rudimentary and stagnant. The voice acting is bad at times, some of the AI is mindless, and there's just a certain charm that Zelda has that this does not.\n\nDoes that make it a bad game? No. Do I recommend you buy it? Maybe. Emulate Zelda if you're wanting something more substantial to play, I recommend Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker -- although Majora's Mask has been and always will be my favorite. Get this game if you're not interested in emulating an older game or want to play something new with Steamworks integration.\n\nAs for how it runs: this is a port of an iPhone game. Surprisingly well done if you ask me. I've experienced no crashing or slowdowns throughout my gameplay -- the only drawback I see are the limited graphical options with presets rather than legitimate tweaking abilities. Some fiddling around with Nvidia Control Pannel (or Inspector) is enough to bruteforce options if need be.\n\nNot a bad game though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zabu_san/recommended/339200/","zabu_san","♫ ざぶ_さん ♫","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zabu_san/","168 products in account","What happens when you take an all-too-familiar formula like Zelda, tweak it ever so much, release it on iOS, then eventually on PC? Well, you get Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas. What seems like a Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker clone with an isometric camera, Oceanhorn has a style all its own. From sailing the high seas, spelunking dungeons for new items, and defeating bosses in a “spot and exploit the weakness” motif; sure this does sound a lot like Wind Waker, but hey, if you’re going to be influenced from a game series, why not one of the most renouned and beloved? Bonus points for borrowing so heavily from one of the strongest games in said franchise.\n\nNo one who plays Oceanhorn will be able to deny the various Legend of Zelda inspirations throughout, but just because it has all of these various ideas and tropes in place, is that a bad thing? Yes and no. Yes because a lot of Zelda fans are rather tired of the same Zelda formula the recent games have instituted: go to dungeon, get a new item, use that item on the dungeon’s boss, repeat 6-8 times, learn midway through of a legend about a green tunic’d warrior that will save the land, exposition a bit more, Triforce wielders confront, roll credits. We realize that’s a snarky critique, but it’s also valid. Oceanhorn at least avoids a lot of these tired ideas and throws us back to a more retro Zelda premise. Those who have played the very first Legend of Zelda on NES will recall the game was rather obtuse and almost too open. Players load the game up and are thrust into a world, onto a screen that has three directions: north, west, and east, with a single cave wherein player will find a weapon (sound familiar, yet?). Oceanhorn feels more like a 1989 Zelda than anything else in terms of world design and instructions.\n\nA few players may be turned off by the lack of hand-holding and direction in the opening hours, but for us here, it was a refreshing take. We’ve become spoiled by overly-simplistic tutorials and being lead through opening segments with lengthy cutscenes and explanations about the world around us. Oceanhorn does seem to abandon the uniqueness it begins with after a few hours and lean on the Zelda formula, but it’s done progressively, making it a forgivable sin. There’s still the “collect x number of relics and defeat the ultimate evil” blueprint in place, but the dungeon exploration and puzzle solving is there to prevent boredom from overwhelming the player.\n\nThe gameplay takes place on dense lands ranging from single-tiered isles to several levels of housing and dungeons. Don’t be fooled by an island’s size while sailing up to it, there’s typically more below the surface than shown. The scale is lesser than Wind Waker, but this is no short game; expect to spend 10-15 hours with Oceanhorn, with an extra few for those that aim to collect any and everything the islands hold within. Puzzles will range from block-moving to hitting ranged targets with arrows. It’s never anything too strenuous, but a few were noodle scratchers that provided “eureka” moments when solved. Boss battles aren’t too genre-defying, but are more complex than one would think an iOS-to-PC game would be. Most bosses require a specific strategy to affect them, and finding out that strategy while strafing and dodging can provide a sense of tension few Zelda games can even subject us to. Tight rooms and multi-powered bosses can keep players on their toes during a fight.\n\nVisually and audibly Oceanhorn is a like-it-or-leave-it presentation. Just like with nearly every other aspect, the main character borrows heavily from Link, even seemingly borrowing his Skyward Sword garb minus the hat, to head out on this adventure. Characters look great, full of colors, design, and polish, but few enemy types and marginally different skin swaps of some of them leave a lot to be desired. Lush environments and dark, diluted dungeons accentuate each other very well, but only vary by the end rather than consistently throughout. Nearly every over world island is practically the same look with a different layout; at least every themed dungeon has a personality and appeal. Voicework and composition are impressive given the small staff at handling the game, with many cutscenes providing adequate storytelling and delivery. Music is acceptable, if not a tad bit safe in the end. As fun and upbeat few of the songs are, there’s little that keeps us coming back to listen to more after the fact. It’s passable, and the influences are there, but the music just doesn’t have that lasting appeal that comes with other games, and especially Zelda games.\n\nWhat was probably a great iOS game, where aside from DS titles, there were not many Zelda-esque games on the market; Oceanhorn was a relief and refreshing. Hitting Steam and diving into the deep end where Zelda clones are a dime a dozen, this little trek has heart, but fails to sail far enough from the rest of the pack to standout for too long. If you have a Zelda itch to scratch while waiting for more, Oceanhorn can fill that need, but don’t expect new ideas, only tweaked presentations on acquainted themes. Oceanhorn has depth and should be explored for those who truly enjoy its implementations and setup, but do be reserved when raising your sails and setting out, the seas aren’t as “uncharted” as they would like you to believe.\n\nYES\n\n+ Its small differences and appeal is good for Zelda fans\n\n+ Engaging gameplay and puzzle-solving\n\n- It’s an unapologetic Zelda clone, through and through, so your mileage may vary\n\n- It’s likely a more impressive handheld game, not a great idea to port PC with even more competitors to compete against\n\n(Review Front Towards Gamer: http://ftg.operationsupplydrop.org/2015/03/28/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas-review-pc/)","May 26, 2015","true","15.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Zelda veterans will find the gameplay natural, as if an extension of an actual Zelda game.  The puzzles work very similar if not the same, items are familiar, core objectives are mostly the same.  Veterans will also find this game a bit easier, and therefore feels a little too short; even with the extra level from the "Game of the Year Edition".  Zelda noobs (are there any?) will be eased into the genre without being overwhelmed by the puzzles which are significantly more difficult in parts of the Zelda series.  Then go tackle all the Zelda you can get your hands on...please.  This is a great game to play in addition to any of them.   Even though I said Veterans will find it short and a bit easy, it's still worth the price.  It's a good deal at full price and a steal at any sale price.\n\nPros:\nWell, you can wait for Nintendo to release a new Zelda for your N64 or Gamecube, or give this a shot.\nA nostalgic but fresh game.\nExcellent graphics that are a blast in 3D with 3D TVPlay!\nPerfect controlls with my PS3 Controller\nAny age can enjoy\n\nCons:\nNo fairies, or bottles to put them in...sad.\nAnother acceptable answer could have been merfairies.\nEach game save is a completely different game, you can't save a single game to multiple save slots.

However, it wasn't long before I started to enjoy the game in it's own right. It reminded me more of an old Playstation game by the name of Alundra more than Legend of Zelda. There is as much exploration and puzzles as there is adventure and fighting. Oceanhorn's story doesn't take too long to get into and honestly if I put down the game for a few days I would forget what I had to do despite the ability to review previous cutscenes. It's a really cool isometric game that deals with exploring various islands in a water ridden world.\n\nThe story was solid and never deviated far from the main goal of finding your father and defeating Oceanhorn. There were side quests a plenty along the way that brought you a little closer to your goal. Some featuring puzzles that required very little thinking, quick or otherwise. The general fighting was simple but gave you a few ways to approach how you would kill enemies. Boss battles took a slight learning curve before understanding their combat patterns. What I find surprising in this adventure RPG was the pace that it went.\n\nThis wasn't by any means a long game. The majority of my time was spent backtracking to find stuff or remember to do one of the quests when I ran into a road block. Clues were scattered around areas that alluded to other locations which I'd ultimately neglect to explore, which made things tedious. I noticed a few things that could have improved my experience.\n\nOne of the things I would have liked was a notebook that maybe jotted semi useful information that you found on your journey so that maybe I could remember where the honey was located without having to go back to the source to get information on particular items needed to progress. Another thing that I found a little mundane about it was the actual traveling between islands. You don't have the freedom of navigating yourself rather you select a route that your boat moves along. I did appreciate the obstacles in the water that I had to be vigilant and shoot with my cannon but after the 10th time it was repetitive to the point of boring because there was so much back and forth travel happening. It would have also been nice if your character was able to interact with people he met on the sea. With so many islands you really wonder why the sea was so barren.\n\nDespite the critical observations I did enjoy this game the time I did spend playing it. the visuals were beautiful the controls tight and the music was well done. The atmosphere and pace of the gameplay was all one note with the exception nearing the final boss. This would be a nice game for anyone interested in Zelda-esque adventure.","April 13","true","27.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrman2k3/recommended/339200/","mrman2k3","Mallas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrman2k3/","1463 products in account","Oceanhorn is clearly inspired by the games in the Legend of Zelda series. I mostly see it compared to The Wind Waker because it takes place on a series of islands, but it's really more similar to Phantom Hourglass and A Link to the Past. You don't have free reign of your boat like in Wind Waker, but instead select an island from your map and a path is automatically charted. During the trip, you must shoot down attacking octopi and mines, but everything is on-rails. Most of the map is locked away at the game's start, but additional islands appear when you learn about them from NPC's or other sources.\n\nThe main game takes place on an isometric grid. One thing to keep in mind which is very important for puzzle-solving and finding hidden secrets is that you can only drop down from above by a distance of one "block". If this isn't possible, then you will simply walk to a cliff's edge and stop. Combat is simple and a bit loose, but it works okay. You have access to items such as bombs and arrows which help out in combat. In particular, I found bombs to be very potent against stronger enemies.\n\nBlock puzzles are featured fairly often, though they never become too complex. Most of the other puzzles are more of the navigational variety, and you'll really only find a challenge if you look for optional collectables. Oceanhorn features "Challenges" similar to what you see in many mobile games. Each island you visit brings with it three new challenges, some that are general goals (i.e. "Defeat 50 skeletons") and some that are specific to that island. Completing these challenges rewards you with a large amount of experience points. You can also gain experience by defeating enemies, but it can be a bit of a grind. When you level up your abilities become more efficient (require less stamina), you can hold more consumable items, or other various bonuses.\n\nThere are also optional items to collect called Bloodstones, which eventually unlock a powerful spell. I noticed these items early on, but I thought I had to get some sort of shovel or something to dig them out. It turns out, you just have to whack them with your sword like twenty times to collect them. I don't think the game ever mentioned this, so I was kind of annoyed when I realized this after I passed by so many during the first few dungeons.\n\nThe graphics are nice and clean, although in motion the animations could have been better. I played this game entirely on a 37" TV at about 10 feet away, and sometimes the text was a bit too small. (Though it didn't help that I played it until 1:00 A.M. the last few nights.) This originally started as a mobile title, so at times you can see its origins peeking through. Overall, though, I'd say this port was pretty good. The music is nice, although it does sound pretty similar to Wind Waker at times. I had heard that the mobile version featured several songs by Nobuo Uematsu of Final Fantasy fame, but I'm not sure if his songs were replaced for the PC version as I did not see his name in the credits at all.\n\nThe controls worked great with my Xbox 360 controller. I did have the game lock up on me a few times, but it was usually right when I launched the game so I did not lose any progress. I did have to exit to the title screen once because I got my character stuck somewhere they weren't supposed to go to. Fortunately, the game auto-saves frequently so it was no big deal.\n\nLike Link from the Zelda series, the main character of Oceanhorn is mute. In most Zelda games, however, some sort of proxy character is present to give some sort of voice to Link. The nameless main character of Oceanhorn lacks this, and coupled with an always emotionless face, you really don't get a feeling of any personality for him at all. The other characters in the game fared a bit better, though none of them were too memorable. In addition to other humans, the world of Arcadia features bird-like Owrus and fish-like Gillfolk. While a bit clichéd, the emerging backstory was interesting enough to keep me playing, and had a slight twist that I didn't expect.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Oceanhorn. It's not perfect, but it's a decent substitution for a Zelda game on PC. It's much shorter than recent Zelda titles and isn't padded with a lot of filler. It may be a Zelda clone, but it's certainly a competent one so I'm not going to complain.","March 23, 2015","true","10.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesatellite54/recommended/339200/","thesatellite54","The Satellite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesatellite54/","98 products in account","It's true: Despite its own graphical style, isometic viewpoint, and some other quirks, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is essentially a Legend of Zelda style game inside. But why is this a bad thing? As a diehard Zelda fan, I welcome the gaming industry to create their own attempts at Zelda-like games, whether from AAA developers or indies. And Oceanhorn does a fine job of being a fun game, even though almost all of its major elements are pretty much lifted from the Zelda series. But let's be fair here, bows, bombs, swords, shields, and sailing are far from monopolized by Zelda.\n\nGetting into Oceanhorn itself, there's a lot to like about this game. The art style has its own charm, the isometric viewpoint is neat and a nice callback to games like Mario RPG and Landstalker, and the music... sublime. It all comes together in a wonderful presentation package that should delight anyone who can see past the game's obvious inspiration. The controls, for the most part, are pretty fluid, especially considering this is a port of an iOS game, and it felt just right on a controller, although the main character does move just the smallest bit slower than I'd like him to. The sailing atmosphere is gorgeous, and it's fun visiting new islands and charting them out, learning what secrets and people dwell there. The puzzles, while not entirely brainteasers, were the right amount of clever and made the game feel fluid. Dungeons are clever and designed expertly, with creative boss fights I quite enjoyed. In some ways it's a bit on the easy end, but no easier than your typical Zelda game.\n\nThe cons with this game are minor. There's the often-cited lack of a map screen, which would have been very handy. I find it odd that you can't dash or roll up steps, which would be nice for speeding up action. And the sailing is even more restrictive than that of Phantom Hourglass; in that game you could at least plot a course, but here, you can only select a destination. I would have liked a little more control, especially in that gorgeous atmosphere, but it's a minor concern.\n\nAlso, the game is too short. :(\n\nBut that's both a pro and a con; a con, because the game did feel a bit on the shorter side, and a pro, because I only wanted more.\n\nIn short, Oceanhorn is worth it if you're a fan of adventure games, especially Zelda obviously, whose only shortcomings are minor. Hopefully the game becomes successful enough to warrant a sequel in the future.

Or rather, they’re in love with the monoliths of gaming history, the games that for many form a mesh of absolutes and ideals which other games continually seek to emulate. Sometimes this leads to the betterment of an idea, a concept first imitated and then refined so that it then becomes synonymous with this new game that did it better. Other times though the ways games so constantly seek to recreate their predecessors never extends beyond rudimentary or reductive replication, seeking success by playing to familiarity and nostalgia. This is where we are met with Oceanhorn: Monster of the Uncharted Seas, a would be Zelda clone that is the gaming equivalent to that off-brand action figure your grandmother mistakenly bought you for Christmas, on the surface indistinguishable from the original but whose inadequacy becomes immediately known once the disingenuous packaging is breached.\n\nOceanhorn mirrors not only Zelda’s style of play, but its aesthetic and structure. Its art design is inarguably seeking to reflect that of Zelda’s more cartoony iterations, specifically the nautically inclined Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass. Oceanhorn’s world is bright and colorful, segmented into different islands you access by sailing on those supposedly uncharted seas, with a bouncy demeanor that is unable to distract from the overwhelming feeling of artificiality present in every aspect of Oceanhorn’s design. This isn’t wholly due to Oceanhorn’s status as a poor man’s Zelda, but the result of a world that feels entirely synthetic. The whimsical charm and history always so paramount to Zelda’s world design is entirely absent, replaced with a cold and alienating feeling of obligation. Oceanhorn’s world exists entirely for the sake of housing its plot, a plot which expands and shrinks in whichever way it finds convenient, pouring out backstory when it needs to feel grandiose and then receding into the background when it fails to back up its attempts at magnificence with anything more than words.\n\nWhere Zelda constructs its narrative to intersect and enhance its mechanics, Oceanhorn uses it as a crux. Things happen because the game needs you to move to the next dungeon. Plot is only ever employed for the sake of giving context to your actions, but the writing is so stale and inconsistent that it causes the game as a whole to feel even more so the product of recognizable but unofficial parts. Details are always given in terms meant to imply a storied history to this land, with caves and lost princesses being hidden away for thousands of years, and yet within minutes of arriving to these areas you are able to overcome whatever obstacle was standing in the way of the local inhabitants, often by such trivial means as to call into question whether anyone has actually cared even a little about the fate of their world until you arrived. There is an astounding level of pointlessness to Oceanhorn’s plot given how much time it dedicates to selling you on it, to the point I feel it would be better off simply tearing it all out and letting the mechanics speak for themselves.\n\nIt seems fair to say Oceanhorn’s main draw isn’t its plot but its mechanical similarity to Zelda, so its true test is in how well it manages to reconstruct a formula that has changed little over the years and yet remains incredibly well regarded and popular. In this Oceanhorn is…fine. It manages to mirror many of Zelda’s most recognizable aspects, from item based navigation puzzles to dungeon layouts and boss designs, but it never loses that feeling of being a cheap imitation. One of Zelda’s biggest strengths is in the multilayered design of its world and dungeons, where puzzles build upon themselves as your means of solving them becomes larger, each knew item bringing with it a host of immediate and secondary applications.\n\nOceanhorn in comparison is much less intricate in its design, presenting you with new items when it sees fit but never giving you much to do with them. There are puzzles here they are more like speedbumps than roadblocks, tending to hold you up for a moment but ultimately tedious to overcome and often of the same block-pushing variety. The lack of intelligent level and puzzle designs causes Oceanhorn to feel intensely segmented and linear, each dungeon serving to send you on the next but having little for you to actually do while you’re there. Exploration is nearly entirely absent both within levels and in the overworld, the former due to the narrow design of each island, and the later as the boat you use to travel between islands is entirely on rails.\n\nEven as one of the few who enjoyed Wind Waker’s sailing, traveling between islands in Oceanhorn is excruciatingly obnoxious. There is so little to do in these segments that their inclusion is as worthless as the plot attempting to justify it. The ocean itself is tepid and lifeless and the only thing populating it an abundance of trash you need to clear away with your cannon, a task no doubt meant to keep you occupied until you arrive at your destination but only serving to make sailing even more annoying as you are then required to pay attention the whole time you are cruising along lest you bump into a mine someone carelessly left floating around. The monotony of sailing caused me to lose any interest I might have had to return to previous island to pick up a collectible I missed or finish up some of the sidequest objectives I hadn’t gotten around to, though these additions contribute so little to the game that the only real reason to pursue them is for the sake of completion.\n\nOceanhorn’s only truly alluring aspect is its novelty as the closest PC and mobile players can get to a native Zelda game. With so little like it on these platforms it is tempting to accept and justify Oceanhorn’s middling to bad attempts to replicate Nintendo’s iconic franchise, solely because it’s all we are likely to ever get. But for as hard as it might try, there is no mistaking Oceanhorn as anything but a knock-off, and not a good one at that. Its design is uninspired and meandering, a chore to navigate and a bore to solve. Even excluding comparisons to Zelda proper, Oceanhorn isn’t fun to play, and if it wasn’t for bearing such a striking resemblance to that series I doubt anyone would have paid it much attention in the first place.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 23","false","6.6"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","5"

The entire mechanic of sailing is pointless in the game and adds nothing other than forcing the player to just spam the gun that the hero has on the boat while sailing to the destination, a simple cut scene or even transition animation would have more than been sufficient.

The story is simple - find your father. The execution is effective, making this one of my favorite games. Let's take a look at why.\n\nPROS\n- The story is basic, but never boring or cliched. Subtle, yet deep. Characters are well-done and engaging. I really look forward to the development between the hero and heroine in the sequel, as well as seeing his father and others grow.\n- Overall, at least as far as story advancement is concerned, the difficulty level is pretty good. It may be a bit high when it comes to finding all bloodstones and such, but, overall, it's solid.\n- Gameplay is enjoyable, with multiple weapons and basic puzzles to solve.\n- Boss fights are pretty well done, though the last boss might should be a little harder. The boss before him was actually harder.\n- The game's morality is solid. No bad content of any kind (profanity, sexual content, etc.), solid view of right and wrong, no female warriors, etc.\n- The graphics are excellent, though the frame rates do seem a bit low.\n- Trading cards!\n- Lots of content. I got all of the achievements, and almost 100% completion, with about 20 hours of gameplay...Walkthroughs helped. ;-) But a better gamer than me may not need them. It will provide a lot of game time nonetheless.\n- Music is excellent.\n- Being able to progress in pretty much any order you like is nice.\n- Island designs are good.\n\nCONS\n- No jumping, excepts across ledges, and only then with "trencher boots."\n- No long-term swimming in deep water (even though he can swim indefinitely in shallow water). These two things are actually, I think, the worst design flaws of the game. They're only there because the gameplay model needs it.\n- No story after defeating the final boss. You were supposed to do something with the heroine, which I really wanted to do, but I guess that's for the sequel. :-) It would be nice if people would talk about how you defeated the monster and all that jazz.\n- Fishing might should be a tad bit easier, though, if you change up spots a lot, which is good fishing advice, anyway, it's fine.\n- Being able to control the boat would be nice.\n- There's no sequel yet! D-: So, yeah, I loved this game.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOceanhorn is well worth the money, with a good story, solid gameplay, nice graphics, and an enjoyable soundtrack. The world is immersive, never feeling dull, but like a real adventure. I highly recommend it - buy it today!\n\nThanks for reading my review; I hope you found it helpful. Have a great day, and Godspeed!","July 8, 2015","true","20.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/recommended/339200/","aGoodServant","보르케","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/","737 products in account","Stats at the Time of Reviewing\nHours on Record: 15,1\nAchievement Progress: 63/63 (100 %)\nIntroductory Note\nI will be judging Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas on its own and not as a part of the The Legend of Zelda (LOZ) series. If you are considering getting this game, you should keep in mind that it is not as well-crafted, lengthy or polished as the classic series. Does that mean that it is a bad game? No, it just means that you should adjust your expectations accordingly and keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to buy the game. If this were a review for a 3DS version of Oceanhorn, a direct comparison would be more relevant, but until we get LOZ on PC (never), I think it would be better to review the game on its own, so that is what I will do.\n\nAlso, this should be obvious, but paragraph length has no connection to the importance of the matter discussed. Some things just need more words to be explained than others.\n\nSummary\nJust let me get this out of the way first: The price is way off. 14,99€ is a fantastic deal, if we are talking about one of the main portable LOZ games like Link's Awakening or Spirit Tracks, but this is a simpler, less polished product and should have a lower price; something like 7,99€ would make more sense, so I would definitely wait for a sale or a bundle to get this.\n\nOceanhorn is an action/adventure game à la LOZ, a top-down game with a large focus on exploration and puzzles, but with a fair amount of combat as well. The combat is as you would expect: You swing the sword with one button and hold it for a charged spin attack. What you might not expect coming from LOZ is the stamina bar. In this case, it is used to do a quick, short dash, to block with your shield and to roll/jump (item required). The combat is further improved by the use of the 5 spells. These tend to often (but not always) be neglected in the LOZ series, and I am glad that it is not the case here. Oceanhorn is also very generous with item drops, perhaps a bit too generous, as you can often kill an enemy with a bomb, and then just get the bomb back; freeze and one-shot an enemy, only to get your magic back et cetera.\n\nWhen it comes to exploration, Oceanhorn provides similar block- and environment-based puzzles to the LOZ games. These often require the use of the items/spells you collect during the game; they are usually fairly easy, maybe because of the limited item/spell pool, maybe because of design choices, but some of them can provide at least a bit of a challenge; you do not just rush through them, at any rate. The game is rather short, with 3 main dungeons, but a lot of optional areas and collectibles for you to spend your time with. The main problems are related to the narrative, and I, being a mostly gameplay-centered person, do not really care much about that anyway, but I will cover it in the next paragraph, because it is still a weak part of the game, even when compared to LOZ, which is not a series known for its strong and original plots.\n\nThe Bad\nThe bad parts of Oceanhorn can really be put into three categories: Plot, writing and voice acting.\n\nThe plot is essentially as generic as it gets, much like that of LOZ titles. "Something bad needs to be stopped; go and collect these magical relics from the dungeons, retrieve the legendary weapon and confront the baddie." Of course an instrument of great importance had to be introduced in the very last moments of the game to make it more nostalgic, too. The thing that Oceanhorn does badly compared to even LOZ in this regard, though, is to add meaningful context to doing these generic things. Pulling the Master Sword is always something epic, though that might have to do with the weapon's legacy in gaming, and the classic jingle that goes with it. The legendary Coral Saber in this case, though, feels more like it was just shoved in to have a legendary weapon in the game, not because it was actually something hugely powerful required to overcome the antagonist. Now the Coral Saber is mentioned if you talk to NPCs, but frankly, the blade is just there on an island, and anyone with some simple items and the legs to jump could get to it, so it does not exactly feel very legendary. That is just one example, though; the whole time, the reason for retrieving something feels like it is just there to be a part of the game, not part of a story.\n\nThe writing is also very plain. It serves a practical purpose of giving hints, but that is about it; there is not an awful lot of character to it. That is what I would say about the voice acting, too, although in that case, they might as well have gone with only text. It sounds like they sat down, recorded once and settled, essentially, with no emotion to any of it. If it had been worse, like that of something like Two Worlds, you could at least laugh at how bad it is and it would have comedic value, but this ends up being plain, boring and just pointless. Going with the LOZ style of just using simple sounds like shouts/laughs/other signature sounds and leaving the rest to text would have made a lot more sense. Thankfully, you (almost) only really hear the voice acting in cut scenes (quite poor ones) and the father's log entries.\n\nIn a movie, book or visual novel, these flaws would have been fatal, but this is an action/exploration game and as such, I really do not care much about these things as long as the gameplay is good.\n\nThe Good\nEven though Oceanhorn looks and plays like the original style of top-down LOZ, the combat feels like a mix of that and the style of Ocarina of Time and later 3D titles. The simple one-button sword-swinging without a larger pool of sword techniques and a lack of a lock-on system, and the throwing of random objects found on the ground feel very much like something along the lines of A Link to the Past, while the more extensive use of items and magic gives the game a slower, more tactical approach like that of the 3D titles. It is overall an enjoyable mix that is neither slow nor fast, but instead a solid balance. Most items/spells can also be used effectively for both puzzles and combat, which means that few items are left on the shelf, as long as you bother using them in combat. Blocking is also used as more than a means to avoid damage, as a well-timed block will stagger the enemy and allow for retaliation, which is a welcome addition.\n\nThe exploration is also an enjoyable aspect, from the aspect of someone who likes to pick up everything everywhere and get every reward and heart container before finishing. Oceanhorn has a lot of collectibles and challenges to complete. These are what grant Steam achievements, as well, and the best part is that these challenges are tied into the XP system, meaning that achievement hunting has a direct in-game advantage. It was a good way of integrating the XP system and unlike the plot, it does not feel like it was just shoved in there for the sake of having it.\n\nThe length of the game is just right for the amount of depth it has (but not for the price). If it were much longer, it could easily outstay its welcome due to the limitations of a smaller item pool and a less than captivating plot.\n\nThe Verdict\nOverall, Oceanhorn is a solid, but flawed, gameplay experience if you are looking for a LOZ-like action/adventure experience on PC. If you have Nintendo consoles, you are really better off playing LOZ, though.

From the bombs and arrows to the comically oversized chests you find them in, Oceanhorn is a mere re-skin mod away from being the Zelda release for PC we all so desperately long for. In fact, this may well be the closest we will ever get.\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing? I don’t think so. While it shows little in the way of originality, it does a great job of reproducing the magic spark that keeps players coming back. Make no mistake – this is no cheap copy, and will easily keep you entertained for hours. It would have been great to see Cornfox & Bros. take a few more risks to give the game more of a distinct personality, but don’t let that stop you from casting off on this excellent adventure on the open seas.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/oceanhorn_monster_of_uncharted_seas/review/article-1433.html","March 17, 2015","true","14.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It's a beautiful looking game, it has a great soundtrack, and when you first play it you will love it. That being said, you quickly find out, this game is not all it appears to be, it tries to be a Zelda game, that just lacks some elements that make a Zelda game good.\n\nFirst off all the island hopping is just obnoxious, given the fact that when you hop on your boat, you don't even get to travel around the sea, you pick the island you are wanting to go to, and it just sails you there and gives you some "mini-game" that you can play to kind of give you something to do while you travel between islans.\n\nBack to the whole island hopping thing, this isn't something you do once, maybe twice, it's almost like every island has SOMETHING on another island that you have to go to and get just to progress through the first island, and sometimes you have to go to a third island, because you haven't gone through the second island yet to get the item for the first island.\n\nTo be honest, i wanted to like this game, i really did, but there was just too many things about it, or too many of a couple thigns really, that just ruined the game for me, personally this game for me, is what makes me wish most, if not all games on steam had a demo, just so i knew what i was getting before buying it.","December 29, 2015","false","12.9"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","0"

The game consists of a handful of dungeons and towns with with inter island travel very similar to Zelda Wind Waker. The game relies on arrows, throwing jars, and bombs, and even sports its own version of the master sword as an example of how similar they are.\n\nOver all score from me: 7.5/10, a worth while adventure for any Zelda style game fan.\n\nBreak down:\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nSolid graphics, again extremely "Zelda" in nature but enjoyable none the less. It has a simple cartoonish style similar to  Zelda Windwaker without the cell shading.\n\nMusic and audio: 6/10\n\nIt's not bad by any means. The music is okay, but is not memorable. It serves its purpose without adding much more. Voice acting is similar in that it gets the job done, but I did not find it memorable or overly well done.\n\nControls/Playability: 8/10\n\nI played with a controller, and I'd recommend playing it that way. Controls are responsive and natural. There were only a few times I was frustrated with the ability to aim at objects in the distance, otherwise the game will largely correct aim on your behalf.\n\nDo I recommend it:\n\nHeck yes. My biggest complaint is the length, beating it in just 8 hours of total play time without referencing any outside guides. I'd like to of have given more of such a good thing.","July 1, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And it really doesn't hide that fact at all. One of the very first things you encounter are pots you can pick up and throw in order to destroy them. There are bushes you can cut down with your sword in order to collect money, bombs and arrows and you have to explore dungeons in order to collect three pieces of a mystical item that helps you defeat the final boss. You also get a new, stronger sword and a new shield over the course of the game. The only thing it doesn't directly lift form Zelda games is the fact that there isn't a princess in this. Otherwise it's an extremely faithful homage to Link's adventures, especially Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, since it incorporates a lot of sailing as well.\n\nI think the most interesting aspect about the game is the fact that it actually came out on mobile devices first. Because while playing it on PC, I honestly wouldn't have guessed its origins. The interface is perfectly adapted for PC and it's playable with both controller and mouse and keyboard. And for a mobile game it's definitely quite a lengthy game to play. It took me on PC around 10 hours to get through and I haven't even collected all the hidden secrets in there and even for a proper PC game the length is adequate enough. The only thing it's lacking is good bossfights. There are only really six bossfights and two of those don't involve any strategies beyond holding up your shield and countering when the enemy is exposing himself. Three of the boss fights are the ones where you collect the faux-Triforce shards and then the last one at the very end. Even though you need to employ different tactics to beat them, they're not all that challenging to figure out.\n\nAnd since there's only three shards to collect, there are only really three big dungeons to explore. The other dungeons are very small and don't contain many puzzles. And speaking of the puzzles, they're mostly very easy block pushing or switch pressing puzzles. Only one of the puzzles was rather hard for me to guess, the rest is fairly straightforward.\n\nOther than that I can say that I'm very pleased with the art style. They really managed to capture the typical whimsical Zelda aesthetic. Though what elevates the experience is definitely the soundtrack. It does take a lot of inspiration from other video game composers, but it's still very enjoyable and very fitting to all your surroundings.\n\nIf there's one problem I had, at least with the beta build I got for review purposes, it's the amount of crashes I suffered. The game constantly crashed on me for no apparent reason, and it had tremendous difficulty maintaining 60 FPS on my rig which is saying a lot. Though I did notice that the crashes subsided on the day prior to release, so maybe they've fixed it. Though really, the crashes were only annoying in the sense that I had to restart the game. Because the auto-save function is pretty damn awesome in this game, I barely lost any progress while playing it, so there's that at least.\n\nIn the end, it's an obvious Zelda-clone because that's exactly what it wants to be. And for an effort from a small indie studio form Finland it's definitely not a bad one. It obviously can't hold a candle to a proper Zelda-game, but keep in mind that they're created by an army of programmers, artists and composers who basically swim in Nintendo-money.","March 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game pays homage to the Legend of Zelda series, specifically to Majora's Mask, Windwaker, and A Link to the Past. To me this game felt like it was a love letter to the LoZ series, a game that brings the same feeling with it's gameplay and great music, not on par with LoZ's music but something that you can listen to hours on end without getting annoyed. Though my hours on this version of the game says 2.1 hours, as of writing this review, I have already beaten this game on iOS and it was really fun to play on both versions each with their own good parts and bad parts.\n\nThe story for Oceanhorn is fairly straight forward, a big sea monster known as "Oceanhorn" has come to your island and your dad goes to fight against it while you sleep. As you awake you're left alone with your mother's pendant, that acts kind of like a guide, and you're off on your journey to fight against Oceanorn on your little boat, just like in Windwaker.\n\nThough this game doesn't hold your hand and guide you through the game telling you which way to go, you're encouraged to explore around the different islands that you discover and sail to. You'll find interesting inhabitants, vast dungeons and enemies with their own unique design, though still looking very similar to their LoZ counterparts.\n\nWith just your sword and shield you'll fight off interesting bosses and solve some puzzles along the way. Now onto the controls, I highly recommend playing this with a controller, you can play with a keyboard just fine it's just gonna take a lil' while to get adjusted. The controls are a little loose but nothing too bad, especially noting that this was an iOS port, and the camera controls are a bit unnecessary since there is no use for it, especially since there is very little movement when you do move it.\n\nThe game itself has you fight off rather easy bosses, where you rarely take any damage, solve fairly simple puzzles and collect four elemental powers. Thought the gameplay doesn't have anything that really jumps out at you the islands make up for it with it's rich design making them immersive and best of all fun to explore. Sailing though is a bit of a let down, clicking on where you want to go without any controls, other than the gun that you fire later on in the game, but at least the amazing soundtrack helps pass the time while you sail from one island to another.\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a great and fun game to play, though it can be a bit too easy from time to time it's still something that I would recommend for someone to buy. As of writing this review Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is on available for $16.99CAD, about $13-$14 USD, and if you're planning on buying it I would say to wait until it's on sale for $10-$12CAD\n7.5/10","March 19","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/339200/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","*Disclaimer: Review originally written for WalaWala Games[walawalagames.com].\n\nIn Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas you start your gameplay as a young man who wakes up to find his father gone; he disappeared after going in search of a monster known as Oceanhorn. With only your father's notebook and your mother's mysterious necklace as clues, you set off in his search and thus begins the adventure.\n\nOceanhorn is a very nice casual action/adventure RPG, complete with puzzles, which is quite reminiscent in many ways to Legend of Zelda. The gameplay revolves around you finding clues from NPCs, battling monsters, solving puzzles and collecting keys and treasures from the different islands around the vast world while you search for your father and discover more to the story and lore of the place. The story and lore might not be too in-depth, but it's deep enough to keep you going through the game.\n\nAs I understand it this game was first made for iOS and then ported to PC, and although the port and game play are smooth enough that you might not have realized it, you can tell it was meant to be mobile by the way certain things work - such as in moving the world map, sliding the menu and other specific touch screen features.\n\nAlthough the developers lean to the simplistic side, the game's graphics are beautiful: bright, colorful, and they feel quite alive. There is something definitely cute about all the characters you encounter and the sights are gorgeous. The way all islands are a bit different, each with their own little biome, some even with weather, adds interest to the gameplay and makes visiting each one a slightly unique experience. This spontaneous element helps keep it from being tedious.\n\nThe music was also wonderful, fitting to the world and the islands. The voice acting was a bit hit and miss, but for the most it was pretty good. I just wish the main character would have spoken, too.\n\nThe camera I found a bit annoying at first, as it's not free roam; you can only move it a little bit left and right, but I got used to it quickly and it did not hinder my enjoyment in the end. The camera follows you during boss battles too, which was both extremely helpful (as it did not get in my way), and extremely dizzying when my main strategy was “back up in circles and wait for an opening”.\n\nHaving tried both ways I can definitely say that the game plays a lot better with a controller, still, I used my keyboard through most of my play through without any major issues. The key distribution is decent enough and, if I’m not mistaken, you were able to rebind certain keys.\n\nStarting up the game for the first time I could see the menu was simplistic, which was good and fitting for the game; but I was not overly pleased with the windowed mode option. The only option available was "Windowed (borderless)", which was... still defaulting to full screen as I could not even change the resolution for it (but I could change the resolution for full screen). However, I read the developers were working on this. I'll be happy to see the option to use regular windowed mode to play it, hopefully in different resolutions.\n\nThe world, as I already mentioned, is quite large. You get several islands to explore, but the islands must be unlocked first by talking to NPCs. If you're not paying much attention to what they say, it'll be easy for you to get a bit lost on which of two (or more) options you're supposed to go to first in order to follow the main story line; still, at most you'll need to do some backtracking. The game has a few tutorial bits (conveyed to you through little signs and pop ups), yet some things were still learn-as-you-go, such as how to deal with the world map.\n\n\nTo travel from island to island you sail a ship. I quite liked the idea of this initially - there'll be monsters to shoot at and boxes to sink. Once more I was reminded of Zelda with this. The first couple of trips are quite nice, however, it soon becomes a bit bothersome to go from island to island, even once your ship gets upgraded to sail faster. I think it might have been much more entertaining if we'd been able to steer the ship ourselves (auto-pathing and steering both as options would have been fantastic!). This would have made it more interactive than just sitting there and shooting at things. It's not much of a challenge to get to your destination though, just like the majority of puzzles are not much of a challenge either. They're good, but they're simple: perfect for a casual gamer such as me. Yet if you're into hard, challenging puzzles, you might find oceanhorn a bit disappointing.\n\nInteracting with items was fun: everything that could be hit or bumped into would wobble, which I found was super cute. You could even bump into people (as opposed to getting stuck by running into them), a little detail that I quite love in games. The way interaction with picking objects worked though was a bit annoying, since the attack button would suddenly serve the function of picking and tossing an object if you were near it; thus, if you were in the middle of slashing your sword away at an enemy and walked by a rock, you would end up getting the rock instead and thus getting hit by the enemy. That you could not walk off large cliffs to your early death was also quite nice and a little feature I was thankful for more than once. Be careful if you choose to go swimming in the ocean, though, as your character will quickly run out of stamina and drown.\n\nThe fighting system was quite easy to get a handle of, and I found myself thankful for the little auto-target while defending, at least most the times. Sometimes it would lock me into the wrong target though and leave me open to a second attacker I was more interested in defending myself from. I liked the way the character leveled up, but it was a bit odd that his leveling did not modify the way his hits affected monsters. Stuff that took 3 hits to kill would still take three hits on level 1 or level 5. It wasn't too troublesome as the enemies are easy to defeat, but I thought it was a bit odd. Even though you can explore the islands, the game is rather linear, needing some interactions to happen first before you can unlock others.\n\nThe mini-bosses require a bit of strategy, but are also not overly challenging once you get the handle on them. Once again this makes it good for casual gamers and the younger crowd, but those seeking challenges might not have as much fun with it. In whole, the game offers you just about 10 hours of gameplay to finish it without any side-questing or aimless exploring, and some 4-6 hours more if you’re a completionist.\n\nOceanhorn plays quite nicely in older PCs and I kind of like the way things spawn on your screen as you come closer to them, slowly popping into the map with their little bouncy animation. It adds to the overall cartoony cuteness of the game. It also helps that it has an extremely small size (at ~380mb) so it's quick to install and start playing it.\n\nI heard some talk about crashes and bugs, but to be honest I did not experience any such. At most I experienced a bit of lag when video sections began or ended, but that was about it and it and it did not occur all the time. The game was truly fun and a delight to play. If you’re looking for a relaxing, casual RPG, I definitely recommend it!","July 8, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I remember having this on my iPad and giving up because it was too frustrating to try to  play with them, then coming on here and having bosses that'd taken multiple attempts go down in a single shot because I wasn't cursing at the little directional pad on my touch screen for ignoring my thumb completely.\n\nSo is it worth it?

Since there are few Zelda clones, this game became quite overrated by many people (maybe by fans of the Zelda franchise).

Some "puzzles" are illogical and make no sense: sometimes you are stuck and you are expected to put a bomb on some wall which is not cracked and seems like a normal wall (how the hell is one supposed to guess that without reading a walkthrough?). The battle sistem is repetive since the enemies are the typical ones (again, no innovation), and the hero moves quite slow. The graphics are cool (it is probably the only good thing of this game). IMHO, the story is boring. Of course, the NPCs of the game have zero charisma and no charm, as the game itself.\n\nTo summarize, Oceanhorn is a very boring game, with cool graphics but with bad puzzles, bad combat system, bad story, and no innovation. This is just the opposite of a good Zelda-like game, recommended only for casual gamers that do not expect too much of a game.","May 15","false","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda, and Zelda-likes, this is very much welcomed to my library.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is pretty much Wind Waker, with a touch of Minecraft inspired cubic layouts.\n\nGameplay wise, there is a very simple two button combat system. Your input options change dynamically as you approach objects you can interact with, which can work very well. Managing items is simple and forgiving; you're given more inputs for quick access than I've seen in most Zelda titles.\n\nWhile the puzzles are mostly tried and true block and button puzzles, its a great trip back to nostalgia lane and leaves me wanting more modern releases from this genre.\n\nUnlike other games of it's genre, there's a levelling system to Oceanhorn. Your character gains experiences through defeating monsters and completing specific goals. Then, through the adventurers guild, you are given access to different weapons and features in the game. This is a great way to tie progress to your regular combat and accomplishments throughout the game.\n\nCornfox and Bros have done a convincing and enjoyable unique recreation of the travel based Zeldas. I'm a huge fan of this so far, and I can't wait to see what else it has to offer.\n","March 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

But the developer of Oceanhorn seam to lack a understandig of why Zelda is a good game. They copy mechanics and implement them in on of the worst ways I have ever seen.\n\nMy favorit example would be the bombs, that can be used in combat or to destroy walls. Zelda introduces bombs in a logical way and shows the player different ways of using them. Oceanhorn on the other hand gifs you said bombs and explains nothing. Of course if you know Zelda you will also know that you can destroy walls, they're clearly damaged and indicate that an explosion would destroy them. In Oceanhorn there is never a clear indication and it's more guessing than knowing. Rarly will you see a small part of an staircase or similiar to guide you the way.\n\nI could make these examples for every design choice in Oceanhorn from the painfully fishing to the horrible level structure.\n\nThe only good things about Oceanhorn are the some what decent soundtrack and the visuals. (Although the blocky style often makes the gameplay worse than it should be)\n\nIf you really want to play this game i would recommend to wait for a good offer on a sale.

It's an incredibly well done Zelda clone(circa Link to the Past) with a healthy dose of the elevation-based problem solving from the classic Genesis adventure Landstalker. The game takes all it can from Zelda right down to the pieces of heart collectibles and block pushing puzzles to the simplistic but effective hack and slash combat. Heck, even the world map is itself a total Windwaker copycat(however nowhere near as tedious or annoying).\n\nIt adds it's own features here and there such as a leveling system, quests and a tad more open exploration than certain Zelda titles, and a more involved story but it's part and parcel a huge homage to the trend setting franchise. In no way is that a knock to the game's character because it's all done nearly as well as an indie dev could do so.\n\nThe music is another feature that struck me as well. It's another high quality aspect of an already high quality product, even if it sounds slightly Zelda-ish at times (when you first leave your house, you'll instantly get the feeling you've been here before).\n\nIf you're someone who loves Zelda or hack and slash adventures in general, you can't go wrong with picking this game up. It would seem so far that it's going to be at least a solid 20-30 hours to fully complete also, possibly more so it's totally worth the price for a game that even begins to touch the greatness that is Zelda.","March 20, 2015","true","38.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It accurately compares itself to the “Legend of Zelda” titles and is definitely reminiscent of the core gameplay in that series. The interesting part however comes from the game being on mobile devices and PC, whereas Nintendo has so far only released Zelda games on their own consoles. “Oceanhorn” attempts to tap into a niche, and does it fairly well, despite lacking the polish that Nintendo fans have come to expect.\n\nThe game is a mostly isometric dungeon crawler game akin to Zelda games. Using a sword and shield, along with various items unlocked through the game, the goal is to progress through various dungeons and reach the boss of each area. At times this is much easier said than done, as the level layouts can be a bit confusing at times. The levels themselves however look fantastic, and generally speaking the game’s graphical quality is up to the standard of the Zelda games, just with a bit less bloom which is very welcome.\n\nIn fairness to the game, as of yet I haven’t run into any major issues that have stopped me from progressing or caused me to wonder what exactly the developer was thinking, however my problems with the game arise from a series of small things that are missing. The easiest way to describe it is unfortunately just to reiterate the first paragraph; the game lacks polish in many areas.\n\nThe graphics of the game, as previously mentioned are pretty great, the game genuinely looks gorgeous, especially the water used to sail between islands. However some texture glitches and clipping can stand out while trying to solve a puzzle, and the isometric viewpoint can be a bit of a problem at times even with an adjustable camera. The game’s combat is generally solid, however hitbox issues can make fighting a bit unsatisfying, and the music sits comfortably in between being great and defining the landscape as Zelda games use their soundtrack, and being fairly mediocre. I never found reason to complain, but unlike some other games in recent memory, it never left me wanting a soundtrack to slap on my phone.\n\nHowever, a lot of the issues I’ve raised with this game are present in others like it, and are usually forgivable, however for something that compares itself to a Zelda game, it’s hard to not judge it in the same vein as those titles. That said, this review has been a bit harsh so far -- while the game definitely lacks the polish of Zelda titles, it brings some of its own traits to the table which add to the game.\n\nAn experience system and a sprint function without having to wait to unlock the Pegasus Boots is likely the biggest improvement, as being able to zip around places you’ve already been through means hopping right back into a dungeon is always just a couple seconds away. The challenges offer experience as a reward and can add some interesting depth to the game, assuming it’s not a simple one like breaking several pots, something Zelda fans were going to do anyway.\n\nOverall, the game does a decent job at mimicking the Zelda series, but as stated before multiple times, the lack of polish can stand out and may put some people off from the title. That’s unfortunate, because the game is generally enjoyable. It makes some legitimate improvements to the formula of Zelda titles, it’s just hard to not look at some aspects of the game and wish the developers had a bit more experience behind them so they could smooth out the rough bits. That said, it’s an enjoyable experience that at the least attempts to shake things up a bit.\n\n3/5","May 17, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Throwing is still ok because you can direct your throws with the wasd keys.\n\nMusic is nice, fits the atmosphere of the game, but i noticed a bit of repetition where the same theme was used for different similar environments. To be expected i suppose.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the longer i play, the more it begins to lag. Fortunately the game saves between rooms, and if i feel a lag coming on, i just close the game and reopen it, that seems to reset the memory. Saved games pick up where you left off, either at a doorway or save point.\n\nFirst boss wasn't challenging, and actually glitched, running into a corner instead of moving around the room or attacking. This creature was reused as a general monster later, so i don't think it was supposed to be as big a deal as what i anticipate will come later.\n\nBoat travels are nice. You don't control the boat direction like in Wind Waker, but instead point out your destination on the map and it auto routes you to it, and after going up a few levels you get a gun for the boat and can then shoot crates and barrels, floating mines, and "octorocks" that are in the way. Fun little minigame that breaks the pace of the dungeon crawling and exploration.\n\nI love the fact that, once you get bombs, you can really start going crazy with the combat and exploration. Only 5 bombs at first, but as you level up you can carry more. If there are visual clues about bombable walls, i haven't noticed any. I bombed a wall to see if it opened a path to a chest i couldn't reach, and it did, but noticed no discoloring, blocks, or cracks to indicate i could do so. This is oldschool wall bombing at it's finest.\n\nGot it on sale for 8.99, and would strongly recommend this game at that price. Even for the normal price at around 15 dollars it is still a nice game.\n\nIf devs could fix the issues causing lag and my disappearing pointer, i'd give this at least a 9/10, as it is, i'll say 7.5/10\n\nIf you're a fan of the 2D Zelda series, Alundra, Landstalker, Light Crusader, or even Neutopia, give this game a try, you won't be disappointed!","May 25, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But, there is still fun to be had!\n\nHeavily inspired by Link/Zelda games Oceanhorn slowly, eventually, groggily delivers an adventure. It doesn't quite get close to Link but the inspiration is there. The early parts of the games feel like if you injected Link with horse tranquilizers and fed him 50 muscle relaxers and gave him toddler toys as a quest. The game just never decides it's identity. And I think it struggles at that, at least in part, because of it being a mobile/tablet port. But then by the second half it evolves to a game with some average difficulty. Its just a very broken flow and stride. A stride that is always a few steps too slow for my liking.\n\nThe world and story is complete though. There's a fun adventure to be had. The pacing, or lack there of, pushed me into wandering and grinding. I'm not big on arbitrary video game achievements or trophies but going for them in this game majorly contributed to my fun factor. What you get out is what you put in with Oceanhorn. You have to make a concerted effort with the game, but I think it was worth it.\n\nThere's more I could complain and nitpick about too. The fishing system is absolutely silly. The "gun" on the boat should've just been mounted to explain why you don't get to have it anywhere else. The boat travel in general could've had more variety. Blah blah blah. The point is, the game has issues. But never did I consider quitting or did they ruin my day. Casual controller game.\n\nSwords, bombs, arrows, keys, treasure chests, and baddies! There's fun to be had if you want it.","April 17","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bt1295/recommended/339200/","bt1295","Bill (Coppershoe)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bt1295/","722 products in account","This is poorly written love letter to the Zelda series.  The games takes all the best pieces from our favorite Zelda games and alters them just enough to make the game both nostalgic and fun, yet unneccessarily frustrating.\n\nThe first noticible difference is the graphical style of this game, which looks to be tiered.  By that I mean it is made out of blocks or little plateaus.  These plateaus can present neat exploration challenges, because the player needs to access and fall from them to get bonus items.  But, the player cannot rotate the camera around them.  Yes, there is a little wiggle room with the camera, but it's pretty static.  This presents problems when an enemy is behind one of these plateaus.\n\nThe next major problem with the game is level design, which is compounded by these plateaus.  The game has a constant mini-map up in the lower right corner of the screen, but when moving through box-maze after box-maze, it's useless.  The player will ultimately find it easier to simply memorize his path than use the mini map.  Levels and dungeons also become frustrating because navigating through them becomes cumbersome, since they are made up of plateaus and no camera.  Furthermore, they can become just downright confusing.  There are too many branches which just lead the player around in circles and never really direct the player on a path.\n\nThis brings up the general pacing of the game.  Like Windwaker, the games is broken up into tons of small islands.  But it is never clear where to go.  When the player first leaves the tutorial island and makes it to a town, a sign-post says to explore each new island as the player learns about them!  Good advice.  Except, when exploring the town island, the player is given the location of no less than three new islands to explore!  Two out of three of them are dead ends until you choose to explore the correct island and get necessary items.  This was just poorly designed.\n\nThat said, this is a game has its own identity.  The combat feels different than Zelda games, and although not wildly different, it's enough to make it stand on its own.  The shield should always be up, and hits eat away at a stamina bar which replenishes when down or not in combat, similar to Dark Souls, although that's the only comparison I can make.\n\nThe graphics are different from other Zelda titles, and I find them to be pleasant.  The zones, however, were just such rip-offs from Zelda that I found it a bit distracting at times.  Ultimately, however, I tended to look at the game as it's own game rather than a copy.  Superfans of Zelda might not be able to do that.\n\nUltimately, if you were a fan of the SNES Zelda and Gamecube/Wii-U Windwaker, this game should hit a nostalgic high point for you.  It's got most of the great elements of those two games, but just bundled in a sub-par game-pace and level-design.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it with the caveats I've mentioned, especially since it is cheap.  It's aggravating, but it's bold in how it takes on a giant and tries to take on the juggernaut.  It'll certainly strike a nerve with the 30-somthing crowd.","August 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The ocean travel is boring (and you do a *lot* of it); it's like Wind Waker without the sense of freedom and exploration, while giving you more random stuff to shoot.  The clincher was that there are some annoying bugs; you often have to push boxes into spike pits so that you can walk over the pit.  Unfortunately, sometimes the game will still let you fall into the pit, right through the box that you pushed into it.  You have nothing to do but wait to die, and then wait for all of your resurection pots to get used up (since you res in the place you died) so that you can respawn at a save point.  It's happened to me enough times that I've given up on the game, and so I'm not recommending it.","March 19","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For most enemies, you only have to hit and parry. There is only two exceptions. One were you need to parry and shoot from afar and one were you first need to use a spell for destroy some sort of shield. Even the bosses aren't challenging at all. In many games, phases are added to boss so you have to get a patern and use it against the boss to defeat it. Here, you don't have to pay attention to the patern, you only have to see if it's following you or not. And the "phases" are in fact the exact same patern that repeat faster.\n\nPuzzles are dull\nHonestly ... I finished the game in ten hours, literally watching tv at the same time. And i didn't focused on the game.\nThe puzzles are so easy. Push this and you succeed. Walk on this and you suceed. Walk on this and walk quickly here and you suceed. That all. I know it's not easy making puzzles. I make some for passing time. But the only thing i ask is some intricacy. You finish a puzzle to pass a room and continue until you find an other room with a puzzle. For example, on easy puzzle is asking to push buttons in a certain order, this order gived by hints in the level.\nSome time i learned there was hints to puzzle i didn't even know were puzzle.\n\nI can't help have the feelings that the princess of fish people ( don't remember their name) and fish people themselves are some bad  plagiarism of zelda. Even if it was intended to be a tribute, i don't think it's "healthy" for the game and the gamers to see almost the same design between two characters ( and species of two different games.\n\nGoods points are : good soundtracks and good graphics (until you watch a cutscene) but this don't make a game.\nThe story is not bad. It feels like, beside some incredibly "borderline inspirations", there is some background and some interesting furthermore.\n\nWell, I don't recommend this game (or buy it for a low price) but if the developers want to make a number two and want to improve what the game is lacking, i'll be glad to buy the second opus.","March 20","false","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What we get instead is a stroll through several islands, hunt for collectibles and a story that barely does anything.\n\nLet's start with the last on that list - while not overly complicated, and often obvious with its revelations/suggestions, the story of the game seems like an excuse thrown together without much thinking. The motivations and some connections are very sketchy, to the point where they don't get any explanation at all. Add to the fact that there is no real closure, the start and the end of the story feel almost random and... you have something that lives in the background, but that's about it. The big discrepancies in the performance of voice actors don't help - some of them sound like they just couldn't care for a single moment.\nUnless we count shoe-horned insinuations of romantic interest and the like, which were as unnecessary and clunkily handed as possible.\n\nCollectible hunt is actually fun, if you are after completing your games 100%, then this is a thing for you. There is plenty of exploring, bombing, jumping and otherwise figuring out how to get to that elusive last blood gem or chest. Coupled with the fact that the labyrinthine, complicated structure of the islands makes it interesting to poke your nose in every corner - it works well.\nWhich can't be exactly said about the puzzles, as they are divided into two categories, as far as I am concerned - relatively easy ones and those you will frown at because they are timed. Why would the latter be a problem? Because of how some of the control scheme works. The biggest offender here are Trencher Boots. For reasons I cannot fathom, aside from their primary function of jumping gaps (Zelda's ladder basically) they also have a roll function, which doubles the role of the dash the character has from the very beginning. Now, this roll can cause you to fall down from low-height platforms when you would rather jump from one to another, because both of these functions are tied to one button and which goes off is dependant on your position. And when you have a timed puzzle, you want to cut corners.\nThere are several more control gripes like that - throwing objects can be finicky, sword combat doesn't feel all too nice either. Bow has the same issues as throwing object which means... you will be okay, but sometimes it takes a wild guess whether you can hit something at all, and times when you will waste three arrows because you weren't just precise enough with turning your character around will happen.\n\nAll the issues and positives combined, Oceanhorn is... okay. You will probably enjoy yourself, spend 10-20 hours in it, then put back onto the virtual shelf. And forget about it, because what this game lacks the most, is anything that would make it leave a mark on your memories.\nI would gladly give this game a neutral review if I could, but as it stands, a thumbs down is in order. Because the game isn't bad, but it is not worth recommending either.","March 20","false","19.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/recommended/339200/","lord-zor","Zor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/","463 products in account","The short of it is that if you greatly enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker(or games like it), and you have a ton of free time on your hands, than you should give this game a chance. Otherwise, if you didn't, don't have that much time, or have access to Wind Waker, than you are better off skipping this game (and just playing Wind Waker instead).\n\nThe long of it is that this game is a mediocre adventure game with some charming elements to it, but lacks polish. Which is very disappointing since it is easy to see how this game could have been much better, had they just done a little bit more.  The lack of polish in this game is shown in nearly every part of it, but the two that I think best display it are these.\n\nFirst, the game has a problem with visual cues, or to be more exact, it sometimes doesn't display any, or displays the wrong ones.  This happens at several places throughout the game, for example, sometimes there are floor tiles in a object moving puzzle section that will use the same texture as the border tiles, even though, you can slide things onto them. Not only is this confusing, but it is also very frustrating, since the solution ends up being very simple.  This visual inconsistence is bizarre, since at times it seems like it was done intentional. Like they wonder why no one else does this kind of thing (using the same texture for both a valid and invalid movement space) before, and they figure that they would.  Also, there a part in the game where the player run across a spiked gate. Not only does this looks goofy, but it doesn't make sense, since throughout the game spikes are used as a hazard.  Except in this one case, where it is the intended path.  These visual cue issues don't break the game, but they do happen enough to be a problem, which is disappointing, since they seem like they would be easy to fix.\n\nSecond, most of the game's puzzles, aren't challenging and feel meaningless, since they are just one step. For example, some time you'll run into a barred gateway, and to get past this gateway, all you have to do is use a switch. And most of the time the switch itself is within 20 feet of the gateway with nothing blocking you from using it. Other times you'll run into a pathway that splits into 2. Down one path is a locked door, and down the other is the key for that locked door. It is this simplistic design that makes most of the game's content feel shallow. There are no a-ha moments, no sense of achievement, and really nothing remarkable about running into a puzzle and then spending 5 seconds to get through it. In the end it feels like they have all the pieces that are used to make a puzzle, but missed the point of why gamers like to solve them.\n\nOverall Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a mediocre adventure game. It can be fun at times, but it usually isn't. The game has a decent foundation, but it execution of those ideas is lacking.  The game as is, isn't worth it, but I found its potential to be interesting.","March 15","false","9.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Twilight Princess has some satisfying dodging and back-stabbing combat, this game has you fighting enemies that can be kept away by simply clicking on them steadily.\n\nBut at least the lawn-mowing aspect is alive and well!","March 16","false","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadaghram/recommended/339200/","Deadaghram","Deadaghram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadaghram/","133 products in account","Blah blah Zelda Blah Blah\n\nOceanhorn takes place in an archipelago inhabited by several sentient races. From fish dudes to eagle people. From several types of humans to even machines. Also the occasional demon. There's also ghosts in the postgame dungeon. Like all video games, it starts out peacefully but everything turns to hell and some random kid with a destiny has to save the world. To do that, you hunt an ancient relic from the technologically advanced past named Oceanhorn but there's a twist...which I'll save for those who play the game.\n\nThe main character is the aptly named Main Character (or Hero). At the start of the game, his father writes a note saying how his (the father's) destiny is linked to Oceanhorn, which also means the Hero's destiny is too because that's how video games work). He then goes to attack a giant robotic crab. The Hero then wakes up on a different island inhabited by one guy named Hermit who sends you on your way to avenge your father and save the world. All the while a Black Boat stalks you from just off screen except when plot demands otherwise.\n\nThe game then continues like all action games: you visit scenic locals; a desert, a dense forest, some ruins, a quaint little town, a floating rock, etc. and you upgrade your gear, learn to use magic, and learn just how special you are because your parents are doubly special. Once in a while, you fish or throw plants at the head of their gardener/Hero's love interest because you (as the player) are a sociopath.\n\nThe controls are exceptional for a game that was originally an iOS game – at least with an X-box controller. The only issue that can, and totally will, happen is how easy it is to fall off a ledge and have to redo entire sections of dungeons again. It's not game breaking but it can be annoying having to back track several screens because you were pushed off a small walkway or you just got to close to pick something up or to avoid another thing. It's great that being able to jump down ledges is a thing – it allows for a bit of a different type of exploration – but it's frustrating to no end when you've done it too many times. Other than that, combat is fairly fluid. Arrows and magic go where you send them and there are never too many enemies on screen to make one have to panic. The puzzle aspects don't interfere with combat when they're intermingled (meaning boss battles).\n\nSadly, the plot isn't all there. I'm not saying there are any plotholes but some of it just feels rushed and just didn't feel deep to me. A random girl suddenly being your love interest is the most obvious one. It's not a main plot in the story so it might just be something that bothered me slightly and you might be totally fine with it. The game is all narrative which, is fine, but it's easy to miss things or important information can be easily forgetten. For example, if you don't talk to the correct people or find certain bottles then certain side quests aren't going to be available to you. Nothing story related is missable but you might not get to full health, arrow/bomb capacity, or challenge completion (if you're into that though, you're probably using a guide). The game keeps going after you beat the main boss so even then, you can go back and find what you want to. Nothing is permanently missable. Some of this might just be mobile limitations that unfortunately show in this PC port. I don't do a lot of mobile gaming so I'm not sure what is and what isn't great.\n\nMusic is a very subjective subject but I can say that I found it to be perfect. It fits the mood and helps provide immersion. Nobuo Uematsu wrote a track for the OST so that's all you really need to know. I like to add official sources where one can preview it so here's a link.\nYoutube\n\nThis is Cornfox & Bros first RPG (and second game after a top-down Carmageddon/Twisted Metal style remake – Death Rally) and these Finnish developers already have my attention. I'm looking forward to anything they might release in the future. Zelda games don't come out very often so go pick this up if you're feeling a lull or just want a short, fun adventure. $15 might be a little too steep for some but remember, holidays and summers are always just around the corner.","December 11, 2015","true","16.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

More specifically, there are just too many inconsistencies with the gameplay and visuals. Some players may ignore these issues considering it’s an indie game but it's apparent that several of them are due to sheer laziness and that's something I can't forgive.\n\nI'll give you an example. The first issue I spotted, even from the trailer, is that the animations are simply stiff. The main character's idle animation is a big offender here. This is because almost all of the animations use a linear transition which creates a really rigid and unnatural feel. This can be solved with easement scaling and a little bit of hand-crafting. Basically the animators were lazy. A minor issue, but the game is FULL of  these minor issues and it's incredibly abrasive after a while.\n\nAt one point I fell down a "hole" that I thought was suppose to be the entrance of a cave. My character stopped shortly after falling only few feet, landing on solid ground.  His head bobbed in his rigid little idle animation for a brief moment. I thought that maybe I was mistaken about it being a cave entrance but then the game transitioned into another scene where my character was falling from a cave ceiling. I then realized that the developers simply made the entrance hole too shallow and this broke the illusion of actually falling through it. When I later got back out of the cave the grass that had grown over the entrance when it was undiscovered was there again, floating in mid-air. See what I mean by lazy?\n\nAnother huge problem is the absolutely shameless use of invisible walls. Many games use invisible walls but it's pretty hard to forgive in this case. You can only walk off ledges in very specific places and it's not nearly as obvious as it should be. In fact it's almost arbitrary. It just feels weird trying to constantly mime your way off a short ledge.\n\nThe allusion to the Zelda series can't just be called inspiration. It's actually a little offensive how much they rely on established Zelda mechanics. For example there are pieces of heart and they work pretty much like you would expect them to. You find them in random chests and you need exactly four of them to create a heart container. I mean, they are literally called "Pieces of Heart". Not convinced? There are crustacean-like enemies that shoot projectiles at you but dig into the ground when you come near them. You defeat them by shielding their projectiles which bounce back at them. I'm not even kidding.\n\nThe intent of copying Zelda mechanics are so desperate and obvious that the game should be called "Shoehorn". Exploration is based around the open-ocean feeling of Wind Waker, for instance. That itself isn't a bad thing but they copied the mechanic in the most superficial way possible. Instead of having any sort of interaction with the actual sailing of your ship, you simply click your destination and then watch as your tiny little vessel coasts its way along the featureless ocean at a snail's pace. This may have been somewhat scenic if it weren't for the main character looking around like a dork with his robot movements I feel like any time a game makes me want to get up and make a sandwich instead of actually playing is a huge red flag. I'm sure some players find this relaxing but for the less patient of us, an option to skip this would have been nice.\n\nI think the real thing that bothers me is that I really had high expectations from the game but it feels more like a Zelda cash-in than a love letter. There may be in fact a real gem under here, but I certainly didn't feel the need to find it.","April 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The game seemed like it would be better if the camera was free or if it was 2D. Moving around just felt wrong in this and a large part of my dissatisfaction in the game came from not being able to see as much as I would have liked which caused the combat and exploration to suffer.\n\nThis sounds like bashing the game a lot, and it is, but it was still a fun game. It is built off of a formula that is fundamentally satisfying, but it doesn't really excel in any aspect. It's more or less good in most regards, but great in none. I would recommend this if you are a fan of the Zelda series, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.","May 8","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/339200/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nThe premise behind Oceanhorn's story is something you have probably seen a hundred times before, as the story kicks off with the hero's father leaving to save the world, only to put you in control of the hero with a quest to find your father and help him defeat Oceanhorn moments after. From there onward you'll experience an entire Zelda-like adventure, looking for the location and a way to defeat Oceanhorn and rescue your father. There is always something new to discover, but Oceanhorn's biggest miss is when you realize that all your discovery excitement that builds up as you move forward quickly goes back to zero once you realize that there are few things to experience besides the main story. There are sixteen different islands to visit, mostly serving as an essential part to the storyline, but only a few of those have gameplay value to encourage a full exploration such as Tikarel which serves as the main town where you can buy items and take on new quests. Unfortunately, the rest of many are only a one-time visit deal, as you can finish everything there is to see and experience in less than 15 minutes and never return to that island again. There are some activities such as finishing and completing the different challenges that might add a bit of variety, but even those feel repetitive and pretty basic to any RPG. The story itself has nothing much to offer as you can probably guess how it's all going to end from the very beginning, but nevertheless, the journey all the way to the final island is an enjoyable ride if you're willing to look past the repetitiveness and basic concepts.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGameplay\nNot only does Oceanhorn feel like a Zelda game, but it plays like one too; if you have played a Zelda game before the formula will seem very familiar to you: make your way to that dungeon, defeat the boss in order to obtain the item you need, return to town to gather more information about your next quest and repeat until you get to the end. Navigation is done via a Wind Waker-like boat mechanic that allows you to travel from one island to the next one using your boat, but there are very few things to do on sea, as the only thing to keep you preoccupied while you reach your next destination are the barrels and mines that randomly pop in front of you as you sail, but after a while, even those start to become more annoying than fun, as the whole concept becomes repetitive and unrewarding. On land, the gameplay is pretty basic, as you only have a few spells at your disposal and your sword attacks, but once you realize that some spells are only useful once for the boss battle that they were designed for, the whole adventure will only become more and more repetitive. There are only a few enemies that you will encounter throughout your adventures, most of which can be defeated with basic sword attacks that require no strategy at all, while the boss battles vary in quality, as some of them feel intelligent and rewarding, while others are just a very long game of poke-poke-hit. Apart from the main quest itself, there are few things to keep you occupied in your adventures and while locating all of the bloodstones feels rewarding in the end, that reward will probably come in too late as you would've already finished the game by then.\nRating: 7\n\nGraphics\nNot only does Oceanhorn feel like a Zelda game, but it plays like one too; if you have played a Zelda game before the formula will seem very familiar to you: make your way to that dungeon, defeat the boss in order to obtain the item you need, return to town to gather more information about your next quest and repeat until you get to the end.

The effects are enough to justify the means, but the voice acting is absent, not that the game would necessarily need it since the quests instructions are pretty clearly delivered via text dialogue, but it would've been nice to have that option, at least for the main cutscenes to make the whole missing father story more personal.\nRating: 7.5\n\nExtras\nYou can finish the whole game within 10 hours, add a few more if you're willing to revisit every island in order to gather all the bloodstones and complete all the challenges, but that's pretty much all of it, and since some skills are required to access a few areas, you can't complete everything in your visit visit, so you will have to deal with the repetitiveness of the main story first and then move on to the repetitiveness of the sidequests.\nRating: 7\n\nVerdict\nIt's impossible to deny the fact that Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a Zelda clone since it feels, plays and looks like a game in the Zelda series, but it's a pretty decent one, so if you liked Zelda and want more of it, Oceanhorn might prove to be an entertaining adventure for you. The game does come with its flaws and lack of content, but in the end it will prove out to be an adventure worth playing.\nRating Overall: 7.1\n\nCheck out the full review and more about Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=383","May 14","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm having a blast.\n\nedit:\nSince my 'review' above is getting downvoted, I asume you want to here more... so:\n\nThis game is meant for zelda fans who cant  wait 5 years to play a new chapter.  This is not an easy game type to imitate, therefore we dont have many(any?) games like this.\n\nIt's NOT a clone.  It doesnt infrenge on copyrights.  I love zelda and would be one of the first to cry foul if it was a rip off.  I'm happy to report its not.  This game has it's own personality.\n\nIn short, if you like zelda then GET IT, if you've never played zelda then go buy a nintendo.\n\nThe following is based on 15 hours of game play and I'm maybe 50% through the game.\n---\n\nI will start with the differences from zelda:\n1) locked camera: think Diablo.   2.5D-ish, very little ability to look around.\n2) blocky world, think minecraft.  Very well designed but can get repetitive and a bit easy to forget.\n3) No lock on targeting, you have to turn and face enimies to fight.\n\nSimilarities:\n1) multiple islands, almost all with dungeons below ground\n2) multiple spells, items, weapons, etc. earned as you go.\n3) varied enimies and boss and mini boss battles\n4) pretty epic story and characters. I didn't expect this part to be as good as it is.\n\nPROS:\ngreat graphics , animations, sound and music. story text is well written.\ndifferent areas and dungeons are very well layed out, quite intricate and detailed.\nthe story and characters make sense and everything progresses with a good pace.\ncombat works well.\nvery clean inventory screen.\n\nCONS:\nnone, I really didn't expect this game to be as good as it is or come as close to a zelda experience as it does.\n\nMINOR GRIPES:\nno full screen map, mini map is hard to read.  I mean, roaches showing up as blue dots? why?\nno free look / locked cam\nenimies are too easy, puzzles have been to simillar and easy, too much block pushing\nyou can get lost, take this to who?\nsailing is on-rails mini-game, pick your destination island and shoot stuff on the way\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nFishing was done really well, actually almost everything the designers put in the game is done really well.  Very high standards of quality.  This game is fun.  I recomend it if you like zelda.\n\n(I'll edit further if things change)","March 18, 2015","true","24.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you're a Zelda fan who's thirsty for adventure, look no further. For a port of a mobile game, Oceanhorn manages to look pretty. The visuals have been polished and everything looks shiny and new, but there are some framerate problems. The art style is pretty much ripped from The Wind Waker, so fans should feel right at home. Speaking of The Wind Waker, you get a boat! This is how you travel from island to island. Unfortunately, your boat doesn't talk and you can't steer it yourself. Traveling between islands is an on-rails affair, but there are enemies to keep you on your toes and driftwood to be smashed for the loot it contains. There's also a leveling system that basically replaces bigger quivers and bomb bags from the Zelda franchise. You gain experience from slaying baddies and attaining in-game achievements, which can force you to backtrack but do add to the longetivity of your adventure. Puzzles are a bit on the easy side and some items are a bit too familiar, but why fix gameplay that isn't broken? If you're a Zelda fan, Oceanhorn is a must-have for your Steam library.\n\n+ Gameplay is immediately familiar\n+ Environments are lovely, varied, and don't overstay their welcome\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n- Framerate issues\n- Controls could be tighter\n- Not being able to sail the ocean yourself is a bit of a bummer","March 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you've played any Zelda before, it should be pretty intuitive then. For the price, it's quite good and fair amount of gameplay. The basic premise is to go around to each island and explore and find treasure/items and on some islands, there are dungeons or caves to explore too. The puzzles never get too difficult that you feel completely stuck as the signs offer pretty good hints what to do. The combat is pretty good although aiming can be a bit frustrating. While this was originally an iOS game, it was remastered for the PC and the graphics and the music are decent enough for the price.\n\nThe biggest negative I have towards the game is that there are places where you can get trapped and are forced to restart from your last save. By "trapped", I mean if you fall down into a hole, you may not be able to get out due to objects blocking your way.

Maybe not the longest game, but definitly worth picking up for everyone who calls himself a Zelda fan, consider doing it during a sale and you wont regret it!","February 7","true","11.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sailing from island to island looks great the first time, but when there is nothing else to do it's just tedious. In fact once you get over the nostalgia of the music and the game mechanics, you realise that the levels might be graphically themed, but they're ever so samey. Some of the Super Nintendo titles are a lot more engaging than this one. I'm not saying it is terrible, but it could have been better with some better level design. There are other similar games that don't try as hard as this one and still have room for lots of innovation in their gameplay. Hack 'n Slash, for example, entertained me for hours longer than this one.","March 17","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But what game nowadays, hell, what piece of art or work doesn't draw inspiration from SOMEWHERE? So, not holding that against it. Oceanhorn is a mediocre title. Not great, not awful. Game play wise it is sufficiently fun. Lack of consistency of physics makes puzzles hard to figure out sometimes. Sometimes you can push blocks, sometimes you can't. Sometimes you can jump down a cliff, sometimes you can't. Sometimes you can swim somewhere and barely make it before drowning, sometimes you can't. The music can be great at times. But the animations are clunky and the writing, story, and voice acting are god awful. The voice actors are amateurs at best and either they were given the wrong script or it was put in wrong because the captions often don't match the voice dialogue. And the person who wrote the dialogue and story clearly failed English. If this was a short story turned into a teacher, it would have gotten a D at best.\n\nOverall, this game had a lot of promise, but lacked the polish it needed before it was released. Not bad, just not very good.","July 19, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1starseeker/recommended/339200/","1starseeker","Starseeker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1starseeker/","339 products in account","This game is a zelda-clone, in particular a windwaker/phantom hourglass clone. However, it's a much shorter and smaller game. The gameplay and graphics are pretty decent, but the story, characters, and puzzles are relatively lackluster. Some of my favorite things about windwaker were the large, mostly open world to explore, the quirky characters and their accompanying side-quests, and the variety of items to use. However, those aspects were not really present in this game.\n\nThe sailing in this game is very boring to me. You're on a track to whichever island you choose as your destination and then there are a few obstacles you get to shoot in the 30 seconds or less it takes you to get to another island. No sunken treasures, outposts, or islands to discover(you just hear about them from other people and then go from point A to point B). The characters are not terribly memorable at all, although I did enjoy the designs of the rito and zora clones (owlbros and gillfolk). The only real items you get are bombs, arrows, and the ability to jump. There is also magic, but I think it could've been used more for the puzzles and bosses. You get this super cool black hole spell if you get a certain number of bloodstones and it's not effective against bosses and isn't nearly as cool as the name implies.  The story is about as cliche as it gets, but this time you're helping your dad instead of a princess.\n\nThat said, the quality is really nice for an indie game. The music is solid, but falls short of the glory of zelda soundtracks. The art is pretty and while the environments are blocky like in phantom hourglass, they're still made to look relatively natural. The combat works nicely and there are a fair number of enemies that you can't mindlessly hack and slash without first getting behind them or breaking their guard somehow. I also liked the fishing minigame.\n\nI'd recommend this for people who really like Zelda games, but expect a game about a third (or less) as long and half as good.\n\n7/10","March 15","true","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/recommended/339200/","jtgibson","jtgibson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/","820 products in account","My ultimate slant is about 6.5/10.  I lean more towards recommending it on the basis that it is at least a very good casual game that would probably keep younger gamers busy -- around 8-12.  For harder core gamers, it is a little too oversimplified.\n\nThe game has a very slick visual style (a couple of the monster models withstanding, such as the bird-like enemy) and the graphics run famously at maximum settings on my overclocked 2012 PC (3.4 GHz Intel i3570k tuned to 4.0 GHz clock) with a 2015 graphics card (Radeon R9 X290 OC).  It is gorgeously presented and utterly beautiful.  The reflections from the surface of the water are sublime and the environments are truly immersive.\n\nThe gameplay, on the other hand, doesn't live up.  Combat involves almost no manoeuvre and is a slog between holding down the block key and hammering the attack button.  From time to time it can be strategic to let go of the block key and dash away, although this is more often rewarded with an enemy stabbing you in the back than with any actual benefit to your character that it is usually meaningless to try.  When you unlock magic spells, you gain a moderate cost "magic missile" spell that never misses its target; enemies have almost no personality other than the size of their hit meter and how long it takes to hurt them.  The most inventive enemy in the game is one with a mask which can only be knocked off with this spell or by throwing an object at them.  The others are, more or less, simply hit point meters that walk.  This is made even worse by the fact that their AI is almost nonsense: they will either lock onto you and blithely pursue you, or will suddenly and arbitrarily go back into unaggressive wandering behaviour.  (If they wanted to create a morality play where I feel remorse for haplessly slaughtering non-hostile creatures, they succeeded there, at least. =))\n\nTo coin a phrase, it has a "none with a but" style.  None of the monsters are well-designed, but one of them is.  None of the puzzles are difficult, but one is.  None of the combat conveys a sense of danger, but the ogres do the first time.\n\nControls are a bit twitchy, since the mouse controls your point of aim and is often relative to your character instead of relative to the position it is on the screen.  (This part might be better with a gamepad.)  The game doesn't have the responsiveness of a purebred action-adventure game and is really more of a pure adventure game with interactive combat.  For instance, once you unlock the bow, trying to shoot a flying enemy that is south-southeast of you will result in many wasted arrows.  There is no first person aiming and thus no ability to carefully choose your target -- your arrows are auto-aimed to a rather ridiculous degree at times, especially as the threshold for where the auto-aim kicks in seems to be unreliable.  There is no locking-on of targets to specify which one you would truly prefer to attack.\n\nThe game appears to be remarkably short (I figure I'm at least a third of the way through after 4 hours of play), made longer only by grueling semi-interactive travel sequences.  Where the game with a very similar visual style would allow you to control your boat, this game is oriented more for auto-piloted navigation.  Your first travels between islands are pointless as there is no user interaction whatsoever, and could just as easily had been done away with entirely.  That they were included at all implies that the game was trying very hard to emulate another.  After your first travels, your character unlocks an ability that does unlock interactivity during the boat travel, but all it does is turn the boat travel into a tablet-like point-and-shoot minigame which has extremely little variety while your boat still travels on auto-pilot.\n\nUnfortunately the slick visual presentation is the only shellac over top of a samey plot and astoundingly shallow character interactions.  The characters completely fail to motivate the player: they are entities in a world in the same sense that a psychopath might view people walking down the street.  For instance, there is an implied romantic attraction between your character and another about 25% of the way through the game, with absolutely zero exposition or setup as to why.  Even Miyamoto's games, with no more than a couple dozen lines per character, managed to express emotional attraction -- this does not.  I literally put my face in my palm for this one.  Literally.  I barely watched the cutscene through my fingers while shaking my head and laughing.  The only character I felt a genuine sympathy for was the "last of the Owrus", after visiting a grave nearby his house after reading the sign in front of the house -- the best example of "show don't tell" story writing, which (most of) the rest of the game sadly missed the ball on.  The game does express a hint of poignance in the bleak backstory now and then, but there is too little exposition for it to be more than fleeting.\n\nThe puzzles are very simplistic.  Never once did I have to pause for more than a second to figure anything out.  For instance, avoiding any spoilers, the supposedly cryptic messages that talk about gaining a particular item from a green chest are obvious exactly what that item is.  The only time I ever got "stuck" in the game is because I failed to notice that I could blow up a single barricade on the desert island at the very beginning, and even then I figured it out simply by double-checking the areas accessible to me and testing areas for vulnerabilities.  One of the puzzles later on in the game, en route to collecting the shield, is quite obvious in intent and solution and made frustrating only by the clunkiness of the movement and aim controls, including a need to quickly and precisely target two sword swings and a spell as well as several jumps.  Perhaps a gamepad would have served me better here too.\n\nWith all of those negatives, you would assume that I absolutely hated the game, but the game is well presented enough that, chore of gameplay aside, it is strangely compelling.  The music is utterly fantastic.  The game manages to capture "fun" without actually being particularly well done, and that is remarkable on its own.  It is a gorgeous romp through varied locations and all extremely atmospheric, even if all are extraordinarily short.  The voice acting is phenomenal and incredibly professionally done (not sure what VAs the other reviewers are listening to, but mine were great ;-)), although the characters are so one-or-two dimensional that it is difficult to develop any particular attachment.  There isn't enough of character interaction to make the world come truly alive, but it is certainly alive enough to watch as an external viewer: peering through the looking glass without ever deciding to step all the way into the rabbit hole.\n\nAn advanced gamer will probably turn their nose up at it, but it would definitely be something you could point a child at for mindless fun.","May 14","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's inconsistent about it's geometry, having the character sometimes but not always be able to jump off edges or climb, depending on what the game feels like allowing without any visual indicators.\n\nThe game starts off with a boring cutscene monologuing about some mysterious monster that an NPC has to go fight voiced by character that isn't there yet (reused voices?), before a voice that is never even given a character tell you to wake up.  With that backstory, the game hands you a list of controls and a list of achievements as your primary motivation for doing things.  From there the game assume the player will get the hidden chest nearby and only then explains why it was significant, while still refusing to give any in-game motivations, and even contradicting its own setting.  The mc was not supposed to get the sword and shield, despite living on a tiny island with monsters alongside an old man who can't defend himself?  I call BS.\n\nAnd then the sailing section occurs.  The game gives no indication of how sailing works.  I won't hide it.  I stopped playing here, because I couldn't convince the game to do anything.  Even after I looked on the forums, all I could find was a tip saying to click a couple hundred times and it'll work.\n\nIf anyone tells you this game is like zelda or the closest to zelda you'll get on PC, ignore them, and go look up Ittle Dew.

Every 'island' you visit is one large complex, confusing puzzle that looks and feels the same in every regard. The puzzles are not nearly as well design as its counterpart that it's trying to rip-off and halfway through the game it starts feeling like a chore rather than fun.\n\n- Selecting an island to travel, has you sailing in a ship that looks eerily similar to that in Legend of Zelda Wind waker. However you don't actually control the ship, the game does that for you while you shoot from a canon, destroying the same enemies over and over again. It was fun in the beginning but like the rest of the game it starts to feel derivative after a while.\n\n- Story and characters feel very uninspired.\n\n- Boss Battles are boring and frustrating to play.\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nOceanhorn is HEAVILY inspired from the legend of zelda series, and while that may be a good idea the game fails in its execution. If Steam had a 'meh' option I would probably choose that. Sadly I will give this game a negative review, because although the game is certainly competent in certain regards the fact that it tries so hard to be like Legend of Zelda and misses the mark is what really hurts it at the end.\n","May 3","false","13.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

(Both in layout and visuals)\n-Uninteresting items. (With the exception of Force Spell, and Trencher Boots.)\n-No Overworld to speak of. (It's a glorified level-select)\n-Boring sailing from island to island with almost no interactivity.\n-No open exploration at all. (just level-unlocks hidden in other levels.)\n-Terrible animation.\n-One Spell has no animation at all.\n-Bad voice-acting.\n-Very limited enemy types.\n-All of the enemies are too easy, including bosses.\n-Late game enemies are very sword-spongy.\n-Collectables take a long time to harvest, wasting time for no reason.\n-No sense of urgency in the plot, ever. Because *Mild Spoiler*: it does not actually progress at all until the absolute end of the game. (As an example: It is like if the entirety of "A Link to the Past" was spent just looking for your Uncle.)\n-Shallow and uninteresting characters. (with the mild exception of the father due to narration on each island, but you never really get to know who he is, just that he did some stuff and has a kind of gravelly voice.)\n-Painfully awkward "emotional" scenes, where you're supposed to really care about character(s) you've barely even seen before, let alone talked to.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nWith all of these Cons, Oceanhorn still might be worth getting if it's on a very steep sale, (ie. for $2.00 or less,) because the Dungeons are at least somewhat entertaining, and it is a mercifully short game. But it is not in any way shape or form, worth anything close to full price.","February 27","false","10.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You "level up" by completing challenges, but you don't get anything from it, other than just some ingame coins. That is some IOS stuff right there. But no big deal. UPDATE: There's actually more than the leveling system than that, so scratch this off of the list of cons.\n_Voice acting is meh.\n\nOverall, you would like this game if:\n_You think IOS ports to PC can be done and are looking for some proof.\n_You think IOS ports to PC CAN'T be done and are looking to prove yourself wrong.\n_You like The Legend of Zelda games.\n\nIs this game worth $15: Yes. It's pretty good. Not in the GOTY sense, but it's very, very decent, borderline excellent for its price.\n\nSeriously, though, I can't believe this game is an IOS port...\n\nShameless plugs time!

Why would you want to play an inferior version of Zelda? Because that's essentially what this is, a bad version of Zelda. I love the design, and the atmosphere is cool, but other than this game is pretty mediocre. The camera is locked, you're kind of weak (I haven't gotten the Coral Sabre yet, however), the stamina system stinks (although it does make sense, it just hampers the game, it doesn't add anything), your ammunition is super low until you hit the max level (where you can hold 99 bombs and 99 arrows), the monsters drop far too little money and experience, the items lack originality, the puzzles aren't that creative.\n\nThe one thing I think the developers did well is the drop rate, which is very high, so your low amount of maximum ammunition doesn't severely hamper you as it's pretty easy to fill your bomb bag and quiver up. The ship travels quickly from island to island as well, so that's another good point. So yeah, if you've never played a Zelda game and you want to get into the Zelda series, then do play this. If you HAVE played Zelda, don't play this, as it's worse than pretty much any Zelda game ever released.\n\nEdit: Also, the music is fantastic.","March 23, 2015","false","8.2"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

I eagerly awaited the Android release because of the rave reviews and many comparisons to Zelda. When it came to Steam, I said "good enough" and made the purchase. Mistake.\n\nOn its face, Oceanhorn has a cute art style and interesting Zelda-like premise. Evil monster, father killed, dungeons, items, puzzles, bosses, you get the drift. But from the moment you set foot on your home island the first time, the game clobbers you with a very un-Zelda feel.\n\nTo say this game's controls feel clunky, does not really convey the true badness of how this game plays. Moving your character around is a chore, and dodging enemy attacks is almost impossible. Fortunately, that is not really an issue, because 90% of the enemies are dumber than a bag of hammers and so slow to act that there are no attacks to dodge. The few enemies who are actually a threat to you are easily dealt with using items that are far too powerful to make any part of this game a challenge.\n\nThe boss fights are really the true disappointment. In almost every boss fight, the game switches perspective to lock the camera so that it always faces the boss. This was kind of interesting, but when most of the bosses have no attacks except to charge at you in a way that almost feels like they're bored, it really lets down. I never took a single point of damage from a boss until about 3/4 of the way through a game when a boss pleasantly offered a real challenge. This boss, the lone exception, features battle mechanics that require weakening him and avoiding his counterattacks. Part of the challenge comes from the camera always changing perspective while he's shooting at you, but hey, I'll take it.\n\nThere are more annoying gameplay elements, like the completely-extraneous boat travels scenes between islands that took 3-6 minutes of firing an infinite-ammo gun at every single thing that isn't water. The challenge is so low for this part that I don't understand the point. It is not fun and adds nothing to the game or story.\n\nThe plot for this game is plagiarized from Generic Adventure Game. Literally nothing surprising happens. Ever.\n\nComparing this game to Zelda is like comparing a Ferrari California to a Chevy Cobalt. Yes they are both sports cars, but that hardly puts them in the same category. Save your money.","November 4, 2015","false","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, I am not so happy with it as other reviewers. This is a Zelda clone, ok, maybe the story is original, and the voices are pretty good too, but there are so many things just exactly like you would find in a Zelda game, chests, heart containers, mirror shield, coins, even a tryforce reference. I'm fine with subtle references, but this is too much, it's not that hard to come up with something different and original. Then there's also the dungeon and puzzles design, which are kind of dull, but it gets better later in the game.\n\nAnother annoying thing is the controls, which relies too much on the physics engine, the player moves around kind of slow and it feels weird when going up stairs, because the weight and gravity makes the character move slower and even it seems like it gets stuck. You get used after a while, but still feels weird.\n\nI understand that this game was made by very few people, but that doesn't justify anything, this game needs more polish.\n\nDespite all that, I liked it and I would recommend it, as I said, the game is fun and the story is not bad.","November 5, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the huge ones is in Zelda when you need something (heart, bomb, arrow...) and you're out of them, one of the next few pots will have it. In this game it's a complete crapshoot. You might be completely full of mana and have only half a heart, and get 10 pots in a row that only contain mana or coins. This is especially annoying during boss fights.\nSpeaking of boss fights, that's the only time the camera does anything interesting - and it can make finding those pots extremely difficult.\nSo it's a game on very small islands... but your character can only swim for about 5 feet. I'd think that someone who lived on an island their whole life would be able to swim for more than a few seconds. And you can only sprint for about 5 feet too.\nThe game is really close to good... it's just not quite there. I found a lot of points needlessly frustrating because the game doesn't always lead you in the right direction.

The main story happens at a reasonable pace and doesn't involve too much backtracking. Going for the 100% completionist, though, stretches out the gameplay to the point where it starts to become tedious and less enjoyable.\n\nThe general combat is fairly decent though it's not very responsive, dynamic, or varied. Hack n' Slash is holy writ for the most part. One major gripe I have with general play is that enemy loot doesn't spawn until a second or two later when the enemy bodies have despawned; this means you have to force yourself to wait around after killing something, backtrack, or ignore the loot. On the plus side the experience "drop" is an automatic pickup even if in the grand scheme of things not worth much (you get most of your XP from doing stuff, not killing stuff.\n\nI greatly appreciated that there wasn't One Way to defeat bosses, largely because that way would result in longer and more tedious fights. Many of the boss fights had a particular gimmick to disarm them based on the arena but this effect could be replicated by bombs, arrows, and/or magic. On the other hand there isn't much depth to any of the fights except the very last one as all the others are just 'disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, done'. Despite that I'm still not sure how I beat the final boss (deus ex machina, literally).\n\nIts style shares vague similarities to Wind Waker but it lacks a certain depth that Zelda games tend to have. There's only basic gadgets, half of the spells are unnecessary, and the fishing mini-game is largely there just to pad the XP growth potential (you can't sell the fish, they can't be used in any way, and none of the NPCs care what happens, but you get tons of extra XP the first time you catch a fish type).\n\nMy personal recommendation is to get it on sale, play through the main story, maybe track down some heart pieces for the final boss, and leave it at that.","June 26, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do wish I had more control over the camera, that isometric perspective is sometimes hard to navigate. The animation is a tad rough in some of the cutscenes/enemy animations.

The storyline is awful and very straightforward, the "puzzles" are a complete joke (you literally slide a block a few spaces forward and thats it; and they're everywhere), almost every boss can be beaten by spamming it with bombs, and aside from getting 100% completion there's no real incentive to do anything. The only real "challenge" in this game is the Whispering Island and even that is super simple.

Even though it's an iOS port, I didn't know that when I purchased the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's compared to Windwaker, but I never played that one, so I can't comment on that.\n\nPros: Works well for mouse, keyboard, or game pad. Decent graphics; nothing flashy, but about on par with a good GameCube game. Plenty of side content and extras to hunt for. Good challenge; not too difficult, not too easy. It's a bit on the easy side, but not disappointingly so. Some of the puzzles and encounters make you think. I encountered no glitches and was able to unlock all the achievements without issue. The different areas and dungeons are fairly diverse. Leveling up unlock new perks in all aspects of the game which is fun; only one level up seems to break the difficulty balance.\n\nCons: The sailing has no value in the game; it's little more than a mini game while you're loading the next island. Poor economy; once you access the shop, you've seen all there is to buy, No way to effectively use the mini-map; no zooming or marking points of interest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/339200/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","45 products in account","A lot of people tend to compare Oceanhorn with past installments of The Legend of Zelda series. I can understand why, but in my opinion, it evokes far fonder memories of an old beauty called Landstalker. The platforming style used in Oceanhorn mixed with it’s gorgeous graphics and expansive world make it a pleasure to play. Find our more in our Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas Review!\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas’ storyline is fairly basic. Boy’s father sets out to slay a twisted beast, boy heads out to find father, boy learns he needs to collects emblems of Earth, Ocean and Sol to help defeat said beasty, boy makes friends along the way, finds beefed up equipment to help him with his journey etc.\n\nHowever, I feel that the true beauty of Oceanhorn isn’t the story. The storyline plays second fiddle to the satisfying exploration and combat system. The most enjoyment when playing Oceanhorn is from the many different islands you’ll visit and landscapes you’ll explore.\n\nEnvironmentally speaking, each island is beautifully portrayed. One such island is covered in abysmal fog and rain, whereas another depicts an incredible rocky landscape. The islands are all unique and each hold their own secrets for you to uncover.\n\nSome players notice when playing Oceanhorn that the whole thing really is quite reminiscent of Zelda games. The enemies are similar; certain characters seem to have walked straight in from another franchise; and the sailing mini-events that take place whilst traversing the ocean waters will have you thinking you’ve accidentally launched another game.\n\nHowever, I implore you to ignore the feelings that you’ve played this before. Overlook the fact that some concepts seem borrowed, and think more along the lines that Oceanhorn is a culmination of different concepts brought together into one vast gaming experience.\n\nOceanhorn easily holds strong in today’s gaming world and delivers a fulfilling experience from both it’s gameplay and design.\n\nControllation (yes it’s a word)\nWhen playing the Steam version of Oceanhorn, the main character is controlled via the ‘WASD’ keys, whilst aiming and attacking is controlled by your mouse and mouse buttons.\n\nVarious equipment can be acquired throughout your journey that, not only plays an integral part in combat, but also helps in gaining access to areas of the game that would otherwise remain inaccessible. Such items come in the form of bombs that can be used to blow away boxes or rubble; and a bow and arrow that can be fired at strategically placed targets which act as buttons to open doors or move pillars out of your way.\n\nThere’s also a few spells to procure along the way, such as fire to melt ice, or a force spell which summons objects to the area you’ve aimed your cursor. There’s even a secret spell to unlock by obtaining a certain amount of items known as bloodstones. If you’re lucky to chance across one, it can be acquired by hacking away at it with your sword until it gets added to your inventory.\n\nBox puzzles await your brain and act as a nice little break between taking on constantly respawning enemies. When completed, these box puzzles will reveal pathways to destinations unexplored or drop treasure chests that contain a nice little bonus of gold or XP.\n\nGold doesn’t seem to play much of a role in Oceanhorn but it’s still handy to accumulate. Merchants provide the service of stocking up your extra items, I.e. bombs, arrows etc. and they can also sell you extra hearts to increase your maximum health.\n\nLevelling up is great fun because each level you reach will unlock a little extra bonus for the game. Some of these bonuses are gaining a gun to shoot monsters or obstacles when sailing around the world, or decreasing the amount of stamina used when blocking attacks.\n\nAnother thing I quite like about levelling up is the title rewarded with each level. For example at level ten, you’ll be given the title of “Voyager” and eventually you’ll work your way up to “Legend”.\n\nBut one of the most fun additions to journeying through your quest is fishing! Yes!! Everyone loves fishing in a game!\n\nBasically at a certain point in the game you are awarded a fishing rod. Take this good ole fishing rod down to a body of water and commence your new adventure!\n\nYou’ll catch different kinds of fish and you’ll also be catching fish of differing lengths. The bigger the better.\n\nCatch all species of fish and I wonder what happens…?\n\nCombatitation (really? you don’t know this word?)\nThe combat in Oceanhorn is simplistic in nature and does away with all the bells and whistles seen in some hack’n’slash games. Left click swings your sword; right click utilises whichever extra weapon/item you’ve got equipped; the ‘f’ key casts whichever spell you’ve equipped; left-shift brings up your shield to act as defence against attacks; and space-bar toggles sprint, picks up and throws an item or acts as the action key.\n\nIf you’re expecting a massive challenge from Oceanhorn, you might be a little disappointed. Monsters found throughout Oceanhorn aren’t that difficult. Some of them will do a lot of damage when they hit you, but you can always block those attacks with your shield. Most enemies will wait a few seconds before commencing their first attack which usually buys enough time to defeat them quickly.\n\nSome enemies are a bit more dastardly and will manage to get a few hits in before you kill them. This will result in a heart or two of your health being taken away. Health can always be replenished from hearts that drop from monsters, or are found when destroying an object like a vase or cutting down grass. If you do end up dying, you’ll respawn at a previous checkpoint.\n\nThankfully, bosses happen to be quite engaging and fun! Each boss will tend to follow certain patterns or require you to perform a specific action before being allowed to damage them. However, bosses found earlier on in the game can be quite easy and you’ll find yourself being able to handle them with little difficulty. When you get further on in the game, the bosses become more challenging and you’ll be relying on your reflexes, as well as your gear, to dispatch them successfully.\n\nAesthetic Charm\nGraphically, Oceanhorn shines brightly. The environments and colours found throughout are gorgeously detailed and display beautifully on a sharp screen, be it computer or iPad.\n\nEnemy design is well thought out and you can see that a lot of love has gone into their creation. Boss design is brilliant and each one brings it’s own flare to match the area you’re traversing perfectly.\n\nThe music is nice to listen to but certain areas might have you reaching for the mute button. In particular the Hermit’s Island. Sound effects aren’t too bad but some sounds, such as when your character runs out of stamina and starts puffing, come across as a bit forced and sound like it could have been done better.\n\nVoice acting isn’t that great. The actors sound wooden and devoid of emotion. That’s why I preferred to play with subtitles on so I could still follow the story without having to listen to the dull voices.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIn summary, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a splendid release from both FDG Mobile Games GbR (iOS version) and Cornfox & Bros. (Steam version). The whole game is a joy to play and would be best enjoyed by younger gamers as an introduction to RPGs.\n\nThe game’s main story takes around ten to fifteen hours to complete, but if you want to fully explore everything and get one-hundred percent complete, you’ll probably find yourself investing quite a few more hours.\n\nBeautifully designed and superbly created, you’ll find yourself wanting to jump back into the world of Oceanhorn quite often. Definitely worth a look!\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","February 14","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I eagerly awaited the Android release because of the rave reviews and many comparisons to Zelda. When it came to Steam, I said "good enough" and made the purchase. Mistake.\n\nOn its face, Oceanhorn has a cute art style and interesting Zelda-like premise. Evil monster, father killed, dungeons, items, puzzles, bosses, you get the drift. But from the moment you set foot on your home island the first time, the game clobbers you with a very un-Zelda feel.\n\nTo say this game's controls feel clunky, does not really convey the true badness of how this game plays. Moving your character around is a chore, and dodging enemy attacks is almost impossible. Fortunately, that is not really an issue, because 90% of the enemies are dumber than a bag of hammers and so slow to act that there are no attacks to dodge. The few enemies who are actually a threat to you are easily dealt with using items that are far too powerful to make any part of this game a challenge.\n\nThe boss fights are really the true disappointment. In almost every boss fight, the game switches perspective to lock the camera so that it always faces the boss. This was kind of interesting, but when most of the bosses have no attacks except to charge at you in a way that almost feels like they're bored, it really lets down. I never took a single point of damage from a boss until about 3/4 of the way through a game when a boss pleasantly offered a real challenge. This boss, the lone exception, features battle mechanics that require weakening him and avoiding his counterattacks. Part of the challenge comes from the camera always changing perspective while he's shooting at you, but hey, I'll take it.\n\nThere are more annoying gameplay elements, like the completely-extraneous boat travels scenes between islands that took 3-6 minutes of firing an infinite-ammo gun at every single thing that isn't water. The challenge is so low for this part that I don't understand the point. It is not fun and adds nothing to the game or story.\n\nThe plot for this game is plagiarized from Generic Adventure Game. Literally nothing surprising happens. Ever.\n\nComparing this game to Zelda is like comparing a Ferrari California to a Chevy Cobalt. Yes they are both sports cars, but that hardly puts them in the same category. Save your money.","November 4, 2015","false","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, I am not so happy with it as other reviewers. This is a Zelda clone, ok, maybe the story is original, and the voices are pretty good too, but there are so many things just exactly like you would find in a Zelda game, chests, heart containers, mirror shield, coins, even a tryforce reference. I'm fine with subtle references, but this is too much, it's not that hard to come up with something different and original. Then there's also the dungeon and puzzles design, which are kind of dull, but it gets better later in the game.\n\nAnother annoying thing is the controls, which relies too much on the physics engine, the player moves around kind of slow and it feels weird when going up stairs, because the weight and gravity makes the character move slower and even it seems like it gets stuck. You get used after a while, but still feels weird.\n\nI understand that this game was made by very few people, but that doesn't justify anything, this game needs more polish.\n\nDespite all that, I liked it and I would recommend it, as I said, the game is fun and the story is not bad.","November 5, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first things didn't seem very refined and detail rich , but I came to realize that was implemented aws done fairly well, and fresh but familiar. I wish more effort was put into the controls and that some of the combat and its animations were smoother and more visually satisfying, but it's good nonetheless. I need to be fair and remember that this is an effort by a smaller studio inspired by a massive legend of a franchise, so its definitely good for the production value. Hopefully the devs can refine the movement, combat, and add more interactivity and content. It would be Awesome if the game could take a bit more inspiration from the Zelda series and polish the game in it's own unique way even more. And Port it to the Vita!

A Disappointing Sea of Content and a Boring Combat System.Genre: Isometric Adventure RPG.\nDeveloped and Published by: Cornfox & Bros.\nPlatform: iOS, Windows and Mac OSX\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is an isometric RPG clearly inspired by the Legend of Zelda series, at least the isometric/Game Boy versions. Everything from the lock-on sword play, the story about a hero gaining three valued artifacts of power to overthrow a growing evil and much of the visual design shows that inspiration in spades. Due to that inspiration, the comparisons to the Zelda series are easy to make. I hate to say this but more often than not, Oceanhorn doesn’t compare well. Whether by limitation of the iOS platform or the inexperience of the developers, a lot of ideas and mechanics were pale imitations of what’s been done before.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe story is ok at best. It’s a traditional story of a young boy who goes out to find the three magical Emblems of the Elements and put a stop to an evil entity. At first, we’re introduced to Father, who goes out to fend off a living fortress known as Oceanhorn and what happens to him is ultimately unknown. After gathering Father’s sword & shield as well as preparing yourself for sailing, Hero goes out to gather these circles. He has Father’s journal with him which will narrate a little bit every time you visit an important island. Hero goes to a forest island, a desert island and an island in the sky to collect all three magical sources of power. Along the way, Hero meets two different races that have fallen into ruin due to the evil machinations of Mesmeroth and some of minions. So, through some dungeon crawling, Hero will eventually right those wrongs done and those races will eventually rise from defeat….in maybe another game. Once the pieces of the puzzle are assembled, with help from Hermit along the way, Hero will go to Father and fight Mesmeroth once and for all. During this quest, a few side characters will come in and out of the story but otherwise, Hero is on his own for this journey. Having only the guidance of Father’s journal and the power of the elements to “guide” him. The emblems are only in the game to push the story along, nothing else.\n\nCombat Thoughts\nThe combat has the worst problems. Using a sword and shield most of the time, you’ll have a lot of slap fights with bullet-spongy (sword-spongy?) enemies in the game. They will often require a ton of hits to bring down and there are a lot of enemies per level which also happen to respawn rather quickly. It definitely feels like grinding through a level, if the experience system didn’t make that particularly obvious. Bloodstones in particular, while not enemies, seem to require 20 or so sword attacks to collect. Why? I don’t know but I thought that was a waste of time. As far as blocking projectiles/attacks with the shield, this seemed to be hit and miss on which attacks would and wouldn’t be blocked, leading to a constant source of frustration while fighting. As a whole, the system works and you can get through the game. But it’s not going to be a whole lot of fun. Oh and there are spells which are used for some puzzles and can be used for the fights. However, I found they often used far too much mana so I usually only used them for puzzles. This is thanks to the lack of an adaptable inventory system. There’s no bottles you can hang onto to replenish health or mana, everything has to be found in the levels. It makes boss fights a lot less interesting as well.\n\nPC Settings & Port Report\nIt’s got a pretty OK selection of options. You have four different graphic presets including low to ultra. There’s a bunch of different options that turns various objects including clouds and soft shadows on/off. V-sync and anti-aliasing is included. Fullscreen and borderless windowed are here as well with a reasonable choice of resolutions. FPS can be set to 30 or 60 FPS locked/unlocked. In the pause screen, you can adjust speech, effects and music with individual sliders. You might want to consider lowering the music slider which I’ll explain later on. Keyboard and mouse work ok with Oceanhorn but it feels off. Not that controller is a lot better either. Some of the action keys can be rebound but the implementation limits where they can go. Mouse keys can only be rebound to other mouse keys and the same goes for keyboard ones. Why did we decide this was a good idea? No clue. It’s a big no-no.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nUltimately, the frustrating part about Oceanhorn is how much this game treads the same ground so many others have in this genre. Sure, it’s one of the better iOS to PC ports I’ve seen in a long time. There’s nary a mention about touching the screen or buying microtransactions in the App Store and I respect that. Unfortunately, the game still suffers problems inherent to the mobile platform. It’s a mechanically boring game that’s a chore to get through rather than an experience to be enjoyed. The gameplay is filled with repetitive and somewhat unresponsive gameplay that completely lacks meaningful feedback to hook the player in. The optimization is questionable too. The story, honestly, the story feels like it was missing a chunk of itself. There are two dimensional characters abound and its hard to stir myself into getting interested while I’m playing.\n\nOceanhorn was just a drag to get through, especially towards the end. The entire time, I was constantly reminded of what this game could have been instead of what it was doing. I was constantly disappointed every time a new mechanic was introduced or an area shown. Most of the time, what they had implemented was done on the most basic of levels, giving me nothing to sink my teeth into. Other reviewers constantly talk about how much this is like Legend of Zelda except on an iPad. This, at best, is a passing imitation to that series. I myself cannot recommend Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 14, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically it. You even collect pieces of heart. None of the characters came off as sex offenders like in some of the Zelda games (Ocarina and Windwaker), so that might disappoint some.\n+ Music\n+ Graphics (though character models are a bit so-so)\n+ Mouse & Keyboard - You actually aim using the mouse, so that's pretty sweet, and the controls are responsive\n\nCons:\n- 3D terrain all over the place. i.e. the simplicity of Ocarina of Time's 3D maps and the 2D Zelda games' full view of the area give you a better sense of security and where everything is. I found myself doubling back too many times, because the terrain blocks you in different directions and is often annoying.\n\nConclusion:\nFrom what I've played so far, I can see that I lack the patience to get through this game, even though I hear it's short. It's just not the kind of game I can stick with, dealing with terrain like that. However, that's a personal choice on my part and not something I could classify as a disability of my own that the game is failing to live up to. As such, I cannot see fit to give this game a negative review. I've made very little progress so far, but it's obviously a quality product from what I've witnessed and if you are -currently- totally into Zelda games, then this may be right up your alley.\n\nThat said, if the idea of a Zelda clone pisses you off, then don't get it because you're just going to be angry about that the whole time. =/","March 26","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks and sounds really well, which you can hear/see from the trailer.\n\nThe game itself is not very hard and the puzzles throughout the game aren't particularly challenging either. There's also multiple crappy achievements that involve RNG (fishing) and just collecting things (ugh, collectibles). If you're still interested, some of the puzzles can have you permanently stuck. No, I don't mean you can't figure them out or you lose a key, I mean you literally get stuck in a whole or glitch into somewhere you aren't suppose to be that you cannot get out of. I have a couple screenshots of this happening in a few different locations.\n\nIt also doesn't really have the strict Zelda feel, so don't expect that even if you get that vibe from other reviews and maybe the trailer itself.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game though.

To be fair, I haven't played much of the game, and so far it's a *little* bit different from Zelda in that there's a level-up/XP system, but other than that, it's pretty much identical in terms of tone, setting, story, etc. Like I mentioned - this is NOT a knock against the game as I don't see it as a bad thing at all.

I really enjoyed it a lot. It's not a perfect game, and near the end it was getting grindy, but overall I had a good experience. The game has some simple puzzles, and lots of backtracking old areas with new skills. If you enjoy old school Zelda type 2D RPGs you will probably enjoy this 3D rendition. It looks good, and the audio is very remniscent of those old games. This game is basically retro without leaning on the retro crutch.\n\nCon: If there is any con, the Oceanhorn battle itself is a straight up glitch fest and getting 100% (done), left you at the mercy of chance in the kind of dumb fishing mini game. I was 98% for quite a while and absolutely infuriated that no amount of skill would prevail I had to rely on luck alone. Oh and the story, it's barely worth mentioning. I think the game could've played better without one, and the terrible voice acting it brought with it. I suppose you needed some motivation to press on, but I didn't care for it. A child could've penned this. In fact if they reveal that one of the developers children wrote it, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nOverall: worth a play if Zelda is your jam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noriundr/recommended/339200/","noriundr","Noriundr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noriundr/","23 products in account","Unless you're incredibly bored & brain dead just looking for a time waster do not buy this game. If you can get it on a massive sale, or for free, and have some time to kill... here's 63 trivial achievementsl. Also just a note going in, you never get to sail the boat yourself D: It's like a loading mini-game that's just spam the mouse to shoot things in your way.\n\nFirstly, enemies. There are barely any bosses and a severe lack of mini-bosses of any sort, leaving you to spam click your sword through low level enemies in every dungeon without any real threat to your annoyance. The Graveyard, Riptide, Old Fortress... none have a boss of any sort. Just the same ol' boring low level enemies. Not only that but pretty much every boss could just be taken down by a few bomb throws from across the arena. Very boring.\n\nSecondly, level design. The trailers don't lie: the levels are small and cramped. But alright, you can still do great things with that limitation. Sadly Oceanhorn doesn't. The puzzles can barely be called that, and yes this is coming from a puzzle lover who's crack is a challenge that could take hours to figure out, but holy applesauce this game... There is more than a couple instances where the 'puzzle' is literally a box right next to the switch. The 'increased' difficulty for puzzles in this game just seems to be: add more boxes and switches sitting next to each other.\n\nThis game feels like it was made for young children with its 'difficulty'. The only reason I have so much time on this is because it was an easy grab for achievements and it felt like it would be an embarrassment to not have them all with how trivial it is. The amount of time is because of how slow it is to move around, fishing, & the time it takes to skulk about an area murdering all of one type of enemy.\n\nThirdly, the story. While the main points are fine and dandy... there's a huge problem with everything else that gets one emerged in the game. There are no interesting or fun interactions with any NPC and despite them never doing anything, learning anything about you, knowing anything about what's happening, the game forces an advancement in their generic uninteresting NPC comments as if they are all omniscient. There are promises of a fun side note/reaction to something you've done, like the “Don't break the pots” sign or the “You will never reach Master Level” sign sitting right next to the 'Master Adventurer' but just... nothing. It's all glossed over.\n\nAnother example is Neeto. No introduction convo, she doesn't acknowledge you're different than the regular townsfolk, yet when you meet her for the 2nd time suddenly she's waiting on the docks for you to arrive and help her cause you're the only one she can count on. Really..? It goes even further with the fireworks scene with her acting like she's the protagonists girl friend, asking to be taken to see the world, and then the kid gives her the super special thing he just got! Wat... Where did that all come from? Where did any of these relations come from? We never get to see, participate, or develop any of it. We only get the after notes, which leaves a player rather uninvested in everything.\n\nI didn't have a very high bar going into this game but I had hope it could be a shadow of a Zelda game as it likes to so proudly tell everyone. But this... this was a fanfic AU of a couple Zelda mashups (majorly Windwaker if one couldn't tell from the videos) where they had to make a few minor character design changes so they wouldn't get dinged by the trademark. Featuring the Zora, the Evolved Bird-Zora, the Hylians, Octoroks, Moblins, Buzzblobs, Keese, Peahat Larva, the Master Sword & Mirror Shield, the 3 Emblems (Green, Blue, Red), Islands as remnants of an ancient civilization...

So I won't be making the kind of comparisons that would be expected here, because I can't.\n\nAnd maybe precisely because this kind of gameplay is still somewhat fresh to me did I enjoy the game so thoroughly. The gameplay is very solid, the mix of exploration, puzzles and action just right. The world feels somehow alive and vibrant despite its absurdities of scale. The fairytale visuals are appropriate here (and are of quite high quality). The music is top notch, especially the epic choral pieces.\n\nI was never stuck for very long. Difficulty is not adjustable, but it is kinda on the easy side. The same could be said of the collectibles, they're suprisingly manageable, not too hard. All that is great in my book. There was the whole Botfish episode, which threatened to produce a negative review all by itself but it quickly resolved itself once I had 9 hearts so I will speak of it no more. There are some bugs that can cause you to get stuck in an impossible location and force to suicide/reload the game but they're rare.\n\nIf you're looking to go on a grand and fantastical adventure flavoured (in a good way!) with childish wonderment, this would be a pretty good choice.","April 5","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those things where there are weird little things that stand out like a sore thumb in an otherwise excellent piece. Oceanhorn is very Zelda-esk, which is what I went in looking for, what with the slowly unlocking new gear to open up new areas around the world. It also has an actual leveling system, which is nice, although it doesn't do a ton, it mainly just upgrades the number of bombs or arrows you can carry and whatnot. The challenge system is nice and provides an easy way to track achievements in a way that gives in game experience points. The story is kind of meh, but they don't shove it down your throat and generally just let you go explore. There are quite a few instances where they don't tell you about something and you're supposed to kind of just figure it out. That is to be expected from this kind of game, but there were several times where I had to utilize something in a way I wasn't even aware was possible and that was a bit frustrating since it wasn't clear. My main gripe with this game is the movement mechanics. I understand what they are going for, but it feels almost moronic to get stopped by 1ft high rocks CONSTANTLY and not being able to fall down more than one ledge space at a time. I feel like if they had given it more physical depth, it would have been a more immersive experience since it really pulls you out of the game when you have to navigate in ridiculous fashions that no normal human being would ever have to deal with. You also have to unlock the ability to jump via an item, which is stupid, and it only lets you jump horizonally across one space and not vertically at all. The movement structure also causes some confusion about progression since the rules get bent a bit here and there. Like you can normally only drop down 1 tier, but in certain spots to progress you have to drop down 2 or 3 and you weren't thinking you could even do that. The boss system is solid and very refreshing. It is something that genuinely awards paying attention and trial and error. The boss battles themeslves are actually extremely easy, but only if you know what you're doing. For instance, I would go into a boss battle and die over and over again until I learned something new and then I could go in and kill it without almost any problems at all. The fishing system in this game seems forced and pointless. You don't gain anything by doing it and it is complete random luck and there are far too many achievements revolving around fishing. My goal was to 100% this game and I got to the last few achievements and was just like NOPE. I see no enjoyment in running all round the world looking for fish and hoping they are the right kind. I was also a bit bummed that the sailing in this game is on rails and not open world. It doesn't feel bad or anything, but I didn't expect it to lock you on your path. Overall an enjoyable game though that satisfies the Zelda itch for a good price. I picked mine up in a Humble Bundle or something, so it was only a few dollars and it was money well spent.","April 7","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's the pros and cons from my experiences of the game:\n\nPROS\n- great story, it follows through very well despite the side quests\n- Graphics are A+ from what I can manage on my computer. However...\n- a lot of chances to explore and the way you sail around really does remind me of LoZ: Windwaker. Although...\n- FISHING! I love fishing, and I'm a fan of collecting.\n- Dungeons reward you for exploring everywhere.\n- Boss battles are challenging, yet still easy for casual play.\n\nCONS\n- Graphics: Despite the game being visually appealing, I was forced to lower the resolution because the game would go haywire if I went to better graphics. The screen would flicker and the game screen would black out like some creepy haunted video.\n- Movement: The character moves too slow sometimes, making me wish there was more of a dashing chance without it eating up stamina so quickly. It wasn't fun walking around a boss and hoping they wouldn't hit you and kill you so quickly.\n- Camera Angles: The biggest reason I can't give a better score on this game. In my fight with Mesmeroth's Spirit, when you're trying to wack the little flaming orbs to find him, the camera angle would TWIST YOUR VISUALITY AROUND SO MUCH that you would STRUGGLE just trying to simply hit all the orbs. I couldn't hit them in time because THE CAMERA WOULDN'T LET ME. I died many times because of this. :(\n- The second time I was fighting the fish boss, he got stuck on one of the pillars and couldn't move. It ensured my victory...but...\n- Exploration - I love exploring. The map is great and going everywhere is fun, but I wish instead of going on a set course, you could sail on your own. It'd have a more Windwaker feel, but it'd also feel nostalgic.\n\nEither way, great game!","September 29, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In general I tend to find those two things normally equate to that of total crap. Surprisingly however, Oceanhorn stands out as a shining example of how a solid port should be done.\n\nNo hiding the fact it's a total Wind Waker clone. Pretty much everything in this game draws direct connection from much of the Zelda series. Trying to fill those shoes can be a pretty huge task, which it at least does a pretty good job of emulating. It manages to capture the nice open colorful world in the same fashion as Zelda. The characters, monsters and bosses are fairly creative. Most of what you encounter tries to mimic the art style of Zelda quite closely. Not quite as charming of course, although to be fair it'd be hard to live up to some of the most beloved games of all time completely.\n\nSometimes you can sense a bit of the restraints from this game originally being intended for the ipad. The combat is good, but I feel like it's not quite as fluid or polished as it could have been. Had it not been originally designed around the ipad. For the most part at least it comes off rather well on the PC using a controller. It also allows for the use of mouse an keyboard controls.\n\nUnlike Zelda, Oceanhorn features a leveling system. Gaining a level can result in earning coins an item refills, increasing the number of bombs you can carry, but it also serves to unlock other things such as a cannon item for your sail boat early on. The boat is your main source of transportation for island hopping around the world. Travelling by boat is done on a rail system unlike the free roaming in Wind Waker. I guess to try to make the travel portions a bit less dull, they decided to add in things like explosive mines and enemies along with crates and things you can shoot for experience and coins as you travel along. This portion can become a bit tedious at times.\n\nThe music is nice and the game looks good enough for what it's intended to be. Saving is done either automatically when entering a new area or when activating checkpoints. Not having the option to save manually however can be a little annoying. The game itself is pretty forgiving however. If you find yourself being killed, you're automatically transported back to the location of your last checkpoint save, while retaining any items and exp you collected beforehand. For the most part the difficulty is rather mild.\n\nIn the end for what faults it does have I would still recommend this to any fan of the Zelda series. All in all it's bit like a smaller Wind Waker lite. It does do a pretty good job in filling a nice niche, in which it's hard to find many similiar games on the PC. If you're looking for something to fill that Zelda-esque desire you probably won't regret buying Oceanhorn. Overall I'd rate this game at maybe a close 7 out of 10. Probably won't wow you, but enjoyable enough to be worth the time.","January 15","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course it's very similar to a certain popular series of Nintendo games, but that's not a bad thing at all. This game does not feel like a clone in any capacity, it is a tribute. There are things that this game may not absolutely excel at, such as boss fights (i'm looking at you Sky Island boss), but the overall spirit of the adventure game is alive and well, and the amount of work put in to this title really shows.

I really enjoyed it a lot. It's not a perfect game, and near the end it was getting grindy, but overall I had a good experience. The game has some simple puzzles, and lots of backtracking old areas with new skills. If you enjoy old school Zelda type 2D RPGs you will probably enjoy this 3D rendition. It looks good, and the audio is very remniscent of those old games. This game is basically retro without leaning on the retro crutch.\n\nCon: If there is any con, the Oceanhorn battle itself is a straight up glitch fest and getting 100% (done), left you at the mercy of chance in the kind of dumb fishing mini game. I was 98% for quite a while and absolutely infuriated that no amount of skill would prevail I had to rely on luck alone. Oh and the story, it's barely worth mentioning. I think the game could've played better without one, and the terrible voice acting it brought with it. I suppose you needed some motivation to press on, but I didn't care for it. A child could've penned this. In fact if they reveal that one of the developers children wrote it, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nOverall: worth a play if Zelda is your jam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noriundr/recommended/339200/","noriundr","Noriundr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noriundr/","23 products in account","Unless you're incredibly bored & brain dead just looking for a time waster do not buy this game. If you can get it on a massive sale, or for free, and have some time to kill... here's 63 trivial achievementsl. Also just a note going in, you never get to sail the boat yourself D: It's like a loading mini-game that's just spam the mouse to shoot things in your way.\n\nFirstly, enemies. There are barely any bosses and a severe lack of mini-bosses of any sort, leaving you to spam click your sword through low level enemies in every dungeon without any real threat to your annoyance. The Graveyard, Riptide, Old Fortress... none have a boss of any sort. Just the same ol' boring low level enemies. Not only that but pretty much every boss could just be taken down by a few bomb throws from across the arena. Very boring.\n\nSecondly, level design. The trailers don't lie: the levels are small and cramped. But alright, you can still do great things with that limitation. Sadly Oceanhorn doesn't. The puzzles can barely be called that, and yes this is coming from a puzzle lover who's crack is a challenge that could take hours to figure out, but holy applesauce this game... There is more than a couple instances where the 'puzzle' is literally a box right next to the switch. The 'increased' difficulty for puzzles in this game just seems to be: add more boxes and switches sitting next to each other.\n\nThis game feels like it was made for young children with its 'difficulty'. The only reason I have so much time on this is because it was an easy grab for achievements and it felt like it would be an embarrassment to not have them all with how trivial it is. The amount of time is because of how slow it is to move around, fishing, & the time it takes to skulk about an area murdering all of one type of enemy.\n\nThirdly, the story. While the main points are fine and dandy... there's a huge problem with everything else that gets one emerged in the game. There are no interesting or fun interactions with any NPC and despite them never doing anything, learning anything about you, knowing anything about what's happening, the game forces an advancement in their generic uninteresting NPC comments as if they are all omniscient. There are promises of a fun side note/reaction to something you've done, like the “Don't break the pots” sign or the “You will never reach Master Level” sign sitting right next to the 'Master Adventurer' but just... nothing. It's all glossed over.\n\nAnother example is Neeto. No introduction convo, she doesn't acknowledge you're different than the regular townsfolk, yet when you meet her for the 2nd time suddenly she's waiting on the docks for you to arrive and help her cause you're the only one she can count on. Really..? It goes even further with the fireworks scene with her acting like she's the protagonists girl friend, asking to be taken to see the world, and then the kid gives her the super special thing he just got! Wat... Where did that all come from? Where did any of these relations come from? We never get to see, participate, or develop any of it. We only get the after notes, which leaves a player rather uninvested in everything.\n\nI didn't have a very high bar going into this game but I had hope it could be a shadow of a Zelda game as it likes to so proudly tell everyone. But this... this was a fanfic AU of a couple Zelda mashups (majorly Windwaker if one couldn't tell from the videos) where they had to make a few minor character design changes so they wouldn't get dinged by the trademark. Featuring the Zora, the Evolved Bird-Zora, the Hylians, Octoroks, Moblins, Buzzblobs, Keese, Peahat Larva, the Master Sword & Mirror Shield, the 3 Emblems (Green, Blue, Red), Islands as remnants of an ancient civilization... I'm surprised I didn't see any Cuckoo beyond the weather vanes.","April 4","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I won't be making the kind of comparisons that would be expected here, because I can't.\n\nAnd maybe precisely because this kind of gameplay is still somewhat fresh to me did I enjoy the game so thoroughly. The gameplay is very solid, the mix of exploration, puzzles and action just right. The world feels somehow alive and vibrant despite its absurdities of scale. The fairytale visuals are appropriate here (and are of quite high quality). The music is top notch, especially the epic choral pieces.\n\nI was never stuck for very long. Difficulty is not adjustable, but it is kinda on the easy side. The same could be said of the collectibles, they're suprisingly manageable, not too hard. All that is great in my book. There was the whole Botfish episode, which threatened to produce a negative review all by itself but it quickly resolved itself once I had 9 hearts so I will speak of it no more. There are some bugs that can cause you to get stuck in an impossible location and force to suicide/reload the game but they're rare.\n\nIf you're looking to go on a grand and fantastical adventure flavoured (in a good way!) with childish wonderment, this would be a pretty good choice.","April 5","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do wish I had more control over the camera, that isometric perspective is sometimes hard to navigate. The animation is a tad rough in some of the cutscenes/enemy animations. And there's voice acting. I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or not.\nI'd recommend a 360 gamepad, the keyboard/mouse controls felt really awkward. There's a Pause button mapped to the Back button, which is really handy during the story telling. Also, you can go back and watch cutscenes if you want.\nIf Zelda games are your thing, get this.

Set in a world following a huge magical war, you set off in search of your father, who in turn is hunting a massive sea monster known as Oceanhorn. Follow in his footsteps as you gather some strange relics in order to finally have the power to confront the beast and perhaps find your father.\n\nThe story is fairly lighthearted and quirky, with a very Zelda-like feel. Characters are all sketched out very quickly and loosely, and you're expected to really like people quickly. I didn't always find this to always be the case, but warmed to what the story was aiming for pretty quickly. I'm about 2/3rds of the way through the game at time of speaking (as far as I can tell), and am looking forward to diving even further in to what this game has to offer.\n\nPros:\n- Lighthearted, fun story, with a rich backstory and lore\n- Controls are really solid for PC, especially with it being a mobile port (don't let that scare you off, the game looks and plays like a PC native game, and the price is more than fair)\n- There's plenty of content to explore, lots of fun secrets, and cute puzzles\n- Great unlocks as you progress, opening more of the game to you and rewarding players who note down places of interest earlier in the game.\n- Interesting monsters to fight, with tactics to learn as you move forward.\n- Some really fun boss fights!\n- Graphics are charming\n\nCons:\n- Your character's attacks are sometimes a bit unresponsive about specific directions\n- The storytelling can be a bit weak sometimes\n- Puzzles are occasionally quite unclear, and solutions are sometimes just finding a hidden button under some breakables\n- Sailing is often pretty dull, which is a shame\n\nOverall, this game is a solid 7.5/10 so far, and is well worth picking up and playing. The asking price is more than fair, but getting on a sale is just icing on top. Will update if necessary when I finish this game!","February 8","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was very obviously a mobile port though. The UI was upscaled as to fit betting with playing with fingers and not a controller. It was also very clunky moving around the menu as well. The game as a whole felt very much limited. I understand it is a mobile port, but I didn't play it on mobile. I played it on my PC with a controller, and was really disapointed that it felt more like a mobile game that it looked.\n\nAside from that, the game didn't challenge me as much as I'd hoped. I kept collecting money hoping to buy some stuff, only, I didn't need any of what was being sold. I never needed health potions, magic potions yea a few times I probably could have had one, but it wasn't a big deal.

This is basically it. You even collect pieces of heart. None of the characters came off as sex offenders like in some of the Zelda games (Ocarina and Windwaker), so that might disappoint some.\n+ Music\n+ Graphics (though character models are a bit so-so)\n+ Mouse & Keyboard - You actually aim using the mouse, so that's pretty sweet, and the controls are responsive\n\nCons:\n- 3D terrain all over the place. i.e. the simplicity of Ocarina of Time's 3D maps and the 2D Zelda games' full view of the area give you a better sense of security and where everything is. I found myself doubling back too many times, because the terrain blocks you in different directions and is often annoying.\n\nConclusion:\nFrom what I've played so far, I can see that I lack the patience to get through this game, even though I hear it's short. It's just not the kind of game I can stick with, dealing with terrain like that. However, that's a personal choice on my part and not something I could classify as a disability of my own that the game is failing to live up to.

I really enjoyed it a lot. It's not a perfect game, and near the end it was getting grindy, but overall I had a good experience. The game has some simple puzzles, and lots of backtracking old areas with new skills. If you enjoy old school Zelda type 2D RPGs you will probably enjoy this 3D rendition. It looks good, and the audio is very remniscent of those old games. This game is basically retro without leaning on the retro crutch.\n\nCon: If there is any con, the Oceanhorn battle itself is a straight up glitch fest and getting 100% (done), left you at the mercy of chance in the kind of dumb fishing mini game. I was 98% for quite a while and absolutely infuriated that no amount of skill would prevail I had to rely on luck alone. Oh and the story, it's barely worth mentioning. I think the game could've played better without one, and the terrible voice acting it brought with it. I suppose you needed some motivation to press on, but I didn't care for it. A child could've penned this. In fact if they reveal that one of the developers children wrote it, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nOverall: worth a play if Zelda is your jam. Slash bushes, break jars, kill monsters, save the world.","April 3","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whereas most games have lovely ideas but lose the big picture, this game has, well, only a small idea but nails it. The idea: to make a smaller and indipendent version of "The Legend of Zelda". Some reviews compared it to The Wind Waker and they´re probably right. From the first to the very last moment you won´t get rid of the feeling that a certain Triforce and a green hat are missing. Nevertheless I´ll leave out comparisons and focus on the things that hit my eyes.\n\nThis game is not for hardcore adventure gamers, I fear, as it misses the great challenges. However, for beginners or "easy players" this game will be a great experience. You should read my notes under this assumption.\n\n+ short game time: A fact I like most of the times is if a game doesn´t take too much time to complete it. There may be some collectables left, but I finished most of the game and the story after around 9 hours.\n+ appropriate graphics: The game is designed lovely and nice to loook at\n+ easy and accurate controls: Played on a controller, there were no difficulties and the buttons are occupied cleverly\n+ easy puzzles: Whenever a chest is hidden or the way blocked, it won´t take a lot of experimenting to find the solution\n+ lovely music: well-composed, supporting the settimg - you will love to listen to it\n+ cute settings: suitable even for children\n+ easy boss fights...\n\n- ...which are really too easy. Once you found out the right tactic you can´t fail\n\nAs I said, Oceanhorn will not be the right game for hardcore gamers, however, fans of "The Legend of Zelda", beginners in the field of Adventure and lovers of cute stories will definitely have their fun with the game.","February 6","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whoever ported it did a good job at making it run well on computer as well as setting up controls for a gamepad. The world is comprised of islands that you must sail between in order to get different items. There are three dungeons; in which you must collect magic emblems in order to defeat a grand mechanical beast called Oceanhorn.\n\nUpsides:\n- A cute cartoony style.\n- Good enemy design.\n- Doesn't just explain everything to you. You have to explore and find out how to play the game (some might not like this).\n- Once I got into the right moodset for solving puzzles there is an island later on in the game called the Island of Whispers and it has incredibly well designed puzzles and atmosphere.\n\nDownsides:\n- Boring on-rails sailing between islands.\n- Some of the sounds are really annoying (like when landing from a drop).\n- There is a spell that allows you to drop a random item onto buttons to press them, but it doesn't do anything outside of the first dungeon. There are so many times where I thought that would be a great solution to an area, being able to press a button from far away, but they instead introduce a mechanic that is never used again.\n- Horrendously frustrating fishing mini-game. I really don't know why developers put these in they're never good.\n\n\nVerdict - You have to be observant to play this game well, or you might stuck a lot (I know i did), but I'd still suggest getting this game if it is less than $5.","May 27","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the fact that the camera is in an isometric view rather than top-down that can't be (from what I can tell using a controller) rotated, combined with a rather hilly landscape means tht there will be some things that you can't see in the game.  Sadly, that sometimes includes both you and hazards. Of course, that is my only real gripe, as the other controls are well-mapped (to the point that it really FEELS like Zelda), the landscape - well. seascape - itself is beautiful (tho it REALLY should have emulated Wind Waker more, IMHO.  I liked sailing to my destination myself, rather than picking an island and just going there with what amounts to a minigame or five along the way), the music is nice to listen to, and the story is also good (even if I find some dialog lacking). It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but it really pales in comparison to the series that rather obviously gave the creators inspiration.

It's quirky, imaginative and full of life. This is just about as close of an imitation as you can get without calling the protagonist Link and giving him a green tunic with a hood, but it has none of the appeal of it's ancestor.\n\nThe Zelda games were designed to consistantly amaze you. In Ocarina, climbing Goron mountain for the first time, exploring the Zora water caves, even travelling across the world on horseback, all of it is inspiring and innovative. The worlds tell their own stories. This has none of that. It's a mediocre copy/paste of Windwaker that does nothing particularly special to cement it's own place.\n\nJust about the only things it has going for it are a pretty decent soundtrack (which is never really complimented with spectacular scenary or tense circumstance) and the fact it's on PC and the Zelda games are not.\n\nThere are far worse games in existance, but why settle for this when it is decidedly average.\n","April 26","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't worry about the latter, you only get passive bonuses like being able to carry more bombs or sailing a little faster when you level up.\n\nThe only annoying thing: You can't skip sailing from island to island. It's not the sailing that is annoying, it's the flotsam, mines and even Oktoroks (I don't know their name in this game, so I'll use the Zelda one) which you have to shoot EVERY TIME you're traveling via boat. If you don't, you either arrive at your goal with low health or you die on the way to it.\nWind Waker made it so that you can lean back while your boat rushes across the ocean. If an enemy shows up it either gives up chasing you after a couple of seconds (Gyorg) or it keeps missing you with its shots (Oktorok). You can always choose to fight them for some extra rupees, arrows or bombs, but you don't have to.\nOceanhorn makes sailing a pain in the behind, because it always spawns stuff into your way and because your boat always sails TOWARDS it, which you can't prevent, since the game does not allow you to control your boat. A third of the game is literally "just sitting there and shooting at stuff".\nEnough about that.\n\nGraphicsAlthough it's a port of a smartphone game, the graphics are pretty nice. The faces may lack emotions, the talking animation looks a little jerky and the terrain consists of blocks (which you can NOT mine, dear hardcore Minecraft fans), but all that gives the game some sort of "unique artstyle".\n\nMusicThe (quite repetitive) soundtrack reminds of Final Fantasy, which is probably the dev's fault, since they "hired" Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito.\n\nConclusionYou're a Zelda fan? You enjoyed Wind Waker? Get this game.","March 20, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's apparently a mobile port but the quality is well enough that it is better than some games made for PC.  The easiest way to describe gameplay would be a mixture of the combat from Bastion and world design of TLoZ.  Game length took about 8 hours for me with a completion rate of around 62% leaving room to go back and do more if I wished.  Controls for the game are well done and frustration-free with either a controller or keyboard/mouse.  The music is great and really shines in certain areas of the game.\n\nThe two complaints I have about the game is the overall story of Oceanhorn which is not particularly gripping, following a generic hero story, and being unable to continue after you defeat the final boss to look for other collectables.\n\nNot a complaint but I feel that Oceanhorn could benefit from a new game+ mode that would add replayability.\n\nI was able to get the game in the Humble Jumbo Bundle 6 but you should definitely pick up Oceanhorn if there is a sale, it's easily worth it.","March 19","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got some really good Zelda-esque aspects in here with the music being beautiful and all the people charming. But then it leaves out some really crucial Zelda-esque things (and I mean if you're going to go for it, go all the way).\n\nThe good:\n+ Artstyle\n+ Music\n+ Story\n+ Inventory/Item switching\n\nThe Bad:\n- Movement controls are a bit sloppy\n- Boss battles are boring\n- There are unfixed glitches in the game that can really mess up your progress (for example, there was a boss that I could routinely get down to zero health and who wouldn't die. He would just fly around the boss room until I got impatient and let him kill me).\n- The game is often vague on what to do and not in a "here is a puzzle to solve" way, but in a "you can find one of the most useful rings in dark souls by climbing out a hidden tower and these ruins that don't look climbable, so you can go back to this area you didn't think you could get back to with no real markers or hints beyond a crow watching you" way.\n- It has the FF8 syndrome where you can get locked into a village with no way to level, get more hearts, get better weapons, etc. And you can't get off that island until you beat a boss. That glitchy boss I mentioned before. It sucked.\n\nThere is just barely enough for me to recommend this game and a lot of the good will it had built up was destroyed by the that stupid boss glitch. If you're looking for a Zelda-esque adventure on PC that reminds you of Windwaker without all the sailing, but with more boring enemies? This is your game.","May 29","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whoever ported it did a good job at making it run well on computer as well as setting up controls for a gamepad. The world is comprised of islands that you must sail between in order to get different items. There are three dungeons; in which you must collect magic emblems in order to defeat a grand mechanical beast called Oceanhorn.\n\nUpsides:\n- A cute cartoony style.\n- Good enemy design.\n- Doesn't just explain everything to you. You have to explore and find out how to play the game (some might not like this).\n- Once I got into the right moodset for solving puzzles there is an island later on in the game called the Island of Whispers and it has incredibly well designed puzzles and atmosphere.\n\nDownsides:\n- Boring on-rails sailing between islands.\n- Some of the sounds are really annoying (like when landing from a drop).\n- There is a spell that allows you to drop a random item onto buttons to press them, but it doesn't do anything outside of the first dungeon. There are so many times where I thought that would be a great solution to an area, being able to press a button from far away, but they instead introduce a mechanic that is never used again.\n- Horrendously frustrating fishing mini-game. I really don't know why developers put these in they're never good.\n\n\nVerdict - You have to be observant to play this game well, or you might stuck a lot (I know i did), but I'd still suggest getting this game if it is less than $5.","May 27","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
