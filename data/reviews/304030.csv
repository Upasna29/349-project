As you can see, I've sunk lots of time into this game.\n\nOne of the most amazing MMO's I've ever played that has everything, yet made thoroughly unenjoyable by the mechanics, hackers, and cash cow decisions by the publisher.\n\nArcheage has it all. PVP, PVE, Ships, Boats, Piracy, Farming, Harvesting, Crafting, player housing, good graphics and if the greedy developers weren't so well, greedy I'd still be playing.\n\nSo to the bad and why I quit.\n\n1. Hacker & Exploits. At launch and for a few months after it, hackers were able to exploit some serious flaws in the game that allowed them to become super super wealthy whilst legitimate players struggled.  This shafted the economy which as of now (March 2015) is in one hell of a mess with everything on the AH incredibly expensive.  Hackers were able to land grab very early on and as land was in such high demand, people would pay silly money for a small farmhouse.  It's only now due to the fact most people have left the game that land is available all over.\n\n3. Labor. In this game if you want to do anything related to farming, you spend labor points which once spent, regenerate over time. Now here's the giggle. If you log off, overnight you will generate enough labor points for around 10 mins of farming.  If you stay logged on, permanently, you'll gain double.  This system is designed to make money from the Korean player base who pay per hour for internet use. It has no place in the western market.  It's the main reason I quit the game.\n\n4. Gear. The best gear is crafted. Unfortunately the crafting system is so RNG based the only way you'll get gear is to buy it but because the economy is so borked, the good gear is so rediculously priced it's unreachable for the majority of players. I worked out that one bow was around £600 real money if you bought enough apexes to buy it.  Generating that kind of income can only be achieved via hacking.  What this ultimately has lead to is a small majority of players with the gear being able to one shot people in PVP.\n\n5. Cash Cow Attitude .Going back to point 3. Run out of labor? No problem, you can buy a Labor pot from the cash store or for around 100 gold on the AH.  Want to improve your gear, you'll need to play the RNG game with uber rare items. Don't worry though you can buy these uber rare items from the cash shop.. Want to sell your property? You'll need some appraisal tickets available from the cash shop.  Want that awesome weapon? Buy APEX from the cash shop and sell in game for gold.... The list goes on.\n\n6. The don't like constructive feedback if it's not positive.  I made only 2 posts on their forums, one was about how the labor system was hurting the game and driving players away. A couple of weeks later I tried to log into the forums and found my forum account had been 'permanently' banned. lol...  I created a support ticket which 2 months later is still unanswered. lol  This for me was actually the straw that broke the camels back and 3 days ago, reluctantly I cancelled my 4 accounts.\n\n7. Epic player abandonment. I've never experienced such an over subscribed game at launch which became void of players within 6 months. At the start the you had to queue for hours to get on. Land was so in demand, some folks after 3 months still could not find any free. Property was sold for silly amounts.  Every square inch of farming land was occupied. Fast forward 6 months later and land is available everywhere.  Go to arena and it's the same OP geared players over and over.\n\n8... I could go on.\n\n9... I could go on\n\n10. I've lost motivation to continue listing the reason this game is one to avoid.\n\nAll in all Archeage is a truly ground breaking MMO that is a victim of poor management and greed. It's such a shame because in the right hands this would be an MMO to invest all your time in.\n\nSeriously, just avoid it and spare yourself the inevitable pain and frustration that will come from playing this game.","March 28, 2015","false","016.7"," 5,565 of 5,861 people (95%) found this review helpful 298 people found this review funny","95","565","5","298","163"

Lets try this again.\n\nThis is an amazing MMO. In fact, its the best MMO I have ever played. The look of the open world, The feeling of the combat, and the sense of freedom in the large, player-driven world is enough to make any MMORPG fan happy.\nThe Farming Systems, Economy Systems, and Crafting Systems come together with the PVP System, Pirating Feature, and the Smooth PVE to create a Living World unlike anything you will see in an MMO to date.\n\nBut that is what makes this game unholy.\n\nEverything, all of the beauty this game has inside of it, the collection of wonderful features that could change the way people view MMO's, is corrupted and destroyed by the exploits of hackers, the incompetence of the developers, and the Satanic Bloodsucking Nature of Money Grubbing Corporate.\n\nBOTS\nBots in other MMO's are normally ignored by other players, as they are normally a simple "Click Report and Go" sort of situation. However, when your game is based around both a player driven economy and Mass PVP feature you have a bit more to worry about. Within a month, the games sandbox system was taking up by "Plot-bots" which bought out any land they could the second any land was open for players to buy. The entire crafting system and economy screeched to a halt when hardworking players were unable to find any space for plots. And administration is nowhere to be seen when these situations occur. Yep, they're busy dealing with people who were false accused of the same act by other players.\n\n"Well, Thats Ok. I can shrug off a few bots"\n\nGrinning and bearing is exactly what my Friend and I did for months, but sadly there was no escaping the tactics of the developers and publisher to get a quick buck.\n\nSATANIC MONEY GRUBBING LEECHES\nOh Yes, where else would a game-ruining conartist make his nest other than an Newly Born MMO? Perhaps a game of such polish and innovation could be made better with a few Microtransactions, Restricting Subscription Fees, and Shady Porting decisions? Well Congratulations to those who decided to stick with that idea, because you managed to make this game an unplayable wreck roughly a week into play. Lets start with the "Labor System". Labor points are used in almost any task involving the Crafting and Gathering systems of the game. Most players start off with a large sum of points when they log on for the first time, but these will fade quickly. When they do, you may not perform any more actions involving gathering, crafting, or opening coin purses (Source of Gold from Enemies) until they refill.\n\nF2P Players gain 5 labor point every 5 minutes, and have a max regen limit of 288 points per day.\n\nPremium Players gain 10 points every 5 minutes, have a max regen limit of 1440 points per day, and can regenerate while offline.\n\nThis was originally a system built around Korean Internet Fees, and has no place in the US Port other than to attract desperate players into buying a "Patron" status.\n\nThe Antichrist that is PATRON\nAnd Finally, to end this long rant that you have either spent way too much time reading or have just skimmed over to read the ending of, the Unholy Object that is Patron. Overall, patron is Trion Worlds way of saying "Premium" in all of their published games.\n\nWhile the Russian and Korean version have the same Premium systems, I'm going to just call it Patron because thats the word I repeated to myself whilst foaming by the mouth in the dark corner of my room.\n\nPatron is a good example of an MMO's Premium system punishing the poor and catering to the rich. Along with the the Labor system mentioned before, Patron gives many perks to Patron players, including:\n10% Bonus XP Gain\n10% Cash Shop Discounts\nNow these could be lived without of course. You could make yours way through an MMO without these perks, so whats so bad about it? Whelp, I didn't mention that it literally removes the 2 bigger aspects of the  SANDBOX  and  PLAYER DRIVEN  MMO.\n\nWithout the monthly pay of patron you will be unable to claim plots or post items on the auction house.\n\nWhile the Auction House may not seem like a big deal, the auction house is what drives the so called "Player Driven Economy" that the game boasted about so much. Same with claiming Plots as well, in fact. Plots were actually advertised as a main bullet point that the XL Games team seemed so proud to have created, and then restricted. Farming, Gathering, and Laboring are meaningless tasks thanks to this Patron system, and F2P players are essentially just Standby Props for the true player who have payed their monthly fees and can roam around completely free and happy while a dark sinking pit of remorse glooms endlessly in their gut.\n\nI will say it again, this is one of the best MMO's I have ever played.\nDon't Play It.\nPlease, Do not Play this game.\nIts already dead.\nIt was dead when it started.\nIts best we just move on.\nTreat it like that one beautiful, lovable Puppy that died of a stroke days after you got it.\nIts Traumatizing, but its gone.\nForget it.\nThank you.","September 12, 2015","false","104.9"," 2,353 of 2,541 people (93%) found this review helpful 605 people found this review funny","93","353","2","605","99"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shrum/recommended/304030/","shrum","World's Greatest Hamburger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shrum/","301 products in account","This is the best MMO I have ever played, and that only makes me hate it even more.\n\nThe "free" model of Archeage is a lie of omission. A person can, in theory, earn premium by grinding enough gold to buy a special item off the marketplace from someone else who payed real money for it. The problem with this is that you need a premium account to ever have any hope of making that kind of gold. The tradeskill system is the most interesting and varied part of this game, which is why Trion Worlds decided people should have to pay in order to use it. Sure, you can collect wood from that tree, but you need twenty five minutes worth of labor points in order to do so. Oh but don't worry, labor points regenerate offline... if you're a premium member. Other wise it's five points every five minutes for free players as long as they stay logged in, which is half the amount premium players get.\n\nThis is pay2win at its absolute most insidious. The subtlety of the paywalls that exist throughout the game are so well thought out that whoever thought of them should be given an award alongside a much more deserved punch in the mouth. I cannot tell you how many times I attempted to do something before being told it was only available to premium members, even though the game never tells you this at any point other than right before you try to do it. Oh by the way, remember that subscription item I mentioned? You actually need TWO of them to have enough credits to buy subscription days, a little fact this game specifically does not mention.\n\nIt's a shame because I've really been looking forward to playing this ever since it was announced, but Trion Worlds proves once again just how much they are willing to siphon the fun out of everything in the hopes of suckering players out of their cash. Their business model is to conceive a product that people want, and then transform it into something that nobody asked for.\n\nI'm not paying for premium, even if the game itself really is fun once you are allowed to play it. After what happened to End of Nations, the idea of giving any of my money to Trion Worlds makes me want to tear my own skin off. I hope now that they've ruined Archeage as well, more people will understand why I feel that way.\n\nGame score: A-\nBusiness score: F++\n\nSee me after class, you shysters.","March 30, 2015","false","30.2"," 1,696 of 1,863 people (91%) found this review helpful 165 people found this review funny","91","696","1","165","27"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrdeathprime/recommended/304030/","mrdeathprime","Mr. Death [Prime]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrdeathprime/","43 products in account","It pains me to write this review, but after 1,000+ hours and two toons leveled to max I think I'm in a safe place to critique ArcheAge. Simply put, this is simultaneously one of the most enjoyable and detestable games I've played. It has a huge open world, without loading screens (aside from the dungeons),  complete with soaring, climbable mountains and vast, mysterious oceans. It has a deep and rewarding farming/crafting system, with optional trade-runs to distant regions and continents. When you build your first boat, you feel like you have built a boat with your sweat and tears. When you complete that long trade-run to Freedich Island unmolested, its amazing. When you find someone fun and civil to run around with hunting for sunken treasure, its a great laugh. There are periodically re-spawning world bosses for all the fight against and fun little seasonal events (which usually give out rubbish freebies, but that’s neither here nor there. Its the thought that counts). Somewhere, deep inside ArcheAge there is a really, really good MMORPG.\n\nBut then, there is a dark side to ArcheAge.\n\n- It is a Korean Free-to-Play title hobbled by unreasonably grindy, gambling-centric, cash-grab nonsense. The RNG element of this game is simply breath-takingly awful. Success rates for upgrading equipment are so low that you won't even bother grinding for the huge amount of in-game gold required. Purchasable items offered to supposedly increase your chances seem to be utterly worthless and suspect. So, in response to the horrible mess which is regrading, some players prefer to take out their credit cards, purchase a load of labor point restoration potions from AA's cash shop and then sell them in the Auction House for in-game currency. They can then purchase whatever super-weapon they desire from auction. Amazing, right?\n\n- Everything, everything, requires painfully-slowly regenerating labor points (LP) - from opening coin purses, crafting, foraging, farming, mining, logging trees, identifying gear, doing trade-runs, and even ransoming lost XP when killed in PVE (!). The amount of LP used is proportional to the level of enemy you kill and regenerates painfully slowly. To rub salt in the wound, unless you have a subscription, its going to only regenerate when you're logged in. Subs also receive twice as much LP than free players. But either way, you'll find yourself routinely hobbled and prevented from making full use of the game’s economy, accumulating or throwing away loads of gold pouches and unidentified equipment. Because…\n\n- Inventory/warehouse space is extremely limited and there is no way to purchase additional space outside the Auction House or the cash shop (!!). Needless to say, this feeds once again into the ‘Pay to Win’ problem, because inventory expansion scrolls are bought from the cash shop using real money and sold in-game for virtual currency. At 129-200 in-game gold per upgrade scroll, you can make a tidy profit and gain a solid advantage over the poor souls grinding away for pennies.\n\n- The community. Man, what can I say about the selfish, sub-human specimens which dwell in ArcheAge's 'Faction' chat? Lots of unpleasant, trolling, often genital-related, angry, racist garbage in there. Don't bother asking for help, you'll get promptly ridiculed by barely literate pond-life. Alternatively, you'll just get ignored, which seems to be pretty common too (and preferable). Sadly, most guilds aren't much better. Do not trust anybody. Period. For example, if you're doing trade-pack runs, watch everyone regardless of faction. Your own guys will, without hesitation, turn on you, kill you, and steal your trade-packs. Said individuals will then be rewarded by joining the game's 'pirate faction' where they can troll and gank with absolute freedom. Don't expect the game's 'justice' system to help either. Violators are rewarded and punished by the whims of the randomly selected jurors, who are often amusingly related to the offender by guild affiliation. Trading via chat is also strongly discouraged, as glorified phishing is rampant.\n\n- The PVP. Want to have a one-sided battle against people who have been accumulating powerful equipment for several years? Want to be one-shotted by an immortal übermensch who mightily wields the power of his magical, enchanted credit card? Sure you do! Everyone loves unbalanced, frustrating PVP. This might have been fun when the game was in beta, long ago. It isn't anymore. Whether it be the 1v1 arena or large-scale battles, you don't stand a chance against people who have either been extremely lucky with the insane RNG system or have paid for equipment.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the crap ArcheAge’s developers have tainted their product with, but it gives you a very brief summary of the highlights (or should that be the lowlights?). I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its current state – there are just too many serious problems baked into the game to say that it is worth investing a lot of time, energy and cash into (and boy, do its developers want you to invest that). If you just want to fire it up, create a ninja mage with jiggling boobs, and briefly explore the world of ArcheAge, sure knock yourself out. But if you want to take it seriously and invest in it, please don’t bother– it will leave your bank account and your soul very empty in the long-run.","May 6","false","031.2"," 415 of 423 people (98%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","98","415","423","34","12"

What a great list of features! I was sold on this game right away, even made the decision to go in on Archeum. Let's see how that turned out:\n\nWhat you get\nYou know what I was hyped about? Making a guy who absolutely destroyed everything while nicely playing a banjo/flute to aid in my path of destruction. What ArcheAge delivered was one or two good combinations that could basically one-shot any other player. I desperately held on to the thought that this wasn't the case for the longest time out of everyone in my group and simply found myself worthless because I didn't spec into a specific set of spells.\nYep, you can go from point A to point B pretty plainly. Walking is well implemented. Oh, sorry, you were interested in flying and boating? So flying is alright. Unless you get a top-tier glider, you are stuck with basically just a glider, meaning you need to be generally above where you want to end up and do typical glider controls to get where you want to go. Now sea travel. Sea travel involves getting utterly destroyed by pirates and hilariously powerful sea creatures and not much else unless you voyage out at max level.\nHAH. So you want a house? Tough. This game is plagued by bots and hackers. As soon as any plot of land becomes available for a house/farming plot to be placed on it, a bot or hacker owns it. Literally instantly. One of my friends bought an auto-clicker mouse to try to get our group a house after a week of playing and not even that stopped the nearby hackers who had already claimed 8 houses that day. Now you're thinking "Oh, that's a cosmetic thing though. A shame, but purely cosmetic." Keep reading.\nCrafting/Harvesting is an absolutely core part of this game. The entire economy is based on it, the way you can get any of the gear or things you want require intense amounts of harvesting, crafting and bartering. Harvesting works by planting a crop/placing an animal, letting it grow for a few hours, then returning to collect it. If you plant/place in land you own, it is protected. If it's out in the open world however, your crops and animals are available for harvest to any player who happens upon them and returns when they're ready to harvest. Oh, did I mention you can't place houses/farming plots without being a Founder (which comes with a recurring fee)? Well you do.\nOn top of all of this, your crafting/building/harvesting/getting money from monsters you kill are all locked by two wonderful mechanics: Labor Points and Gilda Stars\n\nLabor Points are generated automatically during play time at an unbearably slow rate. They are then consumed by planting, harvesting, building, opening coin pouches dropped by monsters and other various things. This mechanic is a leftover of the game originally being from Korea, where there are laws limiting the amount of time people can play MMOs.\n\nGilda Stars are the true bane of this game. You use stars to purchase things like blueprints for boats, gliders, houses, vehicles and other various interesting items. These items range from costing around 30 Gilda Stars to several hundred if not thousands of Gilda Stars. So you're thinking, "What's wrong with this? It's a currency system." Well, naive reader, the problem is in how you gain them. Gilda Stars are gained by completing story quests. At a rate of 1-5 per quest (I'm being generous since I didn't complete the story and I assume they go to higher than the 2 I was getting per mission at level 20) and another even more ridiculous method. The only reason your number of Gilda Stars aren't capped based on how many missions there are in the game is because you can get them also by doing trade runs.\nTrade runs are an incredibly interesting concept. The idea is you gather a bunch of resources and transport them from point A to point B and get a reward for it. Here's what it involves:\nStep 1: Gather or purchase (from the auction house) a few hundred wood, fish or some other material.\nStep 2: Locate a special kind of crafting station and assemble your trade pack.\nStep 3: Trek across the world (by land, sea or a combination of both) to one of the npcs who will trade you Gilda Stars for your trade pack. Please note: You travel at an IMMENSELY reduced speed, making a decent mount required. Oh, and if you log out with the pack on, it will nicely wait a short period of time before dropping off of your character and onto the ground for anyone to steal, meaning you must spend at least a half hour  (depending on how far/profitable you want your voyage to be) just sitting at your computer to steer your character onto the path.\n\ntl;dr Promised combat variations are basically worthless and unbalanced, anything interesting about the travel is worthless until you're max level, resource gathering is a joke for many reasons, housing is a joke for the same reasons and more.\n\nPass on this and save yourself the time and money.","March 26, 2015","false","138.8"," 1,881 of 2,127 people (88%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","88","881","2","89","57"

You can buy charms and better scrolls for the "Chance" of a better outcome, but experience shows otherwise, your gear breaks and degrades just as fast as if you didn't have it. You can end up spending 8 hgours a day for a month grinding money to get the scrolls and gold enoguh to pay for the regrades, and have every single attemp fail, meaning everyhting you put in as a Patron (Subscribed) player was jsut wasted with nothing to say for it, and if your armor breaks you even spent a month grinding to lose your gear.\n\nFor these reasons, I highly suggest you don't play this game, you will only spend loads of time to get nothing to show for it, and you won't even have fun doing it.

I have atleast 1k hours on it.\nSteam says I have 5 hours or such. Please stop commenting on that. It's wrong. Thanks.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time. Why the negative review?\nThe game is broken in so many ways. I bought the most expensive EA pack back before the game was released. Actually, my whole guild bought EA packs. So that was $200.00 I spent. Long story short, I probably spent over $1000.00 ingame. It's really easy to do. That, in fact, is the games biggest flaw. The devs want your money. I feel like they want your money before they want you to have fun. That's a huge problem. From the get go they didn't want to open more servers. They opened one after another very slowly even thought it took hours upon hours waiting in line to get into the game at launch. Then eventually all of that was fixed. Then came the hackers and bots. You could walk around and see when a house was going to expire due to unpaid taxes. Then you could camp that spot once the timer was about to run out. Low and behold... it would get sniped. Plot sniping was a problem that developed due to hackers. They could be ANYWHERE in the map and somehow snipe up that plot you were stalking faster than you could say, "Ya.... NOOOO!"\n\nThen came Hasla. Don't even get me started on Hasla. So Hasla had some of the best weapons in the game. You had to grind mobs who dropped these stone things then turn those in to create a weapon. every mob dropped one. There were about 7 different types. You generally had groups big enough so that 2 people were assigned to each type of stone. 7 stones, 14 people. So you had a 1 out of 7 chance of getting your stone from a mob and then a 1 out of 2 chance of actually getting the stone if yours dropped. Also, you needed 150 of them. Then a month or 2 after that, the devs released Hasla tier 2 and 3 AT THE SAME TIME. We were all sick and tired of grinding and all FINALLY finished grinding out weapons out when BOOM. Now we had to brind all over again for about 3 times the amount of stones. I think they were actually called runes. But thats not the worst part. Hasla was also contested and the reds ALWAYS seemed to own the area that you needed to turn the stones in. SO yeah. You had to grind for like 15 hours to get all your stones. Then shortly after that I think they released chrystal shores. Yeah, you guessed it. Better weapons than Hasla. More grinding. FML.\n\nBut the bots. The Land Snipers. The Hackers. It never ended. Whenever you wanted something, someone was there to take it from you.\n\nBut didn't I say this is my favorite game of all time?\n\nYep. Because I also murdered, plundered, raided and conquered. We once attacked a fortress for no reason. The guild called in all their people to hold up there turf. They couldn't hold it. We pushed them COMPLETELY out of there fortress and into the spawn area. They couldn't leave it if they wanted to. Good times. I mean, we couldn't take the fort from them or anything, but it was a lot of fun to do it anyways. They looked like fools after that. We did that to them. And that is what is awesome about this game. You wanna visit pirate island and take it over for a couple hours and kill all the pirates? Go ahead. You wanna run around enemy territory and murder people for no reason? Go ahead. Do you wanna go into the starter zone of an enemy faction and shoot off fireworks? You can do that. Do you wanna attache your ship to a blimp and learn to fly? Yes? Well you can do that.\n\nI played soccer in prison in this game.\n\nI made friends in this game.\n\nI had more fun in this game than I have ever had in any other game.\n\nI just WISH that it wasn't ruined.\n\nToo bad.","September 22, 2015","false","5.4"," 552 of 631 people (87%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","87","552","631","73","17"

I am currently unemployed and spend 16 hours a day grinding mobs to earn money to purchase things in game. Yes, literally 16 hours a day farming non stop with 0 breaks.\n\nDuring this time I earn on average of 350-400 gold. A "top tier" item costs 20,0000 gold. A good item around 4,000 gold.\n\nIn 2 months of keeping this cycle religiously I have managed to obtain a full set of "good gear". My issue with this game comes from this. Trion allows people with great careers IRL come to this game and purchase a full set of "top tier" gear for around $5,000. There is around 20 people with this unfair advantage on my server that I will never be able to beat. Period.\n\nWith this latest update this same "gear" advantage has now been transferred to ship upgrades and ship combat. On top of allowing people to purchase vastly superior ships they have also put in 2 events that create 21,000 gold a day and 3,000 gold a kill roughly.\n\nSo these pay to winners are now earning more gold than you can possibly earn farming mobs because they can spend 5 thousand real life dollars to upgrade a ship you will never be able to compete with that also allows them to secure kills on 21k gold and 3k gold targets.\n\nThe End.\n\nI will never play another P2W or Trion title again with how utterly sick Archeage has left me.","May 21, 2015","false","218.7"," 1,286 of 1,534 people (84%) found this review helpful 214 people found this review funny","84","286","1","214","61"

THEY ARE ALL FOR PRE-ALPHA AND THEY ARE NOTHING BUT HYPE. THE PARTIAL REAL USER-SCORE FOR THIS GAME CAN BE FOUND HERE WHICH LIES AT 2/10, ALTHOUGH ALSO CENSORED:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?dist=negative\n\n------\n\nDo not mind my in-game hours. I played this game outside Steam. My name (in-game) is God and I am the world first 10 & 20 & 30 on the first, biggest and most influential server on the game, namely Shatigon. I'm here, wishing to tell you the story of ArcheAge, possibly one of the best MMO's in existence to be ruined due to corporate mismanagement. Let me tell you my story.\n\nI was one of 'the' most excited invidiual to play ArcheAge as the PC gaming market just had It's two worst years in the longest of times and the promises of an MMO where you could own land, farm and go pirating on the seven seas sounded too good to be true when combined with beautiful graphics, both on land and on water: http://imgur.com/KXTCrbF\n\nWaiting for the ArcheAge Head Start was one of the most agonizing times of my life to be spent doodling over a clock for weeks and months, but playing the closed & open beta kept me sane somewhat as I perfected a "speed-run" route to reach levels as quickly as possible, and It paid off as I also managed to combine it with being THE <-- first guy to log in onto the servers: http://imgur.com/YoxgaEk\n\nAnd grabbing the two best names in the game: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/706277591696095836\n\nAnd lucky that - Because the spawn area got so pounded and showered in players, people were either crashing or having their game hang from too much many characters to render or they were either completely stuck, as player collission is a thing in this game: http://imgur.com/nnpnnq2\n\nUnfortunately though, being the first guy ahead, I had to do things like dungeons all by myself or invite people that were way below the intended level, forcing me to adapt a "Tank, Healer, DPS" spec that ended up being incredibly inefficient and costing me the world first 40 and 50 achievements. Fun times were had though: http://imgur.com/LvQAGpe "Come at me bro, I'm God, you don't got nothin' on me"\n\nOr the times where my flyer bugged and my character would look like he was flying on his own while clad in iron and a fabulous cloak, resembling an angry Norse god that is on a quest for vengeance http://imgur.com/T2i6W9n\n\nThe loss of "World first 40 and 50" ended up not affecting me severely, at all. Why? Because I was one of the first to see one of the huge "ArcheAge Design Problems" for myself.. And that was the player housing zones: http://imgur.com/oL0NbHw\n\nThey were the incarnation with that of digital cancer - Every single player hoarding and wasting AS MUCH space as humanly possible using cheap and very large "Cottages" that costed nothing to build. leading to all the building space being nothing short of overrun a few hours after the HEAD START begun for paying players. Thought the free players would get any when the head start was over? HAHAHAHA. No. Not for 3-6+ months afterwards when people's premium started running out and they didn't bother re-subbing due to the game being a giant catastrophic flop and riddled with issues, like the player "Trial" system - although I only personally had laughs with that due to people's reactions from what the server messages sent out: http://imgur.com/WQsCB5F\n\nAs competition rose, the heavy stench of PVP started to pop up nigh everywhere after level 30 with the game forcing you to eventually venture into "contested" areas and eventually, the enemy continent where you will be ganked endlessly trying to do quests. While I personally slammed down noobs higher than my level in contested trying to gank me for some quick pvp points..: http://imgur.com/m4EyYYa\n\n..People eventually grew the "Intelligence" to group up with other weak individuals that couldn't stand on their own and thus, did the overwhelming current "Meta" of this game for people to do nothing but gank, gank, gank and gank get born, more than often combined with also picking on lower level players: http://imgur.com/WYWYaLP\n\nNeedless to say, this blazed COMPLETELY out of control, just a day or two after the headstart, PVP zones would become nothing but this: http://imgur.com/GAEz1ER\n\nGroups after groups after groups, packed to the brim with people, hump-ganking any possible opportunity to gank people for pvp points instead of playing the actual game. Remotely 'fair' or equal world PVP quickly became an impossible reality and thus, people who wanted to have a somewhat equal/fair fight was bashed by the community to oblivion and forced to play the "Gladiator Arena".. Which ended up being the most unfair place for PVP of them all as It was filled with nothing but absolute tryhards that have pay-2-winned their character to oblivion (more on that below): http://imgur.com/7nAjRJA\n\n\nWhich brings me to list 3 devastating beyond repair problems ArcheAge has:\n\n\n1. Proper class-balance is nonexistant and only a very few set of "specs" (People can have 3 different classes at once in this game and spec points in them accordingly for a total of 120 different types) have been rendered viable for any remote level of competitive play in PVP or even PVE. Every single one of them was very well known since the game has been released in Korea before we got it (more on that later) and EVERYONE who was even remotely interested in being successful stuck to them, for good reasons: http://2p.com/8825498_1/ArcheAge-The-Most-Viable-And-Popular-Classes-by-AnotherInfinity.htm\n\n2. The game is factually, by the English definition, a massive pay-2-win title. There's no way to sugar-coat it. You buy things like Labour potions and either sell them on the market for insane amounts of cash or use them yourselves to bypass the time restrictions this game has put on players and rocket-boost your character's ability to say, craft the best items by practicing professions with no end and buying the materials off the auction house from the cash you got from selling Labour potions and/or the stuff you create with your profession.\n\nDon't want to do that? Well, just buying the best items on the Auction House works as well (if there are any available) because the gear you can get from just doing open-world PVE in this game is absolute rubbish in comparison to even sub-par basic crafting and It's only made worse by the "Regrading/Enchanting" elements of the game that put your items in the realm of Random Number Generators and force you to gamble repeatedly In order to give them better/optimal stats.. Even If you have to repeat it and gamble 500 times, costing you MASSIVE amounts of money & resources.. Unless you buy "Less Gamble Risk" items for RL cash. The pay-2-win in this game has been made fun of and antagonized to death with by literally everyone who played it, even the people who pay-2-win themselves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UETXpCH1o\n\n3. The game is not owned, nor fundamentally developed by Trion Worlds and It has instead been "Rented" to the NA and EU market from XL Games.. Which means Trion Worlds have to beg XL games for permission to do tiny changes in the game and thus, crippling any potential serious change, improvement or addition to this game.. Meaning, ArcheAge for us not living in Asia is a forever doomed and mismanaged disaster of a video-game and It will never get any significantly better as the audience is dying EXTREMELY quickly, witnessed by Trion World's desperate move to put it on Steam.","March 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 1,729 of 2,077 people (83%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","83","729","2","131","19"

Trion heavily tries to censor whistle blowers, which is a bad sign to begin with. The game has no story, which is fine, it is supposed to be a player driven world, with player lore. However, the players control over anything in this game is non existent. The Auction House where players can trade thier crafted or farmed goods to drive a stable economy is constantly manipulated by Trion and the barrage of pactches that there is no way to predict what will make you profit. One day the best armor in the game will be 25,000gold and the next it will be worth 4,000gold, its rediculous.\n\nEvery aspect of the game has the highest amount of potential but is brought to ruins by either XL or Trion poor managment decisions.\n\nHere is a short list of some problems with the game.....\n\n1)In korea, all customizable equipment is crafted by the artistry profession, in NA, all customizable equipment is in the cash shop but artistry still exists to craft absolutly nothing.\n\n2)The Economy is constantly manipulated by bots and the producers dumping product at set prices directly into the player driven auction house.\n\n3)Every patch is botched, essentially boosting small lucky groups above the rest of the player base due to glitches and exploits, such as a few hundred players recieving numerous starter packs when only purchasing one, miscoding the most crucial land claim nodes in the game so they instantly repawned at the dead player respawn, or giving rediculous compensation to players who have quit as an incentive to return such as much valued mounts, gold, and tons of other valuables.\n\n4)RNG, its everywhere. I am a fan of RNG but not on everything! I dont need my plants to have RNG, and my drops, and my regrading, and my crafting, and my fishing, and my buffs, the list goes on and on and it can kill a players experience. MANY have left because of this alone\n\n5)Gameplay is based on strong player population, and there isnt one. People will say there is to help draw ppl in but just as i once was, the ppl who praise this game are addicted and in denial or the top 4% who got lucky from glitches.\n\n6)You can destroy your own ship over and over again for profit.....\n\n7)All mounts are normalized as is everything else in the game unlike in the other versions around the world\n\n8)All major daily events are scheduled for the middle of the day while everyone is at work, Freedich Gold Trader is at 4pm EST/1pm PST, abysmal sea is at 5pm EST/ 2pm PST and Mistmerrow is so much earlier, im not even sure when it happens......This also leads to the empowering of one group, whichever can be on at those times.\n\n9)Trion does not care about its customers, just check the general discusions forums and youll find tons of posts with players asking for assistance from GM's and getting snotty BS responses that basically tell the players to go F yourself.\n\nThe list could go on and on with specific examples like the castle debocle, dolphingate, the archeum tree scandal, or the swindling of archeum from coinpurses by increase the drop rate but decreasing the quality of the drops, effectivly giving us less and telling us we're getting more. And that basically sums up the game right there, you'll always be told you're getting more when infact you will recieve less....or find an exploit and be rich","May 6, 2015","false","666.0"," 538 of 631 people (85%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","85","538","631","28","18"

I played this game a lot prior to its re-release on steam.\n\nArcheAge. I will now try to explain ArcheAge using my personal experience in a story-like way to sum up the downfall.\n\nSo lets say we have a hype train called ArcheAge. This MMORPG train is unlike any other (supposedly) and will be the train that will pierce the heavans. Revolutionary right? So you get your ticket to board on the hype train, but what's this? There's a queue. Well that's to be expected since its the freak'n hype train that will pierce the he- wait hold up 3 hours to queue in!? Well it's the hype train so I'll wait those 3 hours. I finally get to board in and explore the wonders that this game provides. Boy it sure is packed in the passenger peasant free to play seats... I wonder what the 1st class patreon carriages are like? Oh that's also jammed packed and had a queue. Okay. So I try to wander about and do my begginer quests to level up and stuff but since so many people where jammed packed at the start it was hard to kill basic mobs. After managing to part away form the giant cluster-♥♥♥♥ horde and moving on up the train, that was still hyped, I managed to do quests normally without the fear of being KSed. Bumpy start for the hype train but it was still good and...wait a miute, who the ♥♥♥♥ names them selves Kkknnnjjj,Hjkhjkhj, and sdfesdf. Also why are they speaking jibberish in the chat about selling me gold? These are ♥♥♥♥ing bots. Well what ever. I'm sure the conductor of the hype train will solve that issue soon right? Right!?! Anywho we move on to our quest for leveling up to 50 (as that was the max level at the time). I decided to be a Justicar because transmuting health/damage as a healer tank sounded pretty good to me. Wait what's this? A list of classses I SHOULD be so I don't insta die in pvp? Daggerspell, Darkrunner, Abolisher, Stone Arrow, ect. But what if I don't want to be those classes? Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad cause now I suck. So half-way through leveling up I decided to be a Templar cause I like supporting my DPS friend who was a Shadow Blade. As a Templar, my specialties included t̶a̶n̶k̶i̶n̶g̶,̶h̶e̶a̶l̶i̶n̶g̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶e̶a̶m̶  not dying as fast as other people. So onward back to being useless and needing help to finish quest cause I was KSed by superior classes. Hey what the hell happened to the train? Why are there suddenly less people? Wait they bailed out the hype train? But it's so hype. Ahh well I'm sure things will brighten up once I reach level 50 and do more interesting things such as mindlessly trading packs back and forth because I chose a terrible class to be and tried to level up my other skills. Also the exciting daily quests you do over and over and over to get gilda stars. After 50 days of doing the same thing over and over I can finally afford a boat BLUEPRINT so I can trade packs slightly faster than before. Oh I have to gather materials and use labor points to build said boat? Well okay I mean that would only make sense. Alrighty the boat's done now I can start trading intercontinentally an- "You lack the sufficient labor points." Oh...w-well I guess I'll get more labor points. How do I do that again? Stand around and don't do anything labor related? Okay so being afk I guess that's not too bad I mean I'll just sit here and may- "You have been disconnected for being afk." Well ♥♥♥♥. I guess I'll have to punch this scarecrow all night while I sleep. Oh lookie I made enough labor points to have 30 seconds of labor related fun and 5% exp. Yaaay~ Well I guess while I wait for labor points to stack up again I could try to go to Hasla and farm up for good gear. Hello fellow Harranians. Wait why are you attacking me? This is your farming spot? Wait hold on can't we share? OH GOD PLEASE NOT THE SEPTER! That was the day I found out Templars are the mages ♥♥♥♥♥es. Well ♥♥♥♥ I can't farm Hasla cause I dont have good gear and I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ class. I don't have good gear cause I can't farm Hasla. I guess I'll try GHA and...oh you want a Daggerspell? I'm a Templar. Oh you don't want a Templar. Oh okay bye. Uhh alright it's not all bad I mean I could just mindlessly grind those trade packs every once in a while and squeeze out as much exp possible so I can be a better class. Ummm this train is kinda getting dirty and sticky and unmaintained. I'll go check in with the conductor to see how things are going. Maybe pick up a patron along the way and hopefully make this game a little less of a chore. Sweet patron, now I can go out and own land and make a decent living and make decent exp at a faster rate than before and- wow do those bots claim and make houses fast. Well ♥♥♥♥ing hell. I guess with this faster labor regeneration I can level up slightly faster but I still don't have appropriate gear for ANYTHING. Sure I could craft some really good gear but I was slapped endlessly by the merciless RNGesus. Ehh things could start getting better though right? I'll knock on the door to contact the conductor of the train. Hello? Conductor Trion? You there? Huh? A note? "Thanks for the cash lol gg have fun." -XLGames. Wait wha- no...noo! Oh god the rails end at the edge of this mountain and the hype train is going to fall off. OH ♥♥♥♥ THE HYPE TRAIN IS CRASHING. Boom explosions and train noises. Those that survived the hype crash tried to make a living only to get stomped on by the far richer and much more handsome top class players who threw their cards and money as sacrifices to their unholy God known as Cash Shop. I was scared and alone trying to find someone who wasn't brainwashed into "paying to be  better than you in an online video game". Off in the distance I see a girl with luscious flowing hair and didn't have a patron mark branded on her forehead. I asked her in high hopes what her name was. She just blankly stared at me as she walked off to a random NPC. I whispered her named to my self as my last hope slowly vanished away and my sanity withered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/defiance7/recommended/304030/","defiance7","Deffy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/defiance7/","1112 products in account","With this review I'm oficially done with this game and never coming back. I tried to give it a chance multiple times, but it disappointed me every time.\nArcheage has a couple of major problems, some of them I can live with, but there's just way too many.\n1. P2W\nI'd love to say the game is straight up pay to win, but it's not exactly the truth. It's more like "pay to advance a lot faster than others", so unless you are a complete casual and you want to play single player inside an MMO, you gotta pay. "Patron" a.k.a. "premium" service is pretty much essential. If you don't have it, your ingame progress takes ages. If you have Patron, you generate "labor points" twice as faster as non-patron users AND - more importantly, you generate them even while you're offline.\nYou can't do anything without labor points, you can't collect crops, chop trees, mine iron, you can't even equip newly found items unless you "identify" them first - which costs labor, of course.\nSo the first thing you wanna do as a free to play user is get premium - patron. Anyone can purchase "APEX" for ingame gold. Now that sounds pretty good right, just earn some gold, get Patron and roll with the big kids. Oh, also people can purchase APEX for real life money ($10). So it works the other way too - want some quick cash? Buy APEX for real money. That's the first major problem I have with this game - anyone can get really rich really fast as long as they pay.\nOh, did I mention damage and protection boosters? Yeah, you can buy that, too.\ntl;dr: Basically you can buy gold ingame at any point for real cash, thus getting head start early. Premium is essential for further progress.\nThe second issue with Archeage is connected to the first.\n2. Gold becomes worthless really fast, huge inflation\nImagine you just started playing as a free to play user on a new Archeage server. What's the first thing you want to get? APEX, obviously. Or, in case you don't know what else to do with irl money - quick cash so you can start off real fast. So immediately people start selling and buying APEX. What happens after a couple months ingame? People that were selling APEX early on, don't really need gold anymore. So the APEX that is on market, starts being super expensive, especially since a lot of people stacked APEX early game (because they know the price will rise).\nNow if you're a casual sandbox player - you don't pvp that much and you don't sit at auction house all day long and check on prices and ways to earn some extra gold easily, the way that you as a casual player earn more money is by trading trade packs - ingame items that you can craft by spending labor points. The issue here is the fact, that the gold you can earn for trading packs is fixed, while APEX price varies depending on supply/demand. So the longer the game (server) goes on, the more worthless gold becomes and thus it gets even more Pay to Win than earlier.\ntl;dr: Huge inflation makes it very difficult to buy premium later on, unless you spend a LOT of time ingame.\nAnd this issue is once again connected to the third one.\n3. The game encourages you to be a d***\nSo like I said, one of the ways of earning gold is having your own farm and crafting trading packs. That's my preferred way of playing - just chill at my farm and trade stuff. Another major way of earning gold is being a d***. The gold you get from trading packs depends on quality of the product AND more importantly - where you deliver it to. The further you travel, the more gold you get. The most gold you can get is by traveling to pvp zones. Now obviously there's a risk that you get killed by the opposing faction. That's completely reasonable. What is not reasonable, is the fact that you can get killed by your own faction as well. Now there's a "punishment" crime system, which is actually not punishing at all and doesn't even matter. So what this leads to is your own people camping near popular trading paths and destroying trading carts with your hard earned packs and potentional money that you earned through lots of work and time spent. You can't even imagine how frustrating is getting your cart destroyed and robbed.\nThat's not all though! Since having a "land" is a major way of earning money - you can grow crops, trees and build your own house there, it's super important to have one and frustrating if you don't have it. Now for some f-ed up reason, the amount of land available is limited by the game. There're specifically appointed places where you can build your farms/houses and you can't do it elsewhere. Early in the game, people literally hunt the best housing plots and place their houses so they block the largest place possible, just so they can build more stuff later OR sell the plot for mad gold.\ntl;dr: Two of the reasons why the game encourages you to be d*** - murder your own people and steal as much place as possible.\n4. Land\nLike I said previously, having some land is extremly important. 50% of the game focuses on trading, crafting and housing, none of that is possible if you don't own a plot. Following previous paragraph, after you started playing and spent two weeks ~ish finally earning two APEX (you need two to get Patron), the next thing you look into is probably getting a plot so you can build a house. BUT SURPRISE! There's no more housing space, because the people that wanted a head start spent real life money to buy Patron and took all of the space available. So what does a peasant do? They have to either buy a plot from one of those hoarders mentioned in "3." or they gotta search for an expiring plot - yes, plots expire and get destroyed if you don't pay taxes weekly, tax certificates can be bought for irl cash (obviously) or labor points (a lot of them - if you want more, buy them with irl cash..), so even after people build a farm, they often stop playing because there's the need of playing the game every day so you can buy tax certificates and... be able to keep playing... yeah it doesn't make any sense, I know. Blame Trion, not me. You gotta play so you can play more... If you stop playing for a week and come back later, say good bye to your house. Like I said, people without house plots can find an expiring plot and build their stuff there. BUT SURPRISE! Hackers! Scripters! Waiting an hour for a plot to expire and get it for yourself? Nope! Wild scripter appears and takes it for himself INSTANTLY to add to his collection consisting of 20 other house plots.\ntl;dr: Do we have scripters? Yes, we do. The game is extremly unforgiving if you don't play at server start OR if you decide to stop playing even if just for a week.\n5. Everything takes so long...\n...unless you pay. As I said, you need labor points to do stuff, you earn these while playing if you're a f2p user, or both online and offline if you're a Patron. However, even as a Patron the amount of labor you get is not even nearly enough if you want to progress fast. Everything costs so much labor, especially if you wanna craft those sweet expensive items. Oh, also as far as itemization goes - you can upgrade every weapon and armor piece you get for free! But! It can get destroyed in the process... Unless! You can buy a scroll thingy that makes your odds of upgrading the item way higher (but not 100%). Now it is possible that you buy it and the item still gets destroyed. Imagine spending cash for absolutely nothing. That's ArcheAge.\ntl;dr: You can't be the best in the game unless you are an everliving vampire OR you spend real life currency.\nThat's probably it as far as the major cons go.\nThere's a couple possitive things about the game though:\n1. Great graphics for an MMO and very detailed environment, some locations are truly breathtaking.\n2. One of the few sandbox MMOs with pretty advanced crafting system.\n3. Combat system is decent and classes are very customizable.","October 15, 2015","false","427.3"," 194 of 224 people (87%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","87","194","224","15","4"

I've been online on this game for about 3500 hours, and at least 2500 of those actively playing. So I will be writing my review based on the thousands of hours I've played the game for.\n\nLets just start with the simple stuff that has you looking at this game..\n\nHousing/Farms = Must be a patron to own (Paid sub, can also be bought with in game money, but the labor cap will make this a bit hard and tedious (yes this game uses the "Energy" feature like in some facebook games, of course this is only for.. pretty much EVERYTHING except killing mobs) it is possible to obtain though so I won't say its not.\n\nBoats/carts/mounts = Can be obtained within the game without having to be a patron at all.\n\nThe game is open world, there is no paid section or anything you can access everything in the game, including other peoples houses who do not close their doors. You can also take peoples boats/carts as long as they do not "Owners Mark" Thats a skill that you can spam on any vehicle to protect it from anybody taking control for a whole 3 minutes.\n\nAnyway lets talk about crafting.\n\nCrafting is simply, Make Tier 1 item and then use tier 1 item to make tier 2 item, and so forth. No in depth at all in this department, and that applies to all the crafting, including cooking.. can you imagine.. using that old ♥♥♥ bread sitting in your bank for weeks and weeks.. to make another one today? Yeah gross but then again  can't really ask for logic in a MMO.\n\nRNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG\n\npretty much everything is RNG in this game.. ESPCIALLY crafting.. here is a little example how RNG makes this game a grind/pain..\n\nSo you make t1 t2 t3 t4 t5, without any problem. Now here is where you will notice the giant hand comming at you to take your time and money..\n\nYou can go ahead and craft T6 now, but oh wait its sealed.. meaning that it can end up being\n\nIllustrious Desert Sword\nIllustrious Meteor Sword\nIllustrious Stone Sword\nIllustrious Summer Sword <--- It has to come out like this in order to be upgraded to T7\n\nNow T7 eh.. is the same at T6, same odds again and still need to get a Summer Sword in order to upgrade..\n\nSo T8 eh..\n\nEpherium Desert Sword\nEpherium Earth Sword\nEpherium Flame Sword\nEpherium Life Sword\nEpherium Meteor Sword\nEpherium Stone Sword\nEpherium Summer Sword <-- again has to come out exactly this one in order to proceed to T9\n\nSo T9 now ehh\n\nSame as T8 and then of course T10.. You'd say woot finally last tier right? Yes indeed.. but unless you'd settle for ANYTHING you'd be somewhat upset to find out that ITS ANOTHER RNG SEALED ITEM!!! GOOD LUCK!\n\nAyanad Desert Sword\nAyanad Earth Sword\nAyanad Flame Sword\nAyanad Life Sword\nAyanad Meteor Sword\nAyanad Stone Sword\nAyanad Summer Sword <-- Oh Look its the Summer Sword again.. Well ♥♥♥♥.. You probably want to avoid getting that as end result seeing as it has the stats of a hybrid weapon so its useless all around!!!  Good luck not getting the upgradeable version of the last tier weapon you can craft lol.. of course if they do announce an expansion that will add even higher level weapons.. then by all means pray for it!\n\nPPPPPS: This literally applies to all the ARMOR, WEAPON, JEWELS crafting in the game.\n\nSo GOOD LUCK! Don't forget your mastercard!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!\n\nPS I forgot to mention customer service.. wow how could I forget customer service.\n\nLong story short, got hacked twice by one person who even admitted to doing it on forums and live support did absolutely nothing. (Took about 2 months of waiting on live support, provided with all the proof and threats from this particular hacker it was not enough to get him banned or get me my items back.. I guess his credit card was better than mine.)\n\nLost a quest reward.. never got it back because "Item was lost for too long"\n\nTread carefully and remember to put on the authenticator for your account and whatever email you use. Because if something were to happen.. do not rely on customer service to get your issues resolved, they are only there for credit card issues and anything that involves them getting money.\n\nI guess I'll also add, exploits.. so many.. I've had a few friends do a trade with other players who miraculously are able to change the amount of cash shown after the trades are accepted.\n\nScamming is allowed in this game, just like EVE and every other political influenced open world game. Although a lot of exploits are also permitted with a slight 1 day ban or mute for abuse.\n\n\nI will say it right now, the game is Pay 2 Win. No Exception. If you do not pay you no win!, do a simple search for Kooncoon on youtube or google or twitch and you will see what I mean.\n\nAside from that I've met some really amazing people in this game and I'm sure you would too regardless of how bad the game is.\n\nAlso know this review will not stop you, so see you in Kyrios West!\n\nPS this game has no story, or atleast nothing worth mentioning.\n\n\n\n(Update: 11/10/2015)\n\nI just wanted to add one more thing for those who are looking for quality in customer service.. you will not find it here. This game literally drops you in a world were even customer service will abandon you, if you're wondering what I mean..\n\nWell if you accidentaly delete anything you wanted.. including ONE TIME quest items it is gone for good. You will NEVER get them back no matter how many tickets you submit or talk to live support they can't help you with this for some reason.. I can't even begin to understand how it is so hard for this cryengine 3, AAA mmorpg poblished by what was to be a mediocre (now utter poop balls) company to recover items within its own game.. would you get any sort of compensation for the abscense of this miracle addition that most games have had for the past 10+ years?\n\nDid I also mention that the sheer RNG in this game will turn everybody against you? You will be incredibly lucky to find anybody trust worthy in this game due to its strick RNG policy. I guess you can say even friendship is RNG in this game.\n\nAnyway you have been warned, I've also quit this game officially.","March 26, 2015","false","817.6"," 381 of 473 people (81%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","81","381","473","29","5"

The game is on life support, not due to player density, but due to people actually working on the game, trion layed off a ton of people who were working on archeage before it was even released, even multiple programers who worked on this have stated that it is beyond fixing at this point\n2.) While it is not pay 2 win, it is pay 2 progress. What does that mean?\nAll actions you due in terms of crafting or farming or anything else requires "labor" every action has its own point value, no big deal, but free to play players only have a cap of 2,000 labor, you can go through that in a second if you craft to level up your character or try to increase your trade, this is where a portion of the micro trans come in, you can buy potions to recover your labor (labor usually takes a long time to recover if your a freebie) OR you can upgrade to prem or buy potions and pay for prem for a month or so, or buy these time prems from other players via the marketplace, which boosts your labor to 5,000 with an increase recovery rate. (I was a prem due to buying alpha) Now why is this a bad thing you might ask? On paper it is great, players who work hard can get the benifits of prem without ever cracking open their wallet, but I have friends and guild members who on multiple times the game would not register their activation of these items but still concidered it used, this is not fun when you paid a lot of gold or items to get these time cards.\n\n3.)  Yes, there are a TON of classes, a huge buy for the game was the insane amount of classes you could make, only one issue, not all classes are created equal, when it boils down to it, there are really only maybe 4-5 classes that are the best or "top tier" you can be kicked from parties or dungons for not being one of these, and these 5 classes are OVERPOWERED compared to all the other classes, at one point all I ever saw was daggerspells, what fun is diversity when it is obvious the game is catering to certain playstyles/classes?\n\n4.) This goes back to 1, you can literally never touch a quest, or mob, or anything if you are premium, why you might ask? Because of crafting and mining, if you have the labor and an XP boost, you can max in a week, this is why I said pay to progress, while it is not needed, it is such a HUGE difference in the time it takes, which kills any point of even doing PvE\n\n5.) The game tries SO HARD to show you how pretty it looks, yes it looks amazing for an MMO, massive props to the devs on this, but the world itself seems so bleak/uninspired, it feels like any other MMO you've played, the quests are generic, the fightinig is generic, the art style is generic, even the music for the most part seems like it was just smacked in the middle.\n\n6.) Servers and updates; There have been MULTIPLE times that servers have been offline for DAYS with no real answer from the devs as to what is going on, nobody is expecting an instant answer, but when it gets to the point where people start making "HL3 confirmed, archage servers are up" jokes without a single responce from devs, that's a little bad.\n\n7.) Housing; Yeah, good luck with that, unless you are on a fresh made server, you'll have to hawk every spot that hasn't had it's bills paid on time, and usually either someone will just PK you so they get the spot or a bot will insta build when the property comes up for sale, this can be massivly frustrating for anyone.\n\n8.) In the end, the game later on feels more like a job rather than a game, you usually end up becoming a slave to the economy in terms of just spam trade packs across the sea or to your local dealers or making items for others and selling them on the auction house.\n\n9-ish.) This is more of a subjective issue, but on my server there was a well known youtuber who would stream and record his gameplay, getting a ton of his drones to hop on and try the game, long story short, a lot of stuff pointing towards some GM's giving him little extra's for advertising their game, such as buying stuff that was not out yet for the game. I do not have proof to link, but if you search around you will find a lot of talk about this issue.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\n1.) This game shows you how to do PvP right, even if the classes can ruin it, it always feels responsive and fluid\n2.) The crime system is pretty fun, getting a bounty on your head and having to defend yourself in court ran by player jury leads to great and funny confrontations\n3.) Sailing, beyond fun with a band of friends or guild, feels like windwaker in that aspect that you can sail forever and not get bored, just look out for pirates or the other continent or worse...THE KRAKEN!\n\nOverall the game was great for a while but it is like a giant inflatible castle with a hole in it, it only goes so far.\nAre you looking for a long term MMO to get into? I would skip this one\nGot some friends who play this and want to hop on every now and then? Go for it\nIs this a "WoW" killer? No\n\n\n4/10","March 29, 2015","false","14.9"," 333 of 412 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","333","412","15","11"

In fact, its the best MMO I have ever played. The look of the open world, The feeling of the combat, and the sense of freedom in the large, player-driven world is enough to make any MMORPG fan happy.\nThe Farming Systems, Economy Systems, and Crafting Systems come together with the PVP System, Pirating Feature, and the Smooth PVE to create and Living World unlike anything you will see in an MMO to date.\n\nBut that is what makes this game unholy.\n\nEverything, all of the beauty this game has inside of it, the collection of wonderful features that could change the way people view MMO's, is corrupted and destroyed by the exploits of hackers, the incompetence of the developers, and the Satanic Bloodsucking Nature of Money Grubbing Corporate.\n\nBOTS\nBots in other MMO's are normally ignored by other players, as they are normally a simple "Click Report and Go" sort of situation. However, when your game is based around both a player driven economy and Mass PVP feature you have a bit more to worry about. Within a month, the games sandbox system was taking up by "Plot-bots" which bought out any land they could the second any land was open for players to buy. The entire crafting system and economy screeched to a halt when hardworking players were unable to find any space for plots. And administration is nowhere to be seen when these situations occur. Yep, they're busy dealing with people who were false accused of the same act by other players.\n\n"Well, Thats Ok. I can shrug off a few bots"\n\nGrinning and bearing is exactly what my Friend and I did for months, but sadly there was no escaping the tactics of the developers and publisher to get a quick buck.\n\nSATANIC MONEY GRUBBING LEECHES\nOh Yes, where else would a game-ruining conartist make his nest other than an Newly Born MMO? Perhaps a game of such polish and innovation could be made better with a few Microtransactions, Restricting Subscription Fees, and Shady Porting decisions? Well Congratulations to those who decided to stick with that idea, because you managed to make this game an unplayable wreck roughly a week into play. Lets start with the "Labor System". Labor points are used in almost any task involving the Crafting and Gathering systems of the game. Most players start off with a large sum of points when they log on for the first time, but these will fade quickly. When they do, you may not perform any more actions involving gathering, crafting, or opening coin purses (Source of Gold from Enemies) until they refill.\n\nF2P Players gain 5 labor point every 5 minutes, and have a max regen limit of 288 points per day.\n\nPremium Players gain 10 points every 5 minutes, have a max regen limit of 1440 points per day, and can regenerate while offline.\n\nThis was originally a system built around Korean Internet Fees, and has no place in the US Port other than to attract desperate players into buying a "Patron" status.\n\nThe Antichrist that is PATRON\nAnd Finally, to end this long rant that you have either spent way too much time reading or have just skimmed over to read the ending of, the Unholy Object that is Patron. Overall, patron is Trion Worlds way of saying "Premium" in all of their published games.\n\nWhile the Russian and Korean version have the same Premium systems, I'm going to just call it Patron because thats the word I repeated to myself whilst foaming by the mouth in the dark corner of my room.\n\nPatron is a good example of an MMO's Premium system punishing the poor and catering to the rich. Along with the the Labor system mentioned before, Patron gives many perks to Patron players, including:\n10% Bonus XP Gain\n10% Cash Shop Discounts\n\nNow these could be lived without of course. You could make yours way through an MMO without these perks, so whats so bad about it? Whelp, I didn't mention that it literally removes the 2 bigger aspects of the SANDBOX and PLAYER DRIVEN MMO.\n\nWithout the monthly pay of patron you will be unable to claim plots or post items on the auction house.\n\nWhile the Auction House may not seem like a big deal, the auction house is what drives the so called "Player Driven Economy" that the game boasted about so much. Same with claiming Plots as well, in fact. Plots were actually advertised as a main bullet point that the XL Games team seemed so proud to have created, and then restricted. Farming, Gathering, and Laboring are meaningless tasks thanks to this Patron system, and F2P players are essentially just Standby Props for the true player who have payed their monthly fees and can roam around completely free and happy while a dark sinking pit of remorse glooms endlessly in their gut.\n\nI will say it again, this is one of the best MMO's I have ever played.\nDon't Play It.\nPlease, Do not Play this game.\nIts already dead.\nIt was dead when it started.\nIts best we just move on.\nTreat it like that one beautiful, lovable Puppy that died of a stroke days after you got it.\nIts Traumatizing, but its gone.\nForget it.\nThank you."","December 4, 2015","false","126.3"," 179 of 211 people (85%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","85","179","211","60","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pawlik23/recommended/304030/","pawlik23","Pawlik23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pawlik23/","175 products in account","First off, I want to point out I've spent over 400 hrs before AA was added to Steam.\n\nI suppose I'll start with the strong points of this game.\nGraphics - it's one of the prettiest F2P games I've played. The characters look alive and distinct from each other, there are lots of animations for skills and movement. The world is colorful and delivers many pleasant views during exploration.\nCrafting - it is as important as the combat, there are many branches to choose from: farming, mining, logging, carpentry, artistry, smithing etc. Crafting is rewarding both in terms of EXP and gold.\nSailing - you can build ships and use them for travel or naval warfare.\nPK - some zones have open PvP, where you can kill enemies, or go rogue and kill members of your faction.\nPirates, jury and jail - if you kill too much friendlies, you go to trial. If you're found guilty by the players, you go to jail. Go to jail too many times and you get exiled from your faction and become a pirate forever.\nTraderunning - make a specialty pack in a zone and deliver it somewhere else for money or special currency. The further you deliver it, the more money you get, but also you risk getting attacked by pirates.\nOwning land - you can claim a piece of land and use it for crafting or you can build a house and furnish it.\nNow for the bad parts...\nP2W - for two reasons. First - to craft, you need Labor Points (which is like a crafting stamina). If you subscribe and get Patron status, it increases your Labor Points maximum amount from 2k to 5k, it also regenerates faster, even if you're not online. Without Patron, your crafting capabilities are really poor. You also can't own land without Patron. The second reason why this game is P2W is that it's heavily RNG. Cash shop has items that increase your chances for successful enhancement of gear. Also, if you just throw $$ at the game and sell the items for in-game gold, you can buy OP gear from the market.\nCrafting becomes a chore after a while. At the beginning it's fun, but then it becomes a FarmVille experience. You're forced to log in every few hours to tend to your crops or animals. Some professions are not worth doing in terms of Labor Point/gold ratio.\nRNG. Like I mentioned, the game has a randomizing aspect in gear enhancement. Same applies to drops from cash-shop chests and boss rewards. You can grind a dungeon over and over and never get the piece of armor you need. Armor also has a few grades, which makes the number of possible drops even bigger. Not to mention greedy players who will roll for every piece of gear even if they can't wear it.\nNo grouping mechanics. At lvl 50 you have ONE dungeon to grind for gear. And to finish it, you need a group, but you can't just hit 'find random group' button and wait, you need to spam on chat and pray to find all necessary roles.\nPvP imbalance - although the game boasts 10 skillsets and hundreds of possible class combinations, there are like max 10 classes that people play because the rest are crap. All you need is a Crowd Control skill and DPS. The player who lands the hit first, wins. Also you enter the first PvP zones on lvl 30 so you need to deal with lv50s that will stalk you because you'll be an easy pray. Getting my character from lv 30 to 50 was very annoying, there's no balancing mechanic that would discourage high lvl players from ganking lowlies. I know, some people like open PvP but 1vs3 'fights' are not fair.\nStability - while the game looks and runs fine, memory leaks happen and the game is prone to crash in certain places. To start the game you need to load Glyph (Trion's launcher) first, wait for it to download files. Then you run the game, but after a 'Hackshield' (anti-cheat software) starts. Then you wait to choose the server and connect. You can then pick your character and wait for the world to load. And while EU servers run OK, US ones are often shut down temporarily.\nBots. The Hackshield does ♥♥♥♥. It doesn't prevent auto-farming bots from existing. People also hack Labor Points and teleport with tradepacks on their backs, which shouldn't happen.\nDon't even try to make a traderun in the evening, all the pirate guilds will be waiting for you. Forget going solo, you need at least 10 people pt to protect your goods. Or forget your real life duties and go at 4am.\n\nThe only fun I had in this game was while getting from lv1 to 50, then it became boring. I prefer to play solo so I had nothing to do, but when I wanted to party up, I couldn't find no one. Everyone is AFKing and regenerating Labor.\nDo I recommend this game? Hell no. Too much P2W, bots, hackers, scammers...","April 3, 2015","false","76.4"," 183 of 217 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","183","217","10","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/recommended/304030/","quantizational","Quantization","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/","894 products in account","I am torn. Do I give this a positive or negative review? I think I'll put it down as a positive one but do not misinterpret that as me saying you should play this game.\n\nOn the one hand, I really like the game, it's fantastic, probably the best MMO I've ever played rivaling even World of Warcraft in content, replayability, level design and genuity. The game also has a lot of amazing features that most MMO's just don't have. (Court cases, sailing, own-faction-PvP, a pirate faction to name a few.) For these reasons I have trouble saying that you shouldn't play this game. The reasons why I'd give this a negative review are personal and I will explain why below.\n\nThe developers for this game do not deserve the money. I've played this game since beta, got a maxed character with level 50 in every skill and 90k proficiency in 2 skills. I had 3 large pieces of land, a galleon and a nice set of gear, and I was in many of the best guilds on the Ollo server. I was also a part of the game's first full release Kraken kill. I also want to clarify that I had well over 800 hours played in this game before the game was released on Steam.\n\nOn the release of this game, the developers promised us that the game would never come pay-to-win, and for the first few weeks it didn't. (Although that may have been because they were too busy fixing the 8 hour queue times, not an exaggeration..) But, as time went on, the developers became more and more hungry for money. Now, whether this is Trion's fault or the fault of the company that originally created ArcheAge, (XL games,) and had more creative control is up for you to decide, but either way, I am not comfortable playing a game where I am able to be so easily screwed over.\n\nI'd love to go into extreme detail on how they screwed us over but I'm not going to, but I will mention as many as I can without being too descriptive.\n\nFirst of all they brought out boxes that gave out some of the rarest materials in the game very cheaply. You could buy them for real money. (Thunderstruck logs.)\n\nThey promised us 10% off the real-money currency in-game, but didn't give us that until 4-5 months after the game was released when many players had already quit.\n\nThey sold some of the rarest armour making materials in the game for real money, (which in turn translates into in-game money.)\n\nThey made it so you get more labor whilst being online compared to being offline. (This encourages you to sit afk on the server rather than log out, hogging server space. It also means there is no incentive to take a break.)\n\nSold the best gliders in the game to players for 20 dollars each, and took all of the best gliders in-game with distinct advantages over these gliders and nerfed them so that people could buy the gliders without feeling like it was going to be wasted once they got an end-game glider.\n\nThey released some end-game gear to the public right as a patch was released, making the weapons people had spent thousands on almost irrelevant. (This gear was designed to be released years after the game had been released to allow new players to catch up more quickly, but Trion decided to release it 3 months after release, messing up the economy hardcore.)\n\nRefusing to deal with "land grabbers" who would hide in areas where you could build a house, and as soon as a piece of land was available they would instantly steal it before anyone else even knew what happened. These people were around for the first 5 months of the games release. (I assume they are gone now, but they might not be.)\n\nBots. They must love bots because the GM's hop in-game and tell everyone to "let them know where the bots are" and none of them were banned. Ever. I'd stand with a bot for an hour or so, PMing the GM every few minutes and it never happened. The GM's instead preferred to stand at the docks of Austera and spawn un-released ships for players to exploit.\n\nOh, and they have the worst customer support you've ever seen in your life. It took up to a month to get a response. Their live chat was also only available to paying members, so if your issue was about anything to do with not receiving your membership after paying then you were screwed.\n\nThis last one isn't really the same as a fault, but the game does not have spell queuing, meaning that people with lower pings have a distinct advantage over those with high pings. It essentially means that if you have a low ping, you can use spells more often, which literally means you have a higher dps. Here's a good video that explains it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7cCHy7ShGI\n\nAnyway, for this reason I can not honestly recommend this game, but as the gameplay is good I'm going to give it a positive. If you don't care about the devs behaviour, then go ahead and play this game, you will like it, but be prepared for disappointment and poor decision making from Trion.\n\nTL;DR: You should not 'play' this game, but you should 'experience' it.","March 31, 2015","true","163.2"," 383 of 510 people (75%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","75","383","510","31","30"

While it includes many great aspects of what you would expect in a well rounded MMO it is lackluster in manyways, starting from the terrible coding to the pay to win aspect of the game. The basics that makes this game cool, such as housing/naval combat/trade runs/multi-class characters are great, but that is where it all stops. SInce this is a KMMO for some reason they expect you to sit down and spend your entire life playing the game and getting the best gear or for a small fee (credit card handy) you can easily buy some gold and have the best stuff in the game, which at that point makes you a pretty big threat because you will outgear 85% of the community and 1-3 shot most people. This is turn creates a horribly unbalanced PvP segment and in turn makes for an unfun adventure outside of protected areas, on top of that if you are attacked near neutral guards and try to defend yourself guess what! They will kill you aswell for defending against that player :) Land, what land? You mean the stuff where a bot will show up and steal from you seconds later? While I do see this game having potential, the roots are far from growing into a full tree, super grindy, buggy/memory leaking, and p2w MMO that needs a serious revamp to be competitve in the upcoming MMO market. While this game just recently came to Steam I have over 500+ hours on it off of Steam and while it is still a decently rounded game I could not see myself playing it for an extended period of time and I guess neither can my guild since 90% of the time they are standing around in Marianople.

I really, really did.  So much so that I originally paid for the $150 Founders Pack.  Everything seemed amazing, and if the only factor was the gameplay and graphics, I would have loved it.  The problem soon became that this is one of the most pay-to-win games I've ever played.  I put in over 1,000 hours over the first month or so, but then things started appearing in the in-game store... RNG boxes with huge, in-game bonuses at a very low drop rate.  I'm not talking about cosmetic items, but items that were the foundation for the game's economy because they were as necessary as they were rare.  Then there was the hacking.  Land came at a huge premium and was highly coveted, however teleporting/land placement bots ran rampant.  So much so that many outwardly admitted to doing it.  From last I heard, most received 24-48 hour account suspensions.  The land they acquired they got to keep.\n\nI requested and through many emails and complaints, received a refund about a month after the game's release and haven't played since.  It's possible that everything has been fixed since then, but I highly doubt it given that the Korean version was about a year ahead of ours at the time and players there confirmed that their version was even more P2W than ours.

The time on Steam is from when I returned and played again for a few months.\n\nSo what is ArcheAge? A great idea executed poorly. The amount of hype for this game was immense, and when it finally dropped, well... People were angry. I was one of the people who paid $150 for the Archeum Founder's Pack, and I wish I hadn't. I have never regretted such a large purchase more than this one.\n\nBut why? Why is it so disappointing? It's advertised as the sandbox game everyone was waiting for!\n\nWell, I'll tell you. And I'll tell you the few things it did right. Just to be generous.\n\nPros:\n-Looks decent.\n-Deep crafting system, but has drawbacks.\n-You can level off of your professions. During my few month return, I went from 30-55 entirely by gathering and crafting.\n-Large open world map.\n-Decent character creation.\n-You build your own class, but very few are actually viable.\n\nCons:\n-Toxic community. Very toxic.\n-Pay to do anything.\n-The economy is messed.\n-Crappy endgame. I would have quit again earlier if I didn't roleplay.\n-A poorly executed player court system. Your crimes play no part in whether or not you are jailed.\n-The ocean is very empty.\n-There is a heavy focus on PvP, but only a few builds are viable, and credit card warriors always come out on top. There is no point in trying to enter the PvP scene now.\n-Good luck trying to get land. The amount of space is very limited, and the houses are too cramped together. It doesn't look or feel natural. Claiming land is also a Patron account feature.\n-Labor points.\n\nNow let's analyze these cons. The community in this game is horrid. Actually, let me tell you a story about this.\n\nI am a very good land grabber in this game. I have never failed to claim a piece of land the second it goes up for demolition, and the crowd that gathers for land is immense. One time, a player was attempting to grab a piece of land as well. And since it is such a desperate struggle for land, it turns every player into a savage. This person told the same lie again and again, saying that it was their family member's piece of land and that I should let them have it instead, and constantly harassed me after the fact. I saw this person saying the same thing multiple times during the same day, and was labeled by them as "a part of the ♥♥♥♥ AA community" and told that I was on their guilds "KoS list". Very immature. Land grabs are fair game for anyone. If you can't log in, pre pay your taxes. Log in for your family member. This is the most toxic way to go about such a thing. /rantover\n\n♥♥♥♥ community aside, the pay model for this game is horrendous. Free players are simply screwed. As a free player, you cannot own land. You cannot list items on the auction house without purchase of a marketplace item. Your labor points regenerate slower and do not regenerate at all while offline. Your labor points are capped at less than half of a patron player's. You earn 20% less XP. You do not earn loyalty tokens to purchase marketplace items just by logging in. You gather and craft 20% slower. Patron accounts earn +10% more credits when purchasing. As a free player, you a basically a spectator in this game. The only thing you can do is combat, and this gets extremely boring after a long period of time.\n\nThe endgame is just bad. There are only a few dungeons to run, and most players just do PvP. But then, what is the point to that either? Not much. Sure, your guild can own castles and such if you succeed in guild wars, but then you are most likely trashed by the community for winning. People hate people in this game. You will be killed for no reason time and time again. Actually, I have another story about this too.\n\nIt was around the time when the game first came out. I was enjoying it, believe it or not, but this may have played a part in my decreasing enjoyment of it. I was just a lowly level 40 or so minding my own business, hauling four trade packs along a route. I was in a PvP zone, and naturally, a player came across my nervous self and attempted to kill me. He was aroung level 47 or so, and I took him down on my own. I was very happy, but that wasn't the end. I crossed a bridge and started driving along a path, content with my skill and effective use of an uncommon build. But what I wasn't aware of, was an entire guild lying in ambush just behind a hill. When they tried to jump me, I drove back to a nearby spawn statue where I would be safe and meant to wait them out.\n\nI sat there for three hours. Three hours until they decided to "leave". Little did I know again, was that they were waiting behind the hill... Again. They killed me this time and stole my trade packs, leaving me with hours of my life I will never get back, and very little sleep that night due to being stalled by that band of barbarians. This is, by far, my worst experience in gaming. Ever.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is labor points. They are the main reason this game is terrible. At first, it doesn't seem like such a bad system. It keeps the economy in check and prevents players from progressing significantly faster than others, right? Nope. None of that. The economy is already screwed over by APEX, an item that players purchase for real money and sell to players for gold. Labor points are required for almost every task in this game. Even as a patron player, they regenerate too slowly. When you run out, you ask yourself "Why am I playing?" and log off, even as a roleplayer. It wouldn't be so bad if it were just for crafting and gathering, but stuff like;\n-Unwrapping items you've crafted.\n-Unwrapping coin purses dropped by enemies (the only source of income you would make from killing enemies).\n-Planting seeds outside of farm plots.\n-Reporting bots. There are a lot of them.\n-Paying your taxes.\n-Dismantling equipment.\n-Receiving mail.\n-Harvesting crops on your farm.\n-Turning in a trade package that you already spent labor to make.\n-Breathing (In a future patch I'm sure).\n\nYeah, the labor system is messed guys. So is everything else. I've said all I can, really. Just do yourself a favor and don't get yourself wrapped up in this game. You might actually care about it like I did.\n\nGG Trion and XL Games. You ruined a potentially good MMO that many people waited for for years. I hope you're happy.","May 15","false","541.7"," 75 of 82 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","75","82","5","6"

I thought I'd give it a go because, hey, it's free and I was curious. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate my curiosity right now.. just wasted about 4 hours of my life. I'll be honest, I haven't played enough to comment on this but it is OVERWHELMING how many poor reviews this game has, and they're pretty just.. let me explain:\n\nThis game IS pay to win, don't start playing if you want a true free game (see no more room in hell, league of legends, dota, runescape) trust me, not only can you not craft/farm/build unless you pay up, you have 'labour points' which you have to use to even open bags.. THAT'S RIGHT you can't even loot stuff unless you pay.\n\nThat's just the game model, let me talk about the game design.. oh my dear lord. Now some people think adding collision with npcs is a good idea, adds a certain realism.. it doesn't, don't do it, EVER. The cutscenes/lore is boring and poorly reenacted. Then you add the crashes every hour, the droll linear questing (go kill 5 kobolds, go collect 6 herbs, go take this guys lunch over to him.. fml) and I mean it's ♥♥♥♥ing linear, everything is on one bloody road. The mount system is gimmicky as ♥♥♥♥, so so so so so stupid that I cannot even be bothered to elaborate on that. The combat system is tab targeting.. fair enough, but the skills are clunky, the ui is shocking (like cmon, it aint hard to polish cooldowns really). And finally; you can tell that this game has just been rehashed poorly. It's a south Korean game and they forgot to take Korean text out, Korean voice acting on NPCs. If I was trion, I'd be absolutely embarrassed by this.. I wouldn't put my name on it.\n\nTL;DR... you're curious, I get it.. BUT DONT DO IT. It's a freemium, p2w, poorly engineered game that has a model that makes EA look like a philanthropist organisation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justglaze/recommended/304030/","justglaze","Rich Jerome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justglaze/","167 products in account","-Played hundreds of hours, just not through Steam-\n\nI WANT to like this game, I really do. That's part of the reason I'm wiring this, to finally convince myself that I should never come back to this game, which is unfortunate, because the game has a fantastic premise.\n\nYou have a massive world to explore. This includes multiple large continents, various smaller islands, the open sea, and even the sea floor. You can explore the world through various ships (from rowbots to gallions), vehicles (farm carts and sports cars), mounts, and gliders. But the best part about this massive world is everything is open to PVP between the two main continents. There’s even some ship based combat—and let me just say, you haven’t lived until you’ve dropped a meteor spell on a massive enemy ship.\n\nSpeaking of spells, how you choose to defend yourself is up to you, as your “class” is decided upon which of the 3 skill trees you choose. This means you have a total of 120 potential “classes” to choose from.\n\nHere lie the beginnings of the sour taste left in my mouth after playing this game. You can certainly pick any class/combination of skill tress you want to, but that hardly means every class is viable much less possible. This issue here is due to the way skills derive their power from the weapons you wield. Every weapon is capable of dealing damage; however, not every weapon provides the additional buffs a class may need.\n\nLet’s say you want to play a warrior who casts some spells on the side, then you need to find a way to work a spell power weapon into your arsenal, most likely meaning you’re now wielding a one-handed sword and an off-hand scepter for magic damage.  Or, maybe you want to be a stealthy rogue who can also do some minor healing? Well, good luck with that, because the only weapons the provide bonus healing are clubs and two-handed hammers.\n\nWhile these may seem like viable alternatives to the uninitiated, they are NOT. Not only are these hybrid builds not at all viable, they’re not even marginable. By mixing classes you gimp yourself to a point where even PVE can be daunting. And GabeN help you if you attempt to mix the least-synergistic tree, ranger, with anything that wants non-range weapons.\n\nThe sourness continues into the crafting system. At first, the potential to plant and harvest crops wherever you so choose is fascinating. Though doing so will likely be your first introduction to the labor points system. To quickly summarize this system: Any planting, harvesting, or crafting requires a variable amount of labor points. Points are earned by remaining logged in; 10 points for 10 minutes. If you’re a subscriber or member then you earn double that amount per 5 minutes, with additional labor earned while not logged in. Free players can have a maximum amount of labor with subscribers having a higher cap.\n\nSo, free to play users are clearly at a disadvantage. But it doesn’t stop there. You crops, should you have the labor to plant them, can actually be stolen by both friends and enemies. This is another really cool concept that encourages exploration. Additionally, stealing crops is an in-game offence, and enough of those could land you in jail or make you an aggressive-to-everyone pirate. But again, the members have a distinct advantage when growing resources because they can actually claim land. Oh, you wanted a player owned home and special plot to grow your crops? Go pay a monthly fee. Then no one will be able to touch anything you grow in your plot.\n\nThis negative is made exponentially worse when the trade skills used for harvesting and crafting, such as woodcutting and armor smithing, require hundreds of thousands of resources to level up. So those non-members are left planting crops and hoping they don’t get stolen, and their precious labor points wasted.\n\nFurthering this tragedy is the RNG involved in crafting. The items you make can vary in quality. Meaning if you’re hoping for a top tier quality of an item then you will likely be stuck making hundreds if not thousands of that item.\nLet’s take a second to review all these labor costs while keeping in mind that you only get 5 labor every 5 minutes; plant your crop, harvest your crop (if it hasn’t been stolen), refine your materials, craft your item. If the item isn’t the quality you want: rinse and repeat. Crying optional.\n\nSpeaking of crying, the main story is also something you’ll likely cry over. Not due to its quality, but because it’s painfully short, and rather cheesy. Unless it has recently changed, the story barely carries you to half of the current level cap.\nI WANT you like you ArcheAge, I really do. Your fast paced, massive PVP has made some of my best mmo memories. And your economy made me feel like I was a part of the actual world. A world I spent hours exploring and sailing in. Some of you skill trees were so cool in theory, but so lack-luster in practice. And don’t even get me started on my cow mount, Moonalisa, who has a cow pie skill.\n\nBut what it comes down to is this: ArcheAge is one giant slot machine, with your log in time being the accepted currency. You can play the odds and pay $15 a month or spend in game cash to buy membership, but that won’t change the odds so heavily stacked in favor of the house.","July 3, 2015","false","6.2"," 101 of 122 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","101","122","8","0"

Unforunately, it's been completey ruined by the short-sighted, money-grabbing TRION who are clearly only in it to see how much they can get out of the game before it crumbles.\n\nF2P is an illusion - you can play for free, but you're constrained at almost every turn to the point where you have to spend $$ or quit.\n\nP2P is also an illusion - even if you pay via APEX or subscription, you're still hampered by the labour system which charges you for doing almost anyting in the game:\n\nWant to open a purse you just looted from a mob?  That costs labour\nWant to dig up that corn you just planted?  That costs labour\nWant to craft something? That costs labour\nWant to mine / chop something?  That costs labour\n\nRun out of labour - well you can wait 5 minutes for a bit more, but dig up another plant and that labours gone again.\n\nI can't think of any other game that practically forces you to stops you doing whatever you want.\n\nThe game itself was full of hackers / bots and gold-sellers.  Whilst some of these have been addressed, many have not.  Furthermore, griefing is practically supported in this game with TRION calling it 'emergent gameplay'.\n\nMarketplace / Cash shop items cost a fortune as they mainly in RNG boxes - I read horror stories of people begging to pay $100 for an item as a one-off cost as they've already spent $500 or more trying to 'win' it from the RNG Boxes.  The latest mess?  TRION GAVE AWAY ONE OF THOSE RARE ITEMS AS A FREE GIFT TO NON-PLAYING PLAYERS as a mean to win them back - they hacked off their own player-base and ended up having to give the item out to everyone (but no refunds for the 100's of dollars spent trying to 'win' it.\n\nAll-in-all I'm more disappointed with this game than angry.  Here was a WORLD that I was willing to spend a lot of my time in and yet TRION saw it as nothing more than a GAME CASH AND GRAB.  They would have made thousands out of me over the next few years on a regular subscription, instead they opted for a quick gain from the 'whales' and regular players like me didn't count.

The cash shop is huge with a lot of options that make the game terribly pay to win. Sure, you can play the game without ever spending a dime, sure, you can buy cash shop credit with ingame gold, but the prices inflated so hard after they kicked out the gold bots that I wish you good luck selling anything.\n\nGame design wise it had a lot of potential but Trion's terrible communication and demands to the actual devs ended up with some really bad decisions. For example: they released content that was released after the release, meant for newbies to catch up with veteran players in terms of gear, at the release of the game. This meant that everyone had very easy access (or so it looks like, you'll find out eventually that it's a tiny area in the world that's overcrowded and makes you employ asinine grind and tagging tactics to get anything out of that place) to big weapons, which in turn made one of the bigger crafting professions completely useless and worthless for the bigger part.\n\nAnother big example is the total overpopulation of housing property. In the korean version of the game fewer people had membership to allow them to place houses, and the server populations were also smaller and more divided. Housing space is limited in this game and you had to compete really hard in the past to get a housing spot, a select few people used to use cheats to steal property from other players camping a decaying house to sell them. They eventually got banned, but it took a bunch of months before they did anything about it.\n\nYou need membership (patron) to maintain and place houses, so if you ever quit the game you can wave goodbye to any property you own.\n\nThe pros:\n- Boat physics.\n- Classes (although some will always be top tier while always wont be)\n- Professions/tradeskill, although it's a typical tradeskill menu they're definitely more interesting than the cookie-cutter MMO tradeskills.\n- Boat physics.\n\nThe cons:\n- Weather system (I heard from rumors some sort of focus group found weather too unfun and too impactful on gameplay, and they toned down the weather from more realistic to really subtle)\n- P2W (P2Advantage for you autists that take everything literal) Cash shop\n- Housing system. Once you stop playing you will lose everything related to housing, and with overcrowded zones it can be hard to find a good spot again.\n- Patch implementation choices and gameplay/game content changes compared to the korean version.\n\n\nI honestly can't be arsed writing a bigger review than this. The game left a terrible aftertaste for me after spending so much money on it. Spending any money on anything but the subscription is a terrible waste and not worth it. And the game's flaws will eventually reveal themselves and you will hate it.\n\nA while back Trion customer support refused to refund a patron membership purchase I misbought 3 months ago, but only activated that day, because the dates they displayed when patron would end were completely messed up and I was worried I would lose my housing properties if I didn't pay up. They literally refused to stop the patron that activated today and give me the cash shop points I used for it back.\n\nI had fun with the game though, but I'm incredibly bitter about all the things wrong with it.\n\nEdit:\ntl;dr: ArcheAge was an incredibly fun game to me with unique mechanics that is clouded by bad gamedesign choices and Trion's terrible marketing choices and left an incredibly bitter aftertaste.","March 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 129 of 165 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","129","165","2","0"

During that time, I have witnessed the fall of what could have been the greated MMO that ever existed. It had exactly what ♥♥♥♥♥♥mers have been asking for, it was a great sandbox. It felt a bit like a fantasy version of EVE. Needless to say, that came to an end.\n\nIt began when Trion pulled a bait and switch a few days before launch with their start pack items. It happened again a month later when Trion singlehandedly destroyed the market with the changing of the thunderstruck logs. It has happened time and time again with horrible servers during release periods like Auroria causing people to lose not only plots of land, which are essential to gameplay, but also entire castles which affect many houses in a wide plot of land.\n\nAs if the housing situation wasnt dire enough, balance is yet another aspect of the game that affirms the reasons you should avoid it. This game caters to 1 type of archetype: the archer. It has been overpowered for months and showing no signs of stopping. If you want to win at PVP, you need to be some form of an archer. Melee is underpowered and easily kited, Mages are a very strong second to archers, and by mage I mean 1 class: Daggerspell. Healers are absolutely horrible and its not possible to heal effectively and do any meaningful damage with how spell power work, not to mention nearly all the healing spells themselves are worthless. Complaints and balance issues aside, the class system is very well done and if balance wasnt such a glaring issue, the possibilites for class combination would be unrivaled....but we live in a world where balance IS an issue, so the effective class combinations go from 120 total combinations down to about 10. Yea, great job.\n\nTrion has kept making mistakes over and over. It was a running gag between me and my friends where we just started to expect whatever could go wrong, it will, because of Trion. Granted, its hard to say what is exactly their fault and how much of the games failures is theirs or the actual Korean developer, XL Games, but from a customers standpoint, Trion is in a great place to take all the blame. However, that unrelated to the actual gameplay.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone. It has such glaring pitfalls that exemplify exactly the faults of F2P games today on the market. In fact, in my 20 years of gaming this is the first game I have ever had to do a chargeback with my bank for the misleading advertisements and bait and switch tactics employed by Trion. I downloaded this entire game from steam and booted it up for 5 minutes to write this review in hopes that it will save someone else from this MMO. Do yourself a favor, save yourself months of your time, and stay away from this game.\n\n\nTL:DR: Game is pay2win nonsense, stay far away.","March 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 118 of 150 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","118","150","0","3"

After hitting cap(which you will like in a week) the real grind begins when you craft weapons armor etc. The labor systems limits you and you do have to get the sojourner's pack at least to get by. Patrons can only own land so p2p or gtfo is the feel by the time you get here. The naval combat can be some really fun at times and its what got me to try it at first. Although you can be any class in this game, you will find that most are useless at pvp( its a open world kinda important ) you will see lvl 30s killing lvl 50s mostly cause some classes have way to many stuns that prevent even a person  with ayandan gear to even do any damage.(average time to get even 1 piece of ayandan is 3 months and their is many random types of  this gear which you have no control over of and even if you get the right one the stats are also random so be prepare to be extremely disappointed. The game looks overall. The devs completely gave up the story around lvl 35, seriously no ending, the story ends with you moving into a new area and it just ends you never see another story npc after it. This game could of been a really good game but trion messed it up. Case in point its broken in many ways. Some stuff you can defend but really why have endless classes that get own by 1 or 2 combinations. Wining pvp comes down to who's stun got who first,  Go play GW2, this game should  still be in alpha .","April 7, 2015","false","582.9"," 102 of 127 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","102","127","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyanidesugar/recommended/304030/","Cyanidesugar","Luna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyanidesugar/","7 products in account","While most reviews on games tend to give you a good idea of what the game will feel like when you play it, I don't believe any review I've read has perfectly portrayed what Archeage is. There has been so much negative stigma attached to Trion and this game that I almost never tried it since so many people warned me not to.\n\nTo put it into the simplest terms, there is some seriously positive and negative things about this game that people overlook when they hear "pay to win."\n\nTo get straight to the point, The list of things I find lovely about this game:\n\n-   Beautiful Environments and Character Customization.\nThis game is very lovely and serene. I'm sure many would have a differing opinion but compared to many other mmorpgs, this one certainly raises to the top in both graphics and the background music.\nAside from the beautiful world, the character customization is fairly detailed and gives plently of options to allow the       creation of characters that are unique and different.\n\n-  No Instancing.\nThis has always been important to me and it's one of the main reasons I couldn't continue to play Final Fantasy XIV Online. Archeage, as far as I've experienced, is completely open world without really any loading screens after you begin playing your character (with the exception of portals). This is great for the feeling of immersion and stops the game from being choppy.\n\n-  Crafting.\nUnlike games such as World of Warcraft or Guild Wars 2, there's not exactly a profession system. The best thing about Archeage is that you get free range over crafting, no choosing between leatherworking or alchemy, you can do every single profession without having to stick with just one. This is a system I personally enjoy, especially since each profession tends to go hand and hand with eachother.\n\n-  Mounts.\nThis seems stupid, but it's a small detail about this game I absolutely adore. In every game I've experienced, you buy a mount from a vendor, hope you get it from a dungeon/raid, or as a reward from an achievement. It doesn't necessarily work like that in Archeage. Yes, you can buy them from vendors, but usually only as little baby mounts which you have to raise by growing food to feed them, giving them water, entertaining them and giving them attention until they've grown full size. It's something I enjoy simply because It helps develop the player relationship with their mounts/companions by having raised them and being able to give them their own names.\n\n-  Combat and Skill Sets.\nWhen you create your character you're given six different classes to choose from, which is a pleasant amount for pretty much any mmorpg, but it gets so much more in depth as you start to level. Once you choose your initial class, you are allowed two more skill sets to create your own custom fighting style and the best part is, you can switch it out anytime you want without losing progress. For example, If you wanted to try sorcery and added occultism as your second skill set, after you get your third (we'll say witchcraft), you can switch any of them out any time you want for a different skill. It basically allows you play and level every skillset on just one character which gives a lot of freedom.\n\n-  Sandbox.\nWhile there is a good amount of content around combat and questing, you'll find that there are many small things you can interact with and manipulate. Housing and farming is a huge attraction to this game, and while it's pretty much reserved for subscribers (unless you're in a guild), it's kind of charming to see the many little player farms each decorated to their own liking and sitting cozily next to eachother. With how big the world is, you often get gliders and row boats as well that are equally as charming when you're just floating above towns taking your time to reach the ground.\n\n\nUnfortunately, with every good aspect to a game, there's always the bad ones, the ones that have been talked about repeatedly in an effort to get you to turn back before you play.\n\nWith that being said, there's quite a few issues I've had with this game:\n\n- Labor Points.\nWhat are labor points? Labor points can be thought of as energy that you use on ANY action not pertaining to combat, you know: gardening, planting, crafting, identifying weapons and armor, opening coinpurses, honestly there's not much you can't do without labor points. The problem is, as someone who is free to play, you don't get a whole bunch. It pretty much encourages you to log on and minimize it to the task bar while you go watch a movie or something just to get your labor points up. Usually you get five points every five minutes, and sadly, they don't accumulate while your logged off. However, if you become a patron you get 10 points every 5 minutes, along with a higher labor point cap and they accumulate while you're logged out. It's a really restricting system and can be irritating when you need to craft something that requires 100 labor points and you only have 70.\n\n- Glitches.\nThis is a problem that doesn't happen OFTEN, but it has happened enough that it's noticable and irritating. My main issue is that with a game that is released to the public and has been published for quite some time should have these bugs worked out, especially since they tend to be major, like the screen going black when you look in a certain direction or textures from the ground copying and pasting into the sky. Again, these glitches don't happen a bunch but there are definitely some noticable issues.\n\n- Character Slots.\nThis would not be such a problem for me if they gave you more character slots with a subscription, but they don't. You get two and only two for the entire account and if you want more, you need to buy them with real money. Now usually, with a game like this, I wouldn't complain. You can play every class on one character so why would you need more than one character? But my problem is, there are four different races and if you're like me, you like to at least try out the different starting areas and characters, and this is especially hard with the deletion time when you decide you don't like a character you've made.\n\nMy advice, if you make a character and dislike it, try to delete it before you get above level 10, and DO NOT delete two characters at once. The wait time for a character to delete tends to increase with the longer you have them/the higher the level they are and you CANNOT create a new character while you're deleting another one (Unless you already had another character slot open). There is a reason for this, from what I read, it's to prevent the creation of characters just to receive property and then delete them so that their main character can take it. I'm not entirely sure if this is why, but regardless, it's irritating and takes into account that the restriction on character slots makes this process all the more painful.\n\n\n- Pay to Win?\nI've read many reviews claiming this game is Pay to Win, and knowing Trion, I don't exactly doubt it, but it's not pay to win in the way people have made it seem. As someone previously stated, it's more "pay to get there faster" than anything. Any gear a pay to win player can get, you can get. This mainly affects PvP and unless you're in arenas trying to conquer everyone, this aspect of the game is really not going to have any influence. I've not personally experienced this and don't believe you should let it stop you from attempting the game.\n\nNo review you read will accurately express your own personal experience, I highly recommend that you TRY this game and its pros and cons before you decide if it's for you instead of just taking someone's word for it. <3","January 9","true","11.9"," 176 of 238 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","176","238","7","12"

Cept this game is destroyed by the people running it! The game is set up to make you spend lots of money! You can grind for days and months for gear and weapons then try to regrade them "upgrade them  "*which you must do in order to pvp and not get wreked"" and even after months of grinding for your gear and weapons you have a very high chance of breaking them! Most say don't regrade your gear and weapons, just buy already regraded items.... Well the cost of doing this takes many many months of mad grinding to get enough gold to buy desent pvp gear! What it comes down to is the only people left playing this game are the ones who buy gold, hack, exploit, or dont do anything exept play this game!  Even if you do manage to save up  enough gold to buy good gear by playing legit you will still be out geared by the ones buying gold since they are able to upgrade faster than anyone since the game is being run for massive profit!   The biggest down fall of this game is the system for  breaking gear and weapons! Most people I know "including my self" just don't want to play a game that has a gear/armor breaking system in it!

The scenery was nice, game play was enjoyable, and there was always lots to do. I personally enjoyed going with guild friends on trade runs and out to sea battles.\n\nThe game began to fall apart when there were lots of gold spammers and botting cases, though that wasn't the only problem. The game focused very heavily on the Item Market section with real money. Not entirely the worst system, but made it hard for many players to get anywhere in-game without it. If ever experiencing an issue in-game or out of game, there was terrible lack of support. In fact, it was lucky to get a response back. The official launch after alpha/ beta was released, there was very little sign of patching for the the bug and glitch issues. There was also a problem regarding a botting case in-game, which caused regular players to be banned in the process for no explainable reasons. Which Trion did very little to resolve, and for some didn't do anything at all.\n\nIn my case, I was one of those few if not many to fall into the regular player category that had their account banned for no explanainable reason. I tried submitting multiple support tickets and the company was terrible at responding. Normally took weeks to get a response, and when I did, the answers were not even remotely close to what I was asking. After about ten support tickets I wasn't even able to contact them... They had restricted contact, couldn't access forums, and couldn't log into the game after spending the $150 on the game, and another $150-200 in-game.\n\nI decided to look up Trion on the web for any traceable evidence as to whether it was happening to others as well. Sure enough, the (BBB) or Better Business Bureau has a list of complaints regarding the same issue and more. I was shocked and surprised that a company could be this bad. Since then, I haven't touched foot in ArcheAge or in any Trion games.\n\nAs a previous alpha/ beta tester and player, I would highly recommend staying away from Trion games. They do not respect their players and they have a very bad reputation for purchase history.","March 27, 2015","false","390.8"," 95 of 119 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","95","119","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/walker-boh/recommended/304030/","walker-boh","The Laughing Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/walker-boh/","260 products in account","ArcheAge is both the best and worst MMO I've played. I found the gameplay and combat to be fun and intuitive. The crafting system is very intricate, the housing and farming system was well done (I like non-instanced housing, it puts more value on property. It would be better if bots didn't claim all the land right away), and the Naval combat...oh man..this is what got me hooked on the game! Sailing around the ocean looking for enemy trade ships or fishing boats, stealthing into the water and swimming up to an enemy fishing boat and stealing and and turning in THEIR fish for your profit! I was so addicted to sailing the open waters searching for prey. It was one of the best experiences I had in a game.\n\nBut now, the game is sadly dying and at a rapid pace. The game is a blatant pay to win model. It is almost impossible to obtain end game equipment without paying a lot of money. It is incredibly tedious to even play the game without paying for Patron status for your labor regen and making a lot of gold in the game is practically impossible without patron status. Sure, you can get patron with in game gold. But to get in game gold, you need Patron, See the cycle? To break the cycle, you pay real life money for patron. But you want that shiny end game Delphinad weapon? It's obtainable. But it'll cost you at least 40k+ gold for a single weapon (at the time of this review). To get 40k gold, you can grind trade runs, but you need a lot of labor and it will take about 100 days (lots of math to pull this figure). And that's IF you have patron status AND you pay real money for the farm hauler upgrade AND you grind nothing but trade runs AND you are online the entire 100 days. Labor recharge is halved if you're offline. So what people do instead is spend a lot of money on RNG boxes that contain rare items or buy APEX (what people need to get Patron) and sell for in game gold.\n\nThe entire crafting/regrading (enchanting) system is RNG based. Which wouldn't be so bad if there weren't cash shop items that increase your chances of procing regrades. This appeals to the gambling habits of people and sucks in more money. As long as you keep paying money to Trion, you can keep crafting and regrading and eventually you will proc an end game tier piece of gear. And because people spent so much IRL money to craft the gear, it sells for unreasonable and unobtainable amounts of gold on the auction house. And the cycle goes on...\n\nSo props to Trion and XL Games for destroying one of the best MMOs out there. I hope all other developers can learn from them. Your game can be amazing, but blatant cash grabs and a pay to win model WILL destroy your game.","April 1, 2015","false","677.9"," 91 of 113 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","91","113","3","4"

Nice cutscene at the beginning, very "anime". Character creation was fun, seems "variable" to a large extent based n the class system. The features section has a good amount of variation, so far so good. I name my toon and load up. I enter a nice scene by a lakeshore/pond sort of thing. Graphics look nice. Lots of people around which is to be expected I suppose being highlighted on steam. Then I notice that my chatbox in the bottom left of my screen is being filled with, not the usually "barrens chat" type stuff (although, to be fair I suppose thats exactly what it was) of MMO starting chat zones, there was that, but no, Im refering to the character named "God" who was in a flame war (he was being flamed and desperately trying to justify his position) because in between the childish taunts and usual sexual insults of a 15 year old, he was trying to buy votes for his steam review. Thats right, you heard me. He was trying to offer in game money for upvotes on his steam review of the game in order to troll trion for some perceived slight that I missed. He was going on about how awesome he was, about how he was THE first person on the server and how we were all beholden to him for being able to play the game. He was kind enough to CONSTANTLY update everyone everytime he got a helpful vote as well as blah blah blah, he was almost the first to cap, blah blah, he  knows who cares smith, blah blah.\nIf this is the kind of douchbaggery I can expect from the community, I personally am not going to waste my time. Not with all the reviews talking of hacking, crappy players, bots, etc. Give it a try, its free, but I cant give it a thumbs up unfortunately, because of one insignificant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Population imbalance.\n2. New player difficulty on matured server is high.\n3. Hackers killed the game. Game must be recoded to address the hacker infestation. Not a patch, a full rebuild of the game.\n\n\nConcept and gameplay is really fun if you were in the early start. Even then the servers was really screwed up then with waiting time in the HOURS. That was the people that payed for the game. All the lands were already gone by the first 6 hours of the game. I had a group of friends that played this game and we were ready for the early start. We managed to throw down our farms and take up around 3072 unit of land during the first day. For the week of early access we just powered level ourselfs. Truthfully you can hit your first three level cap in one week.  Money grinding was excruciating but once we poured all our gold to obtain a single 2 slotted tractor, everyone in the group got one within 3 days.\n\nPVP was increadibly fun and the dungeon raids were alright. We had our own ships and we went on a lot of pirating. Both allies and enemy ships were targets. We been to the enemy continent and enraged the enemy guilds to hunt us down. We had enough gold to buy each person subscription so we didn't need to pay for subscription when it expired. However we stopped playing after several weeks.\n\nWhy did we stop playing even though we can fair against pay to win players?\n\n1. Population imbalance. PVP war? I was on the top guild on our continent and we had to fight against the biggest zerg guild in the whole game. For every 1 person on our continent, there was 5 on the other. So during the war, either we get the best guilds on our side to fight or we always lose the war.\n\n2. Joined late, well you are screwed. Waiting for an expired land? Good luck competing against 20 people trying to grab the smallest piece of land.  Our friends that joined late have a hard time getting land. Buying land? Good luck getting one to sell at a reasonable price.\n\n3. Hackers. The game was coded on the user end. My god, any company that is hosting the game can't do anything about it. They tanked the NPC trade market and caused inflations on the user market. They can teleport inside a terrain so you can't see their names. They just make their tradepack then teleport to the trade NPC. Then they use those gold to buy all the cheap materials and sell it for an increadibly high price. Can't buy it? Well read the spam message and buy gold with real money. PVP against hackers? You will never kill them unless they are stupid and forgot to use their hack.","March 26, 2015","false","121.6"," 109 of 141 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","109","141","4","1"

Getting to the endgame (lvl50-55) is a journey that is amazing your first time through, the sheer variety of quests and monsters is great, but upon reaching endgame and looking into the crafting system, you will realize this game's biggest flaw IMO.\n\nThere are 5 levels of gear for high level players, and when made they roll one of 5 or 6 types, only 1 of which can be upgraded to the next tier. Then, there are also 12 different item colors that determine quality, and you have a chance to downgrade, or even destroy the item when attempting to upgrade it. Considering you must begin with the lowest level items and craft them up one tier at a time, crafting armor and weapons is the most tedious and annoying process in the game.\n\nWhile the crafting system is terrrible, most of the game is still great, from taking world bosses as combat pets to raiding ships at sea with your guild, its easy to go have fun by grabbing a friend or two and just go look for a fight or do a dungeon. Sadly as of recently I have stopped playing due to how terrible Trion Worlds is and how badly they have screwed this game up with their incessant pay2win offers, destroying and laughing at the masterful in-game economy as they flood the market with previously-rare materials and basically give no promises as to the value of anything.\n\nOverall I still love this game, but I cannot recommend it due to Trion Worlds' idiocy, if they handed the game off to a company that understands how a game should be run i'd expect many players like me would return, but for now my sub in cancelled.","April 9, 2015","false","10.0"," 88 of 111 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","88","111","0","0"

(A trade pack costs Labour to make AND to turn into gold! If you're out of labour by chance don't expect to make any money)\n-Only way to get Labour points if you are not a subscriber is to literally AFK while you sleep by hitting on a dummy since there is a 15 min AFK kicker which Trion added after people would AFK...to get the labour they needed...to do anything in their own game...they really just took away the only way you could make a profit in the game. GG 10/10 would play again any day.\n-Small amount of content\n-Game is 90% PvP based and typically your faction will always lose.\n-PvP is only won based off of gear score and not skill.\n-In PvP there are counters for every class and more often then not, you're getting countered.\n-To switch a class you have to Pay...\n-To recover lost experience you must..you guessed it, pay.

Add on to that a fee for even attempting to regrade. At the medium level of Unique (Level 5/9) this all together gives you a roughly... 30% success rate, a 10% double sucess rate, a 45% fail rate, and a 15% double fail rate. So for a Grand total of 1,400 Gold (roughly 2-3 weeks of grinding) you have a better chance of losing your current grade rather than going up. The system is in no way rewarding and gives absolutely NO COMPENSATION for those (over 95% of players) who get a DEGRADE (that's right, Trion believes in reverse upgrading) to try and work their way back up to that same point. Instead you are forced to keep your subscription rolling so you can farm your plots, store your materials, make trade packs and larders, and transport them across the ocean for the most money with the chance of: your own faction stealing from you, the enemy faction stealing from you, and pirates stealing from you. If you lose all those trade packs guess what, you get a 5% profit off of what they turn in, which usually be Gilda Stars, something that is completely worthless unless you are wanting to upgrade a house to a much larger version (The land around your house must be empty, fair warning: it never is). It is an endless loop of farming, trade running, and regrading for high level subscribers. And it NEVER pays off for the majority of players. Out of my 830 hours I spent at least 800 of them doing trade runs and PvP to try and get my trade packs back from all 3 sides. The highest level I every got to was Unique simply because I never had the money to try regrading higher. I can not tell you how much money I spent on this game trying to get to that level where most of the PvPers were, most of the Guilds who did end content even REQUIRED you to have these ridculously expensive weapons and armor so they could clear them out quickly and easily, basically making those with poor luck lose out on content.\n\nSpeaking of Content, you remember those other 30 Hours I missed out of my record? Yea thats your entire leveling experience. 30 Hours. I made it to max level in only 12 hours, the rest of it all was just side quests for money and items I could sell on the Auction. And btw, you can not fully use the auction unless you are a subcriber or use real dollars to by a liscence. You have to pay...to use an MMORPG essential...Let that sink in. I wanted to like this game, I really did but the endless grinding that never paid off simply wasn't worth it. I had friends who lost entire armor sets due to that 5% break chance above unique, it was almost like a 5% pass rate vs a 95% fail/break rate, something that should only exist at the Mythic level. This game is so pay to win that I could have paid for a majority of my college supplies with the amount of money I put into this game, hell probably even part of my tuition. The only reason to play this game is if you want a place to throw unused money at with no profit in return.","June 3","false","838.1"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","51","57","5","0"

(since it's a negative review! woo!~)\n\nArcheage pulled me in by offering a seemingly variety in skills/builds and being able to combat other plays in a open world, rather than in battlegrounds.\n\nSadly, the game mechanics are very old school. There is no active dodging/blocking/kiting/aiming/cc breaks that many newer mmo's are starting to offer. Alas, I was still willing to give the game a chance!\n\nFor convenience sake, I will break my review up into categories.\n\nSkills:\nI was very much looking forward to making diverse builds with unique skill sets! Sadly I found myself being pigeon holded into using select skills that are typically the flavor. The biggest obstacle in the way of truly being diverse are the actions bars.\n\nWhile there are many different spells and you can combine three skill trees together to make your hero feel diverse, you are not limited in how many skills you may put on your action bars, therefore you ultimately aren't choosing skills, only trees. Of course everybody eventually goes towards the same skillsets, or rather similar ones.\n\nThere is a combo system in play which does help making builds a little more diverse. It works like this: If you fear the target before using this spell you will do more damage.\n\nThen pvp is very much who initiated and stunlocked who first (no diminishing returns!) There are a few spells that will cancel out certain cc's.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the skills though would be the awful passives. A lot of the passives are activated by chance. Such as being hit by a critical attack will boost your own critical attack by #. This type of "random" mechanic is found very often on the passives. Then to top it off, using our example, if you proc the passive too often it will disable it for # seconds/minute. One passive that is randomly activated disables if you MOVE. Extremely poor passive design.\n\nThere are also a few (thankfully not a lot) of self using buffs that last ~a minute and have no cooldown. Why bother. Why not make this a passive. Just extremely annoying.\n\nPVE:\nThe game does eventually open up a bit, but questing is really the only way to go. The quests are mostly very boring fetch quests (especially early on). Doing every quest I saw between 1 - 10 I killed less than 50 monsters. I understand that they want to introduce the game to you via quests, but it doesn’t take a genius to understand that you right click seeds in your inventory to plant them in a huge farm where tons of others are planting.\n\nThe loot is extremely lackluster. There a few typical set bonuses, etc. But I expect more from games now than just gaining a bit of stats from a set bonus. You also have to use labour points for everything, opening loot, opening gold, crafting, everything. From what I can tell, people who pay will gain an extreme deal more labour points.\n\nMounts are typical, except they can help you fight. I was never much of a pet guy, but I know a lot of people will enjoy this feature. Gliders can be really cool, especially in pvp. Boats have been done before in a mmo, but seem to have been put together a bit better in archeage.\n\nMobs and spells in general aren’t very exciting. You can’t actively block, dodge or even kite very well. Mob interaction is far and few.\n\nOverall:\n\nIf all you want from a game is a very large, runescape esque, crafting mmo. This is for you, if you don’t mind grinding or paying for labour points.\n\nIf you want any kind of pve experience. Or are a seeker of unique treasure and lust after making a very individual and unique build, then no. This game is definitely not your cup of tea. Don’t bother buying into it.\n","August 16, 2014","false","30.2"," 167 of 241 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","167","241","2","4"

Plus, Trion is a TERRIBLE company.\n\nLong version:\n\nI played from Day-1 (Gamanek here) until November 2014. I bought the Silver Pack and played 2 months, everyday, constantly, with also a guild under my command (a medium-large guild with 20+ members).\n\nThings began to fall apart as soon as more people kicked in: after the problem of the constantly full servers dissipated, the real problem began: hackers, bots and whatnot. All the land for housing was taken before you could even click it, thanks to an exploit regarding your character not actually being near the house, but letting the game think you're there, clicking to place the house.\n\nHousing is actually REQUIRED in the game, in order to create most of the things, without housing you're in for AN HELL HOT farm, and a lot of social demanding (knowing crafters, farm money for them, pay them, rinse&repeat) plus, obviously, the actual fun of the game being locked away from you. There are ways of circumventing this: have a friend pay the monthly subscription (you need it to being able to pay the taxes for the houses) and you then use his/her house. Still, you need that actual friend to do it for you. And find a spot for the house.\n\nAfter the house problem, there is the gilda problem: everything for housing costs Gilda Stars: every single advanced bench for your house vary in cost, and you need to pay also designs for house, scarecrows and a lot of things. These stars can be acquired through the chapters of the storyline (which at one point obviously ends) and doing daily things. The daily things, though, are somewhat boring things and sometime even HARD (like killing a certain number of monters which spawn in a precise hour of the day, without getting partied because there are already 1 or 2 full parties) plus, the range for things to be bought is around 250 gilda, while you make AT BEST 5-8 gilda PER DAY.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are okay, not Guild Wars quality, but still bearable, PVP is obviously "I've got the best equipment" and overall the game COULD BE really good. However, terrible company behaviour and a lot of unhappy mechanics really make this game fall apart.\nIf you've got money to waste on this, play FFXIV instead. IF you've got no money, then try this out, and go away when you're bored.\n\nDON'T PAY FOR THIS.","March 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 79 of 103 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","79","103","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRNFloyd/recommended/304030/","TRNFloyd","TRNFloyd (ツ)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRNFloyd/","76 products in account","It was a great game.. in beta.. then it launched.\n\nPlayed this game in beta and then again about a month and a half after it launched. I couldn't log in as a free2play player during launch due to the ridiculous login queues. That's been fixed however. When I finally decided to start seriously giving it a shot, I bought a month of patron and started from scratch.\n\n2 weeks into the game I got a thunderstruck tree from my 5th ever planted pine tree. I planted it outside of a farm and got extremely lucky imo that it wasn't stolen. From that tree, I made 4 logs and gave one to a guild mate, sold the other two and made one into a farm cart. The gold I got from the logs bought my second month of Patron.\n\nAt that point, I felt like I could keep playing this game if I was able to pay for sub time with gold. I felt I was off to a good start. Then the economy took a huge hit and a special type of tree was added to the cash shop via an RNG box. That box turned the player market upside down. Prices of the Thunderstruck Logs(not trees) and Prices of APEX(ArcheAge's subscription time in-game item) completely flipped. One became the other. APEX when I first bought it was 80-90 gold each and logs were several hundred gold. When I left game, it was the opposite. After logging in again since last year, the prices haven't changed much. To get a month of game time, you need 600-700 gold, but since logs are cheap(70-90G), you can make a farm cart rather easily and just start farming the gold.\n\nI never got past level 35 and I stopped questing at around level 21. Trade Packs leveled me from 21 to 35 and probably would of gotten me to the level cap had I continued. I knew a good way of making gold too, so I probably would of been able to earn my APEX had I kept at it. However, the game ran like ♥♥♥♥ on my computer. It still does, but I've learned that its a hardware issue on my end(parts are starting to die).\n\nAll that pails in comparison to the fact that there is no plots available if you start playing now. If you buy a month or two of Patron(which honestly, if you want to play the real game, then you're gonna have to), you will eventually get an 8x8 scarecrow lot. Its pretty good for growing things and if you have multiple characters, you could make a 16x16 with 4 characters on one server via the 8x8's on the temp gardens. They only allow 8x8's, but after a week the plots are demolished. All the permanent lots are taken and some are purposely taken in a certain position that doesn't allow for other lots to be placed near it.\n\nExample: Say theres a spot that can fit 4 16x16 lots evenly. There's more than likely that one guy who instead of evenly placing his lot in a corner, will place it one space towards the center, thus screwing over 3 other potential 16x16's. Sure, you could fit some 8x8's in there, but really, the 16x16 is the desired lot you would want for farming.. it can fit a lot more tall trees and thus more chances at thunderstruck trees. Plus it allows for a hell of a lot more farming, which in turn is more trade packs being run for gold or gilda stars..\n\nIn the end, I reinstalled this game simply to write this review. I do not wish to play it anymore and will move onto better games. Black Desert being one. I can play that game 100x better than ArcheAge ever ran, and that game isn't even released in Korea yet.. Its a sad truth that ArcheAge had potential to be a great game, but XL GAMES ruined it with a lot of bad moves. Maybe they are ideas in Korea, but here not so much. With all the blunders that happened, so many people left the game. So many people wanted it to be a great game.\n\nAnd it is, as long as you keep giving Trion and XL GAMES your money. Maybe one day I'll try again, but its very doubtful..","March 28, 2015","false","14.5"," 100 of 137 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","100","137","2","1"

It all started years and years ago when I started playing wow in alpha and continued to play that for years but eventually got bored of it. I had been looking for a new MMO to play but never really found one I enjoyed as much. Then I heard about arche age and was quite excited at the prospects of gameplay that they had promised. The thought of a somewhat dynamic world as far as raiding players castles and pirating was quite appealing. I was promised a game that was NOT P2W but rather actually required one to play the game in order to advance rather than just opening up your wallet. I paid a fairly decent amount for this game when it come out only to find out that they had deceived me and many others as to what they were actually getting in the pre-order pack. On top of all of these P2W issues the game itself is not very interesting and I got board of it almost as soon as I started playing because it gives you too much too soon. By like lvl 6 or something you get a mount, so everyone has one. In other MMO’s one must earn their mount and when one is seen riding one you know they have been playing for a while to earn that mount. The graphics in the game are about the only thing that is done well but it doesn’t even come close to redeeming this huge waste of time and money. Additionally I have learned that even if you uninstall the game and Glyph there is still a “anti-cheating” program titled “Eagle64” which apparently records things like your IP address whether you like it or not. Luckily I found a way to delete this stupid thing and I am finally free of all the shackles that came along with this polished turd.

I have played Chiv and the community on there is just horrible... however this community makes chiv look like a positive social gathering. Players are extremely disrespectful, no one helps eachother and from what I've gathered if you buy Patron or something from Trion.. and they can't recall or have record of it then they OPT you out for furture packs they give subscription players which requires you cash to get them. The support Trion has to offer is actually none, I've never dealt with such unorganized individuals. Back before this game was released I bought into the whole Archeum Pack deal thinking it was a smart thing to do. However now after all this time I've felt robbed considering they just put everything in the credit shop. And to seal the deal! I bought my wife and I both the Archeum pack, I logged in a little earlier last month and so did she. She recieved her heroes return welcoming pack + more goodies for being a patron. However I didn't recieve anything so I put in a ticket which they didn't answer, so I had to buy Patron just to get into Live chat. Once being there they then inspected my account and followed by saying the last time I logged in was in 2015,05,05.. and that was only on a character I Never used. The one I did use kept updating to a recent log in time period, So they said I was not able to get the same pack my wife got considering we supported this company. All in all Trion sucks hard and doesn't really care about their player base, the server merges show the game is going down the pipes.. If you play this I'd recommend not buying anything to support Trion, just play for free because XLGames did indeed make a fantastic game.","September 25, 2015","false","257.1"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","52","63","3","0"

Then the game came out.......  I had early access to the game considering i was a founder, so i was able play (i think) 4 or 5 days early, Or well would have if it wasn't for the fact that the severs where either down becuase of DoS or being over capped. When i was finally able to play it seemed like they screwed up the game pretty good. i got very low frames in any places that had more then 10 people, I should have maxed the game 40 times over and yet it chugged around. Also the P2W is strong with this one, makes it way unfair for anyone who wants to play the game with out dumping money into the gold farmer market. If you think this is bad wait until you hear this...  After the realese of the game and seeing how poorly the game was preforming i decided to get my money back from the founder pack, i had bought it off steam and considering i was playing by early access the game was not out on steam yet, under steam guidelines it was considered a pre-order so i requested that i get my money back, i was refunded after i explained why i wanted a refund and all that stuff,  but now i hear that i was one of the lucky ones becuase this game fell into a grey area. Well after alot of people asking for refunds Steam took the game off the market. A few days later i got a email from Trion saying i bought the game by a fraudulent way and my account was banned, Not that i cared or anything. I feel like i dont need to explain the game play that much do to the fact that besides of a huge focus on the social aspect and the guild support and class system the game does not stand out that much agianst other MMO's therefore the game play is almost the same with others in its class.","March 26, 2015","false","21.8"," 70 of 95 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","70","95","0","0"

Launch was plagued by issues and then in November a couple of big exploits were discovered (publicly at least) for which a large number of exploiters were never punished and ill-gotten gains were allowed to severely grant advantages and effect the economy.\nAs I started off by saying though, I did have a lot of fun playing Archeage. The fishing + tradepack mechanics added something I havent experienced in an MMORPG before. The sandbox nature of AA is also something that sadly isnt present in the majority of AAA MMORPGs, and the lack of instances really helped the open world pvp flourish back when the servers were full and going to freedrich as a full 50 man raid would lead to you having to fight to hold onto your tradepacks.\n\ntl;dr Really good game spoiled by exploits and developers/producers more interested in milking customers via the cash shop.

Want to gather crafting items... labour points. You get the picture.\nMost stupid system ever deployed; Labour points - it sucks the fun completely out of the game and makes my computer cry when the client needs to stay open overnight to tick over patron bonus's to try and get at least 20mins of 'fun' the next day.\nHaving to spent 12+hours waiting for labour points for an extremely short period of non-combat function is a bit on the rediculous side, c'mon.\n\nI know it's a hard thing to balance out the games economics, but at the moment, there is no economics, the lowest level items cost rediculous amounts of money because dusts are extremely over priced, not enough lewt in quests to make up for it, no drops other than quest items and coin purses.\n\nAs for bugs themselves, minimal, seems to be a slight issue with textures if the games running too long (textures get sucked away), other than that, seems fairly well made, it's pretty, the animations are pretty. There's the odd terrain glitch, floaty trees, rocks you can get trapped behind etc. I'm sure they'll get fixed, unlike other games, right?\n\nThe most hillarious feature of this game, by far, without a doubt, the justice system - whereby criminals are judged by a jury of their peers and the stories that flood the chat are hillarious - justice indeed - need more of that.\nI love the flight, the gliders and having passengers on your mounts which certainly helps when travelling around the map with friends.\n\nClass builds are somewhat unique, having 3 skillsets, I'm not sure what to make of this yet, as the characters seem super weak, but that would be due to the low level items I'm still forced to use, because... *dun dun dun* Labour points. Which does make the game seem somewhat more grindy than I'm presuming it is meant to be.\n\nThis game does have potential, don't ruin it like your other games Trion.\nThis review is subject to change, as and if/when, patches come out that fix the appalling state of the *dun dun dun* Labour system.\n\nEdit;\nHad this game refunded and removed from Steam.\nMy account was one of those banned as a safeguard when they got hacked and leaked their account database all over the place, after over a week of fighting their monkey support system who repeatedly failed to actually read my tickets and offered generic copy/paste replies (which tbh I don't mind, if they READ the ticket I put in) they could not unban my account, IP banned me accidently, failed to remove the IP ban, repeatedly.

I’m not into Farmville and this game feels like one merged into a tabbed MMORPG.  If some things were more automated and didn’t take such a ridiculous amount of time to get them done, then I’d probably have a different opinion.

Trion have horrible support, did their best to back-stab their founders and paying customers many times, and have horrible communication with the playerbase.\nThe community is beyond toxic at this stage, and the game is slowly emptying of people (getting back on steam was probably another step trying to revive it, but it is a matter of time before people will drop it here too).\n\nIf you want a game to just relax and play here and there without commitment, it can be fun and versatile. If you want something serious - invest time and money, have property and such... Archeage becomes a huge money/time drain, stressful, and is designed to draw you in and not let go (labor has limit, if you reach it you "lose" labor, you need to log in to pay taxes or you lose property, you need money to get taxes, be it ingame or out of your wallet, and the list can go on and on...)\n\nNow for the detailed part:\nFirst - Archeage is not a new game, it was previously published in both Korean and Russian markets for more than a year before it was released in NA/EU. That means all bugs, exploits, problems were known and the release was supposed to be smooth.\n\nI tried Archeage back in one of the early beta weekends, and immidiately joined as the potential this game holds is amazing! Really hardly any game thus far can compete with the amount of options you seem to have when you first join.\nThe class combination is almost limiteless, and while not all are viable for every situation, you can truly play something that is unique and suits you.\nThe combat system is the classic uninspired tab-target, but that's life, can't have it perfect.\n\nThe alpha was wonderful and enlightening, there were a few bugs and exploits but Trion's reputation from RIFT was a good one, so I assumed we're in good hands. I was wrong.\nHead-start was beyond disaster. Queues were horrible, servers and connection was not stable, and the servers were riddled of exploiters. What was supposed to be a chance to find a piece of land before it all fills up ended up as a struggle to even stay online. Launch only made things worse as it added even more people to the fray, a complete lack of servers allowed queues to pile up 4-8 hours waiting time for founders (don't even want to think about f2p players).\n\nFast forward a bit - Various gamebreaking exploits and hacks allowed people to dupe items, brute-force rng packs to give a specific item, teleport from one place to the other. A sea of bots killing mobs, doing trade runs. Trion didn't seem to care or do anything for long few months, with an occasional banwave (that also caught legit players, and them ending up waiting for a few weeks due to horrible support and losing their properties), and mostly some words that they are working on it between weeks of silence.\n\nIn the meantime they of course released various rng boxes in the cash shop, making obvious what their priorities are.\nA bit afterwards the first economy-blow came in the form of rng boxes that made one of the rarest items in the game common, instantly dropping its price to about 1/8-1/10 of its original value, also allowing people to create end-game vehicles for cheap and thus infuse more gold into the economy, creating a huge inflation.\nOf course for a couple of weeks nothing was done, and in the end the rng box simply rotated to another one as was normal.\n\nThe straw that broke my back was when they took back a contract/promise they gave to founders: We were entitled 10% discount off of cash shop items, we never got it. Trion tried to shake it off, then get rid of evidence (all posts and ads that included that information), claiming they technically can't do it (then why offer it in the first place?!), then placing it on XLgames and offering a 10% extra credits to all those who purchased credits AFTER launch, effectively putting a knife in founders' backs and twisting it, just for fun. Of course by now you will hardly find evidence of that too, most people that cared enough about it left.\n\nYes - they got a bit better, they communicate a bit better and their support is not as horrible anymore (but still very bad). But there are still weekly dramas and gamebreaking decisions on regular basis, that seem to be made to overwhelm you enough to open your wallet. Don't fall into it.\n\nMy point is - This game has TONS of potential, it can be lots of fun. But after playing for a few months you will notice one simple truth: Trion (and XLgames) are only after your money. This game can be fun, it can be good, but they make a HUGE effort to make sure it will only be fun for those who pay.\nThe amount of rng in this game is beyond crazy - from mob drops (you get a purse, that costs you labor to open, and you have a low chance of getting anything of value), to crafting (from a certain point weapon/armor you craft come out "sealed", and only one type out of 7 can be upgraded further), to upgrading (increasing the quality of item has insanely low chances at higher grades, it will usually drop it in grade instead). All those, and more, are there to make sure that you need either insane amount of luck, or insanely deep pockets to actually be able to get decent equipment. Top equipment is really beyond anyone's means unless they drop thousands of dollars, exploit or are criminally lucky.\n\nAnother big problem is that I see no future for this game. The latest patch in Korea is probably the last, and while NA/EU still have a while to go (Trion intentionally implement things in parts, or realllllyyyy slow), it will reach its end form, and from there only decline.\n\nBottom line - This game is meant to draw you in with decent graphics, a promise of immersive playstyle and options beyond your wildest dreams... Then it latches it claws in the form of duties and menial work you have to do to be able to actually have fun... Balancing that is very difficult, so I really can't recommend this game.","March 27, 2015","false","804.8"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

Maybe some of you recognize me from Tahyang. Don't let my steam hours deceive you, I have played this game for about 500 hours. AA is my most played game by far. I was too naive to see the negative aspects of the game. Ah, the bliss of ignorance. So I finally discovered this about when paid transfers happened. I had been playing on and off casually due to family issues. I actually quit for a month. I had known that the game was dying before that, albeit I didn't know why, but when I came back, Trion broke everything. Tahyang was dead, Ollo was dead, everything was ♥♥♥♥ing dead. The new server was the only one that wasn't shattered. It killed me on the inside to see ArcheAge die. AA was some of the best fun I ever had until Trion stuck their ♥♥♥♥♥ in too far into the cash shop. They finally outdid themselves and came into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s of the community, and when you ♥♥♥, you generally stop ♥♥♥♥ing. That's exactly what happened. Trion got too greedy as they always do, I have noticed, and ♥♥♥♥ed their game. ♥♥♥♥ed their community. ♥♥♥♥ed their reputation. I played Trove for a while. Trove was exactly the same. I have made my choice. I am not going to play AA ever again or any other Trion game. I play TF2 now. Thanks for reading.

Secondly, over half of my hours played are spent AFK due to the stupid Labor regeneration.\n\nI stumbled across this game last summer, and thought my wife would love it.  I wasn't wrong.  But what surprised me is how much I found that *I* loved this game.  From the time I started playing during the closed beta/Alpha stages, I was spending a large portion of my weekends living in ArcheAge.  It quickly became all-time favorite game.\n\nThe game itself is amazing.  Never before have I played a game where you can do just about anything.  Make a farm, grow what you need.  Use those materials to create ships, potions, food, houses, trade goods, etc.  Spend time tending to you home/garden/farm, take trade packs across the maps for gold, go deep sea fishing, steal other people's trade packs and or fish, PvE world bosses, Dungeons, PvP arenas, pirating... There is literally so much to do, that it is overwhelming.\n\nWhere all of these negative reviews are coming from, is from an administrative perspective, and that IS this game's single biggest failing, and it is  major one.  Trion has made mistake after mistake, seemingly on a monthly basis like clockwork.  These mistakes usually revolve around the "Marketplace" (Cash Shop) and involve them placing very rare (and coveted) items in Mystery (RNG) boxes, where people pay real money for random items.  The game is based on an in game economy, which Trion seems to influence for the worse.  But, they do seem to be doing better.  Most major things are being addressed.  Will they ever be a good publisher? Definitely not, but if they can stay out of their own way, this game might just live on it's own.\n\nPeople complain about this game being Pay 2 Win (P2W), which is an over exaggeration. You CAN play the game as a Free 2 Play, but yes, you really do need to be a Patron to enjoy this game.  But I don't consider a monthly fee as P2W.  But due to Trion's marketplace, and APEX, you can dump as much cash as you want into this game and get gold, to which you can buy whatever you need.  So that part is very much P2W, but definitely NOT a requirement to play, enjoy, and succeed in this game.\n\nThis game is an online game with other people, and as such, other people influence this game.  Mostly, everyone in game is having fun and enjoying playing the game.  A small and vocal minority spend a lot of the time creating drama anyway they can, and whine, complain, and cry.\n\nAs for my initial comment about Labor regeneration.  Labor is used in the game to do tasks which generate income or materials.  Such as, 100 labor to catch a fish to sell for gold, or 10 to chop down a tree, etc.  As it is, you generate 5 labor every 5 minutes that you are offline (as a Patron) and 10 labor every 5 minutes that you are online.  Therefore, everyone tries to stay online all the time... which is ridiculous.  They ARE changing this soon though however (finally) so it will be the same whether you are online or not.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe game itself is amazing, I could go on for hours about the hundreds of different things you can do.  I have spent months playing this game, and probably several more to come.  Trion's management as a publisher has been a nightmare, but hopefully the worst is behind us and they improve.  Don't get sucked into the drama, game bashing, and general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery that the community has created.  Just play the game and experience for yourself if you can find your place in this amazing game world.\n\n-Pufferfish\nEnla - West","March 28, 2015","true","388.2"," 92 of 146 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","92","146","9","2"

If you are interested in buying this game, don't- unless you have an endless money supply to keep up with the paying members.\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT FOR FREE TO PLAYERS! I cannot stress this enough. I have tried *alot* as a free to play(couple hundred hours) some of it was fun, but it has been made worse as a game since it was in Alpha and beta since the release of Pay to Win items.\n\nPay to win items in Archeage are everywhere, sure you can buy cosmetics, but if you do you probably have bought many pay to win items in this game. To get the best gear in the game one has to regrade. Regrading makes the game more P2W than most because the chances of upgrading items become almost impossible (Highest tier regrade chance 2%- auto breaks if you fail the regrade).\n\nAs a game if there was no publisher involved-\n\nGraphics: Archeage has not come a far way from Alpha, but I have not expected it too. The quality of the Terrain is sometimes a bit plain but there are objects of beauty everywhere in sight (trees, bushes and rocks fit in perfectly) and the game does not need to be run in high quality to be good.\n\nCustomisation: So far as menu options, with a quick ask in chat someone will tell me how to see quests 1000m away so I can see which quests I have not completed. The Hud is all resizable and you can move it around by shift-click(Dragging). There can be up to 5 hotbars, you probably don't need more :). Costumes as I explained before are mostly obtained from the Cash store and they look fairly well on other players. If you don't like realisim you might not like this feature but you can wear an entire set of armor under a dress or under a prisoners outfit.\n\nGameplay: Do quests, do trade runs (and sometimes get killed), do dungeons with mentors who help you and guide you :D, then do world boss raids where 50 people all pull out harpoons and go all ghost busters on the enemy npcs. Get a house (If you are patron) and grow stuff on farms( if you are patron). Overall you can do everything as free to play like playin enough to buy apex to get patron, and there is more free roam and ship sailing than any other mmo out there this good.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 {Best MMO Quality objects, sometimes things did not load in for several people and had to relog}\nCustomisation: 7/10 {There are ship designs and costumes but costumes are hard to obtain as a F2P}\nGameplay: 8.5/10 {Lots of freedom to do what you want but getting into level 50 is a grinding spree with no real reward}\nPublisher: 5/10 {The Publisher kept the cash store P2W aspect, does not have consistent Cheat protection}\n\nOverall: 7.3\n\nNote: This game was great in Alpha, if you have a time travel machine go back there to experience this at its height.","December 29, 2015","false","897.6"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

Stealing isn't really punished because the game gives you the option to become a pirate so it's almost encouraged to kill/steal.\nIf you get caught doing so many crimes you'll eventually be put to trial and potentially sent to prison and when in prison you wont be allowed to play the game for a certain amount of time depending on the judge's decision.\nAs a player you can serve Jury Duty for someone who commits a crime against you but realistically it's futile because the person gets anywhere from 5-30 min max prison time. Ohh, and the have to pick up garbage for community service. -__-\n\nSooo, once you've realized it's nearly impossible to farm (which is why I wanted to play the game) you have to create trade packs to get any real money in game. Trade pack runs are tedious and any one whether in your faction or not can kill you for said pack.You'll spend 30 minutes running the trade pack and run the risk that if you can even get it to another shore someone more powerful can just kill you.\nThere can be SOME fun to this if you go in groups but it's still tedious and time consuming either way.\n\nIf you want a house you also have to be a paid subscriber to own a land plot and HOLY ♥♥♥♥, good luck finding any space for said house or farm plot.All the plots have been taken since Alpha/Beta. People scam the system by creating multiple accounts  and getting around loophole of one plot per character. Those same people will wait for a demolished plot from someone who hasn't plaid their house taxes ,yup you have to pay property tax.\n\nI was VERY lucky to find an awesome maxed lvl character that helped me around lvl 30 and gave me a 10X10 farm plot.\nI also was able to find a spot for a house when the property prices plummeted after a huge server crash that lasted for about three days.\nNone of this would have been possible if I wasn't a paid subscriber.\n\nI will eventually try the game again being a free to play member and attempt to do none of the farming quest and see if the game is enjoyable at all that way.\nIf you can somehow see past all the things I've mentioned and still enjoy the game then more power to you, but keep in mind Archeage has touted and open world Sandbox game from the beginning and fails to offer any of that unless you pay your dues. I wouldn't be as upset if I had known this going in but it's just too much of a cash grab IMO.\nI feel bad for the people who paid $100+ for the Alpha packages, keep away from this game if you like your wallet.\n","March 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

They show you every possible things you can do in the game; however the catch? you got to either grind 24/7 as a f2p or whip out your credit card.

They must think "hey if a smart person would sit down and calculate how much time it take to make the gold to pay for patronship they would just op to pay us with their credit card and save their time. This way you can spend that time grinding to actually grind more!!!"\n\nIf this game was designed like WoW I would have definately jump in. I rather pay a one time fee a month and enjoy all obtainable objective rather than  pay to play yet still have to pay extra on cashshop to further my goal. All the feather they stated that patron brings are not really affecting the game play are lies. They are affecting the game play in a huge way; having economic superiority over others or being able to dish out more cash on the cash shop can affect the game play greatly.

Don't let it fool you at all.  This game is far from what it appears to be.  This game is just another way for you to waste your money than realize you have truely wasted your money, putting money into this game is litterally like burning money.  Use that money for something more useful like oh I don't know getting a game that isn't filled with bad mechanic choices?\n\nOkay if that above didn't stop you than hopefully this will.\n\nI am a guy who plays games like Minecraft, Space Engineers, Age of Empires, recently Sins of a Solar Empire.  I have played World of Warcraft, Runescape, Evony, Evony2, Tera, MapleStory, Mabinogi.  If you don't think I got enough experience in this field than let me just say I spent around $400-$600 on WoW because of the subscription, faction transfers, race changes, server transfers, getting random crap from the shop such as the small pets and a mount or two.  I know what it is to waste money, back than though WoW was good to my standards.\n\nThis game though, this game I was going to actually throw some money into it, I was going to spend enough for half a year to a year subscription just to possibly get the boosts that seamed to be needed for staying decent in the game.\n\nIn all honesty it's not f2p unless you truely wish to torture yourself, no I haven't played it, I have read the reviews by those who have played it for a good 2,000 hours or so, ammount of time I probably spent in WoW. Let me list reasons it appealed to me and reasons for why I changed my mind:\n\n-What appealed to me-\n1. Sandbox elements {oh sweet I can jump in and slowly build myself an empire nice}\n2. Hybrid style talent builds {oh sweet not too much restriction on a character, I like that, heck lets try being Tanky Priest lel}\n3. Gathering Materials {oh so when building my empire it's like minecraft/age of empires where I gather the materials to build the homes and walls? NICE}\n4. Don't need to keep the same skills? {Sweet if i get bored I can become an Archer priest or maybe a mage warlock combo with Dots galor? MMM yay destruction}\n\n\n-What made me change my mind-\n1. Finding out Labor isn't what I thought it was {Think about playing all those FB games you either still play or got sick of playing, that nice annoying energy bar that you ended up slowly wasting $50 on without even knowing it}\n2. PvE? {apparently from the reviews the PvE isn't really there, sure you got quests but it doesn't seam that PvE is really there, you get bored after a long while being level cap}\n3. Pay to Rek PvP? {So it's not just subscription based with a fake label but the PvP is pretty much pay to get the best gear because grinding will make you rage, and not provide you with what you need to survive agianst the rich little rekers}\n4. Gear regrading or whatever {So ever play Elder Scrolls Oblivion, or ever play a game where you gotta constantly repair your gear?  Well apparently this game has that nice little mechanic, but makes it worse.  Apparently it degrades quicker than you can upgrade it, thus why this is Pay to Win PvP, aka Pay to play the side of the game that actually has content.  I've been on the side where I get rekt constantly because my gear isn't as good yet, I Don't feel like paying to be able to survive in PvP.}\n5. Want to build an empire? {well get inline, apparently their isn't open land to build an empire, let alone expand it if you find an area.  Thus the sandbox aspect in all honesty is false and only for those who established at the very start of a new server.  Which I don't think new servers pop up much at all.}\n\nIn all truth this game has great potential, sadly that potential will never be attempted to be reached as this game has already been corrupted and the developers will never change such mechanics thus such a great idea has already been ruined by the greed of another developement company that thought of the worst choices to have an income.\n\nSo what I recommend you do, is keep looking and possibly find something that may not end up being as good of a concept as this but will be far better than playing a game you'll never have the money to really enjoy.","May 9","false","12.3"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","25","32","4","0"

The armour in it isn't all that good and there should be more options as well as stronger choices. Not only that, but there needs to be more resources in the marketplace such as boats, materials and pets.\n(In my opinion, it's a bit of a money waister if you ask me.)\n\n- RolePlay\nNow this isn't much of the creators fault, but more or so of the community's. In the chat you will commonly find RolePlay (Or RP for short) happen throughout the game, and to be quite frank it can get quite disguisting, players start to talk about sexual things as well as DOING sexual stuff: as an example someone started to strip naked till they were only left with their bra and pants and gave most players a BJ. Some of you may think that is nice but to me it is just horrible and vulgar.\n\n- Overall Opinion\nThere are many more things I can say about this game, whether or not they are bad or good there would probably be more bad things to say from me than good. This is just my opinion and if it helped you by any chance then you're welcome.","March 30, 2015","false","55.3"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","34","48","4","1"

They had the number of people who bought the founder packs yet somehow managed to have 6+ hour queues on all servers during all 4 days of the head start, naturally it got worse when the free players arrived. Right before I quit they added the most pay to win thing yet, a high chance to get the most valuable resource in the game that fueled open world farming, Archeum trees. They never even cared about the obvious gold farmer botting problems, you and 4 other people waste your resource that is used for nearly every action of the game that regenerates slowly to report 1 of the 30 bots in the same area and then see them still grinding in the same place a week later. They also ruined all the player made best in slot non equipment gear too, the best gliders made from 100 ultra rare items are now the exact same as the basic $$$ cash shop ones but have less useful abilities, the best mounts used to come from leveling up a mount and spending a ton of money to upgrade it and relevel it, now you just buy the cash shop ones that have better abilities since they all move the same speed, game is currently more pay to win than the other versions, don't know why people think otherwise. This is the 3rd time they have released a $$$ pack system, but I haven't actually checked in months so there could be more. Can't forget the purposely delayed updates, they had all the stuff released in the newest content update months before release ready in the alpha and took nearly 2 months to release 25% of the cut content after launch.

But then during the later closed betas I could hardly ever get it to open. The reason is I have Avast as my antivirus software and Archeage's anticheat system Ahn Labs cannot deal with that. No matter what I do, how many tickets I submit, how extensive the results I get back, how many results I get back, all the suggestions on all sorts of forums, even trying to turn off my firewall, NOTHING works. It never works. It's not like I'm going to stop using Avast since IMO it's the best out there. So even though Archeage was a truly good and fun experience I can't play it and from what I read many people who have Avast experience the same issues.\n\nI love this game and if you can play it and it actually can run on your system, do it. It is so worth it, the class system is extensive, the amount of crafting is great and provides an excellent alternative to combat. The trade runs are some of the most fun I've ever had in an MMO, they take time, planning, perfect execution, and a great guild.

Everything is going perfectly, so you decide to take the plunge for a long commitment by investing actual money in this person... Then come to find out that this person violated your trust by allowing others access to your personal information- as well as stole money from you and blamed you and everyone else who meets them for trusting them. Yet, this person has the gall to continue to pester you with bribes and incentives to invest more time and money into them.\n\nThat's how the creators of Archeage treated their clients when the game was released here in the states after thousands of accounts were compromised. The overall game was fun from beta tests to release with relatively few hiccups until the big day. The storyline for each race was decently engaging, the game mechanics were smooth, and the graphics were absolutely beautiful to behold. However, thanks to the security breach in a faulty program, many who bought founders packs and demanded a refund after our accounts were hacked got a response that amounted to "We got ours, f*ck off. You only have yourself to blame." After months of attempting to get access to our own accounts back or a refund for the FP we did not get to utilize, I, my spouse, and the friends *we* had showed this game to and begged to try, were not able to get a response of any kind.\n\nSo, my final statement is this:\n\nArcheage had the potential to be a decent game, but because the company it was made by is such utter sh*t and run by thieving  c*nts, I highly advise against playing it or paying any money into it at all.","March 26","false","42.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

To add insult to injury, the monthly sub doesn't come with market credits (like all Daybreak Games/SOE online games).\n\nThe game ran fine at max settings on dx9 mode, after the 2 minute delay for Hackshield.\n\nThe questing was OK but nothing original.\n\nThe housing needed to be instanced. I know they wanted to be a 'sandbox' but considering you had to pay RL money to have housing (and use the auction house) on top of the fact land was limited, was sad.

I played roughly 8hrs a day from release after steam dropped it (CB2/3), so hundreds of hours are not logged on Steam. At any rate, the game was extremely fun to from the kickoff. You meet players around the world, quest, do dungeons, etc. The selling point for me was the mobility. Need to get somewhere quick? Warp or use your glider. I got lucky upon release and recieved patron status for free. That allowed me to auction and play the market, acquiring enough gold to buy APEX in game. Bought 4 months of patron for free that way, got some land, finished ingame questing. Then Trion decided to mess with the market, adding Pay 2 Win methods. I pulled out my wallet and stopped myself before making a poor judgement call in sinking real cash into the game. Here is why:\n\nLand was sparse\nRNG dictates so much in this game and coerses gambling habits (wih real cash before you know it)\nCheaters/Bots\nMuch more, play 50+hrs and you will see\n\nIts free to play, but you will never catch up unless your wallet is bigger than your eyes.\n\n","March 31, 2015","false","17.8"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","33","50","2","0"

Everything about this game should make a good game. Being able to own your own land the character customization and the way the class system works makes all your characters unique.

Unfortunately they totally ♥♥♥♥ed up. From the beginning I was really skeptical with their founder bs, luckily I only paid $50 which I somewhat enjoyed during my 4 months but there was definitely a lot of frustration. Only reason I paid was to play with friends, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't have bought founder.\n\nThe game is very unstable. New patches for this game when I was playing somehow made the graphics options really weird. At launch I was able to play at high, then a patch came and I had to go on low or my fps would just take a huge dump. Then a new patch came out and it became unplayable on low and I had to switch to very high to be able to play. They released the North continent with castle sieges and we only had 1 week of castle sieges before something messed up and it had to be canceled for about 3 weeks. The server would sometimes crash when we killed the Kraken and we would have to wait up to a few hours until it was back up.\n\nThere are a lot of hackers and gold farmers in this game. The economy is pretty bad and finding land is somewhat impossible with the land hackers and all the people who were there first. The best gear is obtained through crafting and you would have to pray to baby RNGesus. Buying good gear was super overpriced for most people who didn't buy gold. This game was a mess when I left and I doubt it got much better.\n\n\nI personally can't recommend this game. It's a free install/uninstall but if you don't want to waste your time.

I'm going to start with the good, and then list the bad and the ugly parts of this game.\nThe good parts of this game that they nailed on the spot.\n1.character customization\n2. leveling while in combat and crafting\n3. the combat and skill customization to make your character unique to others\n4. Mounts system.\n5. the quest system is good.\n6. Great tutorial\nUnfortunately I only got to lvl 15, tried to get back on the next day, and the game could not load on computer. There are still a lot of things on this game that I have yet to explore or to experience and I would have enjoyed trying them out, but that leads us to the bad and ugly side of this game.\nThe bad parts of this game that throws this game in the garbage can.\n1. Im going to start with the labor system. To give a general idea of how the labor system works is anytheing that you gather or create such as mining, gathering herbs, or maintaining livestock takes labor points. When you start off in the game you get zero labor points, and as a free to play subscription you only get 5 points every 5 minutes you play and none when not playing, which makes sense cause Trion wants to make money on subscription fees, which does give you more labor points to work with.\n2. Crafting system. Sor far with the sandbox games Ive been seeing a lot of issues, and one of them is getting enough random matts (material that you get at random from opening bags droped from mobs.) So far I've came close to creating a sword but the the random matts stopped me in my tracks, which is depressing cause in ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes crafting is essential and without crafting makes the game lose depth and interest. But it still has potential as long as you want to put your spare time in this game(mostly all your spare time) to just make a sword aor anyother item that you want to make.\n3.Main quests the good part about the main quests it gives you a decent story throughout the game, but when I do the maain quests the tend to get stuck on the beginning of cinima part and the game crashes. It's a great idea, but it reality they messed it up cause the game to freeze in black screen.\n\nNow the ugly parts of this game.\n1. This game is not computer friendly because you may be able to play this game at least 4 times before something goes wrong, and it doesn't load. Pretty much your waiting for this game to load or waiting for this game to crash. Most likely your waiting for this game to crash. When it does there is a internet page that pops up saying what YOU need to do to make this game work on your computer. The page is somewhat helpful but it didn't fix my problem with this game. ANYTIME and I mean ANYTIME a game that can't play on your computer and the the company tells you how to fix it, and they don't fix it themselves is a terrible game design in progamming, and the company who is in charge is not getting my money to play this game.\n2. This game is definatly a pay to win game for sure, cause you cannot craft hardly anything at all with a free subcription.\nThis my review of Archeage, it had potential but they threw it down the garbage disposal of dispare, misery, and disapointment. I would highly recommed staying away from this game.","April 26, 2015","false","11.3"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","32","50","2","0"

They consistently make mistakes that cost players a lot of hardwork, and have NO intentions of compensating anybody affected AT all. I lost so much of my land because of what Trion did during a server merge. When people said something to them, they apologized and did it anyway. Nobody was compensated, half of us werent able to log in during the land rush, and as a result we lost EVERY SINGLE PROPERTY. I've tried several times to get a server transfer from the server they merged me onto, that's all I wanted as compensation for being COMPLETELY screwed.

What MMO ever launches without a few hitches, right?\n\nA few months later, guild dissolved as nearly everyone quit, most people gone due to rage and disappointment with the game's mismanagement. It turns out the client is fundamentally flawed to such a degree that hackers and exploiters could do everything from claim valuable real estate from afar to duplicate some of the most valuable and necessary items in the game.

I have played about 500 hours on the Glyph app that the game was originally on (platform-wise). There are multiple gripes I have witht his game that kinda made me regret spending those hours playing on it.\n\nPro's\n-The Graphics are sub-par however I have can play the game on high settings and the game looks pretty decent. I have however got curious to look at how the graphics are on Medium-Low, etc.\n-Lore-wise there is some story even though that it is buried underneath a lot of cloud smoke and specific items that have a flavor text to them to understand some background information.\n-Gameplay is somewhat engaging, in massive raid's to see a lot of things happening and brought some form of nostalgic feeling back in the day when I played Classic WoW.\n\nCon's\n-The overall atmorsphere of the game doesn't feel right, of course at the beginning of launch the game was full of pvp'ers, griefers, hackers, scammers, etc. And also that those who bought founders pack especially those who spent $100 dollars on the founders pack and got that game breaking boost that gave those who had it to get a lot more done and those who didn't fell behind really quickly.\n-Questing in AA is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to do. You can't do anything without going halfway across the world just to find one thing only to go back to where you came from and have to go to the opposite way you just came from to complete the quest. The rewards from the main quest line aren't useful as you could find Dungeon gear that blows it out of the water, Even when you begin.\n-Queue-Simulator, This was something that was a big issue in the beginning, So I am not sure how it is now, maybe there aren't that many people who play the game. But again this was another thing that really bothered me. Of course if you spent money on Founder's you would bypass that entire process.\n-Balancing is a serious issue in the game as some classes are extremely useless while some are absolutely broken in all manners.\n-Pay to Play (or do anything without a ♥♥♥♥ing limit). As with all Trion World games you have the option to become a "patron" I call it founder even though I know the difference between the two. "Patron Status" is the good ol' thank you for spending money on us, here have everything on a silver platter and do not worry about getting behind because we will break the game for you. I honestly think the Patron is the equivalent to being a hacker. Say it takes 10 Labor to mine a vein of ore, and you have a base of 1000 Labor. Your could mine 100 veins of ore if you arent a patron. On the other hand you could become a Patron and mine 200 plus get bonuses along side it.\n-There aren't many other things you can do, unless you want to whip out your credit card to have an advantage over the other people. However that would make you a ♥♥♥♥ and you also wouldnt enjoy the game anymore if you hadnt liked it before.","June 4","false","7.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Then the cash shop took over and made it pay to win to the extreme. Well technically it's pay to advance but in pvp if you aren't within a tier of other players gear you will get smoked every time unless you run with zergs or only spec the most op specs you can find to balance out your crap gear.\n\nThe game was beautiful and brought in ships to the MMO world, the ocean was gorgeous and from say 1 I just wanted a cottage on the ocean.....yaaaaaahhhhh right. The land grab crap was insane and stupid, people allowed to just buy up everything they could get their hands on. 99% of all houses that go defunct and come up for auction are won by flat out hackers and everyone in the game knows it complains and the devs do jack and squat over it.\n\nTo be able to compete gear wise you need to be willing to A: spend 500 dollars or more on the cash shop to get +chance combine items, or be willling to own upwards of 6 or 8 properties and have literally no life hauling packs all day long. You will then have a literal part to full time job with upkeep on your properties, and because items past tier 3 can drop enchants on fail or even break. Past tier 4 they pretty much break if you fail a combine which mind you only has like  a 10% chance to succeed. Prepare to spend most of your time breaking upwards f 30 pieces of gear to get one piece that allows you to fight against only a few people. The top pvpers will literally have most of their items 3 to 4 tiers above you and splat any 3 to 4 person group of average geared joes.\n\nAlso prepare to meet people who park carts that you can't bypass or move to block you from doing the 13 million trade pack runs that you need to do to even get in the door of pvp and there is no recourse. You can't kill them and they just sit there afk watching a movie and talking s-h-i-t.\n\nI truly loved this game but even with my relaxed schedule I just don't have time to spend 20 hours a day on it.\n\nIf you plan to never sail outside of your safe zones, never pvp and pay some real money to buy land off the hackers who in turn sell the currency on their websites then you will love the game. Otherwise prepare to grind like you never have before. I am a long standing veteran of korean grind mmo's this one takes the cake. I have also played EQ since it's release and most every pvp oriented mmo out. The devs in this game are by far the worst pieces of horsec a c a ever.

In a little over a month.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have with this game is that the gear progression is entirely randomized, and it is not randomized in your favor.

Not quite what you were looking for? Check out my TERA review and decide for yourself. Now on to the review.\n\nStill here? Great. The rest of this review will be dedicated to the pros and cons of Archeage, and analyzing how it holds up in the oversaturated MMORPG genre.\n\nWhy ArcheAge is good:\n\n-You are immediatly given a huge number of character customazation tools, making it easy to really personalize and come to love your in game sprite.\n\n-Graphically beautiful. Everything from the in game models to the backgrounds and environments feel alive.\n\n-Deep class system. Through the patented "pick 3" class system and the option to change classes at any time, you should never feel bored or disappointed with your role.\n\n-Economy nuts will have a blast. Through a deep player driven market and well designed trading system, wealth is just a couple minutes away.\n\n-Deep and interesting universe. Each area feels aesthetically different and holds its own lore. About 60% of the quests, including side quests, have some deeper meaning in the in game world and give you the opportunity to immerse yourself.\n\n-Gear and loot tends to be pretty well balanced.\n\n-Combat and pvp are intelligent. Mashing buttons isn't going to do you any favors. Play smart.\n\n-The community is, generally speaking, supportive and enthusiastic. Of course, it's up to you to find a guild and make friends, but I doubt anyone would have trouble finding a friendly group to work with.\n\n-Gaining skills feels rewarding. I genuinely looked forwards to each level up because it signified one step closer to something awesome (nothing feels as satisfying as your first meteor or tiger strike)\n\n-The game really did feel like a sandbox. I never felt like I was being pushed one way or another. The story quests act as a sort of guided tour of each area, but other then that the game is more then welcome to let you do as you please.\n\n-Building, owning, and maintaining in game property is intuitive and immensly satisfying. From the smallest cottage, to a mantion or castle, every home interior is fully customizable and ready to show off to your friends.\n\nWhy ArcheAge falls short of greatness:\n\nI had a few major issues with ArcheAge, but they mostly all boil down to two thing: Accessibility and Respect for the Player.\n\nSo what do these big words mean? Don't worry, I'm here to help. Basically, for much of the time I spent in ArcheAge, the game neither felt easy to use or even that fun at points. Here's why.\n\n-ArcheAge is hard to understand.\nTrying to craft or perform higher level trade runs (essential at higher levels) is a bit like trying to hit a pinata. If the pinata was the size of a penny. And your hands were tied behind your back. Basically I'm saying it's really not easy to do. There are a few vague and confusing extra curricular quests you can attempt to learn the most basic functions of these mechanics, but in the end you're still left confused and unsatisfied for most of the process.\n\n-ArcheAge is hard to use without payment.\nThe so called "pay to win" model people often accuse Archeage of having is, while exagerated, somewhat factual. The game funtions on a "Labor" system, where the player regenerates points while playing, and then spends those points on in game actions. Come the later levels, it is enfuriating to constantly find your self without Labor points. ArcheAge functions on a subscription basis, but unlike other MMORPG's, the subscription is less of a luxury and more of a necessity, as it doubles your maximum Labor and allows Labor regeneration while offline.\n\n-ArcheAge does not respect your time.\nArcheAge has a deep dungeon system and great end game/pvp content. It's a shame you won't see a sign of any of this for the first 150 hours of play time at least. This game does a good job of rewarding players who stick around past the 250 or so hour mark. Not ready to dedicate that much of your time? Sorry, you're missing half of what the game has to offer.\n\n-ArcheAge does not respect your desire for progression.\nGrinding, or playing repetative quests for the sake of progression, is a staple for MMORPG's. This is understandable, and can even be fun as a way to fill up your time between more important tasks or quests while leveling up your character. However, in many places ArcheAge falls pray to excessive ammounts of padding and side questing that feels boring, unrewarding, and generally leaves the player dissapointed at the game. I found it really saddening that, although I was surrounded by beautiful environments and interesting lore, most of the time the questing broke down to "Go click F on 4 NPC's, kill 50 monsters, go click F on the same 4 NPC's. Rince and repeat."\n\nI had a bit of a dysfunctional relationship with ArcheAge. Every time the game annoyed me or wasted my time, and I was sure I was going to quit right then and there, it managed to rope me back in with the little things. Have you noticed that when you play music in a dungeon it echoes? Have you ever ridden a snow lion through a rain forest with a friend? Have you ever spent 2 hours trying to pilot a rowboat down a river with aparty of guild members, laughing the whole time? It's moments like these that really left me smiling at the end of every play session.\n\nArcheAge is a good game. If you come to terms with its annoying and confusing segments, you'll uncover one of the most well fleshed out, responsive, and socially enjoyable MMORPG's on the market.\n\n7.5/10\n\nEnjoyed the review?

I wont discuss the buisness model because frankly that is somthing each player must decide the value of.\n\nIn short the questing and combat feels like its about ten years out of date, it is dull hotkey mashing and pretty much nothing but fetch me ten bear ♥♥♥♥'s and or kill ten bears. Combat is also damned unforgiving if you want to fight more than one enemy at a time you'll probably die, i was playing as a tank character with healing abilities and at most i could fight two enemies at the same time anything more and death was certain.\n\nI never bothered with any of the crafting systems after a short tutorial quest on farming i decided it wasnt for me. Essentialy you must buy seeds, pick a plot of land to plant them in then either wait for them to grow or water them to speed up the process, after all that you can then harvest but actualy gaining crops is not guarrenteed so it seems like a huge time sink. As a side note some crops takes litteral hours to grow, i think wheat was listed at over two and half hours for a single crop.\n\nGaining any resource in the world such as iron ore requires what the game refers to as "labor points" essentialy this an arbitrarty point system that add's nothing but forces players to save up points thus missing out on items and loot, if you choose to save points eventualy you will be able to spend them on somthing good like a house but i have no idea how many hundreds of hours that would take, Points are generated all the time whilst logged on i believe you gain five points per five minuets of play, it is simply a bad system that punishes players for no reason.\n\nThis final point is probably the biggest nail in the coffin though, the community is non existant, in the five hours i played i never once saw a single other player or saw anyone typing messages in chat, i even asked "is anyone else playing right now" multiple times and never recieved a reply.\n\nWrap up stament: The combat is boring and tedious, the quests are equaly disapointing. The playerbase is so small that you may aswell be playing by youself. Crafting is a huge time waster and the labor points make it even worse.\n\nAvoid this game you will only waste time on it and gain nothing,","June 26, 2015","false","5.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Questing and leveling is slow and a major bore. The combat, while it isnt all that clunky, definitely cannot be called smooth. Combat still requires you to use skill rotations. Movement feels weird. I cannot put my finger on it but it doesnt feel natural. I think this may be due to the character animation/size. Music was great at character creation but then drifts off into a less than desireable sound that reminded me of 90s game music for some reason.\n\nThis game has cool ideas, like being able to steal from other peoples crops, forests, animals, etc... when they try to hide their farms up on mountains or in valleys.\n\nAlso you can commit crimes and leave behind clues that other people can report which will force you to go to jail and have to hold a trial by jury which is literally other players.\n\nLots of neat ideas but the game itself is shabby and does not feel smooth or fun at all.\n","June 9, 2015","false","23.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

BDO's energy system is way better for consumption of points, wtf.\n\nThis game is extremely disappointing. I entered the game world only to find vast, empty, spread out areas, and the first area was okay with all the foxes, but after getting to level 15 to talk in chat, the game world is extremely empty. It's like Trion didn't think about the scale of the game they wanted or something. The distance between towns is super long, the stuff between towns is just empty. No trees, foliage, or anything like that to catch the eye. The mob design is\n\nI really don't see how people are still playing this game, but I do hope they switch to Black Desert online at some point, and I'm glad I didn't start playing this game that much. I primarily started playing to have something to do while fishing on BDO. I thought the game would be much more similar to BDO in terms of graphics and gameplay from what everyone was saying but... holy cow lol. It's like almost Runescape graphics and just awful, extrmemely basic gameplay.\n\nI know I'm going to get a bunch of fanboys out of the woodworks but this game is awful and you should feel bad for playing it and supporting Trion. At least Rift looked way better to play and more adventurous, this is just a damn abortion. The community here seems to be centered around a few people on each server as well who are vocal in chat, which at this point in time is frieakin' weird IMO.\n\ntl;dr: GO PLAY BLACK DESERT ONLINE, IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THIS ♥♥♥♥ HOLE OF A GAME","April 4","false","20.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

If you've only just started playing it, it will take forever to get your house/farm. First, if you don't want to pay the $15 for Patron, you can get the gold in game to buy the APEX tokens that will give you credits when used. However, the price is constantly fluctuating because of the other uses for credits in the marketplace. Once you've actually managed to work around the fact that you cannot have a farm and get the 600+ gold that you need to buy 2 APEX, you will then have to search for a place for your 8x8 garden. That may seem all fine and dandy until you realize that there's no place anywhere to place a farm, let alone one of the houses that require bigger plots of land.\n\nLandgrabbing is probably the biggest issue in this game. You can buy them from other players, but it's usually for way more than they cost. The majority of the time, these other players are not even using the land that they own.\n\nIf you have a lot of time, this could potentially become a nice game for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemiGoth/recommended/304030/","DemiGoth","DemiGoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemiGoth/","714 products in account","Lets start by telling that ArcheAge actually is a good game. It's just this Free2Play version of the game that makes it bad. More over because the game is still running in Korea as subscription game, and then you can enjoy the game to it's fullest...\n\nBut enough of that, Why I think ArcheAge is a bad Free2Play game. Basically to enjoy the game to it's fullest you *MUST* become a patron (subscribe) for 2500 credits (cash shop currency) a month. To make things worse, you can buy them only per 1250 for a stunning €10. This means that the game would cost you a stunning €20 per month! A good thing though that you can buy these 1200 credit packs in game (much like EVE's PLEX) for around 650 gold (which would imply a HUGE grind for money!).\n\nWhy is it so important to be a subscriber? Easy, being a subscriber you get 2 benefits over a 'free player'.\n1. You'll regenerate labour points while off-line, which a 'free player' does not and when on-line your labour point regeneration is twice that of a 'free player'. And labor being almost the most important thing in the game with a cap of 2000 points, it's a *MUST* to have a lot of it. Opening lootbags that contain gold costs you labour, mining ores costs you labour, cutting wood costs you labour. Basically almost every thing you do in the game costs you labour and as 'fre eplayer' you just don't have enough (you can always buy over expensive potions for labour points, but then I think subscribing is cheaper...)\n2. As subscribed player you can own land, which is needed to grow crop and trees, in turn which is needed to trade. And trade is one of the key features of the game. With trading you make gold or 'gilda stars'. Both are important, but the gilda stars are required for the real special items, and as 'free player' you'll only get about 200 maximum through regular playing and questing. Okay, honestly speaking, you can grow a bit of stuff as 'free player', but chances are very small you'd find a space on those spots...\n\nI have played ArcheAge during it's alpha and beta and I loved it because I had all the benefits of being a subscribed player. Now that I have returned, I can buy up to 4 months of subscription from the alpha pachage I bought, but the game doesn't feel the same anymore because of the restrictions. It actually feels very Pay2Win when you're a subscriber,  because of all the benefits you'll gain and honestly I doubt it's even possible to play and grind so much to get an equal benefit as 'free player'...","August 2, 2015","false","5.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BLAQKLIGHT/recommended/304030/","BLAQKLIGHT","BLAQKL!GHT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BLAQKLIGHT/","144 products in account","Clarifying the misinformation given out by my fellow reviewers....\nNote: My hours on steam do not reflect my actual playtime of this game, which ranges somewhere in the mid 3k hour range. I've played this game as both a F2P and a P2P player, and I can tell you from experience that both are enjoyable. Still, I will do my best to provide an accurate account of the game by destroying most of the "complaints" and "issues" that others have offered.\n\n"Bots"\n\nThe majority of the bots have been gone since before patch 2.0. Its now patch 2.5. I don't know why people are still championing such outdated information.\n\nLabor Points and Patron System\n\nMost F2P games have a "premium" service that requires a monthly subscription to get added bonuses/perks/whatever. WoW requires it to play at all, ESO offers monthly credits along with premium, GW2 recently moved to a F2P model, etc. This isn't anything new or evil.\n\nAs a free player, you get 2000 labor a day and only regen labor when you're online. God forbit you run out, and decide to leave your computer on with the game up to idle for labor. Someone in the reviews down below said you get kicked for that? Again, this has not happened since before patch 2.0. Don't care to wait, buy a labor pot off of the Auction House for in-game gold. They're cheap. Super cheap.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have pointed out, this system encourages people to buy Patron. Oh no! Not Patron! Its so expensive and evil and so...its $15 a month. Go get a job and work for 2 hours a week. If you don't have that/don't want to do that? They offer a way for you to get it in game. By completing a quest for a farm cart and running packs (you don’t even have to own land), you can make decent money. If you run several pack runs a day, for 2-3 days, you will get enough gold for Apex. 2 Apex gives you Patron status. Congratz, you now have patron and have another 3k labor to spend each day for the rest of the month.\n\nMoney grubbing...what?\n\nYes, the devs want to make money. That would be the idea behind any game. So, for those people who want to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on this game? That is their choice. They are the reason that Apex is even on the market to begin with for F2P people to buy for Patron status. On the server that I am on, Apex sells for about 500g. So, Patron is therefore 1k gold a month. I ran enough packs with my farm cart to get a merchant ship, and I now run packs across the ocean with some friends. 6 pack runs is 1,200g and takes me about 4-5 hours on a Friday or Saturday night. I purchase patron and then have leftover gold to make more packs to then run across the ocean for armor, weapons, mounts, costumes, etc. It’s not rocket science and it isn't hard.\n\nServer Migrations and playing a "dead game."\n\nBack in September 2015, many servers with low populations were merged into larger, more condensed servers. Most of these servers have populations of 1,000s of players. The server that I am on has well over 3k players. This game is far from "dead."\n\n2.5 and the Bloodsong Update\n\nSo, what people haven't told you are all of the awesome new things that have been opened up, even in the last week.  Most of these reviews are from months ago. I would guess from around 1.5 or 1.6? Now, there is a 3rd continent. There are massive, 50 person raids of world PvP. There are new castle sieges, naval battles, dungeons, treehouses, mounts, guild missions, new fishing systems, large-scale pirating, gigantic world boss fights, new gear progression systems, and much, much more. The beauty of a sandbox on this scale is the limitlessness of possibilities. Premium or Patron isn’t hard to get, and finding a good group to play with has never been easier. I won’t lie to you and say it’s perfect. There is a lot of grinding and it can be frustrating when you get killed/get things stolen from you, but welcome to just about any MMO out there. I HIGHLY encourage you to either give this game a second chance, or to start on it for the first time. You won’t regret it.","January 29","true","48.8"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","34","59","5","3"

If you don't believe me, go ahead and check my two or three Archeage screenshots. This is why I felt I needed to suck it up, download it one last time and share with you my experience with this game. I will admit it is a beautiful game with an interesting battle system, a highly customizable class system and a justice system that I feel should be explored in other games. It also has boats, gliders, personal housing, trading, farming, etc. So why wouldn't someone want to play this game? For those of you who don't like to read, think of this game as Farmville, mixed with Candy Crush with a generic MMO skin. You want to own land? You need to buy the premium membership (15 dollars a month) and even then, good luck trying to get some with all of it bought up by other players or owned by hackers. Want to pvp? Have fun zerging, which is excusable I admit. Want to upgrade your equipment? Better hope that it doesn't randomly break. Sorry, but just like SWOTR, if you are going to put out a "F2P" game, make sure you give access to all of the features to everyone without putting them behind a paywall.

TRION WORLDS HAS TRAPS, TRICKS, AND TRIALS TO DEVOUR THE DEPTHS OF YOUR WALLET ON THEIR GAMES!\n\nThis review is by a player who has been playing Trion worlds games for almost 4 years, and has played them all. I currently run a game blog, and have been an avid supporter of Trion, and was even considering buying a share in Trion stock at one time as a major personal investment. I have even done beta for petroglph's and Trion's now defunt war of nations. Also Warface was ( not anymore ) slated to be released by Trion at some point.\n\nArche Age is infamous. From the obscene queues at launch, to the screwing over the founders, ripping off it's player base, memes, ( like the infamous comparing it to Sword Art Online, except you cannot log back in once out, to the meme of a skeleton sitting in from of the computer when it just let him into the game. I reposted those two many times, and I think Arche Age had a certain familiarity with the wait time to get online from the show Futurerama. ) to huge amounts of land being taken by botters robbing patrons of housing space, to now the evolution servers coming online. Evolution servers are formed by taking 6 servers ( yes 6 servers ) and merging them. Everyone on those 6 servers lost their homes. If on one of the 5 servers moving, you will need to rename your character if someone on the 6th server has that name. ( standard Trion worlds server merger policy. I have had to deal with it more then once. )\n\nI have been with Arche Age since beta, and once it was done, played a little after. Then no more. I downloaded Arche Age just to put out this review. My time with the game above will reflect that. My friend suffered from not being able to play the game due to a green shield like splash screen and just quit. When it came on steam, she returned. She told me her land was dead. It went from seeing lots of people on beta, and after beta, to no one around. No one on her guild. She also never paid for patron, which allows you access housing. Yes. You have to pay real money to get a house. Then pay a weekly tax on top of that with in game currency. I have no idea about currently but that was at launch. If you cannot believe me that housing was a hot item, believe me, it was. Outrage ensued many times, and was reported many times by gaming sites.\n\nI was not a founder of the game, and the following accounts were posted publicly on Arche Age forums, and published in news articles.\n\nThere was a lot of outrage when the founders got screwed leading to a angry thread about getting a refund for founder status. They got screwed when Trion gave better items at launch then in the founder packs. Some were denied patron status at launch making them wait 10+ hours in queue like me. They also had no ability to join the great land grab for a house due to loss of patron. They lost out on a promised 10% discount in the in game store, and was refunded about 10% of what they spent in real money on premeuim currency. Not with cash. In game currency. Founders who bought on steam, could not download on steam, people who found what Trion called an exploit had their accounts locked until they paid the difference. The "exploit" was the tradable currency was giving them more then it should. If a bank gives you $100 when you ask for twenty, and charges you twenty in your account, it's not your fault. Trion said it was. Recently in the producer's letter, they cleaned off all the former exploiters.\n\nHard lessons learned. Those bait and switch tactics Notch tweeted about that should be illegal. From a gamer standpoint, they should be. Are they? No. And Trion knows that, and will continue to use it. Might as well take your money and throw it out a window. Gives you the same thrill, but you can go down and get your money back.\n\nI cannot recommend this game because for me Arche Age for me was way too simplistic. Yes they had good things they added, however the game felt cheap. The graphics were nice. That is the only positive I can say. The law system where everyone is guilty, and gets jail time, even for taking a tree you were going to chop down is silly. Plus I believe people could go into your home and prevent you from putting down your furniture buy nudging you with their mount. Trion protected them, because it did not violate their terms of service. It did, because it led to a new craze of trolling with still no added housing security.\n\nI also cannot recommend this game due to what Trion has done to their players. It is inexcusable, and part of what is wrong in gaming today. I am not and will never be made of money. I lived on a budget like everyone else, and you are damn lucky to get any money the players throw at you. Contrary to popular beliefs by video game makers, the government has NOT supplied every American with a money tree. That and the Kickstarter cash grab, leading to new policies on Kickstarter.\n\nRecently for me Trion has broken the camel's back with a simple forum policy ( no sarcasm at all unless obvous. Zero tolerance policy ) plus obvious focus toward money, has lead me to leave all Tron games. I already left RIFT, i am including defiance, and the new trove. Total Boycott. Trion has lost a huge customer today. There are people who need this money more then I do, they suffer from hunger, they have no roof over their head, and can't feed their kids. From now on I am going to give any money I would give to Trion, to those in need. Trion has had a positive influence in that area at least.","July 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The game itself is amazing. The problem then was poor management and armies of hackers and bots that were allowed to roam the game freely.\n\nIt is the reason i had quit but recently i heard that hacks and bots were finally getting banned and punished so i thought i'd give AA another go. This is what i found.\n\n-The game is dead\nAnd i cant really explain how empty it truely is. If you were to compare it to the population it had the first few  months from its launch (excluding bots) the playerbase has probably dropped 80-90%. Trying to play the game as a new player means your going to be playing alone till you hit lvl 50 unless you joined AA with some friends. Low level dungeons are never run so if your a new player dont expect to be able to see their content. Furthermore the game is still declining in population, trion is soon doing a server merge because ppl keep leaving and servers are becoming too empty. Some of them are to the point where its rare to even see another person and this isnt even being exaggerated.\n\n-Toxic Community\nCommunities always have toxic players, MOBA's have the worst, but with archeage almost the entire community is toxic. If you ask a question in chat you get bombarded with harrassment. Players will mock you for not knowing every single thing in this game and majority of the time will just troll you with false answers. There is a 1% chance that someone will actually give you the right answer.\n\n-Griefing\nAll games have it, most games put limits on it. Archeage supports griefing and encourages it. Is this fine? It can be. But its strongly abused in this game. Lvl 50-55s will camp low lvl and low geared players for hours to prevent them from bein able to quest or lvl up once they hit 30. Guilds will steal trade packs if your trying to do trade routes and either destroy the packs or store them forever so that you can gain no profit. <The biggest issue with this is that a safegaurd was originally set up that gives the owner of the pack 20% profit if someone else turns it in. Players dont want new people to make money which is why they destroy the packs or store them forever.\n\n-Green Pirate Guilds\nPlayers are now abusing the faction system. They choose to make war against Nuians for example but instead of becoming a hostile pirate (where you fight everyone) or joining Harayans, they make Nuian characters. This prevents Nuians from being able to kill them and has too many issues to even go into detail with. I'll say this though, its basically an enemy player that is given immunity to everyon around him with the option to turn it off and kill you or grief you when ever they want\n\n-Bots / Hackers\nThey are not as bad as launch but they still exist, and through the 3 weeks of me being back in this gamei have noticed them more often making me assume they are going to be everyone again. Biggest issue with this is they are controlling the trade market causing prices to inflate beyond any new players budget as well as some current players.\n\n\n-Player gap\nThis game has a massive player gap between new players and veterans. I understand that there should be a gap but the one in AA is ridiculous. It will take hundreds of dollars or months of constant farming to be able to acquire gear that will allow you to even try and compete with everyone in pvp or farmville. The price on everything in the player market is based on the hoarded amount of gold veteran players have meaning new players will struggle to afford anything.\n\n\n-Poor management\nThe game is still being handles like garbage, all the bugs that existed in cbt still exist, new bugs arise, nothing is getting done. Trion also is using what might be an illegal marketing tactic on its players by selling them items in the cash shop that are advertised as Item A B C, then few weeks later telling everyone "sorry" we typo'd on the cash shop item it does not contain items A B or C but only item D. No refunds are given during these "accidents".\n\n-Dangerous Bugs\nSome of the bugs in AA are very harmful to your computer, one of them causes the game to create files repeadetly on your computer using up all your memory. I had multiple instances where in 10 minutes of gameply, AA created 5-10k files on my computer which was something like 8-16GB of data.\n\n\n\nIn the end this game is not worth playing. The concept of it was amazing and the game looks beautiful. But the poor management by trion / xlgames on top of the wall preventing new players from being able to experience the game, as well as the non stop griefing and toxic community, ruins anything and everything that AA could have been.\n\n","June 6, 2015","false","202.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I don't know if anyone else had specifically emphasized how bad of a (semi-)loot system this is, it doesn't feel like you’re earning anything. Basically if you want to get anything or do anything in this game regardless of…anything you have to use labor, it limits how much stuff you can get on a given day. This is dumb because labor recharges at a fairly slow rate and the only way to speed this up is to buy labor potions with either gold (which kind of defeats the financial purpose) or with real money. The combat is decent but I can’t pvp because my armour is ♥♥♥♥, so half the time I’m either letting my character auto smack a scarecrow all day or just playing a different video game while my labor fills up because that’s what I want to do in Archage….play another video game.\n\n\nEdit: I wanted to post this review 2 months sooner but it wasn't on the steam page for some reason, even though I got this game through steam.

If you run out of labor it is extremely limiting in what you can do but guess what.  If you pay a monthly subscription you can regenerate more labor offline and online and you can even buy labor potions with real life money...that alone is pay to win.\n\nIn addition to labor being an unnecessary annoyance the best gear in the game is crafted.  And there is another component to getting the best gear that requires luck in gambling or as people like to call it "RNG".  This comes into play in the regrading and socketing systems.  You use a regrade scroll to try to get from say celestial to divine in weapon or armor that jumps the gear's stats.  One thing to note is at the higher tiers gear can break at a regrade attempt!  These chances are extremely low at the higher tiers and people will generally get charms that can increase your chances.  Someone ends up having to pay real life money (p2w) to bring these charms into the economy.  There is also luck involved in socketing gems into gear and anything after 1 gem has a chance of breaking all the gems in that gear.  Does this sound like fun to you?  Didn't think so\n\nYou can have someone come into this game with literally no playtime and buy their way to the top by buying APEX, selling for gold and buying the best gear in the game since the best gear is craftable.  If this isn't pay to win I don't know what is.  This is a perfect example of overly greedy companies destroying good ideas and it is a trend that seems to be prevalent in many mmos as of late (I'm looking at you ESO).  And the only people who defend this are the ones who spend an ungodly amount of money on the game and don't want to feel like a sucker (buyer's remorse) or apologists for a company that doesn't care about them.  It's people like these that reward shady business practices and they are a blight on the gaming community.  Well, I think the gaming community deserves better.  The second a sandbox MMO with equal graphics and some of the better ideas of Archeage comes out without soul sucking systems such as labor or RNG in crafting Archeage will die.  ♥♥♥♥ this game\n\n","June 11, 2015","false","748.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

My friend has been bugging me for weeks to try it, so to shut him up i did. I got about 3/4 into the tutorial and was like nope. I know my friend told m the tutorial was bad, but thats an understatement. After the first cutscene where you get to move aroud, my character started glitching out, doing some odd headbangs. and within a 5 min period it did again. Not a big deal tho. Then you get on a pirate ship, and i notice where the captians quaters would be, its missing textures and i can see right though the boat. Sloppy much? Then after a cannon battle, another cutscene and then your shipwreked. You then get to use these gliders, which i accidentally skipped over that part . Then you have to mount a siege on a castle your enemies are building. Now keep in mind this is all happening with 2-5 days, and the castle they have built is insanely massive. Makes alot of sense right? You have seige tanks even tho your shipwreked. You enter then retreat when the captian gets hit with an arrow. Then afer a cutscene you wake up and it was just a memory. The intro is what supposed to draw you in, but ArcheAge doesnt understand that it seems. Also the difference in graphics during the cut scenes and gameplay are quite noticeable. When playing the graphics drop in quality. Noone has prob read all this, but i think this game is far from done. I've played several games in Alpha that were more complete then this. I think this shouldnt have even been release, or atleast marked as Alpha or PreAlpha if there is such a thing.

Great graphics, fun gameplay, very different (good) spec mechanics, wide range of gear, pets/compations, cool mounts, beautiful landscape and cities.. etc.\n\nThe plague:  "Labor points".  If you want to research something, you need labor points, if you want to mine a rock or gather some plants? You need labor points, if you get gear from a random mob, you need to research it first.. and you guessed it, you need labor points.  You get a bag of coins from a mob? Yup to open it you need labor points.   How do you get labor points?  You get them by staying online... A LOT.  1 point per minute.  If you have a free account you do not get any labor points when you're offline.  This brings all the problems to the front.  You have 3/4ths of the server population AFK because they are trying to get labor points.\n\nIf they get rid of this joke called Labor points at least half of the negative reviews would change to be positives because the problems simply go away.\n\nTruth is I enjoy the game quite a bit and but because of this giant problem with labor points I just cannot bring my self to give it thumbs up.","January 12","false","111.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soooy/recommended/304030/","Soooy","SoySauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soooy/","87 products in account","I loved this game. So much. It had everything I wanted from an MMO in terms of content, beauty, uniqueness, and capability to run on a toaster at decent settings. Group content was exciting; the grind was length, but oh-so satisfying as nearing the top became more and more realistic. The style's great, combat is satisfying, builds can be varied and are flexibly experimental if you're okay with venturing outside of whatever's OP this season.\n\nBut when you crawl closer to the point where you know the real content is locked away, it becomes more and more apparent how P2W the game is, and it's heartbreaking. Everything from a content standpoint is varied attractive, fluid and functions for the most part as it should, and it's impressive as a whole. What's wrong with the game has to do with how Trion treats its playerbase, which is like complete and utter garbage. There's no reaction to actual in-game problems, there's no remedy from a gameplay standpoint, and from an end-game grinding standpoint that supports F2P players in even the slightest.\n\nI'm not really going to say anything that hasn't already been said, but don't commit yourself to this game without being ready to shovel out a respectable amount of money-- probably more than you'd pay for an episodic series of any AAA title, when all's said and done.\n\nJust don't. Trion won't change.","February 18","false","399.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","4"

It has everything I could possibly want:\n1. House building\n2. Boats of various kinds with naval warfare and fishing\n3.Variety of mounts from traditional horses to cars\n4.Variety of vocations\n5.Classes are very nicely done, easy to switch and combine to make one that meets your taste.\n6. Large open world\n7. Plenty of companion animals\n\n\nHowever can I recomend this game? No. There's three main reasons for this:\n1. Labor system. The labor system is set up where pretty much anything cool you want to do requires it. Go fishing? Need labor. Mine resources? Need labor. Here's the thing: If you arent part of their "patron" status, where you purchase the monthly subscription, the amount of labor you regain is miniscule and only gained when you're actually playing. If you arent playing or just leaving your toon logged in, you dont gain labor.\nPatron status however? Labor isnt an issue. Heck, get patron status and you'll even get exp buffs, etc... in short making the game where if you truly want to enjoy it, you need to get the subscription.\nCase in point, my friend has played the a fraction of what I have and has already far surpassed my level because he has patron status allowing him to do things I had to wait to do. Happy as I am for him, its still insulting that because I don't spend money paying for this subscription, even if I put in double the amount of game time he does he will still surpass me just because of what a huge difference that subscription offers.\nI'll be honest, I have no issues with subsciptions for F2P games, heck I did it on SWOTOR and I've never regretted it. I understand a company needs to make profit of some kind. But the labor system alone is what kills the whole thing.\n\n2.Grind: I knew going in that MMOs always have a serious grind to them. But with Archeage and the labor system it takes it to the max. Building ships, house building, leveling; all of it is a huge grind after another.\n\n3.Credit Car Warriors. Again, I have nothing against a company making profit, whether its through subscriptions or their online market. But on this? Doesnt matter if you spend a load of time working for something like that new piece of armor; someone can just use their credit card and bam, that stuff you worked hard for has been blown away.\nLook at the Ollo Server for example: the largest guild KGB and its subsidaries are known for this.\n\nSynopsis: I love the game, it has everything I could possibly want. However this is all ruined by greedy business practices. Will I still play the game? Yes. Though to the extent which I want to? No. Nor can I reconmend it. If you're looking to kill some time and spend quite a bit of money, then by all means, go for it. As for me, I'll stick to the F2P content.","February 20","false","159.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","3"

Though in the end i won't be giving the game an actual reccomendation. Yes, you should definetly appreciate what Archeage is trying to do. The story was interesting and the gameplay, while unintuitive at times, was fun. But here's where i get to the part where i explain why i'm not reccomending this game. Far far far too many reasons the game came up with to not allow me to play. First an error #104 that didn't allow me to finish updating until i had dove into the files and fenagled with the few things necessary for the fickle updater to not screech at me. Then launching the game. I get to the server selection screen, pick a server, start connecting, and crash to desktop. When you can't connect to the server you choose you get the message "the gods hae disconnected you" along with a helpful note to maybe check your network connections and whatnot. After checking to make sure my internet was still functioning i tried again. I got into the game once in the maybe 35 times i launched the game. Kyrios was the server i ended up playing on, and after turning the visuals down to low entirely because it's either poorly optimised or too much is going on. Still having to deal with occasional lag spikes that froze me for up to 10 seconds. I got up to level 9 (confetti sound). Then the friend i was skyping at the time got off and i decided to take a break. So I tried to go back to the character selection screen. And crashed. Now i'm back to the launch crash rinse repeat cycle again. While i am going to attempt to keep playing, the fact that these issues have been largely unresolved for many people for roughly three months is a little daunting and discouraging. If you like what the game has to offer and can't find another game that does it, give it a go.","June 10, 2015","false","11.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

There is an absolute divide between free and paying players that just cannot be ignored, and the community just feels like a group of trolls to be blunt: especially regarding some of the higher ranked/credit card warriors and guilds. The RNG is abysmal.\n\nwith that said, however, you do not need to be a patron to be "top tier". all you have to do is spend 10 dollars on an auction house license, and you can use the Auction house to earn a ton of gold. you can even use it to earn patron. just sell high tier weapons like obsidian katanas at celestial grade.  2K Gold on Arenzeb. 6k for unique.\n\nIf you decide to play though, and  can get past the above problems, you may have a good time. You can explore and pretty much do whatever  you want: even ship battles. You just can't own a house without Patron. Also can't regen labor offline...which stops you from doing anything unique to this game for the most part if you run out. That also includes things NOT unique to this game like opening bags to get loot.\n\nFarmville 2.0. good concept ruined by poor management.\n\n-Vexil, Arenzeb.\n\nEdit: After the 2.5 update, I feel that the RNG value has gotten worse. It could be me, but I went from being able to get multiple celestials and even uniques off regrading with the occasional fail to struggling to even go past arcane. From basic to mystic, this is the fourth tier out of ten.","March 30","false","979.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The concepts are nothing new except for a few things.\n\n1. Owning land in a non instanced environment.  This would be great is there was land available that didn't cost an arm and a leg due to land value being highly over inflated due to the economy of the game.\n\n2. 120 different character classes.  Yep there are 120 different character classes available but really only a few that work in game if you're planning on doing any sort of combat.  Some can be modified slightly but really the classes still end up being cookie cutter.\n\n3. Any class can use any armor or weapon.  Haha just kidding you can but you can't.  It's very stat dependant and only certain gear really has the stats that you want as far as quest rewards and crafting until the lvl 50 sets that could potentially allow you to use whatever you wanted as whichever class you wanted to play.\n\n4. Trade routes.  Fun for awhile but after the fun wears off the manotony sets in and it's about as fun as sitting in the prison.\n\n5. Jurys and prison.  Okay this is something that I feel was actually done right.  You get to look at the crimes of whoever is on trial when you're on the jury and decide whether they're guilty or innocent and if guilty how much time they will served based on the amounts that they give you in the game based on the defendants crime points.\n\nFinal thoughts.  I wanted this game to be good.  I really did but in all actuallity playing it for about a month it got boring and repetative.  With the current land issues and marketplace/economy problems (at least I see them as problems, this game is very pay to win) I wouldn't recomend anyone playing or spending any money on this game in it's current state.\n\nThings that can be done to turn Archeage around would be to stop allowing things purchased from the cash shop to be sold on the auction house.  Allow loyalty tokens to be used to purchase more if not everything from the cash shop.  STOP BEING SO GREEDY TRION.  If something is available in a game and you have a way to subscribe to said game then that subscriber should not be required to also spend extra money in your cash shop to advance in the game.\n\nOnce again it is my opinion but DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE!!!","July 6, 2015","false","484.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It had an interesting beginning story, fantastic character creation, awesome crafting system, and the ability to build your own house in the world, for starters.  However, it changed upon official release.  I managed to get enough points together to buy a house, only to discover afterwards that I had to have an account first.  I loved the game enough to get the account, only to then discover that bots had taken up every bit of available land.   I spent hours of real time looking for a spot to place the house, only to never be able to do so.  And the crafting system, which is a major component of game play, requires the player to have land.  I finally became disheartened and gave up.  But I really loved this game and recently reinstalled it through Steam.  I logged in and found the streets deserted.  I travelled to the nearest housing settlement and found that it was still completely overrun by bots.  And to make matters worse, in the span of 45mins, the game crashed on me three times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinnamongod/recommended/304030/","Cinnamongod","Cinnamongod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinnamongod/","685 products in account","This game has some major flaws that need to be addressed!\n\nFirst flaw is one that keeps me from playing this game on Steam. I had to give up and just use the game manager through Trion's website. If you ask me this is probably on purpose so Trion does not have to share money with Steam. Very dishonest of them. I also had a similar issue on my laptop except that it would never play due to missing direct X and Cry engine files. The problem was that the Steam version did not install these files but the one from Trion's website did. How can this oversite have happened?\n\nThis game takes entirely way too long to load even when it is working, sometimes in upwards of 10 minutes. There are some serious optimization issues... And no it is certainly NOT due to my computer!\n\nShutting down the game disables your mouse and this has to be fixed by disconnecting it and then reconnecting it. This is very annoying but luckily for me I have a wired/wireless mouse so I do not have to crawl behind my computer every time.\n\nAfter playing the game for extended periods of time the textures on various creatures and terrain in the game turn to crap and this can only be fixed by shutting down and restarting the game. This then brings you to the other 2 very annoying issue of fixing the mouse and then waiting forever  for the game to boot up again.\n\nThis game is effectively Pay to play/Pay to win due to the following mechanics:\n\nI can not use the auction house with spending money of buying a license off of someone with an excessive amount of gold.\n\nI can not open any of the loot dropped without spending "Labor" which accumilates at a rate of 5 per 5 minutes only when logged online. Opening a green drop at level 20-30 costs 30 Labor. Labor is also used for almost everything you do in the game like crafting, harvesting, openning drops, etc... and your Labor cap is 2000. If you pay the monthly fee then the Labor cap is 5000 and it generates at 10 per 5 minutes online or offline.\n\nStorage breaks this game also. Storage is fine until around level 20. You have 50 slots in your bag and another 50 slots in your warehouse (bank). Expanding this becomes the problem. It costs 300 credits to expand it 10 slots which translates to $2 every expansion scroll. Expansion scrolls can be bought in the auction house but the going rate is around 75 gold which I have yet to accumulate at around level 27.\n\nCrafting is very extensive and normally I would consider this a good thing but with the issues of "Labor" and storage it makes having to craft extremely annoying.\n\nI can not recommend this game mainly due to the greedy descisions made by XLGames and Trion. This game has much potential but ALL of the above issues need to be fixed.\n\n","July 15, 2015","false","31.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

I was playing since beta. I must confess, it is really a pay to win MMORPG. I had like 4 patron accounts running on 4 different PC's just to be able to accumulate labor points to use for crafting. I owned so many lands and have houses and was doing end game raid dungeons. I spent quite a lot of money and time on this game but it disappointed me at the end. My character is very powerful and I can stand up to most of the elite people in the server and it was fun for a while but the pay to win system really ruined it for me too. I ended up just giving my accounts and all my items, gears, lands, etc. to my friend. We have a big house and she likes decorating stuff so I just gave it all to her and I went back here on Steam playing the games here. Now enjoying playing Witcher 3... lol\n\nAnyways, ya.. if you don't have the time and money to spend on this game.. don't do it. You are very limited if you don't have patron status which means you have to pay monthly or whatever plan you chose. I have a decent income so I payed for the 4 accounts all payed up to 6 months.

You don't HAVE to be P2W in order to play the game, all you have to do is grind it out which only takes about a week, save up for 2x APEX and boom have patron. From there you'd save some labor to do some other works that you'd like to invest in such as farming, fishing, etc. People complain about "labor" but they dont realize that they must be patient in order to do certain things, instead of wasting all of your labor save up for it. The game is meant to be played by alot more people since it's very enjoyable with unique PvP and PvE.

I see a lot of people say this is a "pay to win" title. While I personally dont believe that, I can understand why they might believe this. If you dont pay it is going to take you much longer to level your vocational skills because of labor costs. Also keep in mind that this is a korean mmo, so expect to grind some crafting skills. For me it wasn't anything of a grind because i had a blast doing it and I am not in a hurry to get to end-game.\n\nWhile this game has some obvious flaws, its currently the best offer for a virtual world sandbox experience. So, if that is your thing, give it try.","January 1","true","802.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I’ve played this game since closed alpha. I stopped playing from October 2014-September 2015 and just started again.\n\nAlmost all of the negative reviews of this game started as positive ones, but people got dissatisfied during the period I mentioned above for numerous reasons. Bots were rampant, but they have now been removed. The cash shop got out of control, so the developers decided to introduce other means for users to get these items and therefore restarted the economy. Classes became unbalanced with introductions of new weapons/armor, so the devs fixed that too. There WAS a period where this game got unplayable, but it was fixed. Sure, you can pay and get armor/weapons/whatever, but you can also craft it on your own if you actually put time into the game. I’m tired of hearing “pay to win” or whatever. Stop crying about it and stop getting angry at the people who are dropping hundreds of dollars to play a game. That’s their life.\n\nThis is BY FAR the best mmo that I have ever played, and believe me; I’ve played a lot of them. The PVP is amazing; the combat system is fluid, and the player base has evened out to the point where only fun, dedicated, and invested players remain. New players are being discouraged from “negative” reviews of people who haven’t played in forever.\n","October 30, 2015","true","063.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

Honestly i don't know why people were surprised that the game was so grindy, most korean mmo's are.

It orignated in a land known as Korea. Now Korea or XL games decided to make a truly openworld sandbox MMORPG. Their creation was truly brilliant. Trion Studios the creators of Rift, Defiance and Trove all good games decided to make a western port for us American/Australian/New Zealand/English Folk. I first heard about the game May 2014. The game had been out in Alpha for about a couple of weeks I believe. I saw the game on steam advertising founder packs for access to alpha/beta testing. I myselfn was curious as I saw it was being produced by Trion Studios and I am a big fan of Rift and have sunk a decent amount of time into it along with Defiance. So I decided to do some research on the game. I couln't believe how bad ♥♥♥♥ the game sounded, I don't know about you but sometimes when I read a book I like to just have a relaxing adventure not some heartstopping action all the time and have a break from the danger. Like when they are describing a picturesque scene somewhere I just like imagining relaxing/swimming through the rivers and what not. I don't know if this is weird but I love a book like that.\n\nAnyway I heard about the amazing aspects Archeage had to show, first thing I learnt about was the trade runs. A trade run is where you gather certain materials and turn it into a pack that your chracter carries, this slows you into a walk. You then have to transport it from Point a to point b, the cool thing about this is the further that you take the pack the more gold you will recieve when you turn it into a gold trader. The gold gets mailed to you on a 22 hour time period I believe with 22% interest. So the game had this whole economy thing going that I just loved.\n\nI began to watch youtube videos about this and night after night before going to sleep I would read up on the game and watch people play the alpha. I just knew this game was going to be special!\n\nI then learnt about the naval aspects with sailing/pirating. Now I was about to have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥!! A massive open world no instanced areas! And you can sail between continents delivering goods to far off lands! This just sounded too good to be true. The water was a massive turn on for me! Have you seen how gorgeus the waters surface looks! Its good enough to make a grown man cry!\n\nI was holding off on purchasing my way into the Alpha as it cost $150 USD and I was a little sceptical as I wasn't sure if it was worth that much money. However one evening I decided to make the purchase! I bought the game and sat down shoving my homework to one side. I eagerly sat awaiting it to install while browsing through beginner tutorials. I couldn't wait to get a farm set up and start my life as an honest samaritan before turning into a pirate at the max level and raiding un suspecting traders!\n\nMy first character was a Firran, He was a stone arrow I believe which is a mixture of Archery, Shadowplay and Defense. It was like a tanking rogue. I had alot of fun on that character believe me the adventures me and Severin shared were incredible. Alpha housed some of the most amazing gaming memories I have. Nothing even the atrocious piece of ♥♥♥♥ the game is today, we'll get to that, will change my love for the adventures that were had! I remember I had a lovely farm cottage set up on the hills overlooking the ocean with a massive mountain with lush forest for a backdrop. It was so peaceful logging in and greeting my neighbouring farmer who set up his house on a plot near me. I worked so hard and eventually I had enough materials to build a Galleon Ship. This is a massive warship with 8 cannons and a crows nest. I said goodbye to my guild as I was about to set off on the life of a pirate! I then began the process of stealing other peoples crops and trees. I also in war periods in certain zones began killing members of my own faction. As other people came across my wrong doings they would report me and slowly buy surely my crime points began to rise...\n\nEventually when I had done so much misdoings and commited enough cold blooded murders I was kicked out and exiled from my continent Halcyona. My friend and I set sail for Growlgate isle nervous but excited none the less for our new journey. I couldn't believe I had been playing the game for over a  month! It felt just yesterday I had started my journey in the Falcorth Plains! As the sunset and a mist gathered across the ocean we were cast into darkness. I was steering blindly as wave after wave pounded the bow of our ship. Salty air whipped my face as I clung to the wheel in desperation. My friend scoured the map to make sure we were on course!\n\nA few moments later we were under attack from monsterous jellyfish! My mate swept out his sword and began to fight for his life while protecting me as I was vulnerable trying to keep the ship under control! I remember watching hopelessly as he fought valiantly. Eventually he drove them off and the wind changed. With a burst of speed with set off into the unknow.\n\nThe clouds began to part and we could see an island in the distance. My friend assured me that it was Growlgate. With butterflies in my stomach we set forth for a new life as a pirate.\n\nAs we docked into the port we could hear the bustling port packed with life. I looked up and saw a pirate tending his livestock. Long story short, much fun was had over teamspeak with our new guild as we raided and plundered the high seas! We even defeated the Kraken the worlds largest boss!\n\nDo you get what I'm saying, the game in Alpha was fantastic! I remember the fateful day came when the Alpha servers were about to go down that night. Their was a massive party by all and every race got together and enjoyed their time together before our characters would be wiped from existence. There are some great screenshots of the last day of Alpha out there if you google them. I remember I was partying it up with my guild at mirage isle (the main shopping island). Then that time came round and I lost Severin...  I cried manly tears of course.\n\nBeta testing arrived. I was kind of put off as I didn't want to lose another character again for launch. So I only leveled to about 26 and stopped awaiting launch on September 16th.\n\nLaunch Day...\n\nIf you were unfortunate enough to have experienced Launch day for yourself then you will know what I'm talking about. To cut a story short the Launch day was a disaster. Their were ques for hours just to log in and then when people got in they got disconnected. There were ques where people were 12,000 in line!!! And it said estimated time left 28 hours!!! This was unacceptable and Trion were not prepared for such large numbers wanting to play the game.\n\nI myself was a patron at the time so I got priority and got in, in about 5 minutes.\n\nAs land was not instanced there was only so much land left. I was luck enough to get my self a 16x16 farm plot but in a couple of hours there was almost no land left. Many people were up in arms as they couldn't have their own farm as bots stole alot of it and were selling it off for real money.\n\nI started a Nuian on the other continent called Starlix. He was a Hellweaver, which was a odd class to play I must say. It was a mixture of Battlerage,Sorcery and shadowplay. So basically a warrior mage rogue all in one.\n\nI remember 16x16 wasn't enough space to grow crops so I had so much fun adventuring around the zones climbing up mountains that looke unclimable and gliding to far off pastures to plant as much crops as possible. A person I met once up n the hills was called Divinity she was so nice to me, Thanks Divinity <3 I have no more room left so long story short the game is crap its ptw. If you want good gear you need to buy RNG boxes. No endgame content either.\n\nRIP Archeage you will be missed :(","August 11, 2014","false","540.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

That was during the alpha phase when I bought two Archeum founders packs.  Let me tell you something, I was a damn fool!  A damn naive fool.\n\nThe game started out pretty, decently fun, nice soothing sound and music,  to me, and granted I am old enough to have played games since they were text.  I have a myriad of games under my belt.  Ok, you get it, I was digging the game.\n\nTrion screwed up the launch worse than any game I have ever seen.  Yes, I was there for WoW and all of its expansions launches.  Yes, I was there for Anarchy Online, DDO, so many games.  They totally failed to provide and live up to the promises they made their founders.  So much for bonus items at launch, for a headstart, etc...  You coud not even get into the game.  The queue times were 16+ hours.  And once people found that out they would not log out.  They would run circles afk.  Trion did not care.  ALL the land was gone in mere minutes.  Even land that was impossible to get to at launch.  Hackers were rampant and domiating.  Trion did  not care.\n\nWhat Trion did care about was micro-transactions and that stuff was spot on.  They updated that stuff like crazy.  They cared not about the economy being blown by hackers and their massive failure to provide.  They just used that as fuel to sell micro-transactions.  Some conjecture that Trion allowed the issues to go on for that purpose, some even conjecture Trion was secretly funding the hackers or that they were workers from the Korean side.  I wouldn't doubt it to be honest.  Trion is some dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Once the economy started balancing out and people start getting rare items that the hackers were cashing in on.  Trions turns and ups the drops rates to like 90%, overnight items went from 2k gold to 80 gold.  The have nots that farmed their asses off to make a sell and some back were screwed.\n\nBack to land, land was promised, land makes the game go round.  There was none.  They opened new servers and added a message on existing servers "Want land?  Come to server xxxx"  Guess what?  Even if you wanted to abandon your progress and move servers to a new toon, there was no land.  Even though that message was up for weeks the land was gone in minutes.  It was a token effort to fight against refund and poor BBB reviews.\n\nCensorship.  NEVER have I seen forum moderators so heavy handed on censoring the truth.  If you spoke a tiny bit of negativity, even if the truth, you could and would be banned.  Especially on any really dirty practices in customer service.\n\nCustomer service was literally non-existant for 6-8 weeks, when they did hire more it was automated, you were in a queue for days to weeks.  So long in fact that when you asked for your entitled refund they told you that you were past time to get a refund even though it was their fault.  They even argued that through the BBB with MANY customers who posted their dealings on the forums.\n\nNow more than ever, the game is heavy into hackers, cheaters, and microtransaction.  It is more pay to win than a $1000 hooker.  There was a guy, I kid you not, working on his own land.  A hacker come up and was stareing at his owner ship plate, the guy ask him what was up, and the hacker hacked his land in front of his face.  They guy had screenshots of it happening.  Trion's stance, we do not refund or return land.  Period.  So it didnt matter if you were hacked with proof or if Trion's own bug screwed you, you were out of luck.  You basically had to buy real money items to get back into the game.  And if a bug or hacker somehow got your store items you had a receipt for, well, that was tough also.  No guarentees.\n\nThey stated that is was a ruthless, player driven, pvp based enviroment and if someone got over on you whether it was hackers or Trion themselves, tough ♥♥♥♥!!\n\nTrion does not care about you or your experience with their product.  They do not even want YOU they want YOUR MONEY, to hell with you.\n\nDo not invest ANY money or your time (it can be better spent elsewhere) in this cashgrab of a game.  Do not give Trion ANY of your money for any game unless you REALLY do your homework and are sure.  This seems to be somewhat habitual of them.","August 18, 2014","false","60.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Movie-like cutscenes, different gameplay, and of course cute characters with a hint of anime/manga style to them. Here is what is really screwing this game over from being a very likeable one: The lag is unbelieveable, and so is the fact that the voice acting is late as well. Not only that but when I began playing after the annoying prologue (that refuses to let you skip it unless you have gone through it with another character), my character was being controlled by itself. As in, I only pressed the "W" key to walk and all of a sudden my computer took over and made my character run and use spells I didn't even press. What's even worse is that the graphics would be awesome if you didn't have to have an awesome computer to play it on. My computer is not made for gaming whatsoever and it runs Skyrim, Saints Row (high graphics games) perfectly fine, but Archage is a failure when it comes to speed and reliability. And the second to the last thing I have to complain about is the fact that this game is listed under MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER. Well... it's not. No other player was with me when I got out of the prologue, probably since no one actually likes the game since i've seen similar criticism described by my complaints, that is most likely the reason why. Now onto the last portion of this ever so long review... There will be perverts on this game. Not even 5 minutes into completed the prologue tutorial, someone asked for a virtual H.J. on my server through the World Chat. I don't think I will be playing this game again, but it was worth a try.","August 27, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has a few bugs which when encountered can make your experience not ideal... The first problem I encountered with Trion was during the process to buy APEX. I tried several times to buy them but their system wouldn't accept my MOP. Upon inquiring with the support staff, all they told me was it was a bug on their end and they've fixed it now on my account...  the second issue I had was that I was kicked me off their servers during an expensive trade run and for hours I couldnt get back in due to what seemed like poor stability of the servers. I was able to play other games, Youtube, browse the internet without any problems but Archeage would not allow me on. I ended up losing a considerable amount of progress and assets in game and all I got from Trion was "please follow these steps to troubleshoot YOUR internet problems"... Both of these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you're planning to play for free and not spend anything- I recommend it... but if you do support the project with your real money... don't expect anything from Trion if something goes wrong and it seems like this game is littered with little bugs here and there so you're bound to encounter something that will give you a negative play experience at one point or another.","September 7, 2015","false","34.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

ArcheAge is the funnest MMO I have ever played, and I played World of Warcraft for three years straight. This game has provided the ability to meet new people and make a lot of new friends. However, there are some problems with this game. This game is very unfriendly for new players, if you haven't played an MMO previously then it might be a huge task to learn all the mechanics. Even as a MMO veteran, I've had to relearn and unlearn habits from previous games. ArcheAge is highly based on working with other players, this isn't a solo player experience. If you are keen on PvP, then I would highly suggest joining a guild and learning the basics from veteran players. I highly recommend giving ArcheAge a try, and if you decide on a Haranya continent race (Harani or Firran) and wish to join a guild based on helping new players and companionship contact me (Vavona) about joining the Neko Punch guild!

This game had a lot going for it. I can't express how disappointed I am.\n\nI went into playing this game with little hope to begin with. Another lame F2P MMO. What can I say? I'm a die hard WoW fan that is rarely ever impressed, much less interested in anything else. Call it personal preference or obsession, whatever suits you. But after playing ArcheAge for a few weeks, I actually started to enjoy myself, little by little. Until I realized a few things about it.\n\nFor starters, this is not a F2P MMO. They like to make you think so. But if you want to do anything substantial in this game, you'd better have cash and be prepared to spend big. At the very least, you need a paid account if you want to get involved in trading profitably. That's a real downer for those who just wanted to enjoy the game they had marketed to them as F2P.\n\nAnother big hit that eventually lead me away from ArcheAge was the community. I played for several months on NA Calleil. I don't know how things are on all the other servers, but the community in Calleil is horrible. People are downright cruel to one another. As cool as some of the game mechanics are, it's the perfect set up for people to be hateful to their fellow players. If you want to keep any shred of faith in humanity, don't play.\n\nI still maintain a small hint of interest, simply due to the naval side of the game. Let's face it, having your own boat is pretty damned cool. So you might just run across me, out there in the war torn waters, trying to catch a stupid fish that will probably get stolen along with my boat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kit_Katters/recommended/304030/","Kit_Katters","Albemaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kit_Katters/","111 products in account","UPDATE:  This review was written right before the game launched. That was before it mysteriously got removed from the Steam store. I no longer reccomend this game. I feel that it is fine if you don't fall into the RNG box trap. But, if you are a player who likes things fast, easily accessible, and/or like to collect in-game items, this is not the game for you. I played this game longer than the hours shown on here. I played it for about 6 months straight after launch. The continuous issues with communication between Trion, XLGames, and the community, made this game unplayable for me. I know there are those who will still enjoy it, and I'm happy for you. I wanted it to be more than it ended up being. Good luck to those still playing. <3\n\nPros:\n- It allows you to customize your gameplay by giving you the freedom to mix three classes of your choice.  This means that if you wanted to, you could be an Archer/Mage/Rogue or a Warrior/Monk/Necro.  There are combinations that make the most sense and probably have the most synergy indicated by flame icons when you go to choose your second and third "skillset" (class).  But, it does not prevent you from making up your own combinations.\n\n- Character customization in this game is pretty fleshed out.  There are many options for hair/makeup/skin, etc.  And it allows you to go even further and apply scars that you can move to new locations on the face, alter the size, and even change the angle.  Some of the options look silly, and it's easy to make a "derpface" character if that's what you're into.  And, if you're one of those players who doesn't like spending hours customizing a character, there are many premade options available to choose from.\n\n- The combo system is interesting.  While watching players fight mobs, it's obvious who has paid attention to the skill info and who hasn't.  The combo system is incredibly rewarding if used correctly.  The amount of damage you do becomes less about having the "strongest" skill and more about reading through all of the skills and finding a combination that has synergy.\n\n- You get a mount before you hit level 10.  It will be in your quest log before you even notice.  While the game will be f2p, and many "fancy" mounts will cost you a pretty penny, they do supply decent mounts for the 100% f2p playerbase.  This mount also has set skills that you unlock as your pet levels up.  And, you can gain armor for your pet through quests.  So, again, the game doesn't force you to spend money to be able to move throughout the game.\n\nThere are more pros to the game, but I suggest for anyone who is weary after reading the cons to just wait until open beta and find them out for yourself.\n\nCons:\n- You don't start off with many skills.  Unlike many other MMOrpgs, you do not recieve a skillpoint with every level achieved.  And, you don't start off with the 2 extra skillsets, those are unlocked at level 5 and level 10, respectively.  Some players feel limited by this setup.  This especially becomes an issue when you mix the limited skillpoints in with the level-gated and point-in-class-gated system (the passives for the skillsets are locked until you spend a certain amount of points in that particular skillset).  So, when a player wants to save those precious skill points for the level 20+ skills, they are severely limited in their number of skills available to them.  It becomes a choice, and I would reccomend just purchasing the skills that you really want, but still getting enough in the beginning that you are having fun.  Afterall, that is what playing the game is all about.\n\n- There is an issue with some quests where the arrow at your feet, pointing you in the direction of your quest, takes you to a location and nothing is there.  Why is that?  Because your quest objective is either above or below you.  Usually, this issue only occus when it is below you.  While you will eventually find where you need to go, and faction or general chat can be helpful, it can become frustrating and in some ways takes away from the immersion of the game.  You end up no longer pretending you are a member of a criminal society and just focusing on "UGH WHERE THE HECK IS THIS NPC" /rage.  It isn't a huge issue and it is in no way occurring frequently, but I figured it was worth mentioning.  And, this game isn't even in open beta yet so issues like this may be fixed.\n\nNow in order to do some of these cons justice, I need to make them Pro/Con, bare with me.\n\nPros/Cons:\n- There is a resource called "labor" in this game.  You gain it over time, but those without Patron status gain it at a much slower rate.  I feel like this resource is a good idea within the game and it gives a truly rewarding boost to those actively supporting the game developers.  But, it can become an issue in the early stages of the game.  New players want to explore these new horizons.  You can create trade routes, become a farmer, sail the seas, craft like a boss, or build a house and maintain your land.  All of this takes labor and in some cases the amount is rather substantial.  On the forums I saw someone mention that it may be a good idea to eliminate the labor costs from the beginning quests that are simply showing players what the game has to offer.  I agree with this sentiment and I think it would make "labor" more of a Pro than a Con.  I also think that if the developers let players fully experience the boundless opportunites of the game, they may be more likely to purchase Patron status in the future.\n\n- If you don't tag a mob first, you won't get XP or any loot from it unless you were in a raid or party with the person(s) who tagged it before you.  This is a Pro/Con because it depends on how you like your MMOs.  Obviously, some quests will become infuriating if someone decides to sit there and troll a boss spawn, but, so far in my experience, people accept a party invite.  Do not expect the stranger sitting at the corpse's feet to initiate contact.  You have to be willing to set up the party if you don't want the guy to tag it before you and if you don't want to be one of those players who runs in right before it spawns and steals all the progress from the player who has been waiting there for a long time.  It encourages group play, which I think is necessary in some ways.  I feel like it is a nice kick in the pants for the outcast players to try to find a guild or a group of friendly players, which will ultimately enhance their entire gaming experience (this is coming from a singleplayer4life "outcast", I'm one of you).  It really isn't the worst thing in the world, but it will turn away some players.\n\n- Freemium is always one of those iffy business models that I generally try to avoid.  At this point, I don't see anything truly gamebreaking from playing it without putting money into it.  However, sometimes these games can take a turn for the worst and suddenly quests are for sale (I'm looking at you LOTRO).  Or, they may stop putting real content (armor, weapon, and glider skins) into the questlines of the future and instead place them all in the marketplace (I'm looking at you Guild Wars 2).  It's too early to tell what direction this game will take, but it's definitely full of interesting content and it's complex enough (tons of tradeskills, skill combinations, mechanics, travel options, etc) to entertain a f2p player.\n\nFinal notes:  Not sure about it?  Don't pay for the packs that give you super duper special shiny early access.  It's a lot of fun, but if you don't have the money right now, or should be putting that most recent paycheck into the bank, just wait.  If you wait until open beta/launch you have spent $0.  Then, if you fall in love with it "LIEKOMG", then you can consider putting in the big bucks to attain Patron status.  Hopefully that helped.  Happy gaming. <3","August 2, 2014","false","202.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","16"

I reached level cap, build my ship, farmed Hasla, etc... So ignore my 0.0 hrs logged on steam for this game. They were late to the party on getting it on steam.\n\nVery innovative, but Dev's and the parent dev company are compeltely lost on what the community actually wants.\n\nAt its core, this MMO is BETTER than any other MMO.  It offers more in it's general idea.  The aspect of building your own ship from scratch, sailing the open seas, diving for treasure, exploring shipwrecks, and killing sea monsters... These things are groundbreaking to the MMO genre.\n\nIt has a very decent questing system that doesn't feel too grindy.  The class systems are very well done, and they avoid falling into the cookie-cutter rut of class building that 99% other MMO's fall into.  You really can play your way, choose your own skills, and build the class you want, as long as you play smart about it.\n\nIt does lack in some skill trees though.  I wish there were summoner type classes, as well as psionic/telekinetic types that never get any love.\n\nItems are unrestricted, you can use anything.  You're given great freedom over how you want to play and theorycraft your character. This is another aspect where AA beats other MMO's.\n\nThe game looks great, and plays great. It's easy to get around, explore, do quests, form parties, etc.\n\nWhere the game fails is at its developement team.  They aren't doing a good job of protecting the game against botters or hackers.  They DO NOT listen to the community at all, no matter how they might try and comfort their fans on the forums.. It's often "We'll say we'll fix it, but we will show we don't give a !@#$."\n\nA MAJOR problem with the game, that caused me to quit playing after reaching 50 is that there is not NEARLY enough housing space available.  And you need a house to craft properly, and you need to craft properly to build the ships you want, and weapons you want.  You can try to otherwise, but it will take you 10 times longer than everyone else. You will fall behind the curve, and get smashed in PVP encounters.\n\nThe crafting of end-game items requires so many materials, it becomes a grindfest.  To the devs i say this: THIS ISN'T FUN!\n\nAll in all, you have a game that looks good, plays good, sounds good, and has a ton of content and options.. It's technically better than every other MMO out there.  But the way it's crafting and housing system has been designed is poorly balanced and is killing off numbers of players for the game.  And its supported by 2 dev teams (Trion and then AA's parent Korean Dev team) that can't make ends meet in providing support and care for their game.\n\nI can recommend playing through to level cap, but don't get any big ideas of crafting a Black Pearl pirate ship, or building a big house for yourself - Those are unrealistic ideas in this game.  Which is a shame because they are the funnest aspects.\n\nArcheAge really should have taken a page out of Ultima Online, and really given more freedom to players on where to build houses and made land more available.\n\nWhat a giant let down... This game was supposed to revolutionize MMO's. and it could have.  But the dev's ruined that opportunity.  This could have been a WoW killer if they would have done it right.","August 2, 2014","false","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also says i can have 4 charcters, but will only let me have 2 made at a time. I have zero problems with other games.

I waited for this game for so long. Think of the dream MMO... Fluid combat, pvp, pve, Housing, Crafting, Complex dungeons, Sailing, and a true sense of open world freedom. Unfortunately bad business practices and no care in the world about cheaters killed this game. Dont let my profile fool you. I was played this game through alpha, betas and launch. I spent 300$ on preorder for my copy and my wife. The cost in total just for apha between me and my friends was $1050. We had a great understanding of the game when launch hit, so we claimed tons of land. We grinded up to 50 (cap at the time) was doing all the dungeons, Mass pvp wars in freedich, had gallions, merchant ships. When Auroria content cameout Trion screwed up so bad that people en masse called for a game wide rollback. Then the hackers came. Now mind you this game has been released in Korea/Russia for a very long time. They (Trion) knew about the exploits for a very long time and did nothing about it. They made the excuse that they were only publishers and the developers have all the power, which is wrong. Hackers made out like bandits with hacks such as instantly Teleporting Trade packs to the drop off point making out like bandits. ESP and lvl 15-20  1 hitting max level chars. Botting was so bad that you could watch trails of bots grining mobs in hellswamp, with lvl 50 players protecting them when you tried to kill them. When you tried to do the right thing and report them, it cost you labor. Even thos that was going on we still played. Then Trion fought back in the dumbest way. They temp banned people who were caught hacking and they would gloat about how they talked their way out of a ban ( look in reddit). Then Trion punished people who were playing legit. It happened to my brother. My brother put a rare item on market worth 800g at the time which was a lot. Someone bought it. He logged on the next day and his gold was gone. He contacted a GM to find out what happened and to get his gold back. It turned out that someone who had hacked money bought the item and they took the gold from my bro and never gave the item back. Then there were the land snipers. Everyone would scour the land to look for a spot to build property. WHole groups of people would stand there waiting to put their plot down when another expired because of unpaid taxes. Hackers were there too, and would snach that land up quicker than a macro ! 1 guy would snatch 8-10 properties in a row, flip them and re sell them for a rediculous price. It got to the point where I had thousands of hours into the game, and I was tired of the Hacks and the store getting bloated with Pay to win items. I left, and my entire guild did as well. Fast foward a year, I see Archeage and I decide lemme give this one another try, maybe things have improved. I put 50 hrs into the game my second attempt, grinded about 4.3 million exp. Got a few of my friends back into it. The place is a ♥♥♥♥ing Ghost town now... places like Hasla where everyone would go to grind token for a higher teir weapon is empty. The Store is so bloated now with pay to win items its not funny. Now Trion is trying to move servers to combat the massive player losses they were hit with. One of the 1st things I noticed though was Hackshield was gone... they took it off. I literally watched 1 guy get 10 items regraded to Epic back to back. Server chat was buzzing with people talking about this guy that loggs on regrades items to epic and puts them on the market and loggs off. This was my personal most anticipated game period. I absolutley loved this game, I talked all my friends into it and they loved it. ARCHEAGE is probably the best if not the best MMOS out there. Having said that I will tell EVERYONE to never play this ♥♥♥♥ing game. This is the best example of a company literally milking the cow dry, and turning a blind eye to cheaters as long as they have revenue coming in.","August 24, 2015","false","51.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

ArcheAge is a GOOD game. BUT it does have its flaws. Without a lot of the F2P elements in the game, this would be a much better title. Not to mention you kind of have to struggle through the early levels to actually have any fun.\n\nI honestly love traveling in this game. The world is big and just looks good overall. Not to mention Boats are a LOT of fun. I recommend grinding through the first 15 levels mindlessly and find yourself a good guild.\n\nFRIENDS ARE WHAT MAKE THIS GAME\n\nNow on the other hand, this game can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. F2P is frustrating as hell when it comes to having to buy space for your bags. The only reason this isn't terrible is because you can buy them with gold at a relatively fair price.\n\nI'm not a fanboy of this game, but I wont diss on it because it's easy to. It's a good game, you just need good people to play it with.\n","September 30, 2015","true","157.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played many P2W games and this one isn't that bad, gold is key here and you don't need to fork out real money to make gold in game. Buying gold out right also isn't possible, you can buy apex and sell them for gold in the market.  You do need  patron status if you want to own a house but also you don't need real money if you buy apex with gold from cash paying players listing them in the market your good to go.  If you have the time to make gold in game you never have to spend real money.  I do like that there is a cash store for players like myself that do not have the time to farm or spend hours a day to make gold in game.  I get a few hours of game time during the week and weekends is where i really get to spend most of my time gaming.\n\nI'm really enjoying my time playing archeage. The graphics are great, and over all gaming i'm hooked.  There is so much to do, build and trade with other players that i'm always looking at my time and seeing that I've spent all my game time in what it seems to me in just a few min when hours have passed by.  I would recommend to people that are looking for a in depth game with a decent cash store.\n\nEdit...\nSo after a few hundred hours of playing, i'm still enjoying this game quite a bit.  The seas are dangerous plan and simple, chances your going to get robbed is very high.  I suggest joining a guild to help, but even then its still a big possiblility your going to get robbed. One good thing is even if you lose your packs your trying to sell your given 20% of the profits the next day via mail.","September 28, 2015","true","430.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was extremely addicted to this when it first came out in the west, but it died shortly after a few months. The playerbase decreased significantly and it became more and more pay-to-win. At first it wasn't really pay to win, I could reach about level 45 without having to pay a single penny but the game is a lot more fun when you buy a Patron subscription.\n\nThe class system is what I liked most about the game. In other MMOs, once you select a class/profession, you're stuck with it unless you delete the character and start again. With this, you only need one character and you can simply change your class whenever you want. Vehicles, sailing, racing, farming, battles, even making music. This game had it all, and it's a shame that the west got everything a century after Korea and the east release new features.\n\nThe subscription system doesn't work here and the customer service is terrible. I wish I could love this game again but the playerbase is pretty dead, kinda like the game. It's too late to get into it now, plus the amount of foreigners who can't speak English is too annoying to deal with.","January 31","false","144.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

ArcheAge is a GOOD game. BUT it does have its flaws. Without a lot of the F2P elements in the game, this would be a much better title. Not to mention you kind of have to struggle through the early levels to actually have any fun.\n\nI honestly love traveling in this game. The world is big and just looks good overall. Not to mention Boats are a LOT of fun. I recommend grinding through the first 15 levels mindlessly and find yourself a good guild.\n\nFRIENDS ARE WHAT MAKE THIS GAME\n\nNow on the other hand, this game can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. F2P is frustrating as hell when it comes to having to buy space for your bags.

I've played many P2W games and this one isn't that bad, gold is key here and you don't need to fork out real money to make gold in game. Buying gold out right also isn't possible, you can buy apex and sell them for gold in the market.  You do need  patron status if you want to own a house but also you don't need real money if you buy apex with gold from cash paying players listing them in the market your good to go.  If you have the time to make gold in game you never have to spend real money.  I do like that there is a cash store for players like myself that do not have the time to farm or spend hours a day to make gold in game.  I get a few hours of game time during the week and weekends is where i really get to spend most of my time gaming.\n\nI'm really enjoying my time playing archeage. The graphics are great, and over all gaming i'm hooked.  There is so much to do, build and trade with other players that i'm always looking at my time and seeing that I've spent all my game time in what it seems to me in just a few min when hours have passed by.  I would recommend to people that are looking for a in depth game with a decent cash store.\n\nEdit...\nSo after a few hundred hours of playing, i'm still enjoying this game quite a bit.  The seas are dangerous plan and simple, chances your going to get robbed is very high.  I suggest joining a guild to help, but even then its still a big possiblility your going to get robbed. One good thing is even if you lose your packs your trying to sell your given 20% of the profits the next day via mail.","September 28, 2015","true","430.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(PETS AND MOUNTS) you can actually equip them with armor. Every pet and mount levels through various things such as letting them watch you fight and keep them summoned just to get the xp for your mount. pets such as wolves or other things small creatures mostly. They will fight with you and gain xp on it. Both mounts and pets have abilities that can appear in the side while you have them summoned. (GLIDING) gliding is a really useful thing in this game you can use it to save your own characters life. use it to climb mountains or just to escape enemies and attack airbourne enemies.\n\n\nSECOND PART WILL BE REVIEWED TOMMOROW","February 2","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was almost pulled away from it by the big amount of mixed reviews.\nGlad I decided to give it a try at least. I played this when it first went into Open Beta for a few hours but then quit due to unkown ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasons. Now I decided to give it another shot and damn, it's nothing like I remember it.\nThe game itself is extremely stable for me, works awesome, looks incredibly awesome and plays awesome.\nI'm currently Level 12 on my character and I'm really enjoying the quests they've thrown in my face, the story and the fact that you can interact with most of the props around the world.\nThe combat system is nothing out of the ordinary, works alright. Skills so far are awesome and I like the fact that you (I may be wrong on this) can change your classes at any given time and just juggle between them as you want. If I want to be a mage that also uses a bow and sword and shield, I can be one.\nNext would be the yet not entirely discovered crafting system which I'm only beginning to explore. It's freaking dense. Tons of things to do from what I've seen. You can have your own personal plot inside the game world which I've been given the choice to do it but I encountered a "Free users cannot do this" error which I'll see later one if it's avoidable or not.\nWhat else, hmm.. Ah yes! Boats. You can have your own freaking boat and it works like boats should work, no unrealistic epic speed with nitro, just slow, steady, annoying speed.\nSo far my 5 hours with this game have been a blast. I'll update this review as my journey continues.\nI really recommend it so far. P2W or not, in the first 5 hours you'll have a blast.

I'll tell you the bad, then the good.\n\nTo start, this game makes you grind in your quests. You spend A LOT of time doing one quest when there are plenty of other games that would let you advance in level MUCH more quickly. When I first started this game, I would play with my boyfriend (OH MY GOD A GIRL ON THE INTERNET WHO KNEW THE LEGENDS WERE TRUE) and he would get REKT so much by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wanted the goods he was transporting for the quest he was doing at the time. The community has died down a little since then, and there aren't as many of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as there were at the start.\n\nThe reason I would recommend this game is because the world is HUGE and the amount of quests to do is pretty much endless. You can choose from an assortment of races, and depending on the race you choose, you ACTUALLY start off on DIFFERENT CONTINENTS! How freaking cool is that!? AND to get to the other continent you can actually cross the freaking OCEAN. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAN SAIL THE SEAS AND BE A PIRATE IF YOU WANT TO. But don't. You'd be one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I mentioned earlier. This game is insanely fun, and even though I only have about 14 hours on it, it never gets old. It's probably my only favorite MMORPG I play.","January 24","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But I personally have felt like I should because I've seen what this game was and what it could become, and then I watched it fall apart.\n\nNow this IS NOT a bad review and most people who've played this would ask why. Well I still think that this game could become much better then it is now so I've decided to write this review, redownload and get back into it. I mean think about it everyone from those who've played to those who have yet to. Name another game that you can go from farming crops, or running goods from one city to another (be it by airship, land or sea) to make profit, and then go to war and fight against an entire faction of people that have the freedom to do the exact same. Now I understand that a good chunk of the game was taken out by hackers and botters, and I understand that Trions devs could do more. Trust me I've lived through it. But we shouldent label this game poor because of its failings, especially if theres someone out there looking for a game like this. I'm for sure not also saying throw all your money at Trion in hopes that they *fix* it, but I believe that there will be a time that this game will come back. And be that one MMORPG that we all wanted it to be.\n\nSo I guess check it out if you dont like it then you can blame me for anytime you lost playing this game.","January 9","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The F2P model is very similar to cellphone games: Lots and LOTS of waiting.\nEverything you do ingame costs Labor points: to open pouches from enemies, cut down trees, mine ore, crafting, etc. If you play for free, you get 5 points every 5 minutes ONLY if you are online. If you pay however, you get 10 labor points every 5 minutes even if offline.\nYou want to mine the iron ore over there? NOPE, gotta wait 10 minutes before you have enough labor points. You want to craft a silly quest item? Tough luck buddy, you will need 100 labor points. Even if you subscribe, the waiting for labor point ruins the whole experience.\n\nIf you want to play it for free, the only way you can do stuff is by leaving your game open to stack labor points.\n\nOn a last note, everything in the cash shop is way overpriced to be worth your while.\n\nTL:DR Great game, horrible f2p system that ruins the whole experience. I would recommend if it were a subscription-only based game with no labor points and no cash shop.

I really did. The world is very well-developed, the playable races are interesting (this is the first game that made me actually want to play an elf, for instance), and the class system is pretty neat and varied. And I absolutely love to make things in these games.\n\nHowever, if you're on a free account, there's much less stuff to do than appears to be out there. I suppose that's fair- after all, you get what you pay for. I do wish, however, that the game had told me my limitations going out of the gate, instead of, for example, cheerfully handing me a quest to build something and then informing me when I tried to fill it that building things was an activity limited to paying players only. For another example, the help message at the bottom of the server select screen tells players that they can have six characters total, with a maximum of four on any given server- this isn't the case for free players, who can only have two characters total. Another small thing, but I'd have appreciated some accuracy.\n\nThen there's the Labor system; there's no reason for it to be run the way it is unless the developers wanted to limit crafting to paying players only. I'm fine with effectively not being able to craft items, but then the designers somehow worked enemy drops into the crafting system. That's right, you have to spend Labor to collect any in-game currency from defeating enemies, which is the thing that angered me about ArcheAge. I tend to play MMOs in short bites, so I'm not online nearly long enough at a stretch for my Labor pool to replenish itself to a workable level, and with every foe I kill, and there are a lot of them, I get another useless coinpurse (at level 15 or so where I am, they cost 2 Labor apiece to open, which doesn't seem so bad, but then "higher-level" coinpurses are dropped that cost 20 Labor or so to open).\n\nAgain, my opinion may not matter much, because I didn't spend money, but I really dislike being locked out of things that were advertised to me as being available to everyone.","July 8, 2015","false","43.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Going out on a ship was fun even with a few bugs (game mechanics) here and there.....then as you get to the end game, you realize how much this game really suffers from an extreme case of 'pay to win' disease. Sure it had been improved in a recent patch, but it still requires alot of real money transactions (unless you spend your entire life in the game grinding gold or selling crafts) RNG is not on your side most of the time. Sadly a huge time and money sink that doesn't live up to the entertainment value. Maybe it will improve, maybe it will get better in time, but by then, I think we'll be playing a new and better MMO.

Roughly three months in AA turned to crap, progressively worse every day.  I was really fortunate to have not been a big enough chump to swipe hard for gear and any time I found myself tempted to I would take a step back and evaluate how hard the game was dying which made it very easy to spend my money elsewhere.

Free to play players only regenerate a small, tiny fraction of the LP compared to subscribers or people who spend real money on Labor Point shops. Want to pick up a flower? Loot a mob? Sell something on the AH? Craft something? Build a trade pack? Get a ship? Open a chest? You better buy some labor points!\n\nChecked the game's features? You can build trade packs and turn them in for gold or resources. Cool huh?\nNope. It's a big fat ♥♥♥♥ing noobtrap.\nCrafting?\nNoobtrap.\nUhh... You can get a house and grow ♥♥♥♥ and raise animals!\nNope. Noobtrap.\nIf you want to maximize your earnings, you need to grind 432534 of the same low level mobs and open their purses for archeum. That's basically the game. Enjoy.","October 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Honestly I don't know... It just lost the feeling for me. I played during Alpha aswell. Spendt Pretty much 70% of my game time there, and for what? To have my character deleted and for me to start over again.\n\nArcheage tried its best to be unique, and some places it succeeded, but its just way to repetetive. Go here, kill that, go back, get another quest, kill that etc.\nBut if you ignore this, and try to have fun with friends and do traderuns or maybe robb someone it can be alot of fun. I remember playing with one of my good friends, and we used to do traderuns all day, we got robbed several times but we still enjoyed it.\n\nBut here is a huge mistake I think with the game. IT IS SO GRINDY. So you get something called Guilda stars, wich are used to buy blueprints for stuff like ships and houses, these are pretty much impossible to get after you do the main missions that ends roughly at level 30. After this you do F***ING DAILY QUESTS THAT GIVE YOU ONE GUILDA STAR PER DAILY..... or you can do traderuns to the enemy country and earn one guilda star per package...\n\n\nI really wish this game was different, I had some awesome and epic adventures in this game. But im afraid I just can't recommend this game (even if its free).\n\nFinal verdict\n\n3/10","December 24, 2015","false","186.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

The game is fun, you can have great fun with this game without spending a penny. Although I would reccomend if you enjoy the game then dropping some pennys on patron access is a good idea, at least for the first month.\n\nEverything in the cash shop can be purchased with ingame gold using the Apex system but this is also where the pay to win comes in. Gold can be purchased from other players using the Apex system.\n\nLong story short. Its free to play, dropping money will make you advance faster but ultimatly this is a fun game even ifyou dont spend a penny.\n\nTip: Find a guild!","September 11, 2015","true","368.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are over 140 class combinations, because after level 5, respectively level 10, you get to choose 2 more skillsets, and get your own class title : Example : Arcanist, Demologist, Revenant, Stone Arrow, Templar, Gypsy, Shaman, Blighter, .\nYes ! I've level up my character, now what?\nCall your friends, cooperate, make a 'family' and decide what things you want achieved, example Player x wants to build a house and be alchimist, you want to build a ship and focus on cooking, crafting, machining proficiency activities.\nIt's a free game, yes, but you can't access the whole experience without paying. MY FRIEND YOU ARE WRONG!!.\nYou can make alot of gold for free, and buying some coins named APEX, granting 1250 credits. the amount required to get patron is 2500 credits If I remember, and you can get patron for free, and as you have patron *5000 labor cap, faster xp drop* you regenerate 5 labor while offline, 10 while online. you can use the patron for different activities that get you gold. in 1 week you can buy patron for two months.

It's the god-awful crafting system. Crafting is tiered and requires the previous version of something in order to craft a better version of it.\n\nWant that level 50 staff? First craft a level 20 staff, then upgrade it to the level 25 staff, then to the level 30 staff, and so on and so forth. Each new version needs a bunch of different hard-to-get materials and it's obnoxious. Now imagine doing the same thing for all your different armor slots.\n\nTo compound the problem, you can't just harvest everything you need for crafting. Some things can only be gotten from trade runs. Other things have to be crafted from other professions. The prices for everything are so inflated that oftentimes buying the oil you need to make that leather armor negates the profitability of crafting it yourself. You might as well just buy the armor of the AH.\n\nIt's just uselessly complicated and absurd. If I could harvest everything I needed, and didn't need the 10 previous versions of a piece of gear to make that gear, I would love this game. But the crafting system as it is right now just enrages me. I can't take it anymore.\n\nIt's a shame because I enjoy most other things about the game. With MMO's it's always that one boneheaded design decision that ruins it for me, and in ArcheAge it's the crafting.","August 15, 2015","false","82.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I'm just writing this for the sake of personal closure.\nArcheage could have been THE MMO. THE WoW killer. The be-all-and-end-all of MMOs. I'm well aware that the title I just said has been given to MANY MMOs, (SWToR, ESO, TERA), but if you have played Archeage (And I do recommended playing the first 15 levels, then you'll truly understand what this review is saying) you'll know that Archeage was destined to be the real WoW killer. THE MMO.\n\nSo where did it go wrong?\nIt's funny how just a small little thing can ruin such a magnificant example. The fact that this game is free killed it. In order for this game to be free, Trion had to burden it down with microtransactions.  And what a mistake that was. In order to fit in with the crowd of free to play MMOs, Trion felt it would be a good idea to make the game free, when a simple $15 per month sub fee would have been well justified with how much content and opportunity this game had.\nEverything in this game either costs money to enjoy or isn't worth doing. The housing system? Costs money. Auction house? Costs money. Farming? Costs money. simple things such as crating and getting loot? Costs money.\nEven the things that don't cost money aren't worth doing because this game has no hope for it left. Its playerbase is gone, and whoever is left is either a new player or a bot.\n\nHopefully someday soon another game like this will pop up without the colossal failure of what this game did wrong.","January 24","false","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I stopped playing this game twice, only because it took up my whole life.  I have far more hours on it than my steam says, truthfully, I've hardly played on steam and I have 434 hours logged.  There is one thing I'd like to say.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING YOU CANNOT DO IN THIS GAME EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO OPEN YOUR WALLET.  THIS GAME IS 100% F2P.\n\nI have seen far worse in games than the pay system in this one.  This one is only hindering on your ability to own housing/crafting, but thats easily managable.  As you advance in a craft, the labor costs decrease as well, making some things that where not effective earlier, something you can sell to make money now.\n\nPeople say you can't make money when your not patron(subscriber) and I disagree.  I always have enough money for patron status within a week using the formula at the bottom of this review to craft via buying and selling things from the AH.\n\nNow it is true, when you first start playing, you cannot access the AH without an AH license.  My first playthrough I saved up money for 2x APEX and bought patron which removes the need for the AH license, but I still picked one up later.  That one barrier is a hinderence but does not make that game unplayable, as by the time you reach max level, or maybe even halfway to max level, you should have enough money from fighting alone to get a single apex for an AH license.  I'll post the formula for making money at the bottom.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTRUE OPEN WORLD\n\n1.GLIDERS!!!!  This game has so many fantastic design elements I've never seen anywhere else.  First of all GLIDERS!  OMG GLIDERS...Every game I've ever played since this game, has me trying to double jump to pull out my glider.  You are MEANT to explore every nook and cranny of this game.  There are even "achivement" awards for finding specific areas and even if nothing is in a place, how do you know another player isnt hiding a large tree farm hidden behind that mountain.\n\n2.Naval Warfare!  They did a fantastic job with ships and boats, to fishing boats etc.  Gameplay is VERY smooth over water and each component on a ship is destructable with its own HP bar.  I wish there were a lot more types of ships as well but they did a fantastic job there.  The physics on ships can make you laugh sometimes too when they go to right themselves.  Although I wish there was more of a reason to leave a ship out and/or docked.  There's a button that makes it so no one can steal your ship, but it only lasts a minute after you disembark.  10mins when in town would be a lot better, and 1 minute at sea would still work.\n\n3.  It is a true open world.  As for some loading screens, the only loading areas I'm aware of is dungeons, and those are no PVP group events anyway.\n\n4. Multiple Islands/Dialects.  The world is very large, and sadly I wish it were bigger still.  You will have to learn other langauges if you wish to speak with anyone from the other faction and that can take some time and money but is still a fun aspect of the game.\n\n\nPVP\nThe PVP aspect is a part of the game I wish they knew how to address better.  PVP starts around level 30 areas and is pretty much open after that point.  PVP as it is now is very, very fun.  I'm not really a huge PVP'r, but the threat of danger is always around which is fun.  As the game currently stands, you can opt out of PVP by simply sticking to your homelands.  Passed level 30 areas, you just have to watch for criminals from your own faction, but I personally have never really had too much to worry about.  There's 3-4 areas, per Continent, that you cannot be attacked in and those areas are quite large.\n\n\nTwo things would make this game A LOT better imo though.\n1.  Create a server that has a 100% unkillable rate on home Continents, like they do for levels 1-30 but make it for all areas.  Still able to get jacked on the high seas and opposing Continent but thats a risk you take.  (Easy Mode)\n\n2.  Create a server that has a 100% no protection rate on home Continents allowing only the guards to protect you. Then make it so when you die, you drop ALL your items including some of what you have equiped or possibly all of what is equipped.(Hard Mode)\n\nTHIS would remove the entire pay to win PVP aspect of the game and fix the only real problem with the "Credit Card Power" system and at the same time, a lot more items and gold would shift hands via AH as well as a lot more crafters being needed.  The creation of these two servers would solve a good majority of the complaints and negative reviews.\n\n\n\nHere is the forumla for making money.\n\nSP() x (AHT) = G ()  //Selling Price(SP) x AuctionHouseTax(AHT) = how much Gold you get back (G)\nG() - MC() = SP()    //G - Material Cost(MC) = Single Profit(SP)\n\n1000/LC() = TC()     //1000 / Labor Cost(LC) = Total Crafts per labor potion(TC)\n\nTC() x SP() = TP()   //TotalCrafts x SingleProfit = Total Profit(TP)\nTP() - LPC() = NP()   //Total Profit(TP) - Labor Potion Cost(LPC) = Net Profit(NP)\n\nIf your Net Profit is in the positive, your making money effectively without using any labor of your own.  I also believe the AH takes more tax if you are not patron, but i dont think its much more, its 10% from patron or (0.9) in the formula above.\n\nThis is by far one of the best MMO's ever made and yes I've played just about them all, except WoW.

While beautiful to look at, little impactful story and imbalanced abilities make it impractical to strive to pass through the high levels of grind needed to subsist, let alone thrive. The game desperately tries to hide the fact that anything you can grind can more easily be aquired through payment, though some high tier items can only be purchased.\n\nSimply put, as many others have said, if you wanted a Pay-to-Win Farmville game with RPG elements in the Crysis engine, then play this game.

You're probably better off waiting for another upcoming tittle. It feels like playing a beta just where you know things won't be fixed. Class imbalance, gamebreaking bugs and glitches(and those things have been there forever). The most gamebreaking for me is that the "endgame" of Archeage seems to be the PvP, but I have yet, after almost 300 hours gameplay, to feel interested in it. There's only the arena (1v1 or 5v5) where there seems to be descent PvP(and with current balance only few classes are represented here). Most of the PvP is just ganking where it comes down to who strikes first.\n\nPros:\n- Non instanced housing where placement matters\n- Good concept\n- Good graphics\n- Crafting system is okay. The best gear in the game is obtained through crafting aswell as a lot of RNG\n- The game encourages playing with guild and friends\n- "Endgame" is about what you want\n\nCons:\n- Class system is garbage. A good idea but it comes down to a few skill trees being completely dominating.\n- No bugfixed (like at all. Instances are bugged to make boss fights trivial have been there probably since release aswell as other gamebreaking bugs)\n- Labor points system preventing you from doing what you want to (crafting, gathering and even grinding requires labor points)\n- PvP is just annoying.

You can't just do "what you want" at anytime in the game.

The f2p portion is a taste of the game and if you like it you will want to pay for the subscription. This is like the play to 20 system on wow but it is longer. There are ways around purchasing the subscription with money. Before I started paying for patron (the premium) I got a month free through buying apexs I made by different labor free gold methods. It was a hard long haul of small gains but 800 gold later I bought 2 apexs (premium currency) and got patron for free. After I obtained patron I made enough gold to buy patron 10 times over. It is possible but it is hard and requires alot of dedication and hardwork. After a while I broke down and started paying for patron for real money and it was well worth it. The only major problem that I have with this game is the current state of the server that I play (Aranzeb) and the reviews that make this game look like it is black desert. If you do goto play on the Arazeb NA server feel free to freind me im Zorzx ingame","July 9, 2015","true","523.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

[/quote]\n\nI think this is the biggest problem with the game.. they should never have introduced a cash shop and simply made it subscription based.\n\nThe ability for individuals to drop large sums of money to get a competitive advantage is what makes it feel like it's pay to win.\n\nIf I pay a monthly subscription, I expect the game to be balanced around equal effort, not who sells the most apex/cash shop items.\n\nI had no problem with the grind, but when you add in the RNG (AA has one of the toughest rng sets I've played.. it really is a luck grind),  the fact that your items can be destroyed when upgrading (regrade charms reduce this and at higher levels, they are required to progress without spending a fortune) and then the ability for people to simply sell apex and outright buy high end items. It makes the game feel pay to win.. not just pay to progress faster.\n\nThe worst part is that as a subscriber.. Your already paying a sub, then you still feel like the game is pay to win at endgame.\n\nNone of these issues will affect you heavily as a you are leveling, so its a fun game up until endgame, where you realize its almost impossible to progress without subscribing and swiping your visa.  That is the double dipping that really annoyed me about their cash shop model.","March 29, 2015","false","239.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Now they have done so much more work on the game i find it so much more enjoyable. I was really looking forward to Archeage when they announced it and i was so hyped. On launch it was a dissaster with 3 hour to 5 hour wait time. When ytou finally got in there were so many people on the server it was laggy and the starting zone was horendous. You couldnt complete the first quest because there were so many players the respawn wait was so much slower than the kill rate. i quite at this point.\n\nAfter monthes of being disapointed with the game i decided to play it again. I was amazed with all the work they did the game looks fantastic and feels like a great MMO. I was so happy because ive been looking for a game like this for so long. I am a lvl 26 Plate wearing Darkrunner who just got his first ship and i am having a ball. An example is i just got my first ship and i toook my low level friend to the sea of graves in the whirlpool isle. I decided to ram the whirl pool and our ship went flying.

So you can think long and hard before investing your time and money.\n\nArcheAge could have been a very amazing MMO, but it is completely ruined by the cash shop and Trion's money  grubbing. You have no hope of getting anywhere without the payed account statis. Which you can pay $15 a month for (Which I have no problem with, MMO developers should make money off their product, just not expect to suck an endless amount out with broken cash shops.), or buy two Apex items off your servers auction house. My server Apex was worth 500-600g. Now apex can only be bought through Trion's webpage for $10. Meaning anyone using apex for a payed account, will be feeding Trion $20 a month instead of the normal $15.\n\nWith this being stated, the majority of players pay money for their monthly account. Despite this Trion still forces cash shop purchase with regrade charms, that only come from the cash shop and can not be crafted.\n\nEnd game bosses are unoriginal and boring. Each boss shoots out some form of area of effect one shot magic attack. Which is countered by standing together the whole fight and casting a spell, that makes all of you immune to magic damage. The only exception to this is boss ship battles.(They are fun.) Bosses are open World, where only one guild gets to kill and loot it. Each with a one day repawn timer. Your faction or the opposing faction can grief you while you fight a boss. Even if you get boss loot, you are still forced to regrade it.\n\nRegrading is a JOKE and is the "hidden" end game in ArcheAge. I've never seen a MMO punish their players so much before for simplely upgrading their equipment. It is a system based only on luck and cash spent, where 99% of the players fail time after time, while the 1% get impossible success after success. Enough so where you just assume they are cheating.\n\nYou regrade an item by using a scroll and spending gold each attempt. Charms can be added to this to increase your chance of success. Each success increases the grade of an item, giving it a stat boost. Once you reach a certain grade, your item can not only explode and destroy it, it can fail and fall three grades. There is NO WAY to prevent this, leaving you with only wasted time and money.\n\nI am very sad because ArcheAge could have be great game, but at it's core ArcheAge is built to milk money from your wallet.","August 25, 2015","false","434.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And if oyu are going to read please do read to teh end,I don;t want anyone getting the wrong idea.\n\nI was a Gold Founder for archeage,i supported this game pre-release and played all the beta events,and as any Founder will tell you the Beta was amazing,it was beautiful and it was fun. A huge world where you can craft,build,fight and explore with your friends and make new ones in-game. The beta was truely great and it was an aweseom time.\n\nHowever,then came the 4-day head start for founders and this is where the first signs of Trions mismanagement started to show,there simply were not enough servers,and this was with knowing exactly how many players they would have as everyone playing had paid for the founder pack,and this started to show poor management. At the time most founders were annoyed about not being able to pay,I was,but thre were also some of us that realised how bad it could be when the game went to open access and Trion wouldn't even know how many people to expect,and on day 5 the servers simply could not cope,there was at most 1 more server added which still couldn't even fit all the founders in so on day 5 there were queues of over 7000 people waiting to get into a server.\n\nNow don't get me wrong,the game is amazing,for those that don't know the game is originally made by a Korean company and Trions runs the game for NA and EU with their main original role being translation (which they still haven;t done completely) all the problems seen in the first month of teh game were down to Trions management, NOT the game.\n\nAfter week 5 I stopped playing untill December,I had truely lost hope in Trions ability to run the game. But when I took a look at the game in December I got my hope back Trion seemed to be doing there hardest to make up for their previous mistakes,I had not looked untill then but I found out that 2 months into teh game they released a componsation package for all founders afffected by the ♥♥♥♥ storm at launch. They also seemed to have a more friendly relation with teh player-base like they did in Beta and Alpha.\n\nAnd in the Summer of 2015 with the games 1st Anniversary Trion seemed to have fixed most of their problems,however they do somethimes make gamechanging decisions done by vote on polls without advertising the poll to the whole community.\n\nSince then the game has been improving in general,and apart from some anger within the community about Server Merging Trion has not really made an massivly unpopular decisions.\n\nThe gameplay itself tis great,each race has a truely amazing story my faviourite being the Nuian,the combat is fun and different from a lot of MMOs standing comabt,this allows you to,and at times you must,move and fight mobile. you can build ships and dail the oceans,live as a pirate,fisherman,miner,armour,warrior there are huge amount of choices.\nYou also pick 3 subclasses to make your overall class and you can change them at any time meaning that you are not locked to a single class.\n\nThe community is great,I have only ever met a few people who are just toxic towards other players,even most pirates are friendly enough. You will be able to find a guild that suits you,and with my experience most guild leaders are very helpful and kind.\n\nOverall I do recomend the game:\nGame itself:9/10\nTrion Management:6/10\nCommunity:10/10","April 2","true","28.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

The game play is fun, there is a lot of potential in the game. The biggest problem, the game is based around PvP. People will argue that if you don't want to pvp you dont have to. You can go with out PvP but you might as well be playing farmville. Every bit of this game is PvP and that is what I loved about it! But then you get into the whole pay to win aspect. To compete with anyone in this game you have to lock in your credit card and start shelling out money to get gear to compete.

This made the leveling experience alot nicer for me as the game sticks to traditional mmorpg quest hubs, grab some quests kill 15 of these whilst stealing 10 of them and hand them in, the only difference here is that there is an over achieving system, where if you kill more than your target on the way back to the quest giver, you recieve a bonus for that or alternatively, you can hand in early and complete the quest for a lesser reward. It doesn't differ on the quest variety much though.\n\nThe class system is somewhat nice on this, at character creation you get to choose from a multitude of classes for all sorts of roles to forfill on the typical holy trinity structure tank/damage/healer and then off you go to fight. At level 5 you can choose again from the same pool, then again at level 10, every other time you level up you get to choose from skills from one of the trees, each move can combo with other skill you learnt from other trees, this made picking and choosing fun as it opens up a whole new window of oppertunity with personal strategy\n\nThe last thing I want to hit on before I end this review of my experience is the thing that I loved most about my time in archeage, the world and travel. This game has everything I loved about my wow days and more, the open world with no instancing and no loading screens, this is SO important to me in a game like this, the freedom to explore on my own terms if it be by my  personal mount that I raised from a pup (or kitten I guess in my case) or by glider and if your destination is across the sea you can travel by a large choice of boats and ships. One of the things that got me most outstanding features of this game is the player housing and land owning wich I feel most mmo's have failed to deliver even though its close to no1 on players requested features, this game does it and it does it very well but I will have to do an update on that when I actually do it myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoVictrix/recommended/304030/","neoVictrix","neoVictrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoVictrix/","254 products in account","To clear up some misconseptions on the game -\nYes, it had a less then stellar launch, and took much longer than expected for a number of issues to be addressed, looked into, and resolved. Over time, a number of these issues have been resolved, and are continued to be worked on.\nYes, the game makes use of an energy system to limit the amount of "vocational" activities you can do - crafting, fishing, gathering, opening coinpurses, anything that isn't involved with questing and combat. Part of the reason for this is because you earn experience from these activities as well, so in a way it functions no differently from the "rested" exp system popularized by World of Warcraft.\nThe game does not force you to spend money to do anything. Learn to pace yourself - the game isn't going anywhere, and you don't need to zerg rush the game to the level cap with the best equipment you can craft. Playing the game that way will make you not enjoy it.\nDespite all the pay-to-win claims, the title is not appropriate for the game. There is PVP content for those interested in it, and there is PVE content. Having the best equipment in the game is not a requirement when participating in either of these things, and does not require you to shell out any amount of money to be in them. A player with lower grade equipment but knows how to play can beat out a player that relies only on their equipment - this is something proven many times in many different games.\nFor those that like to play solo, while it is possible to do in this game, you'll find yourself having difficulty in attempting to be self-sufficient. ArcheAge promotes some sort of cooperation between players to get things done, or at least make them easier. So make some friends, join a guild, use what they have to offer to speed up your progression.\n\nSo now onto the game, which I'll try to keep as short as possible.\nIt isn't perfect, it has it's flaws, and depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs it doesn't offer anything really new to the scene. The fact that you can build ships and sail the ocean is a nice feature of the game, but if you are one that finds the "go to this place to find or kill this thing, then talk to this person in the next town" questing system boring, then this isn't for you.\n\nPersonally, from the time I've played it (off of Steam since it has just recently returned) I've had fun, met some great people, and been bored out of my mind. So I can say my time was well spent for the amount of entertainment I've had from this game.","March 26, 2015","true","310.1"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","18","35","2","0"

I dont want it to die out, but everyone is spiting this game and ignoring how amazing it is. if the community follows this game and keeps it alive, it will turn out to be an amazing sandbox mmo, if not the best one. The class system, the combat, the sandbox gliders, mounts, vehicles, houses, farms, all amazing. Give this a chance, take some time to really realize why this game is so good\n\nAlso, watch this, its very long, but this guy will explain EVERYTHING that makes this game so good. this was all during alpha aswell, the design choices and new things to come are so amazing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uYtipph5ho\n\nYes the labor system is annoying. But just like every mmo, you have to work to be good in this game. You can pay for fancy stuff BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO, i repeat YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TO BE GOOD IN THIS GAME, you completely have the option to get everything with hard work, a good party, and dedication. There are no strengths to paying, only that you will have a pretty glider and got your house a bit easier.\n\nMost things in this game you can pay for are not needs, but wants. if you WANT a house or you WANT a cool glider or you WANT a nice mount, Just like any other mmo, you have to pay. Nobody on any mmo gets anywhere without paying, thats how companies make money. even pay to play mmos have cash shops that render players "a cool house" or "a cool mount" so what makes this any different?\n\nIn reality, free to play mmos will ALWAYS have something for you to pay for, and so will Sub mmos. But people become spoiled by the "FREE TO PLAY" model, and think that means "Im gonna be super cool and have everything FOR NO MONEY OR EFFORT". Well you will need to learn to get over that before you play ANY mmo. If you dont wanna pay, Settle for what you can do without paying, If you can become something great in an mmo, without any statistical disadvantage, Just play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  if the mmo doesnt benefit people who pay in any other way besides "having a few nifty gizmos and vanity armor" Just play it and see how great you can become with all the awesome things that you DONT have to pay for.\n\nIts people like this that feel entitled to things that games dont hand to them for free, these are the people that kill communities. This is why pay to play has such a good community, The people understand that they get entire worlds to explore, items to weild, Quests to do, Skills to master for what they pay for. But free to players just see "that guy paid 5 bucks for a fancy thingy, Its pay to win!" rather then "I get this entire world to explore, quests to do, etc ALL FOR FREE". so, Free to play will always be plauged by greed, but more often by its players rather than the companies.\n\nSeriously, Chill out guys, lighten up, and enjoy living in a fantasy world.\n-HEZERU","July 18, 2015","true","3.5"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","23","45","3","1"

Unfortunately, only nearly. Some of the problems are unfixable. My biggest gripe is: NO ONE TALKS. Even if you talk to another player, 9 times out of 10 they don't talk back because they're too busy grinding something whether it be gilda, crafting, gold or combat. For me personally, that's most of what the game could be down the toilet instantly. Without any regular meaningful communication with other players how exactly do players of this MMO actually relate to each other? Running dungeon raids together or by murdering you mainly. And I have no problem with PVP, in fact I am in favour of it but without any positive form of relating to players to balance it out this game really ends up, despite the wonderful structure it has in place, being just a boring grind and hoard fest.\n\nAlso, most  of the early-game's adventuring spirit was entirely anhilated by an unfortunate need to have to do a gazillion tedious quests to level up which mostly consisted of boshing mobs that are standing around all over the damn place like a bunch of cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, waiting for you to abuse them. Then when you finally have reached level 50 you've seen nearly the whole map and don't really feel like adventuring anymore. It is also then when you realise that even though you have reached level 50, it's the level 55s with the ♥♥♥♥-hot gear and the finely tuned derivative build who are still going to be butt-♥♥♥♥ing you at their whim.\n\nWhat I would like to see future developers do is: Get rid of the grind altogether - it's ♥♥♥♥. Give us ultimate freedom. To do this, remove levelling. Start the game at the highest level. And get rid of ridiculously expensive/hard to find items - they're pointless and only encourage further grinding. Get rid of quests too, they feel too much like they're telling you what to do, directing you too much, and take away from your own feeling of freedom, inventing your own quests (or perhaps discovering secret/subtly written in quests). With all that ♥♥♥♥ out of the way, focus on one thing only - making a good end-game. Also consider ways in which to encourage players to interact with each other in ways that don't ONLY include grinding dungeons and killing each other. If a developer considers all these things we might get a good game. Archeage has a lot of great features, unfortunately they all come to diddly when overshadowed by the grind and total lack of meaningful relations between players.","June 22, 2015","false","129.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has potential out the ♥♥♥- an amazing open world, great graphics, awesome class system, challenging yet rewarding skill system and much, much more. But at the end of the day and my 400+ hours (I played on the normal app before the steam one came back) my experience was ruined not by the great (yet slightly troll) community but by the fact this game is Pay To Enjoy. Some would say pay to win or pay to get there faster and whilst I have debated both with my friends I must say after my first few hours of gameplay the cash shop started to rear its dirty head right up into my face.\n\nThere are stats I could throw at you like the fact you'll never earn as much gold as a person who throws money at the cash shop but instead of going on FOREVER, id like to cut this short by saying that archeage could have been a classic game for ever but instead of being pay to play like every MMO should be with no subscription and no cash shop it instead chose to shot itself in the face.\n\nSo no don't play this game...unless you wanna throw loads of money at it in which case why don't you just ge world of Warcraft and buy the sparkle mount?\n\n\n...P.S.

There are not enough digital laws to protect people from games gloriously programmed for your failure like this one. Archeage is absolutely setup around scaling % algorithms. Meaning the random number generator is not so random. it scales constantly and changes constantly. This is why there are no actual percentages in the game. Archeage is beautiful and has so many different elements it makes the game feel unending. Good right? Well that depends how much money you would like to spend. Unless you can dedicate and focus yourself to one element of the game at a time your going to burn through money and hate yourself and be broke at the end.

Running on a modified CryEngine, it features fantastic character models, outfits, weapons and mounts. It's landscapes are as vast as they are detailed. The ability to set sail on it's massive, gorgeous seas adds a new layer to the already played out genre. Who doesn't fantasize about being a pirate?\n\nPlayer owned plots are a throwback to days where MMO developers brought a balanced approach in delivering the goods to their playerbase. The community driven market is nothing new but very much welcomed.\n\nAt first sight, it really seems like ArcheAge has the potiential to redefine MMO's for the better.\n\n\n!BUT!\n\n\nThen we run into their atrocious P2W model. This game is a MMO whales wet dream. Sadly this applies to both the PvE and PvP aspect of the game.  As an examle, the taxation on player plots is rather high. Labour (which is required to craft, which is 1/2 the game in itself) is such a transparent cash grab that it's slightly infuriating. Then there is the fact that North American publisher 'Trion Worlds' is terrible at communicating with their community and when they do, they often renag on their word. Lest I mention their biased community support leads found in their forums.\n\nUltimately, at the end of the day, ArcheAge offers VERY little for seasoned veterans of the MMO landscape. However, for new comers to the genre it may very well be the game that gets them hooked. As somone who purchased a 'Founders Pack' which is the MOST I've ever single-handedly spend on a video game, turned out to be such a farce, I'm compelled to tell the average gamer to stay away.

This game takes every opportunity to promote buying with real money. Also, You can't own a farm or house unless you pay to be a patron. I can't understand why the free to play option allows people to have those things. Oh, I forgot, The devs didn't develop enough land to allow everyone to have a piece of it. I can't understand why the devs can't make instances for houses. Other games do. What I mean is that everyone has the opportunity to own a farm or house, they enter an "instance" to go to it. For having the ability to do crafting, farming, building and questing, one would think the developers would figure out how everyone (free or patron) could have their own place to call home.

It's a beautiful world thats somewhat rewarding to discover. With the housing and trading system, most zones are populated with high level players so the world never really feels empty. The crafting system is very deep, but it does rely on RNG a little too much (its a korean developer after all).\n\nBut this game is NOT at all optimized well. Even a high end machine will have some issues. The small # of PVE dungeons are glitched. Housing is a joke because of hackers.\n\nAnd, furthermore, it's Pay 2 Win since the best gear is crafting and with RNG, you need to invest millions in gold.\n\nI wanted to love this game. I enjoyed having my own thatched farmhouse, doing my daily farming and livestock tending. Crafting here and there. Going on trade runs. Trying to hi-jack the enemy factions trade runs.\n\nWhat killed this game for me is its truly shoddy handling by XL Games and Trion. I won't bother listing what they did wrong, as that list is a mile long. Time after time they screwed up the game more and more, because of bad management. I mostly blame XL games, as on the coding side of things, a lot of the issues could have been fixed. I feel like Trion has their hands tied in a lot of decisions as well so I don't FULLY blame them.\n\nBest example of bad management: the day the new continent of Auroria was released, where it was basically a race to build on 1 of 4 spots a castle for your guild, 90% of the playerbase could not log in. So the guilds the got the castle, it came down to luck - and there are people that prepared for weeks to do this and lost out. I stopped playing shortly after. Theyve released some new content since then but I am doubtful the game is much better.\n\nBTW, I played this off steam, so thats why I dont have any logged hours.","May 6, 2015","false","10.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

That could say it all, but to elaborate a bit. AA is a game with great potential but like many other mmo's it has been ruined by 3rd party game publishers more interested in making another buck than building a community that they can milk for years to come.\n\nThe main issues in the last 12 months center on:\n1.  Releasing year 2 content less than 3 months after the game made its North American release.\n\n2. Hacking is ramped and GM's more than a few times simply unban hackers on request with a lite finger wag in their direction.\n\n2a. We’re talking teleport hacks that let people warp clear across areas and land grab hacks(you can own land in game for living/ storage/ farming) these hacks also let them bypass the system as a whole and INSTO-BUILD  their homes leaving 50+ people scratching their heads as to how someone who wasn’t even online could grab the land and have built a house.\n\n2b. The land hacking leads to "land barons" who make all their money in game thru selling land. These are the people you see selling 4 or more pieces of land on a almost weekly bases.\n\n3. GAMES LABOURS LOST or THEY HATE YOU AS A PLAYER AND THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL EVER LOVE YOU IS IF YOU GIVE THEM MONEY ON A WEEKLY BASES FOREVER. This is illustrated whenever you buy a pack like the one steam sells here. They generally have gear that is better than that which can be acquired in game for free. That is until AA staff decides to gimp that gear after you bought. This compounded by the reminder you need "patron status". Patron status is the "non-required required" monthly fee that allows you to own land; own but not keep. You must after paying the MONTHLY FEE, you need to pay a WEEKLY FEE as well in order to keep your land. Now maybe you get busy with life or you just decide to play something else instead? Then after 2 weeks you land is lost to you and the most valuable items are sent to your mail box, after 30 days all items that the game recovered on your land that were sent to mail will AUTO-DELETE IN YOUR MAIL BOX.\n\n(This includes item purchased from the ingame cash shop. That’s right all items in the game are fair grounds for deletion.)\n\nRemoving almost every reason to come back to AA ever(Side Note: This last May they have a “come back to AA” even which did nothing to return lost goods to former players. Instead giving returning players cheap gimped gear as a reward for trying to play again).\n\nHonestly never played an MMO that punishes gamers to the level that it could be consider STEALING FROM GAMERS.\n\n(FINAL NOTE: Dont even attempt to play unless you do your researh first. As of this winter 2015 atleast 4-6 NA servers and 4 EU servers will be merged into 1 NA and 1EU having all those people still playing on those servers losing all their land and having to start anew.)\n","August 19, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/questionetics/recommended/304030/","questionetics","║ QutnC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/questionetics/","115 products in account","Like many others, ignore my play time.  I downloaded this via steam, just so I could write another negative review among the masses, so that it the reviews would reflect the state of the actual game, instead of the Early Access reviews.  I played a Harani on Kyrios, as part of <The Soggy Potato Trading Co>.\n\nPlay as a pirate?  Kill your own faction?!  CARS?!  BOATS?!~?!  I'm on a boat~ I'm on a boa- wait a minute...*\n\nArcheAge had a lot of potential, and I was part of a group of 8 friends who decided to play the game together.  We all got to 50 and had a lot of fun, but it progressively worsened.  There were many problems that Trion simply did not fix, and I'm just going to write them as a list, instead of a wall of text for people to decipher.\n\n1. Bots: After the implementation of needing to be lv15 to use the Faction and Nation chats, a surge in bots appeared, impending the ability to complete some quests in a timely manner.  I took a screenshot of nearly 100 bots in a small area, killing all the mobs as soon as they spawned.\n\n2. Hackers: The most obtrusive problem with hacking exists in the form of claiming land.  Farming crops and trees is a main part of the game, so to protect your plants while you are away, you need to own land in the game.  To own land, you must have the Patron status(which is basically a subscription service), but sometimes people quit the game, or decide to stop caring about the land, and it becomes open to be reclaimed by anyone willing to try.  The problem is that there could easily be 20+ people waiting next to the plot, hoping to be the one to claim the spot, but it will be claimed by someone hacking, sometimes by a toon that is halfway across the continent.  It's a guarantee at this point that you can only get land by hacking or buying the plot from a hacker.  This was a problem before Auroria was launched, to which most land on that continent was claimed by hacking, and it remains a problem many months later.\n\n3. Pay2Win: With the launch of Auroria, came an increased need of a material known as Thunderstruck Trees(can be broken down into Thunderstruck Logs).  These materials were set at a reasonably high price in the economy beforehand.  It was something that only occurred as chance to any tree in the game, but with the introduction of the Rumbling Archeum Tree Sapling, there was a large influx of Thunderstruck Trees in the market, and for a few days, the prices of nearly everything in the economy was unstable, at least on my server.  These tree saplings still exist in the game as something you can buy with real money, and while I do not know how much of a value they hold now, it was just one of many things introduced to create a significant advantage to those willing to spend more money on the game.  Patron Status already had large advantage over free players, because of the Labor Point system.  Coercing players to create AFK macros to stay logged in the game, so they can actually do something in the game that earns in game money.\n\n4. Unbalanced Class System: Something alluring about ArcheAge was the relatively large amount of classes the game has, but in the end, there were only a few viable classes with specific skills needed to survive.  There were classes that could either 1 shot, 2 shot, or 3 shot, anyone that wasn't one of those classes.  While gear matters quite a bit in the game, the class has a much larger influence.  If you're wondering why that matters, then you're simply limiting yourself to less than half the available gameplay, by playing how you want.  Going out to sea, which is roughly half of all existing playable area, would just be you going out to get yourself killed, and probably your ship getting wrecked by pirates or anyone doing pirating activities.  Yes, that's right...  Your ship can #GetRekt\n\n5. If you need a number five, it's there and more, but I'm done wasting my time on anything related to ArcheAge.  Unless someone else were to manage the game, and spend the time to really fix it, it will be a broken, unplayable mass of data.  Occupied by bots and hackers.  Floating in the void of the internet.  If people are still playing this game, they need to #FindJesus.\n\n*That was the only humorous line, in the entire review.","April 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not overly, yet just as much as a connoisseur like me would want to, enough for shaping an opinion.\n\nSure, the company managing it isn't probably doing the best job handling clients/players, also in keeping the game clean from bots and whatnot. Yet I'll not take that too much into account, as I will more try to reflect on what the game itself offers.\n\nThe Koreans have indeed made a wonderful effort here - the game-world is beautiful, so are the models and graphics, the landscape and details. Even the music and the narration are very compelling - I also love the elvish-sounding Korean-speaking NPCs here and there. English ones are awful though, text would have been enough of a translation (would really like the option that I'd get to go full-out Korean mode and change audio language entirely - Asian voice actors are overall and usually far better for games and the like, with voice-acting schools far exceeding the West's).\n\nAs for gameplay, it does get somewhat repetitive, yet the environments and open-world feeling make up for it. I also love the risk and freedom that trade runs and piracy offer. Kinda reminds me of me ol' runescape days, stalking the wilderness. Classes are also varied, and so are the options for character builds. Even though I'd prefer even more of that - Diablo 2 style - it's quite a meaty system here as well, in comparison to others on the market. Crafting in-game is rather significant here, as it should be in an in-depth MMO.\n\nOverall, I love the game for its aesthetics, and really do enjoy the fluidity and varied nature of the whole experience. This makes ArcheAge my favorite MMO aside Guild Wars 2, Mortal Online and Secret World.\n\nAs a game, I'd score this 7/10 - I'm not all that huge on MMOs. :)","February 27","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

World, lore, combat and of course the whole flight/naval battles on a different scale from most other MMO's\n\nThen the accountants got their claws in it. Or it might well have been designed to be a cash cow from the begining. I know MMO's, hell, most games are about getting cash from you but they don't have to ram said business philosophy down your throat. Everywhere you look you're reminded of it. The gathering/crafting system, mounts, gliders, property, ships all require either an immense investment of time grinding in the game or a massive investment of cash.\n\nIf you have deep pockets or a whole lot of time on your hands (though if there's many people with more time on their hands than I, I'd like to meet them) and like MMO's with large scope go ahead but for everyone else, don't bother. Guild Wars 2 has no subscription fee, not even a premium status with perks. The things they do ask you real life cash for are either cosmetic or revolve around increasing your allready generous bank space or numerous character slots. GW2 starts you off with five, ArcheAge two. GW2 you can increase to 69 (though why you'd need that many I have no idea) at most here you can have six across all servers. Plus with the upcoming Heart of Thorns expansion, you need only buy that and get the core game too. They are adding gliders and the return of guild halls means you can have your own refuge from all the terrors of the world without an exorbitant price.","October 12, 2015","false","77.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

(even if some aren't "viable")\n-Generally good playerbase and very fun in a guild/with a group\n-Open world, open ocean, fun to explore.\n-Planting, building, crafting, and trading are all decent fun, as is SPORT FISHING!\n\nCONS:\n-Cash shop and pay to win concerning armor, weapons, etc.\n-Hackers, bots.\n-Grind, grind, grind--never ending grind.\n-PvP is really NOT FUN AT ALL when you're against the pay to win players who are decked out in good armor and weapons and will camp you, steal from you, etc.\n\nOVERALL:\nI truly, completely loved this game for what it was until the hackers killed any chance of farming and crafting, people began paying to win in PvP and arenas, and the playerbase ran for the hills. The game was fun, exciting, and unique. Trion killed it by milking the game for $$$, not worrying at all about the lack of land and server space, and ignoring what we have all been screaming this entire time: BRING BACK THE OLD ARCHEAGE! You know, the Alpha one? Make it pay to play, or just remove that all together. Get rid of land grabbers, notorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and the lack of variety for free to players.\n\nJust give me my game back. :(","November 22, 2015","false","25.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game has fallen far from it's potential.\n\nI joined up late in Alpha and experienced a sandbox with amazing potential, but dated mechanics. The gameplay was fun and I spent many hours through alpha learning the ins and outs of trade and farming. As the game launched, disappointment settled in because the land which was so crucial to success in the game was gobbled up. I continued to tough it out, slowly building up land for myself and alongside guildies.\n\nThen Trion started making a mess of things.\n\nIn a game so focused around the player-driven economy, they continually made choices which turned the market on its head and took away the communities control over it's economy.\n\nLets start at launch. Trade certificates could be bought for cash shop currency. These items are needed to place and maintain your property. Whats the harm? Well being able to buy as much as you could afford in real money allowed the whales to dominate the landscape with massive amounts of buildings from the get go. This also devalued the tax certificates making it really inexpensive to maintain the land.\n\nAnother item...the wagon upgrade. The wagon is the critical tool to making money in the trading game. It allows you to carry up to 6 more trade packs and move at a greatly increased rate, massively increasing your gold payouts. The one item which could put your cart from 4 slots up to the max of 6? On the cash shop.\n\nFinally, there was a rare material used for higher end items like these carts called a thunderstruck tree. It went for 2000 gold at one point. Then Trion put in a cash shop seedling which had an exponentially higher chance of spawning one. Within a day or two the price dropped to 200 gold.\n\nThe game is build on a flawed engine with many security holes, allowing for packet injection. This would not be a problem outside of PvP but it enabled an onslaught of bots and mods to dominate the real estate landscape, ruling out any chance of getting land beyond paying through the nose for it. Time and time again they claimed to have clamped down on this behaviour, yet the suspect land grabs continued.\n\nThis game has lots of potential but because of mismanagement by Trion and a terrible framework it has missed the mark by a long shot. The only reason this game has survived as long as it has is because there just isn't anything solid out yet for the sandbox fanatic to sink their teeth into. Once the rest of the industry rolls out it's sandbox options I would expect Archeage to fade to obscurity.\n\nFor now, I highly recommend not giving Trion your money for this or other titles. They have proven time and again that they are only keen on making a cash grab. No tricks, no traps, right?","March 27, 2015","false","415.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/questionetics/recommended/304030/","questionetics","║ QutnC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/questionetics/","115 products in account","Like many others, ignore my play time.  I downloaded this via steam, just so I could write another negative review among the masses, so that it the reviews would reflect the state of the actual game, instead of the Early Access reviews.  I played a Harani on Kyrios, as part of <The Soggy Potato Trading Co>.\n\nPlay as a pirate?  Kill your own faction?!  CARS?!  BOATS?!~?!  I'm on a boat~ I'm on a boa- wait a minute...*\n\nArcheAge had a lot of potential, and I was part of a group of 8 friends who decided to play the game together.  We all got to 50 and had a lot of fun, but it progressively worsened.  There were many problems that Trion simply did not fix, and I'm just going to write them as a list, instead of a wall of text for people to decipher.\n\n1. Bots: After the implementation of needing to be lv15 to use the Faction and Nation chats, a surge in bots appeared, impending the ability to complete some quests in a timely manner.  I took a screenshot of nearly 100 bots in a small area, killing all the mobs as soon as they spawned.\n\n2. Hackers: The most obtrusive problem with hacking exists in the form of claiming land.  Farming crops and trees is a main part of the game, so to protect your plants while you are away, you need to own land in the game.  To own land, you must have the Patron status(which is basically a subscription service), but sometimes people quit the game, or decide to stop caring about the land, and it becomes open to be reclaimed by anyone willing to try.  The problem is that there could easily be 20+ people waiting next to the plot, hoping to be the one to claim the spot, but it will be claimed by someone hacking, sometimes by a toon that is halfway across the continent.  It's a guarantee at this point that you can only get land by hacking or buying the plot from a hacker.  This was a problem before Auroria was launched, to which most land on that continent was claimed by hacking, and it remains a problem many months later.\n\n3. Pay2Win: With the launch of Auroria, came an increased need of a material known as Thunderstruck Trees(can be broken down into Thunderstruck Logs).  These materials were set at a reasonably high price in the economy beforehand.  It was something that only occurred as chance to any tree in the game, but with the introduction of the Rumbling Archeum Tree Sapling, there was a large influx of Thunderstruck Trees in the market, and for a few days, the prices of nearly everything in the economy was unstable, at least on my server.  These tree saplings still exist in the game as something you can buy with real money, and while I do not know how much of a value they hold now, it was just one of many things introduced to create a significant advantage to those willing to spend more money on the game.  Patron Status already had large advantage over free players, because of the Labor Point system.  Coercing players to create AFK macros to stay logged in the game, so they can actually do something in the game that earns in game money.\n\n4. Unbalanced Class System: Something alluring about ArcheAge was the relatively large amount of classes the game has, but in the end, there were only a few viable classes with specific skills needed to survive.  There were classes that could either 1 shot, 2 shot, or 3 shot, anyone that wasn't one of those classes.  While gear matters quite a bit in the game, the class has a much larger influence.  If you're wondering why that matters, then you're simply limiting yourself to less than half the available gameplay, by playing how you want.  Going out to sea, which is roughly half of all existing playable area, would just be you going out to get yourself killed, and probably your ship getting wrecked by pirates or anyone doing pirating activities.  Yes, that's right...  Your ship can #GetRekt\n\n5. If you need a number five, it's there and more, but I'm done wasting my time on anything related to ArcheAge.  Unless someone else were to manage the game, and spend the time to really fix it, it will be a broken, unplayable mass of data.  Occupied by bots and hackers.  Floating in the void of the internet.  If people are still playing this game, they need to #FindJesus.\n\n*That was the only humorous line, in the entire review.","April 2, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Powygahn/recommended/304030/","Powygahn","[NGC] Polygon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Powygahn/","132 products in account","First of all I'd like to say all the reviews saying it's pay to win are completely exaggerated and more of, Over the top.\n\nAlso I'd like to point out I have more hours into this game than it says on steam. I was running the standalone but it's bugged a bit with windows 10 so I installed the steam version.\n\nThe game at first seems a bit standard normal mmorpg not entierly sure what you're doing or where you go. Boring quests at first but as you get a little farther into the game around level 20 or 30 things start to pick up. You get dropped into pvp zones where you can.\n\nA. Kill people in your own faction\nB. Get killed by people on the other faction\n\nPeople complaining about the fact that they drop you in pvp zones is absolutely asanine. Plenty of mmo's do this. WORLD OF WARCRAFT is a prime example. A game that has lasted many many years and is still going to this day.\nIt's very easy to avoid fights. For example maybe glide away when you see a red name. Or... If you think you could handle it try and attack them! even if you're 9 or 10 levels below the player YOU COULD STILL WIN This game is heavily skillbased and is not 100% dependant on stats and gear. Those help but you can still do damage to someone significantly higher level than you.\n\nLets get into the "Pay to win" aspect. Not once have I seen something remotely close to be even called "Pay to win"\nThe only thing I've ever seen in the marketplace is workers compensation potions (Potions that restore labor) FUN FACT YOU CAN FIND THESE WITHOUT BUYING THEM. No one is seriously going to drop their damn money CONSTANTLY on a game just to get some labor. That's wasteful. You could easily buy patron and get a subscription to pay monthly OR stay free to play and leave it on overnight to gain labor. Once again I'd like to point out you CAN play this game free to play but if you want the FULL expirience. Buy patron. free to play is basically somewhat of a trial or demo. Not all the features are unlocked. Hey at least this game lets you play for free. World of warcraft MAKES you pay a subscription to even GET in the game.\n\nMost of the "Gear" that you think is pay to win. Is usually gear that people have EARNED in game I haven't got that far but I havent seen anything in the marketplace relating to any kind of overpowered gear. I'm fairly certain you need to earn it with honor points. People EARNED this gear. Stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game because you're getting rek't.\n\nNow onto the mob's\n\nThe mobs are difficult later on. Around level 40+ it becomes VERY hard to solo things. But it is possible with a little skill and planning. It's not difficult in the sense that it's unfair. If you're not killing the mobs later on. It's because you are not playing the game right. Formulate a stratagy and learn how combos work, Learn how your class works, And don't just pick darkrunner because you googled "Whats the best class in archeage" and then follow some outdated guide to put your skills into. Pick one thats best for you. Because there is not just one skill rotation you can do. It varies depending on the situation. You have to think quickly otherwise you could mess everything up and leave yourself extremely vulnerable and possibly draw your last breath.\n\nThere is one issue with the game that I have ran into so far..\nBots.\n\nI don't need to explain why bots are a bad thing in mmorpgs I'm sure you already know why.\nBut there neat little things to combat these little pests..\n\n1. Report them (YES THIS ACTUALLY WORKS, YOU EVEN GET A CONFIRMATION FROM A GM THAT YOU GOT A "Confirmed Kill" YOU EVEN GET LABOR FROM IT :D) Chances are they will be banned and their accounts "Stripped of all their gains" according to the automated gm message you get in your mailbox for a confirmed kill.\n2. Kill them in pvp zones. Chances are they aren't prepared to attack you back some don't seemed to be programmed for that so they just ignore you. So you can easily halt them in thier tracks and make them run back to where they were before (Some of them even seem to break, standing at the nui statue doing nothing or running in circles, That will definately ♥♥♥♥ off the bot owner.)\n\nYou can even own a house yes we all know you can own a house in this game. But the extent of cool things you can put in them are pretty awesome. You can even put chests in your home to hold more items in-case your warehouse becomes full. Put some furniture. Have a nice little cozy place :)\n\nIn summary including some other things not listed here is the pro's and cons list.\n\nPros:\n1. Engaging quests and fun gameplay\n2. Huge world to explore, All zones unique in its own way with a small piece of lore in it.\n3. No flying mounts, Just gliders. Flying mounts break world exploration. Why even have them?\n4. Player Run Economy\n5. Cool mounts.\n6. Fantastic Graphics.\n7. Complex housing system.\n\nCons:\n1. Bots\n2. Difficult and "sometimes" unfair mobs/strong mobs later on (I eventually beat them after a few tries)\n3. Frequent fps drops\n4. Connection errors once in a while "The gods have disconnected you"\n\n\nTL;DR\nGame is not pay-to-win and is really fun the reviews are over-reacting gaming elitists.\nBots can be easily dealt with by reporting (GMS even confirm the ban for you in your mailbox within 1 day)\nYou get disconnected every once in a while big deal. Reconnect. Stop whining.\nIs a gud game go download it.\n\nAll in all this game gets about an 8/10!\n\nOne of the best MMORPGS I've ever played!","July 31, 2015","true","484.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","2"

It's all about labor. You get 5 pts per 5 min of beeing online for example to cut a tree or mine you need 10 pts per action with in my opinion makes all the collecteed resources very prized possessions. So it's not like other mmorpg when you just trow garbage away from inventory. Here every item counts and may be used by someone so you can sell it/trade it for gold.\n\nIf you pay 14$ for 30 days you will get 5 labor also when you are offline, but actually it does not matter so much if you just play the game. Here when you play your time counts and actually in auction house you can buy your patron status also for gold. I know when you pay real money you probably get more resources faster but if you dont you still can have everything like others but you need to spend some more time to get it\n\nAbout clases and spells... there is SO MUCH of it. Combinations, combos, items - 14 lvl's of items with everyone need to craft it by their self.\n\nFor me it's a combination of old Lineage II and World of Warcraft. I recommend to everyone.","May 13, 2015","true","840.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Quite a few hours of gameplay have changed my opinion. There is a main story but I hardly paid any attention to it due to the almost overwhelming amount of optional things to do. Typical to any MMO there is a fair amount of character customization to start, then when you get into the game, you can buy your gear for a relatively cheap in-game price or you can scavenge for it or you can quest for it, already you have several options. There are infinitely more side-quests than story quests, and while there are some pre-requisites that are unclear to me, I'm sure if you do all the side quests in your alotted spawn you can find a million other things to do. Want to run trade missions across an ocean or continent? Go right ahead. Want to own a house and live off the land? It's up to you. Want to pull your riches from the ocean through fishing? It's up to you. Want to claim other people's riches as your own as a pirate? Don't let me stop you. You can live life however you see fit in this game, anywhere from a life of crime, to calling the largest castle your not-so-humble abode. It does take a bit of a pricey PC to run on higher graphic settings, I wouldn't even consider this game for Mac users, sorry, you're definitely missing out, but most desktops can run this on fairly decent settings. Even with the lower graphic settings, you're not missing much gameplay-wise aside from the shine of a fresh set of plate armor. The controls can be tough to get used to, but that's nothing new when playing a new game,  there are a lot of things to be understood about some technicalities, but when you get the hang of this game there is no limit as to what you can do, and if you get stuck, the community is incredibly friendly (outside of pvp zones...) and especilly helpful on the forums. I had my friend help me through the first few parts of the game, he has over 120 hours on his account, he's only halfway to the max level of 55 and I'm only a level 18. Neither of us have a house, a boat, and we only have the more basic mounts. There's still so much more to do, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna go get on that.

At its core archeage has great combat and a fun same faction pk system that allows you to pirate your own if you feel the need to. the game becomes a bit like a job if you're not willing to shell out hundreds of dollars to get gear worth having. you'll constantly go back and forth from loving the game and feeling like you want to quit.

This game has improved a lot.  I was around with a few other friends during the closed betas, but the game fell apart at release.  As of right now, only one other person I started this game up with still plays (occasionally).  So why the thumbs up?\n\nThis game's been through a lot.  At launch it was swarmed by DDOS attacks (yes, they were real), bots, spammers, insane queue times, and bad management.  They even took the game off of Steam.\n\nNow, they fixed it up and it's back.  The economy is normal, the community is surprisingly friendly.  There is almost no reputable source of a wiki on the internet, so people communicate!  The game almost has the old WoW feel to it.  There's no dungeon finder, no cheat sheets on the internet, and no cookie cut progression, going out of your way to capture cool pets with good stats.  Yes, it's true that it does have the same flaws old WoW did (some abilities/talents outweigh others by far), but it's a tradeoff.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game.  It isn't nearly p2w as most people comment on, you literally can only but gliders (faster movement), mount armor (so people don't gank your mount as easily), and land (but pirating and illegal farming can get you the same revenue).  The rest are cosmetics.  Tweaked cosmetics with slight boosts, but nothing p2w.\n\nTL;DR - It's worth a shot.  Go for it.

This game has fallen far from it's potential.\n\nI joined up late in Alpha and experienced a sandbox with amazing potential, but dated mechanics. The gameplay was fun and I spent many hours through alpha learning the ins and outs of trade and farming. As the game launched, disappointment settled in because the land which was so crucial to success in the game was gobbled up. I continued to tough it out, slowly building up land for myself and alongside guildies.\n\nThen Trion started making a mess of things.\n\nIn a game so focused around the player-driven economy, they continually made choices which turned the market on its head and took away the communities control over it's economy.\n\nLets start at launch. Trade certificates could be bought for cash shop currency. These items are needed to place and maintain your property. Whats the harm? Well being able to buy as much as you could afford in real money allowed the whales to dominate the landscape with massive amounts of buildings from the get go. This also devalued the tax certificates making it really inexpensive to maintain the land.\n\nAnother item...the wagon upgrade. The wagon is the critical tool to making money in the trading game. It allows you to carry up to 6 more trade packs and move at a greatly increased rate, massively increasing your gold payouts. The one item which could put your cart from 4 slots up to the max of 6? On the cash shop.\n\nFinally, there was a rare material used for higher end items like these carts called a thunderstruck tree. It went for 2000 gold at one point. Then Trion put in a cash shop seedling which had an exponentially higher chance of spawning one. Within a day or two the price dropped to 200 gold.\n\nThe game is build on a flawed engine with many security holes, allowing for packet injection. This would not be a problem outside of PvP but it enabled an onslaught of bots and mods to dominate the real estate landscape, ruling out any chance of getting land beyond paying through the nose for it. Time and time again they claimed to have clamped down on this behaviour, yet the suspect land grabs continued.\n\nThis game has lots of potential but because of mismanagement by Trion and a terrible framework it has missed the mark by a long shot. The only reason this game has survived as long as it has is because there just isn't anything solid out yet for the sandbox fanatic to sink their teeth into. Once the rest of the industry rolls out it's sandbox options I would expect Archeage to fade to obscurity.\n\nFor now, I highly recommend not giving Trion your money for this or other titles. They have proven time and again that they are only keen on making a cash grab. No tricks, no traps, right?","March 27, 2015","false","415.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Quite a few hours of gameplay have changed my opinion. There is a main story but I hardly paid any attention to it due to the almost overwhelming amount of optional things to do. Typical to any MMO there is a fair amount of character customization to start, then when you get into the game, you can buy your gear for a relatively cheap in-game price or you can scavenge for it or you can quest for it, already you have several options. There are infinitely more side-quests than story quests, and while there are some pre-requisites that are unclear to me, I'm sure if you do all the side quests in your alotted spawn you can find a million other things to do. Want to run trade missions across an ocean or continent? Go right ahead. Want to own a house and live off the land? It's up to you. Want to pull your riches from the ocean through fishing? It's up to you. Want to claim other people's riches as your own as a pirate? Don't let me stop you. You can live life however you see fit in this game, anywhere from a life of crime, to calling the largest castle your not-so-humble abode. It does take a bit of a pricey PC to run on higher graphic settings, I wouldn't even consider this game for Mac users, sorry, you're definitely missing out, but most desktops can run this on fairly decent settings. Even with the lower graphic settings, you're not missing much gameplay-wise aside from the shine of a fresh set of plate armor. The controls can be tough to get used to, but that's nothing new when playing a new game,  there are a lot of things to be understood about some technicalities, but when you get the hang of this game there is no limit as to what you can do, and if you get stuck, the community is incredibly friendly (outside of pvp zones...) and especilly helpful on the forums. I had my friend help me through the first few parts of the game, he has over 120 hours on his account, he's only halfway to the max level of 55 and I'm only a level 18. Neither of us have a house, a boat, and we only have the more basic mounts. There's still so much more to do, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna go get on that.

Quite a few hours of gameplay have changed my opinion. There is a main story but I hardly paid any attention to it due to the almost overwhelming amount of optional things to do. Typical to any MMO there is a fair amount of character customization to start, then when you get into the game, you can buy your gear for a relatively cheap in-game price or you can scavenge for it or you can quest for it, already you have several options. There are infinitely more side-quests than story quests, and while there are some pre-requisites that are unclear to me, I'm sure if you do all the side quests in your alotted spawn you can find a million other things to do. Want to run trade missions across an ocean or continent? Go right ahead. Want to own a house and live off the land? It's up to you. Want to pull your riches from the ocean through fishing? It's up to you. Want to claim other people's riches as your own as a pirate? Don't let me stop you. You can live life however you see fit in this game, anywhere from a life of crime, to calling the largest castle your not-so-humble abode. It does take a bit of a pricey PC to run on higher graphic settings, I wouldn't even consider this game for Mac users, sorry, you're definitely missing out, but most desktops can run this on fairly decent settings. Even with the lower graphic settings, you're not missing much gameplay-wise aside from the shine of a fresh set of plate armor. The controls can be tough to get used to, but that's nothing new when playing a new game,  there are a lot of things to be understood about some technicalities, but when you get the hang of this game there is no limit as to what you can do, and if you get stuck, the community is incredibly friendly (outside of pvp zones...) and especilly helpful on the forums. I had my friend help me through the first few parts of the game, he has over 120 hours on his account, he's only halfway to the max level of 55 and I'm only a level 18. Neither of us have a house, a boat, and we only have the more basic mounts. There's still so much more to do, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna go get on that. It's free to play, so what do you have to lose?","August 6, 2015","true","70.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not overly, yet just as much as a connoisseur like me would want to, enough for shaping an opinion.\n\nSure, the company managing it isn't probably doing the best job handling clients/players, also in keeping the game clean from bots and whatnot. Yet I'll not take that too much into account, as I will more try to reflect on what the game itself offers.\n\nThe Koreans have indeed made a wonderful effort here - the game-world is beautiful, so are the models and graphics, the landscape and details. Even the music and the narration are very compelling - I also love the elvish-sounding Korean-speaking NPCs here and there. English ones are awful though, text would have been enough of a translation (would really like the option that I'd get to go full-out Korean mode and change audio language entirely - Asian voice actors are overall and usually far better for games and the like, with voice-acting schools far exceeding the West's).\n\nAs for gameplay, it does get somewhat repetitive, yet the environments and open-world feeling make up for it. I also love the risk and freedom that trade runs and piracy offer. Kinda reminds me of me ol' runescape days, stalking the wilderness. Classes are also varied, and so are the options for character builds. Even though I'd prefer even more of that - Diablo 2 style - it's quite a meaty system here as well, in comparison to others on the market. Crafting in-game is rather significant here, as it should be in an in-depth MMO.\n\nOverall, I love the game for its aesthetics, and really do enjoy the fluidity and varied nature of the whole experience. This makes ArcheAge my favorite MMO aside Guild Wars 2, Mortal Online and Secret World.\n\nAs a game, I'd score this 7/10 - I'm not all that huge on MMOs. :)","February 27","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

World, lore, combat and of course the whole flight/naval battles on a different scale from most other MMO's\n\nThen the accountants got their claws in it. Or it might well have been designed to be a cash cow from the begining. I know MMO's, hell, most games are about getting cash from you but they don't have to ram said business philosophy down your throat. Everywhere you look you're reminded of it. The gathering/crafting system, mounts, gliders, property, ships all require either an immense investment of time grinding in the game or a massive investment of cash.\n\nIf you have deep pockets or a whole lot of time on your hands (though if there's many people with more time on their hands than I, I'd like to meet them) and like MMO's with large scope go ahead but for everyone else, don't bother. Guild Wars 2 has no subscription fee, not even a premium status with perks. The things they do ask you real life cash for are either cosmetic or revolve around increasing your allready generous bank space or numerous character slots. GW2 starts you off with five, ArcheAge two. GW2 you can increase to 69 (though why you'd need that many I have no idea) at most here you can have six across all servers. Plus with the upcoming Heart of Thorns expansion, you need only buy that and get the core game too. They are adding gliders and the return of guild halls means you can have your own refuge from all the terrors of the world without an exorbitant price.","October 12, 2015","false","77.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game has fallen far from it's potential.\n\nI joined up late in Alpha and experienced a sandbox with amazing potential, but dated mechanics. The gameplay was fun and I spent many hours through alpha learning the ins and outs of trade and farming. As the game launched, disappointment settled in because the land which was so crucial to success in the game was gobbled up. I continued to tough it out, slowly building up land for myself and alongside guildies.\n\nThen Trion started making a mess of things.\n\nIn a game so focused around the player-driven economy, they continually made choices which turned the market on its head and took away the communities control over it's economy.\n\nLets start at launch. Trade certificates could be bought for cash shop currency. These items are needed to place and maintain your property. Whats the harm? Well being able to buy as much as you could afford in real money allowed the whales to dominate the landscape with massive amounts of buildings from the get go. This also devalued the tax certificates making it really inexpensive to maintain the land.\n\nAnother item...the wagon upgrade. The wagon is the critical tool to making money in the trading game. It allows you to carry up to 6 more trade packs and move at a greatly increased rate, massively increasing your gold payouts. The one item which could put your cart from 4 slots up to the max of 6? On the cash shop.\n\nFinally, there was a rare material used for higher end items like these carts called a thunderstruck tree. It went for 2000 gold at one point. Then Trion put in a cash shop seedling which had an exponentially higher chance of spawning one. Within a day or two the price dropped to 200 gold.\n\nThe game is build on a flawed engine with many security holes, allowing for packet injection. This would not be a problem outside of PvP but it enabled an onslaught of bots and mods to dominate the real estate landscape, ruling out any chance of getting land beyond paying through the nose for it. Time and time again they claimed to have clamped down on this behaviour, yet the suspect land grabs continued.\n\nThis game has lots of potential but because of mismanagement by Trion and a terrible framework it has missed the mark by a long shot. The only reason this game has survived as long as it has is because there just isn't anything solid out yet for the sandbox fanatic to sink their teeth into. Once the rest of the industry rolls out it's sandbox options I would expect Archeage to fade to obscurity.\n\nFor now, I highly recommend not giving Trion your money for this or other titles. They have proven time and again that they are only keen on making a cash grab. No tricks, no traps, right?","March 27, 2015","false","415.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A massive open world evoking the feeling of "if i can see it, i can go there."\nPlayer driven economy gives the opportunity for your character to have a impact on the economy which makes you feel ever so important, this also has a major downside due to humans sharing similar characteristics to a greedy pig but who can blame people for wanting to sell to make max profit and buy for the cheapest, ♥♥♥♥ everybody else, you need money for dat pimpin patron and gear.\nPVP based game takes the boredom out of quest grinding when you are being camped by some max level enemies, forces you into being productive by making you rage quit and do something with your life. But of course, you can not be  a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥.\nFARMING. Ever thought "man i wish i can play a more graphics intensive farmville" or "dang it, i have no one to show off to in farming simulator", then you have found a beautiful game. Plant flowers all day and sell them = reasonable $.\n\nYes this game can be considered a pay to win game with it being extremely extremely restrictive without patron status and the opportunities for people to swipe for a massive advantage. However, the thing that makes me enjoy this game so much is that you are also given the opportunity to earn patron status with in game money. The best gear and weapons are avaliable to buy with gold, its just a matter of how long it takes you to make that gold. People whining about how its so restrictive may be casual gamers plebs, for this game IS NOT FOR CASUAL PLEBS IF YOU DONT WANT TO SPEND IRL $$$, even if you do spend irl $$ its still not a casual game. This game takes time but it is fun time well spent and the feeling of getting patron for free while others swipe is a reward in its own way. Me and all my friends have spent no money in the game and we have been patron for months already, earning patron with in game money is not hard. Getting the first patron is the hardest but once you reach there its clear skys from there on.\nPeople get angry at pay to win players, but they are the sole opportunity for free players to become patron. They swipe and sell to us for gold. If they are willing to spend $30, $40, $100... whatever, its their money, they can do what they want and its their loss or win in the end of the day.","December 10, 2015","true","570.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has improved a lot.  I was around with a few other friends during the closed betas, but the game fell apart at release.  As of right now, only one other person I started this game up with still plays (occasionally).  So why the thumbs up?\n\nThis game's been through a lot.  At launch it was swarmed by DDOS attacks (yes, they were real), bots, spammers, insane queue times, and bad management.  They even took the game off of Steam.\n\nNow, they fixed it up and it's back.  The economy is normal, the community is surprisingly friendly.  There is almost no reputable source of a wiki on the internet, so people communicate!  The game almost has the old WoW feel to it.  There's no dungeon finder, no cheat sheets on the internet, and no cookie cut progression, going out of your way to capture cool pets with good stats.  Yes, it's true that it does have the same flaws old WoW did (some abilities/talents outweigh others by far), but it's a tradeoff.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game.  It isn't nearly p2w as most people comment on, you literally can only but gliders (faster movement), mount armor (so people don't gank your mount as easily), and land (but pirating and illegal farming can get you the same revenue).  The rest are cosmetics.  Tweaked cosmetics with slight boosts, but nothing p2w.\n\nTL;DR - It's worth a shot.  Go for it.

It's a beautiful world thats somewhat rewarding to discover. With the housing and trading system, most zones are populated with high level players so the world never really feels empty. The crafting system is very deep, but it does rely on RNG a little too much (its a korean developer after all).\n\nBut this game is NOT at all optimized well. Even a high end machine will have some issues. The small # of PVE dungeons are glitched. Housing is a joke because of hackers.\n\nAnd, furthermore, it's Pay 2 Win since the best gear is crafting and with RNG, you need to invest millions in gold.\n\nI wanted to love this game. I enjoyed having my own thatched farmhouse, doing my daily farming and livestock tending. Crafting here and there. Going on trade runs. Trying to hi-jack the enemy factions trade runs.\n\nWhat killed this game for me is its truly shoddy handling by XL Games and Trion. I won't bother listing what they did wrong, as that list is a mile long. Time after time they screwed up the game more and more, because of bad management. I mostly blame XL games, as on the coding side of things, a lot of the issues could have been fixed. I feel like Trion has their hands tied in a lot of decisions as well so I don't FULLY blame them.\n\nBest example of bad management: the day the new continent of Auroria was released, where it was basically a race to build on 1 of 4 spots a castle for your guild, 90% of the playerbase could not log in. So the guilds the got the castle, it came down to luck - and there are people that prepared for weeks to do this and lost out. I stopped playing shortly after. Theyve released some new content since then but I am doubtful the game is much better.\n\nBTW, I played this off steam, so thats why I dont have any logged hours.","May 6, 2015","false","10.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Running on a modified CryEngine, it features fantastic character models, outfits, weapons and mounts. It's landscapes are as vast as they are detailed. The ability to set sail on it's massive, gorgeous seas adds a new layer to the already played out genre. Who doesn't fantasize about being a pirate?\n\nPlayer owned plots are a throwback to days where MMO developers brought a balanced approach in delivering the goods to their playerbase. The community driven market is nothing new but very much welcomed.\n\nAt first sight, it really seems like ArcheAge has the potiential to redefine MMO's for the better.\n\n\n!BUT!\n\n\nThen we run into their atrocious P2W model. This game is a MMO whales wet dream. Sadly this applies to both the PvE and PvP aspect of the game.  As an examle, the taxation on player plots is rather high. Labour (which is required to craft, which is 1/2 the game in itself) is such a transparent cash grab that it's slightly infuriating. Then there is the fact that North American publisher 'Trion Worlds' is terrible at communicating with their community and when they do, they often renag on their word. Lest I mention their biased community support leads found in their forums.\n\nUltimately, at the end of the day, ArcheAge offers VERY little for seasoned veterans of the MMO landscape. However, for new comers to the genre it may very well be the game that gets them hooked. As somone who purchased a 'Founders Pack' which is the MOST I've ever single-handedly spend on a video game, turned out to be such a farce, I'm compelled to tell the average gamer to stay away. If you REALLY need to play an MMO, renew your WoW account.\n\n2.6/5","December 4, 2015","false","133.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had better luck in the European server than the North American servers. It seems this game is all about Marketplace. Some games have one but don't flaunt it. This game takes every opportunity to promote buying with real money. Also, You can't own a farm or house unless you pay to be a patron. I can't understand why the free to play option allows people to have those things. Oh, I forgot, The devs didn't develop enough land to allow everyone to have a piece of it. I can't understand why the devs can't make instances for houses. Other games do. What I mean is that everyone has the opportunity to own a farm or house, they enter an "instance" to go to it. For having the ability to do crafting, farming, building and questing, one would think the developers would figure out how everyone (free or patron) could have their own place to call home. The game had such potential but now I would rather play a game that offers free to play AND allows everyone to own land.","December 17, 2015","false","152.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
