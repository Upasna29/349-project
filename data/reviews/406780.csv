It's not a game, it's not even a simulator -- it's more like an interactive art project someone made for SVA and then figured they could sell on Steam. The music is beautiful, haunting even, and I'd absolutely be willing to pay for the soundtrack, but that's about the only worthwhile part. It doesn't feel like the makers have ever been to a real graveyard, especially not one as old as Boon Hill is supposed to be. Graveyards that old aren't as empty as this game's setting, for one thing; 90% of the "graveyard" is empty space with a smattering of tombstones in small family clusters, even though it's supposed to date back to the 1700s at least. And we're not talking "ruins" or "stubs that are old, broken tombstones, now illegible" -- it's just EMPTY. Lots of grass, maybe a tree, but that's it. Also, it feels like they never finished this "game", since many of the gravestones can't be read -- and I'm certain that's not intentional because they AREN'T blank, they're simply not things with which you can interact in the "game." Clicking on them does nothing. Most tombstones have writing that can be read, some are blank when you click on them, but this third group? Just...not there, as far as the program is concerned. That serves no narrative purpose, there's no explanation for it, and it really just ruins the immersion.  Sort of like that Spanish tombstone with the name of "Inygo Montoya" on it. Har har. Also, the Spanish tombstones? Yeah, they're pretty clearly just English things someone ran through Google translate and then incorrectly typed out. I wouldn't make fun of "stupid Americans [who] can't read [Spanish tombstones]" (that's the translation for one of them) when you can't even manage basic Spanish spelling, grammar and vocabulary. "Mayora" =/= "Mayoria." I assume the same would be the case for the ones in Cyrillic script. I'm not really sure why they felt this needed to be Kickstarted, but good on them for being entrepreneurs, I suppose.","November 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 54 of 70 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","54","70","3","0"

I'd guess that most people on Steam would not be into this sort of thing. You need to be in a certain frame of mind. If you liked Dear Ester - this may suit your mood aswell. In my opinion, reflection on death is a very important thing and it doesn't detract from life.\n\nIf I could ask for one change to the game, it would be to make it easier to know where you are in the cemetary in order to find each and every grave. Right now, there are multiple sections of the graveyard spread out in no overall order. I've visited sections that include Russian gravestones, Spanish gravestones, Asian ones without inscriptions, a soldier cemetary, a pet cemetary, one with two open graves that you can lie down in, and single graves that lie outside of the fences. So it feels very organic, a mishmash of sections. But this has the drawback of you're not quite sure if you visited all the graves. I hope the author of the game can do something to address this. Perhaps a map or marking system.\n\nNote: I've actually played this for more than 3 hours before activating it on Steam.","November 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

That said, I'm sort of wierdly glad this game exists, if only to prove that it's bad idea.","November 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","25","45","0","0"

Definitively the "graveyard simulator", this game burdens the player with macabre conclusions, from finding loved ones lost from disease, fire, and some having perished before their own lives came to be. A few NPC's haunt this graveyard, some more disconcerting than others, some instilling wisdom onto the protagonist, but all a very neat addition to this title.

With grief and mourning fresh in my mind I played Boon Hill for the first time today. While I would have appreciated more structure, or at the least a run button, there is certainly something all too raw about reading fake epitaphs for people who were not real but none the less "died."\nIf you were to put a headstone on a hill, carve a random name into it, make up some numbers, and then walk away, your fiction would become truth given enough time. Someone finding that stone one hundred years from now wouldn't know the difference.\nBoon Hill isn't real, but mortality is. Even knowing this game is fictional can't stop me from imagining a life connected to every headstone I found. When I stumbled onto what seemed to be a section for children, I had to leave. I felt real pain.\nIf you have never known death, I envy you. Maybe Boon Hill won't affect you like it did me. Personally, I felt catharsis, as if fake-grief gave me a respite from real-grief.\nPerhaps I'll come back to Boon Hill the next time I need such relief. I hope that's not too soon.","May 29","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This does not effect my review.Welcome to Boon Hill is a graveyard simulator game (which I had honestly never heard of before playing this). There is no goal to the game; no perilous situations to overcome, no goals to complete that signify completion.  “Why would I want to play this game?” you may ask, or “What’s the point of it all?” Here are some reasons why I think this game is worth your 5 bucks.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that it allows for you to create your own experience. You play as a mysterious boy or girl, wandering around the Boon Hill cemetery reading as many epitaphs (messages on the gravestones) as you please, pondering some and dismissing others. Some may come off as funny, others meaningful, and some as downright depressing. There are hundreds gravestones to read and each message is different with its own meaning. This experience is yours: you may leave when you please and stay for however long you want. While exploring, you will notice the mysterious music; relaxing one moment then suddenly eerie the next.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who enjoy piecing together information that they collect along their way, even if that information does not fit together necessarily well. Also people who want to experience an immersive environment with many hidden insights, tragedies, and stories of success and happiness waiting to be read. If you do not like the idea of investigating the past lives of people who once lived, or walking with no seeming purpose in mind, just traveling from one grave marker to the next, you may not enjoy this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595327665\nIf you feel beckoned to explore a graveyard at any time, or are even remotely interested in visiting a graveyard, you should try this game out! It offers a similar experience, all from the comfort of your home. For only $5, there isn’t much to lose.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game's rating: 7/10.

Would I laugh? Would I cry? Would there be hidden zombies I have to fight? While those concepts were few and far between I came to the realization that the game is much more than what people expect from a “typical” game experience. It’s not meant to apprise to tell any set story but aims to set in motion for the user to create their own experience. To define their own meanings.\n\nAt face value, Boon Hill can seem as if it’s a modest graveyard simulator but in actuality the graveyard is as disparate as it is eerie. The music is fantastic. It absolutely gives an otherworldly feel that sends chills down your spine as you interact within the world and its muses. Though the sound is simply an undertone to the real joy of play which is the diversity in reading the epitaphs.\n\nFrom the start of the game you already know there will be plenty to explore as each epitaph you come across is far different from the previous. Some are silly such as one that was simply “This sucks I’m scared of worms.” While there can be others that hit you right into the feels such as “The sun shall rise and find your eyes filled with tears for me for I know that you love me as much as I hold love for you and with the passing of enough days the tears will dry but each time you think of me know I miss you too.” Boon Hill can definitely surprise you when you least expect it.\n\nIn the graveyard you walk and keep walking. There is no HUD, there are no map indicators, and there are no mission objectives. You venture onwards unknowingly between yourself, some NPCs, and the massive amount of dead that slumber in their graves. What I take from this is that this game is about the representation of our lives. We don’t quite know where we’re going until we cross paths with something we wish to take the time to glance upon. We meet people, see things, both ordinary and unordinary. And eventually we all come to experience the humor, pain, and intrinsic oddities of what death represents to us.\n\nRecommended.","November 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you liked doing that and thought it would make a great standalone experience, Boon Hill might be for you.\n\nFirst off, Boon Hill isn't so much a "game" as it is a narrative-based art experience. If you're expecting any action or a straightforward story, you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe story of Boon Hill is really several individual stories written as epitaphs,  some fantastic, some mundane, some comical. As you travel across the surprisingly large cemetary, stories begin to unwind. Like The Spoon River Anthology which was the inspiration for this game, some of the deceased knew one another in life as friends, relatives. lovers and enemies.\n\nThe idea for the game is intriguing, the graphics look like they were ripped from a Super Nintendo game. It can be fun trying to tie various "residents" of Boon Hill together. This has the makings of an enjoyable, if not a bit weird experience.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without problems. First, it does not appear to support a gamepad. I had to make a profile with JoyToKey to use an XB360 controller (my control device of choice for most games) with Boon Hill. Also, there are some graphical glitches that detract from an immersive experience. Finally, the controls, even with a keyboard ar a bit janky and laggy. You think you're moving your character one way, but he/she ends up moving a different way. I hope that the devs will tighten up the graphical glitches and controls.\n\nStill, the game is compelling. It's only USD 5 and I know I've wasted more on coffee, booze, and junk food many a time. If the idea of wandering a virtual graveyard and reading tombstones at all appeals to you, I think the game is worth you time and money.","November 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Why on Earth would you play a game like this you ask?\n\nWell you quickly find there's far more depth than at first glance. I came to Boon Hill thinking "ok I'll spend about 5 minutes walking around and get bored". Well a few minutes turned into an hour and I was completely drawn into seeking out more epitaphs to piece together the stories of life and death.\n\nThe death of a child, a person that lived life to the fullest, un marked graves, even some funny little easter eggs are all you'll find in just the first hour of play. I feel like there's still more to get out of it.
