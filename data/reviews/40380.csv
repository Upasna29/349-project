You spend as much time in the air as you do on the ground. You can steer your vehicle in the air.\n\nBut hot damn, it's fun. It lacks 2-player support. The soundtrack isn't the best. But the game is a blast to play, and it *does* support my Xbox controller. Try the demo.","November 5, 2013","true","2.4"," 82 of 92 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","82","92","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/40380/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND4r1ApjPrU&list=UUnQL0hzRCQwxnRMV9Nn9i6g\n\nIn Nail'd you will crash a lot, at least in the beginning, maybe even accompanied with some cursing, but you after learn the tracks, both will be reduced. But lets not jump ahead to the gameplay and continue with the options. There are a lot video option (texture quality, material quality, shadows, texture filtering  and so on) to make the game run on slower machines. The game came out in 2010 and I can safely say it looks decent 4 years later.\n\nI was quite surprise from the audio option. You can manage every sound in the game – engine, music in game and in the menus, environment and so on. As a hole the audio is okay. The engines sound okay and the music is decent, fits really well with the game. Also you can adjust the brightness and rebind keys on the keyboard. And honestly, you need to, because by default they are weird. You can play with 360 controller, but controls are absolutely fine with the keyboard.\n\nAfter you set up all the option, it's time to choose male or female character, some clothes for them and atv or dirt bike. For your driver customizations are limited just to clothes, but you can change parts on your vehicle. They are unlocked just by playing the game and they have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe gameplay is arcade. Here the gravity is not the master. What I mean is, you can do extremely ridiculous jumps. And the sense of speed is amazing. This maybe is one of the few games where I don't mind the motion blur. Even if I want to I can't turn it off. In the beginning, before I get used to the sense of speed, I often missed some turns. Interesting thing in the gameplay is the steering in the air and leaning to adjust your jump. In other words – you almost fly.\n\nThere are 4 types of races – single lap, 3 laps, time challenge and stunt race. The first 3 are self explanatory. The stunt race is a little bit different. They are not stunts in a traditional sense. In this mode points are given if you drive through fire gates and circles, make wheelie and few others. And of course, here also matter if you finish in first place and how much you were in front of the other players. That way you can win a race, even if you didn't make enough stunts. All of them give you boost. My favorite way of getting it is to fall down on someone or push them in to obstacles. This can happen to you too. Other interesting thing is the mutators. They are constant boost or no collision.\n\nTo work everything I said about the gameplay, you need really good tracks. This is the case here. The design is great, even the environments are good – village, harbor, forest, canyon and others. Every track have different routs to take, but not all of them are shortcuts. Also in some tracks there are obstacles like falling rocks, but they are easily avoidable and stop being a surprise after a while.\n\nOne of the things I didn't like is the difficulty. I played on medium. The first half of the game I didn't have any problems with the AI. Then the difficulty jumps high for a few tracks. After them I was winning every race again without a problem. But biggest issue here is the repetition. It's kind get boring after a while, because there isn't enough variety. Since this is old game the online multiplayer is dead, but if you have some friends there is LAN, it's such rare thing to see these days.\n\nI never played racing game with such sense of speed and adrenalin. Some compare it to MotorStorm. Even with the repetition, which comes at some point, this is still a solid game. If you have friends to play it gets even better. I recommend it.","October 24, 2014","true","10.4"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","37","44","3","0"

The sense of speed is incredible. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the lack of multiplayer. I did beat the entire first person mode, so if you enjoy a really challenging racer even in a single player campaign? Then you really should pick this one up. The graphics and sound are all great. The music is alright and keeps you going as fast as the game does. You will soar like you've never experienced, in the air nearly as much as on the ground. Learn to control it and you'll be rewarded with a rush like no other. It's a good purchase. Oh, and the partial controller support icon on the store page?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/40380/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","nail'd is one of those games designed to flick all the "HELL ♥♥♥♥ING YEAH!" switches in your brain. Normally when I play a racing game, I'm super serious. No, that doesn't mean I play Gran Turismo, Forza, Project Cars, or any other simulation. I'm a fan of arcade racers like Daytona USA, Outrun 2, Ridge Racer, and so on. All of my attention is focused on making those expertly crafted turns, weaving past my rivals, and powersliding. I don't care about realism, but games that emphasize your opponent's destruction (Burnout) don't do anything for me.\n\nI have to admit, nail'd flicks my switches real good.\n\nThis is an ATV/MX racer, with some vehicle customization. Sim-fans are going to be shown the door immediately, since the first thing they'll notice are stats like "boost acceleration" and "mid-air steering". It's expected that at least 1/5 of the mileage you put into this game, will be spent in the air. Each track is composed of ramps, hills, slopes, cliffs, and other structures designed to get you high. The tracks are also loaded with obstacles such as trees, rocks, trucks, trains, and so on on.\n\nUnlike the arcade-racers I usually play, collisions aren't an automatic restart in nail'd. You're always in the race, and you lose maybe 1/2 a second or so when you crash. However, keeping up with the pack (and winning) requires that you boost. Boost is acquired via certain gates, mid-air rings, perfect landings, wheelies, going fast, and even wrecking your rivals.\n\nThat last one actually doesn't come up very often in a race, which is why I love it. With Burnout and its ilk, the pacing starts to become effected when it seems like every few seconds I'm watching a cut-scene of a burning wreck. What was once awesome, gets really tiring. Knocking your rivals out in nail'd works because there aren't any cut-scenes. Everything moves so quickly that it takes you a second to realize "Did I just do that? Holy crap!" At one point I jumped off a ramp and actually landed on someone, destroying them instantly, I was so freaked out I crashed twice in a row. There are other moments like this, like the time I got so much air I actually rode on top of a hot-air balloon.\n\nnail'd is an extreme racer sure, but it also has a touch of subtlety. It rewards players for doing the unexpected. The tracks are designed to accomodate rather than frustrate, giving racers room to look for shortcuts and opportunities to score more boost. This is likely one of those "you already own this" titles due to its appearance in bundles. Do yourself a favor and give it a go.\n\nAlso it might be a trick of perspective, but the racers in this game have phat behinds.","December 20, 2014","true","2.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

Beware, there's no realism to be found here! The game has a great sense of speed. You can make ridiculous high jumps! While racing, you can earn boost with performing tricks, like flying through a hoop, to go even faster. There's the ability to adjust your vehicle for better speed, acceleration, handling on the ground or in the air. Yes, you can steer your vehicle while flying through the air :) Basically, all the thing you would expect from a game like this. It looks pretty good too and it's also really cheap. You would expect a much higher price for a game of this quality. So, if you are interested in the genre, you should pick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IsaacTheSpinosaur/recommended/40380/","IsaacTheSpinosaur","IsaacTheSpinosaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IsaacTheSpinosaur/","77 products in account","A nice little nostalgia trip,this game appears to be made by the same people as the original monster jam game.\n\n(y'know the one. It was on Wii,DS,PS2 and PC. not path of destruction,urban assault,MTM2 or rigs of rods,it was just "Monster Jam")\n\nOr at least these guys are pretty darn close because the handling is nearly identical,as is the soundtrack. Of course,they use newer songs of the same genre,but put on five horse john's missisipi king and omigosh it is nearly the same game.\n\nOf course,you do not drive monster trucks rather ATV quads and Motor Cross bikes. I can't help but see the bikes as the motorcross before the Monster Jam show,and the ATV's as the Monster Jam trucks,but that's probably from the coincidentally similar gameplay styles.\n\nHowever,the thing that sets this apart from that series is the customization. You can change colors of every part of your rides,making both the bike and ATV have different paintjobs. Then you can edit your driver. Make them male or female and apply one of 8 color schemes. I believe you unlock more as the game progresses.\n\nYou have to make a profile for some reason,which is odd since this isn't multiplayer. However,with the "remember my password" just a simple press of the log-in button can have you racing twoards victory in no time. Again,this was a welcome surprise as it sent me on another nostalgia trip as the (what a shocker),ORIGINAL MONSTER JAM GAME did this too!\n\nSorry for the constant comparison,but i'm seriously curious about all the similarities between this and the Monster Jam game.\n\nOf course,the tracks also show some similarities,some welcome similarities at that! You can fly through the air like in the MJ game,and some of the obstacles are pretty similar.\n\nOf course,unlike that game this time you can feel the power of these vehicles kicking up dirt and rocks,and it's remarkable! A+ on realism guys,awesome job!\n\n\nUnfortunately,there are one or two nitpicks.\n\nFirst off,the hitboxes on the tracks are questionable at best. I went flying under a curved,arch-shaped rock and it said i hit it. Then,i flew past a rock with a tire width between me and it and i still hit it.\n\nI wouldn't mind it if they added a damage system. Not like a performance limiting one such as N'14,but one where you hit something a chunk of your vehicle flies off like in the old MJ game this is so similar to.\n\nBut one tiny impact and your driver and vehicle graphically burst as the screen fades to black,white and grey and eventually total darkness with some splatters here and there.\n\nAnd the respawn takes a whopping 30 seconds of in-game time,meaning one crash can absolutely DEVASTATE your lap time. This isn't uncommon among racing games though,so even if it is a minor annoyance this game isn't at fault.\n\nI also dislike you cannot mix colors and paint jobs. If you put on the "graffiti" one for example it makes the vehicle black and red. I turned the ATV yellow but when i applied the decal it switched the base color back to black! Every paint job i try does this. But that's just my customization freak mind,not a real problem in the game.\n\n\nIn the end i gotta give this game an excellent rating of 5 stars. all games have problems,sure,but this isn't ment to be cutting edge i don't think,i think this was meant as a nice little reminder of some of the great racers of the past,and even the LOADING screen gave me that impression.\n\nAny racing game lover HAS to pick this up,it is a gem in any racing game collection!","October 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The closest I can come to describing the sense of speed is the Burnout series from the PS2 era.

Personally, I wish there was more variety to the game, like with different modes (combat-based, mini-games, et cetera) or perhaps a free-roam mode (what can I say, I loved FUEL). But that said, the core game in Nail'd is still strong and fun for what it is.\n\nTL;DR= If I had to pick: It is a NO for me at regular price. And a CAUTIOUS YES for me IF IT'S ON SALE (for 1 dollar or less). However, if you really like arcade-y, EXtreme-air type offroad RACING games that almost make you feel like you have super-powers, then it could be a (stronger) YES recommendation for you. :)\n\n-----\nedit [03/04/2016]: originally I said "too many races to advance to the next tournament (okay, I get it. it's a racing game, but do I really need to do 18 laps (9 on the same track) to even advance past the most AMATEUR LEAGUE?)"\nI realize now tournament mode is actually relatively short. it's just 6 races, then a seperate cup to advance. (rinse, repeat, and add one more cup for the finale.)\nI was thinking you had to do EVERY race in your bracket, as if there was a glitch in the game. it's hard to explain, but now I see the game works how I originally THOUGHT it was supposed to be.","February 28","false","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Even on 'Hard' difficulty there's no real challenge - get out in front and the AI won't bother to catch you no matter how many times you crash.

Its tracks have massive ups and downs, completely unrealistic verticals - like not just crossing a canyon, but actually diving down into it, and landing it perfectly - and a sense of speed that's unparalleled in the motocross racing genre.nail'd does come with some downsides, though. While the tracks are fantastic and have lots of routes for you to go through, the developers often actually punish you for going too fast or too high, as you'll often crash into stuff in mid-air if you're going too fast.Despite the lack of depth to your racing strategy, nail'd is still a blast and a half for at least a while, and the online play works nicely - if you can find people online to play with, that is. The console versions are fine, but the PC version of the game was completely devoid of players on launch day.Nail'd is arcade driving taken to the extreme. A fun game over all, which engages you tu run and jump at incredible velocities.","March 26, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks gorgeous and runs butter smooth. The handling model is appropriately arcade, with some subtle hints of challenging handling model, namely in the need to rotate your vehicle in the air to ensure a safe/fast landing. The reward for taking that control is that you will get boost added to your gauge for every landing you make that is perfect.\n\nThe level design is pretty awesome as well. The tracks sprawl and are completely populated with tons of set pieces and hazards that make the race even more engaging. All of the tracks also employ sections that completely disregard gravity or the laws of physics, and it makes for some really fun sections of track.\n\nSound design is adequate, and the soundtrack is a pretty solid metal affair. It is in the game directory in OGG format, so that is pretty awesome as well.\n\nTo further the enjoyment, there are a wealth of new parts you can unlock and install on either your ATV or MTX vehicle. The interesting thing, unlike most racers with "upgrades", is that these parts aren't always a clear betterment to the ones you have installed. Each part carries some bonus or some malus with it, so it is up to you to choose the parts that will balance the various characterstics of your ride as you see fit. Really nice depth to tuning there.\n\nOverall, a pure arcade racer with some awesome levels, interesting upgrade system, and great presentation.\n\nGet it for cheap, give it a go.","January 5, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nail'd is garbage.\nI like this genre of racers-- the tricks, the constant speed, the excitement that so many others manage to capture. Why can't Nail'd do it?\nWell, for one, because it's impossible to lose.\n\nEven at the hardest difficulties, I never, ever finished in anything but first place. Even if I constantly crash my bike, I respawn farther ahead than I was before, so it doesn't set me back in the slightest.\nI'd still manage to have fun if I could perform tricks, race to awesome music, or at least race on a decent track, but this is just so... boring.\nThere are no tricks in Nail'd. There's, um... going through gates. Those refill your nitrous. What skill.\nThe tracks are bland and repetitive. There's really not much else to say, is there? I might as well describe the flashlight on my desk. It's black, but the switch is dark blue. It's more interesting than this game.\nThe music's better off muted. There aren't many songs, and they all suck.\n\nIf you consider yourself a gamer of good taste, spare yourself and buy Mad Riders instead. It has a variety of tricks, a sense of speed, a more exciting soundtrack, and pretty maps. Much less of an eyesore than endless desert.","August 22, 2015","false","1.9"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","14","29","3","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rallymen007/recommended/40380/","rallymen007","rally","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rallymen007/","832 products in account","Nail'd could have been an average generic racer if it wasn't for a huge flaw: the driving mechanics.\n\nEverything is unpredictable. The way the gravity will react, the way the vehicle is going to respond when landing after a jump, or even if you're going to grip or not. This makes for a very unpleasant experience, not helped by the amount of glitches. Sometimes you can pull one-wheel wheelies because the engine glitches, sometimes you will crash into invisible walls, sometimes you will crash face first while trying to land, and much more. This is why I can't recommend the game.\n\nThis is a shame, because it has all the basics for an enjoyable little racing game. The graphics are decent (apart for the ugly and nearly headache-inducing shake filter when boosting), sound design isn't too unpleasant and there are some interesting ride and rider customization options. The game still has the same faults you can find on pretty much every relatively low budget racing game:\n- nail'd becomes a bit boring as you start powering through it. The limited amount of tracks (12) compared to amount of races (around 70-80) means you'll be going around the same tracks again and again, which completely nullifies the point of having branching tracks and scripted set pieces. You'll have to learn the optimal line around a track to be able to beat the AI.\n- Horrible, inconsistent AI. The AI will teleport itself, it will drive through you, it will do impossible moves. But it will be slow nonetheless. There are only a couple of near end-game events where the AI cheats enough to be challenging. In most races, it's easy to gain a 5 second lead and never let go of it.\n- Generic locations and art-style. While I did appreciate the mediterranean caricature, the three other environments are painfully generic. Generic desert area with huge rock formations and a western movie styled town. Generic jungle area with mud, too many trees and some wood bridges. Generic snow area with snow covered mountains. Generic vehicles with generic paintjobs.\n\nOn the technical side, since it's running on Techland's engine you'll have to deal with all sorts of bugs and issues depending on your configuration and the moon's phase.","April 7, 2015","false","13.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The worst, by far, driving or vehicle based game of any kind since Desert Bus and Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. The physics are maniacal! You can take a 180 Degree corner at 60MPH on a quad bike, INSTANTLY. No loss of speed, no loss of traction. Just flipped around. Jumping physics are simply hilarious. One minute, you will be going 20MPH, hit a SMALL ramp, and fly a good 300 Meters. The next, Going 90MPH and hit a LARGE jump, you are on the ground 50 feet away in about two seconds. If you get a good laugh out of sheer frustration and disgust as well as mind-boggling stupidity, this is the one for you.\n\nEDIT: Everyone that dislikes this review, go play PURE on the 360 if you haven't already (It's like $5 everywhere you can find Xbox 360 games). It's this.. but not terrible. I'm comparing this to PURE, because the similiarities are simply un-ignorable.

The good first grapics and sense of speed is great and it works fine for windows 7 64bit with no issue. I do have a few issues with the game though despite the good sense of speed sometimes it moves to fast for its own good and sometimes your driver will hit a leaf and crash out. Sometimes he will hit a cactus and live to tell the tale. Slightly annoying. Invisible walls abound inside the track. You wont see them but a respawn be coming your way if you hit one.\n\nGot this for a the Price of $1dollar so I am not complaining. The music is hard rock but I like it however its a little loud on default settings. Other then the invisible walls, and leaves killing my rider its a fun and good looking game.\n\nI do have one other nitpick the pick your own parts for your bike is junk. It takes away at least as much it replaces. Now I understand why they did this its for the online play to keep it all fair. However why even offer it? It seems like a waste and not very well thought out. Also the online portion for the pc is now dead and buried.

It's cranked way up to some ridiculous number, it must be 120-150. Everything has this weird fish-eye look, and the sides of the screen are all stretched out. Whenever you take a tight corner, it gives you this bizarre feeling almost like vertigo. There's no way to adjust it in the options so enjoy! The screenshots on the store page don't make this very obvious so trust me, it's EXTREME fish-eye. Very distorted.\n\nOther than that, this is an over-the-top arcade racer, not a simulation. You'll be jumping hundreds of feet in the air across ravines, over rocks, under arches, and sometimes even around corners. You can control your direction in the air (aftertouch) like in Super Mario Brothers, except in 3D, and you must or else you'll crash. Even then you'll still crash.\n\nI like that you can customize your driver, and you can choose gender. There are lots of different outfit options and paint jobs for your vehicle which you can unlock as you go along. I'm just not sure how much I can play this one with that bizarre FOV setting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/40380/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","The first thing I noticed when starting the tutorial race was the field of view (FOV). It's cranked way up to some ridiculous number, it must be 120-150. Everything has this weird fish-eye look, and the sides of the screen are all stretched out. Whenever you take a tight corner, it gives you this bizarre feeling almost like vertigo. There's no way to adjust it in the options so enjoy! The screenshots on the store page don't make this very obvious so trust me, it's EXTREME fish-eye. Very distorted.\n\nOther than that, this is an over-the-top arcade racer, not a simulation. You'll be jumping hundreds of feet in the air across ravines, over rocks, under arches, and sometimes even around corners. You can control your direction in the air (aftertouch) like in Super Mario Brothers, except in 3D, and you must or else you'll crash. Even then you'll still crash.\n\nI like that you can customize your driver, and you can choose gender. There are lots of different outfit options and paint jobs for your vehicle which you can unlock as you go along. I'm just not sure how much I can play this one with that bizarre FOV setting. But hey it's cheap so if you're looking for something to add to your library it's not terrible. I can't honestly recommend it though. 6/10","April 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Suffers from being not only extremely uninspired, but also just has a severe lack of identity. It can't decide what it wants to be. Not skill-based or free-flowing enough to be ATV Quad Power Racing 2, but at the same time despite the similar lack of control and excessive corridor race lines of Pure, it lacks that title's polish and love from its developers. While most ATV games try their best to be unique in the face of the familiarity of their subject matter, Nail'd is quite content to simply be "there." I can tell there was a great vision for this title in at least a few of the developers' efforts, but something seems to have happened along the way because while it does have those moments where it truly shines, those moments don't last more than a few seconds and are surrounded by stretches of directionless "sameness." Darn shame, for a bit it looked like QPR2's spiritual successor. 4/10, wouldn't recommend","January 14, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music really feels like racing music - not just garbled loud music.\n\nI also like the way every track ends up with multiple paths you can take - but none are obvious "short-cuts" you take to win, which one you should take depends on your racing style (like sticking to the ground or jumping through the air).\n\nThe game sometimes appears on sale for $0.99-1.99 (think i paid $1.25-which is why I gave it a shot).

Anything more and I wouldn't recommend the game.\n\nThe game works well and the graphics/sound aren't bad at all. My main critisisms are with the gameplay.\n\n1. The initial controls are wierd. What should be a single-hand setup is instead made awkward. Why:\na) Up/down is to tilt the vehicle forwards and backwards, while left and right turn left and right. Accellerate is shift, boost is ctrl and brake is Z. So a touch typist uses the three main fingers on the right hand, but only the pinky (for three buttons) on the left hand.  Additionally boost can only be activated when accellerating, so your pinky must be pressing shift and ctrl at the same time.\nb) recommended setup (and i have no idea why this isn't default) is tilt up/down is W/S, Turn left/Right is A/D. Accellerate is Shift, Brake/reverse is ctrl, and boost is space. This configuration feels a lot more "natural"\n\n2) Forced "resets". If you go slightly off the designated "track" it automatically resets you regardless of whether you could recover from it. For example, one section of the first track you get the option to drive on the top of a train, or on the track beside the train. if you choose to drive on top of the train and fall off the side onto the track, it forces a reset. (even though you could have easily just kept driving on the track). This is also the case if you do a jump, and land on a "pillar" for a moment before landing on the other side of the jump - you get reset, regardless that you were still going to make the jump.\n\n3) Arcade feel. This isn't a bad thing, but it isn't really my style. you can extend jumps by tilting up, and you can change direction in mid air. It also puts some small encouragement to doing tricks such as "wheelies" on your quad bike, which isn't something a racing person would do mid-race. It doesn't really add to the racing feel in my opinion.\n\nAll up, the game worked fine and there isn't any significant problems, it just isn't my type of game.","November 5, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics don't make sense, the track design is ridiculous, and most of the things you're going to should be impossible.\n\nIn other words - it's nothing but mindless fun. Give your cortex some time off and let your brain stem take over.\n\nGood music (several licensed songs, well chosen), fast driving, acceptable graphics, easy gameplay once you get comfortable with it.\nWhich will likely take some time - at first you may think the game responds weirdly, and the blurred graphics are disorienting.\n\nStill, once you start jumping down a ledge, down being about 50 meters, or use an opportunity to race atop a speeding train, you'll see the game is well worth the few drawbacks it has.\n(The only real drawback is the lack of online play. Once it worked. Now all that is left is LAN, apparently...)\n\nThe single player campaign consists of a tournament with quite a number of races. Unfortunately the number of tracks is rather limited (14), and several share segments. After a while they repeat, since they're grouped into regions (for the races).\nTo offset this, each race has "mutators", which change the way the race works - for example, in one race you may have continuous boost, while in another you can't hurt another player.\nWhich can be quite a drawback, as the game clearly intends for you to win races, not friends. When someone is trying to overtake you - bump them. Ideally, they crash and you get 30% boost fuel.\nLand on someone after a jump? 100% boost fuel!\nDon't worry for them, as you'll see when you crash (and you will, believe me), all that happens is that you respawn a few seconds later.\n\nYou can customize your vehicle somewhat - by winning races you unlock parts and paintjobs - different parts will give different benefits, so you might want to check that carefully.\n\nThe track design, which I described as "ridiculous" above, is actually quite fancy - it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\nThe tracks are clearly marked - you cannot escape the track, unfortunately - but they lead you across an active train track sometimes, or right through a hot-air-balloon festival.\nOn one track, part of the physical track is held in the air by helicopters even. (They change altitude, btw.)\n\n\nMindless fun.\nFast fun.\nFun.","March 15, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These are my first impressions, but from what I see, the tracks are well designed with a ton of branching paths and extras.  I even had fun during the time trial mode just seeing where each one would take me vertically and horizontally.  The physics-defying maneuvering in the air is  challenging, but not frustrating and the developers seem to have a good idea where the fun is.  It's nearly a cart racer, which isn't a complaint here.\n\nMy only two minor gripes is that I wish there was more customization with drivers and vehicles, but considering I got this for $0.99, it's a tiny thing.  The other critique is in the momentum (or lack thereof) on slopes.  I might just need some practice, but it seems as though you're kind of going the same speed throughout, unless you run into something.  This is obviously not true because you can get to different areas depending on how fast you hit a jump, but there's something in the feel.  Again, both are minor and do very little to stop enjoyment of the game.  Definitely worth the price, even not on sale.  If you enjoy games like "Trial," this is definitely something that is a great waste of a few hours!","March 25, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, you absolutely have to finish the training tutorial prior to having access to these options if I'm not mistaken.\n\nGiven that Windows 10 is sometimes a major letdown for older games... I was surprised at how well this one runs. The resolution goes as high as my monitor and GPU allow. The FPS on here is ridiculous at high resolutions.. Hitting over 300 FPS constantly. There isn't a V-Sync option (at least I didn't notice one)so those with 1080p monitors running at 60hz may see some screen tearing... Just an assumption, I don't know. This is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's fast, unrealistic and fun as hell. Not many graphics options, but that is to be expected with a game from the early Xbox 360 era. I enjoiy it for what it is. If you like games where you can hop on a ATV or Motocross bike, go fast and make outrageous jumps.. this one is for you.
