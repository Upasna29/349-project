Let me explain by telling you the Pro's and Con's.\n\nPros:\n♦ Cheap\n♦ Graphics looks pretty good\n♦ Has Steam Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n♦ Game tries way too hard to be funny that it's lame\n♦ Game content isn't even long enough to unlock 1 Steam Trading Card\n♦ Game crashes if you click the "Work on the Game" option on Day 1\n♦ Game crashes to Desktop if you finish the game with any option\n♦ You can litterally skip everything and get 8 out of 9 achievements in under 1 minute\n♦ You can skip every stage of the game and not watch any of it\n♦ There is only one playable mode and it's boring as\n♦ The main game is soo lame all you have to do is click the corner of a circle that shows in every row of circles (Like it's not even fun or funny, it's just lame)\n♦ The ending for developing the indie game and playing through minutes of boringness is soo lame and unfunny\n♦ No replay value\n♦ Filesize seems like a joke (999.9mb). Feels like they set it to that even though it doesn't have 999.9mb worth of Content anywhere in this game... Only way it could be that big is if it's soo unoptomized it's not funny\n\nIn my opinion this game has an awesome concept with high potential with many aspects that could have been forfilled that weren't (Concept seems to be implemented poorly with limited content). Like, there is soo much more the Devs could have done with this to add to the content, the gameplay and even to make it funnier that they didn't even look at. Instead we got a miniscule length game with limited possibilities and unfunny jokes that all end before it even begins.\n\nTherefore, on a whole, I finished this completely by getting all achievements in 11 minutes and the only reason anyone would play longer is if they wanted the Steam Trading Cards. I don't even know why this game has Steam Trading Cards as I don't see how it could even have good emoticons, badges and backgrounds! Also, I found this game extremely unfunny and boring not to mention broken (It shouldn't crash on day one if you try to make the indie game and it shouldn't crash once you finish it). It is one of the shortest, most unfun games I've played in a while and I'd recommend you only ever buy it if it's free or you really had 89 cents you had to get rid of.","April 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 342 of 393 people (87%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","87","342","393","33","16"

Rearranging that old review and looking back, I find my opinion not to be changed. Sorry, this is not a game.\n\nOk, I'll try not be annoying with this one - but I am annoyed to say the least. HOW THE FRIGGIN' HELL IS THIS EVEN A GAME??? Ehm, sorry for the caps lock rage. It tends to burst out when I remember this particular abomination.\n\nThe 'game' consists of short movie crops made by some 'artsie' movie students - which takes a grand deal of optimism to call as art - , some snarky comments far from being funny and ‘a mini game’ which takes result in meaningless random clicking to win. Yaaay, you have developed an indie game! Is that it? If it is supposed to be even funny, it ends with being insulting for the genre only.\n\nI’d say even with the change under your sofa, this game doesn't worth neither the value, nor the 10 minutes that you will be losing from your lives. Okay, it is as cheap as it can be, but there are actual games that you can play for a dollar in Steam. Make it Indie! is neither creative, nor commemorative and not even fun to play. But it is sure %100 on achievements with some free trading cards for a dollar.

The description on the Steam Store page explicitly asks not to take it too seriously, and so people have mostly jumped in expecting some fun and entertainment. Which the game ... does not provide.\n\nAt its core, this is a (slightly) interactive story, which "teaches" the player how to succeed or - more likely - fail at becoming a developer of Indie games. During one week you're every morning presented with a choice: to work on your game, or rather do something else. If you work on the game enough, and you succeed at the fairly stupid but not that easy clicker-mini-game, then you finish a game and it may be published. Goal accomplished.\n\nIf you choose to other things, you're presented with one out of eight different full-motion video's, which feel like being directed by a decent amateur cinematograph (or first-year student) and are shot in Russia. They contain some nice images, but are mostly unsettling in their vagueness. There's no interaction at all in this part of the game: you just watch and wait (or skip and proceed to the next day, quickly getting all the achievements, but that would completely beside the point).\n\nNow, based on these all-too-meagre contents, it could be a straightforward affair, and I could dismiss this little "game" as  an utter failure. But the game has stirred something inside me while playing, something I've been thinking about. Maybe there is a "deeper" meaning to it, such as: if you do what you're expected to do (working every day on your project, in order to succeed), life is boring as hell. Which, to me, makes sense, and not at the same time. It all depends if you can put something of yourself, of your dreams maybe, into your work. But if you choose not to focus, and to do whatever you feel like doing on a given day, life becomes unsettled, even upsetting. That's where the nightmares come in: every night, there's a short but disturbing dream. Nothing spooky or horror-like, no, just unsettling. It's difficult to describe it so I suggest you just pay the dollar or euro, and go and watch (play) this.\n\nTry to do it with an open mind, not expecting some quick fun, and maybe you'll get the same feeling as I had: that this game wants to tell us something, about life, about dreams; surely in a clumsy and unpolished way, but stll: I feel there is more to it than just "a game not to be taken seriously".\n\nRecommended for the really curious, but definitely to be avoided if looking for some easy fun.","July 29, 2015","true","2.6"," 63 of 86 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","63","86","0","5"

There were a few movies or text between movies that actually made me laugh, as the game even pokes fun at itself.\n\nSome of the movies in the beginning seem to try to stress the feelings you might have being an indie developer, but toward the end they just get very abstract and I think the dev on this game, just went for random strange stuff that people would interpret in strange ways.\n\nMusic probably could have been more interesting, but most of it was in Russian(?), and so I couldn't really understand it.\n\nControls only exist really in the mini-game which consists of you spam clicking.... Really kinda boring and one dimensional.\n\nVisuals - I would have to say interesting, though when you're wondering if something you've seen is the same thing or if it's something different, you tend to start realizing how bored you are because you want to analyze the waking up bit.\nWARNING: while the game says that smoking is bad and features scenes of people smoking, what it fails to mention is that it could possibly cause someone an epileptic fit. While you have the ability to skip most movies, which would be fine if you realized in time, this particular video sequence occurs when you are supposed to be 'developing' the game (read as playing mini-game to beat the game).\n\nWas extremely short, achievements are easy to get...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/357900/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: A game making the point that you cannot make a game unless you devote a big chunk of your time to actually do it.\n\nThere, I spoiled it for you. But then again, Make it indie! has very few actual gameplay features. It advertises that it's a game about surviving as an indie developer for a week. The problem is, it's not really a game about that. It's hardly a game at all.\n\nThe concept sounds awesome. What do you have to do to make it through the week as an indie developer, to push for that deadline? Maybe you'd have to make a timetable and try to manage your time between game development, designing, art work, writing, sound design and also free time and relaxing. Require the player to put that into the right order to come up with the game. Perhaps even require keeping your hunger, exhaustion and focus at bay. Throw in a couple of events you need to take into account, like a birthday party or some special holiday. Voilà! So how's the execution of that anticipation in this game?\n\nIt's poor. It's outright appalling. It's the bare bones of what I expected with fluff all over it. In the game, every day you have a choice of basically two options: either use the time for developing the game or goofing around.\n\nThere are eight kinds of goofing around. Choosing any shows you a video of the developer goofing around: e.g. playing with his cat, being at a party or playing poker with his friends, with no gameplay whatsoever. Then the night comes and you get to see videos of weird dreams. They are potentially epilepsy inducing with all the flashing lights. All in all, no games were developed that day.\n\nI found these videos to be "artsy", in that bad way where you get bored and awkward and feel tempted to skip but cannot in case you miss something interesting. There's some angsty, varying music on the backgrounds of the videos. It varies from heavy metal to eerie ambience to some experimental stuff and unfortunately I liked none of it. At least every video grants you an achievement.\n\nIf you instead choose to develop your game, like you probably should, you get a taunty hint of how meager your attempt is and then get to play a tedious game of "developing". It's the same game every day, just more difficult and more tedious every time because of the horrible music and varying background that camouflages the game pieces you are trying to identify. A cringing sound plays in the background making the experience agonizing (it made me take off my headphones). That seems to be the whole point too: the game developer's life is hard and boring work.\n\nI watched all the videos and played the game through to its two different endings ("bad" and "good" one) in 40 minutes and still have to idle it to get the trading cards if I care enough. It costs just 1 € so you don't lose much anything but time for it. Fortunately, its Store Page itself warns you not to take the game too seriously. My warning is this: it is not a game developing simulator. In fact, there's no game here to begin with.","August 23, 2015","false","16.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I think I may infact have PTSD, I am seeing those dolls in my dreams and they make my cry a bit from the bottom of my soul. This is bad, because this will involve long sessions in the hospital and in front of therapists, but I am sure I will make it through.\n\nOn the bright side however, since I only .39p for this game, it is infact possible to spin a net profit on it through selling steam trading cards, as there is one that is listed at 11p.

Waste time with friends waiting for the deadline or work hard and reach good results.\n\nI cant say that this game would make you happy. To my mind it's main idea is to make you think about you time/abilities/duties. Make it indie made me think over my free time.\n\nIt can be compared to cinema.

It's an artistic expression representing the life a an indie developer. Working on the game option is how you come to a "good ending" but alternatively you can chose to witness 7 days of activities, normal things like watching your cat or listening to the rain. Things that might make you stop and daydream for a while. After each day however, the night ensues bringing with it the obscure fragments of discorded sounds and a malaise of out of focus images. Taking influences from every day activities is a ways of formulating ideas. Drawing from everyday life and dreams is how fantastic creations are made, be it works of art, music or games.\nIt's an important reminder of the developers who have the skills to create but the agony of translating the realms of imagination into a format people can enjoy as a playable game.\nDon't be too quick to judge Make it Indie!

It contains a lot of poorly translated english but that's not surprising considering A) It's an indie game B) it's a Russian game, they were clearly not going to have enough money to get a decent translation performed.\n\nGameplay there is very little to talk about as it consists of a manu that links to several different video clips and a singluar mini-game where you click on one of four segments of a circle. It's very basic but the 'gameplay' section is clearly intended to reflect the monotony of developing a game, this does not make it good or enjoayble however.\n\nClearly effort has gone into this game, however it's also clear that it could have been made in a 24 hour game competition without loosing much.\n\nAs for the fact is was developed using Unity Personal, so what? Unity Personal does not mean that it should not be sold. Games devloped in Unity Personal can still be sold commercially as it says in the license when you download it.\n\nCONCLUSION - 6/10\n\nAlthough I cannot actually recomend this game it is not at all bad for 79p (I assume prices will vary outside the UK) It is very basic but what do you expect for what it is. There is no gameplay but you might extract some pleasure through playing through it once, and if you want some quick cards/achievements then you cannot go wrong.","June 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I thought I'd give it a try so I went ahead and bought it.  I would rather watch water evaporate.  It was horrible.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Instead, I suggest going out to your local store and buying a gallon of paint, and painting it on a wall.  Grab a nice chair and set it in front of the painted wall and stare at it until it dries.  After it's dry paint more paint over it and watch it again. Repeat the process until you run out of paint.  Surprisingly it would be more fun than this game, or actually, it's not even a game.  It feels like I took 49 cents and threw it on the ground and then an bird came by and picked it up and flew away with it.  I feel like I was ripped off.

Good consept, uncomplete result... It also feels exactly like many uncomplete games out there that come with heavy marketing and steep prices...\nSo as a game, its absolutely not worth it... It doesn't have anything, only two possible endings, and each day you actually get to choose between two posibilities, work on the game, or don't work on the game. Whether you make a perfect score on the minigame (which would mean a great result on the game you make) or you barely make it has no difference, in both cases you get the "good ending". Just like this game barely made it, but they still charge you for it...\nIn conclusion, it's either a very good ctirique, or such a bad game, that it becomes a good critique...!  I'll have to downvote it, since either way, it's not worth paying and playing... I praise the critique though, intentional or not!","June 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought I'd give it a try so I went ahead and bought it.  I would rather watch water evaporate.  It was horrible.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Instead, I suggest going out to your local store and buying a gallon of paint, and painting it on a wall.  Grab a nice chair and set it in front of the painted wall and stare at it until it dries.  After it's dry paint more paint over it and watch it again. Repeat the process until you run out of paint.  Surprisingly it would be more fun than this game, or actually, it's not even a game.  It feels like I took 49 cents and threw it on the ground and then an bird came by and picked it up and flew away with it.  I feel like I was ripped off.

The game is VERY short and if you keep\non pressing '0', you can beat it in under 10 minutes. The achievments are VERY easy to get, and saying that you got all the achievments for this game should not be impressive.\nThe game is surprisingly cheap, and it justifies it's price quite well... even though I bought it for 80 cents yesterday compared to the 99 cents it actually costs.\nI would also like to say that visuals are quite nice, and though I don't like FMV games, the real-life footage is REALLY good.\nHowever, the gameplay is  VERY  weak. You would think the main course of the game is developing games, but developing games is more like a puzzle your school gives when you have nothing better to do; it's engaging, but after you put some pieces together, you just don't want to finish it.\n\nVERDICT (for those who are too lazy to read what I've wrote):\nMake it indie is surprisingly cheap, has great visuals, and an engaging idea.\nHowever, to justify the 99 cents and the (what feels like) VERY short development time,\nthe gameplay is sadly dull and you can beat it in under 5 minutes...\nwhich would explain my extremelly short play time.\n(also the fact that this was released on April Fools Day should make anyone buying this feel violated)\n4/10","April 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
