I mean, look at him. He's kind of creepy looking - especially if you don't have a fondness for clowns.\n\nBut after talking with the developer and reading up on Dropsy's creation... I fell in love. I played the side game that put out for a game jam (Dropsy and the Black Lodge) and that just cemented this character for me.\n\nHe's an innocent. Probably one of the only pure innocents I've ever run into in gaming.\n\nI don't do a lot of standard reviews of games (and this is my first on Steam), but I love this game enough to write this.\n\nI honestly am not sure what to say that doesn't just sound like me gushing about Dropsy. So... I'm going to gush.\n\nThe audio is fantastic. The soundtrack helps set the mood (and the Dream-world tracks... some of my favorite).\n\nThe hand-drawn animation just fits. The first time you see Dropsy get excited because someone likes him, when you go to hug someone and they accept the hug... I'm actually getting a little emotional just thinking about it.\n\nJay does a fantastic job of including humor in the game. The emotional scenes hit you right in the feels. The laughter is contagious. And even the frightening gives me goose-bumps.\n\nControls are fairly standard Point-n-Click.\n\nThere is nothing written in the game. The visual method that characters use to communicate can take a little getting used to, but it's laid out simply enough that even a child can understand it.\n\nIt's not often that a game comes along that can literally be appealing to kids and adults, but my nine year old son is just as excited to play with Dropsy as I am.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Go start hugging!","September 10, 2015","true","10.0"," 204 of 251 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","204","251","11","0"

As a metaphor of the climate of hate and incomprehension in a post-9/11 world. Serving as an acid critic to the globalization and the current U.S. policies. But also as a love letter to two of the greatest American cultural contributions in the form of classical Hollywood cinema and Jazz music\nThe world completely changed after the terrorist attacks occurred on 11 September 2001 in New York. Leading us to an increased militarization in the western countries, now obsessed with the idea of security. So consequently, the artistic and cultural manifestations also changed, including videogames. A generation which grew up with cute videogame mascots was followed by a new generation of children playing realistic war simulators. While they saw tragic news on television, talking about the devastating consequences of the Irak War. It’s not a coincidence that in a country like the United States, where so many young lives were lost in the Irak War, Call of Duty became the best-selling franchise. In the New World Order raised from the ashes of the 9/11, the war was seen as an everyday routine.\n\nI also think that it’s not a coincidence that a game like Dropsy was launched in the same weekend of September 11. Given that it’s a work surrounded with a pacifist message, talking about the act of giving our unselfish love to others as the only  possible means to make the world a better place, mitigating the intolerance by trying to not prejudge other people. It’s easy to see in the cheerful and lovable clown Dropsy a mirror of all the Muslim people resident in western countries that were judged as potential terrorists in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11.\n\nWith a lot of its contemporary games relying in the idea of violence as the only possible means to defend our countries and using an ever increasing level of realism, in Dropsy we have our hugs as the main tool for interacting with other characters, trying to bring happiness to other people’s lives. And it departs from realism, sculpting an intentionally surreal world with some dreamy landscapes reflecting Dropsy’s traumas that seem taken from a Dali’s painting mixed with LSD.\n\nDropsy is clearly inspired by Yoshirou Kimura’s Chulip, one of the all-time best adventure games. Prior to the creation of Chulip, Yoshirou Kimura was one of the co-founders of Love-de-Lic, a Japanese studio that was responsible for some of the most creative games in videogame history. With Chulip being the consummation of Yoshirou Kimura’s principles regarding art creation.\n\nChulip, like Dropsy, was a game based in the idea of help other people with the final objective of give a kiss to every single character. So like in Dropsy, all of its puzzles were centered in how to win the confidence of the city inhabitants until we may be able to kiss them.\n\nThe subtle difference between Dropsy and Chulip comes in the form of its ambience and artistic and intellectual references. Chulip was envolved with a tinge of sadness and melancholy, highlighted by a palette with a tendency to ocre and brown tonalities. Its universe was so quirk as the showed in Dropsy, but another type of quirkiness. With cute characters more close to the perverted habitants that you could find in Austin Jorgensen’s Lisa. An the use of narrative in Chulip evokes the cruel society found in Charles Dickens’ novels, with a component of social criticism resembling Akira Kurosawa’s films such as Dodes’ka-den or The Lower Depths.\n\nDropsy is more like the luminous and warm opposite to Chulip. Its colorful palette takes its inspiration from Tim Schafer’s classic adventures in the vein of Day of the Tentacle, suggesting 60’s cartoons. At a first glance, some of its characters may seem a little disturbing. But all of them hide in his interior a kindness and friendly part waiting to be discovered. Dropsy, like Undertale, is a perfect antidote against all the skepticism surrounding the 21st century. A warm damp hug given to neutralize the nihilism.\n\nIf in Chulip the Akira Kurosawa’s social films were an obvious inspiration, Dropsy looks directly to Charles Chaplin’s first silent movies. Showing the same wise combination between tenderness and dramatic elements. Like Charles Chaplin or Takeshi Kitano in some of his first movies, Dropsy’s creator Jay Tholen has the magical ability of generating vivid emotions in the player, making you pass from crying to laughing. But most importantly, Jay Tholen shows the same talent as Charles Chaplin in the creation of a mise-en-scène. By disposing visual elements with a narrative focus in every shot. By evoking a lively environment through the interaction of these visual elements. And by providing accented expressions to his characters. With a narrative constructed only through the use of images, Dropsy becomes a love letter to classic silent movies. Resulting in a touching experience that it will be able to draw an immense smile on your face.\n\nDropsy also serves as an acid social critic to the globalization. And like Charles Chaplin’s films, it introduces subliminal messages for the construction of a more equitable world, eradicating any type of intolerance. In one of its more emotive fragments, we can see a woman in a church predicating against minority groups. Outside of the church, in an adjacent street, we can see an elderly woman begging for food. When Dropsy gives a sandwich to her and after and emotive hug, she will retire to an isolated corner with a crucifix to praise the Lord. Showing the true meaning of christianity as a religion about giving our love to others, trying to not discriminate those people with personal beliefs that are different from ours.\n\nLike Hylics, another videogame masterpiece created by Mason Lindroth and also a sole-man effort, Dropsy shows an extreme level of detail in its animations and backgrounds, with thousands of small and subtle details. An ambition emphasized by its open world structure, with a cycle of day and night altering the interactions with other characters. In both creations, Dropsy and Hylics, is easy to perceive the seminal influence of Bill Plympton, one of the greatest American independent animators.\n\nAnd its soundtrack composed by Chris Schlarb envelops its world with a groovy Jazz feeling, that serves to sculpt an idealized postcard of the American culture.\n\nDropsy is one of the best indie adventure games ever created. And an emotive art piece that equals other instant classics such as Kentucky Route Zero, Why Am I Dead at Sea, Botanicula, Gemini Rue or The Last Door.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/274350/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Dropsy is a point and click adventure game with a really interesting pixel graphic art style that was released in September 2015, being developed by Tendershoot and A Jolly Corpse.\n\nIn all good point and click style, Dropsy is a confusing yet very entertaining adventure game. The game’s puzzles and game world environment are all extremely interesting to explore and solve. Following the trend of classic point and clicks, some of the puzzles make no sense what so ever and you will be resorting to the help of forums and wiki posts to progress without wanting to spoil too much of the surprise. Dropsy the clown only wants to help people, as you wander around the modern day world solving small puzzles for anyone you come across, all you want in return is a simple hug. It has a very creepy vibe throughout the whole game that is portrayed excellently through the main character, Dropsy.  Very early on in the game you assemble a party of three other characters, these are a dog, a bird and a mouse. These other party members can be used to complete puzzles, find more items and explore parts of the environment that Dropsy would not otherwise be able to do himself.\n\nThe art style in Dropsy is gorgeous. The pixel art style that takes you back to yesteryear showing off exactly how you pull of the pixel graphics to a very high standard. The game’s animation of all the character is splendid too, with not one wrong move being seen throughout. You will also be very creeped out by a lot of the art in the game too; some of it is very trippy, a lot of it has a really dark feel to it whilst being in a very colourful scheme, but this fits very well with the main character being a Clown though. The art is definitely my favourite aspect of this game.\n\nEven though the game does not have any spoken English dialogue, you are still able to get a grasp of the game’s plot. It has some very sad and tragic undertones, whilst also being bright and cheerful at points too. Most of the game’s story is portrayed with the use of thought bubbles above character’s head. I thought this was a very interesting way of getting the plot across to the player as it leaves a lot of it up to the player’s imagination as well.\n\nDropsy was a very difficult game to complete; I think if I didn’t have the aid of a walkthrough at times I probably wouldn’t have been able to complete it. Some of the puzzles and solutions are just fundamentally whacky and I really don’t see how anyone could solve them without some sort of prior knowledge of the game. Throughout the game, you will also have the opportunity to collect lots of collectable items as well, this adds to the game’s longevity and offers a little diversion from the main plot when you need a bit of a break.\n\nI finished Dropsy in just under six hours; this was with completing the majority of the side puzzles for the citizens of the town on top of collecting the other items as well. The game is split into 5 chapters as sort, the first four chapters take about an hour each to complete, whereas the last chapter is more or less just one long cut scene with very little interaction being needed at all. There isn’t any real replay ability in the title as the ending will be the same whatever, but there has been points which you can change the reaction of some of the characters in the latter stage of the game, depending on how you treated them on your play through – whilst this may not be a massive change on the game, it may add a little replay ability for fans of the point and click genre.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems during my play through, there isn’t a tutorial in the game, but if you have some knowledge of point and click games, you will be able to work it out very quickly as the inventory and controls are all the same.\n\nDropsy is one of the better point and click games I have played in recent memory, with a very exciting but sad story on top of some beautiful graphics and art style. The game’s low price of £6, 99 should be considered a bargain given the production values on show here. I cannot recommend this top notch indie title enough.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The pixel art is detailed and beautiful like a watercolor painting. The puzzles are challenging enough to make you think and feel rewarded when you solve them, but not too hard so you feel frustrated. The story in this game is one of positivity and redemption which isn't very common in most games, so it's nice to have this heartwarming plot to play through (completely told through images, impressively). Finally, Chris Schlarb's msuic in this game is fantastic and I would reccommend anyone who can afford it, to purchase the "Warm Damp Hug Edition" of this game.\n\nOne of the best point n' clicks I've played in a long time.","September 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","53","63","2","0"

Dropsy is a heartwarming and beautiful game, with some really creepy moments.\nAs the title says, this is a hugventure. And it really is. If you would just complete the main riddles, the game should be pretty short. But it feels like Dropsy's actual goal is to make everyone happy and so it is the thing you will do most of the time.\n\nWith that in mind, the whole character of Dropsy is wonderful and I always just wanted to hug everyone. Especially that lil dog that follows you the whole time (One of the cutest game characters I know). The soundtrack is fitting perfectly into it. While it can be very creepy, or sometimes different, it always fits to the cuteness or creepiness of the game. Followed by the wonderful art, that can only be described as the very best pixel art since the old Lucas Arts adventures, this game should be considered not just a game, but pure art.\n\nI will definitely play this again and can already say, that this is one of the best games of the year. If it isn't even my favorite.\n\nJay Tholen, you are great! Please don't let this be the last thing we see of Dropsy and his sidekicks, because it was just too great to be the end.

Whereas other publishers would see a point and click adventure game about a functionally illiterate clown man who only wants to be loved and run the ♥♥♥♥ in the other direction, Devolver Digital charges headfirst towards it, eager and willing to be the recipient of terrifying damp clown hugs. Even if, so far, the reaction to Dropsy has been a little less than lukewarm.\n\nDropsy is one of the weirdest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games I've ever played. It plays a lot like an old school SCUMM-VM title with all the modern user interface conveniences thrown in, and that's a big ♥♥♥♥ing plus - you can look the part with the beautiful '90s era pixel-art scenery, but you don't have to go all in and start forcing players to play with a verb bar that takes up 35% of the screen. A lot of the fat has been cut out and it allowed me to focus on what mattered - figuring out what the ♥♥♥♥ to do with half of my inventory to EARN THOSE WARM DAMP HUGS.\n\nEarning those damp hugs, though, is not entirely easy, and it's partially due to the fact that the game is centered around a character who is functionally illiterate. And that's a big plus - in order to figure out what I had to do next, I had to disabuse myself of my inclination to focus on the language and pick up on the details surrounding the game. It alienated and made me feel like a tourist! But even then, a lot of the time I was wandering around, trying to figure out what to do next while feeling really stupid, like I did with classic point-and-click adventures. Some of it was due to my own incompetence, but I feel I can pin some blame on the game's idiosyncracies. The daytime/nighttime system feels like an inconvenience and I felt it could have been left out without sacrificing too much of the dynamic feel of the world. Some of the puzzles just felt too plainly obscure, and the developer saying something to that effect in the game forums kind of cemented my suspicions. If I were a veteran of these kinds of games, I probably would have had no problem, but I'm not, and I felt kind of lost.\n\nAlong the way, you can do all sorts of side-quests where you are able to hug people, kind of like an open-world game system where you figure out solutions to people's pressing dilemmas. One in particular, in fact. One where there's dragons and swords and vampires. I forget what the name of it is. Starts with an S. I know some people modded their anime waifus into it.\n\nOh, yeah! Skyrim! This game is like Skyrim, but with hugs.","September 14, 2015","true","5.6"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","55","72","8","0"

It avoids the pitfalls most adventure games blunder into by maintaining sensible item usage and keeping main progression requirements clearly communicated to the player.\n\nDropsy eschews words and instead utilizes symbols for all interactions, allowing the game to be enjoyed without language barriers. It's obvious a lot of effort went into symbol usage, they're intuitive and make characters' reactions both powerful and immediate.\n\nIt's really impressive how rewarding and touching it is to help (and subsequently hug) all the downtrodden inhabitants of Dropsy's island. There's sad moments, and grim realities, but Dropsy never lets it get him down or prevent him from trying to cheer up those around him. While animals instinctually know Dropsy is a good person, it can be a lot of work to get people to realize the same.  It's worth it.\n\nI love the visuals, Dropsy's animations are exagerated and very expressive, ideal for its cartoonish world. Locations are vibrant and visually interesting. Lots of great details, and the npc designs really shine in this world.\n\nThe audio is fantastic and varied, often settling back into jazz compositions that coupled with Dropsy's pleasant interactions creates a very chill, feel-good vibe.  There's a number of dream sequences, each with unique variations of Dropsy's theme, that I'd just stand still and listen to for stretches.\n\nDropsy isn't a super long game, but if you want to discover all the secrets of Dropsy's world and hug all its inhabitants you will definitely get a great time value for your purchase.\n\nIf you like adventure games, you should definitely pick this up. Honestly, unless you absolutely hate point and click gameplay, you should think about getting this game.  It's worthwhile.","September 11, 2015","true","14.3"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","0"

I loved everything about it. It has an original character in Dropsy the clown, who just want to help and befriend people, to make them happy. He is not alone in his quests and as his story progresses he will go through some challanges and grow as a character.\n\nThe interface of the game does not contain any text, no any that you can read in some known language anyway. You'll have to make sense of pictograms, which is presumably how Dropsy perceives and/or senses people's (but not only people's) feelings/ needs/ mood. There are some other clever mechanics at work here, since you can use your companions to assist Dropsy in his quests and additionally Dropsy can hug almost everyone and everything!\n\nThe game for the most part had quite a feel-good vibe going for it. The story will take some darker paths, eventually but there is always something positive or upbeat and it tries to never leave you in absolute depressive or bad mood.\n\nThe puzzles are logic and most of them are of easy difficulty. The game's world and many characters are quite weird (in a way that reminded me of the classic LucasArt's Sam 'n Max). The story is interesting and it will leave quite an impression on you.

The story follows Dropsy, obese depressed clown who is hated by all people around. He can rely only on his irksome father, and his dog, that is his partner from the beginning.\n\nThe game plays on an island that might feel huge for most players - you might have got used to splitting adventure games into acts that plays on different locations, but Dropsy does it differently. From the beginning of the game, whole island (many scenes!) is available to you to wander through.\n\nThis fact also comes with obvious consequence - the difficulty gets a bit higher in comparison to other current adventure games. There'll be parts where you get stuck but it's up to you then if you'll try to solve everything with peace in mind, or check a walkthrough - there's a great Steam walkthrough made by Morrinn.\n\nLet's make a small rollercoaster of impressions, there's actually one thing that makes the game easier from the others - you can't combine items in your inventory! But on the other hand, you won't be controlling only Dropsy the clown. You will be switching between Dropsy, his dog and later also between his new friends - mouse and a bird.\n\nWhole presentation of the game shows big emphasis of adventure gamers' nostalgia. It's not just about pixelart graphics (which are awesome) but also about the small details like the slow animation for checking the inventory. It's annoying, especially when you're stuck and trying to find out what to do, but nostalgic.\n\nThe game plays a lot on your emotions, as you'll have to feel a lot of hatred from all people around, which you can fix by hugging everybody... or not. They might reject you, which makes you feel even worse. A big mention also deserves the soundtrack of the game, because it's brilliant. There are many great sad and happy tones that you'll love.\n\nConclusion:Even though Dropsy is shorter than average point and click adventure game (~3 hours to finish the game, though if you'll be getting stuck, expect more), it's a great adventure experience that's worth recommending, for its speechless story (all dialogues are driven by pictures) and for the atmosphere that brings great impression.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 10","true","4.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","4"

So in case you’re afraid of reading, since this is what you usually do in a classic point and click adventure (and of course pointing and clicking … Duh), fear not!\n\nStoryFrom the looks of it (since there’s no text remember?), Dropsy, the ugly but loveably Clown, becomes an Outcast after a fire burns down his Family’s Circus and he’s now on his Quest, with his trusty Sidekick Dog, to uncover the truth in order to clear his name.\n\nGameplayYou point. Then you click.\nMoving on!\nJust kidding. Well alright yes you do point and click in order to move or interact with objects, animals or people but that’s not only it. First and foremost. No one likes you. Let that sink in for a second. That’s a terrible feeling isn’t it? That’s exactly why you have to make everyone like you again so you can hug them and become friends. Might as well tell you folks that you can literally hug everything. You can even hug a tree and become a tree hugger! How cool is that!?\nThere are also a bunch of puzzles you have to do in order to do so. But not only that. The game features actual Time. By that I mean there’s some stuff only happening at Night, be it specific People showing up or else and some only show up when the sun’s shining bright.\nRemember the part about this game not having any text? Yup you have only images that give you some clues.\nSo that might be confusing and even a bit frustrating at first but you’ll get the hang of it pretty quick.\nI guarantee it.\nOh and it’s an open world game. Sorta. Well you can decide for yourself on how you want to tackle this game and what you do want to do without anyone holding your hand or following a linear story.\n\nVisualIf you’ve read any of my other Reviews before then you might know that I absolutely love Pixel games. I just adore the art style. There’s just so much detail in this game it’s unbelievable. Not only that but also the amount of color that has been used … Just gorgeous.\nIt really looks like it’s alive and breathing.\nAbsolutely stunning. Every character looks unique and was created with so much love and details it’s really fantastic.\n\nAudioThe Music is stunning. Brilliant. And so, oh so fitting! It’s creepy where it has to be creepy, uplifting where it has to be uplifting and overall just perfect. I mean remember … no text. So the music in this game is key for atmosphere and just the general gameplay.\nI have to give a shout out to the Artist right here.\nThe game features over 50 minutes of live music composed and performed by Chris Schlarb[schlarb.bandcamp.com].\nI’ve stumbled upon him some time ago, actually ages and just enjoy listening to his music every now and then.\n\nWhat else can I say?Not much. Or maybe too much.\nIt’s a game for everyone. I really mean it despite it being creepy here and there but you can let your Kid play this game or just enjoy it yourself.\nI stumbled upon this game by chance and after watching the trailer and seeing it’s been published by Devolver … well I was sold and I don’t regret my decision to buy this game at all.\nIt’s truly something else especially in the point and click genre.\nYou could throw certain words at this game like crazy, unique or psychedelic and you would be right.\nSo what are you waiting for?\nGo on forth you Clown and hug everything!","September 10, 2015","true","4.5"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","1"

The art and music are top notch, and the game is full of heart all the way through.\n\nThe annoying parts of old adventure games are absent - there are no puzzles requiring you to use non-sensical things to progress; instead, you're given cues through "conversations" had entirely with icons and unintelligible sounds. And the majority of the puzzles are working out how to solve problems for forlorn characters, who reward you by letting you give them a hug. A weird, wobbly, greasy hug, but a geniune one.\n\nThe ending is a bit of a crazy twist but it's a perfect capstone for the game.

(Oddly enough, one of the interaction icons is a hand.) So Dropsy must travel through the town and countryside, restoring his good name as he gives hugs to any and all, resolving their many issues along the way. But Dropsy is not alone, travelling with his (dog with a snout? pig?) who pees where he goes, gaining the same rewards as Dropsy's hugs.\n\nThe player can control either Dropsy or his pet at any moment. There is little prelim info offered, but additional options are hugs (people, squirrels, trees rocks, you name it), inventory (as he reaches down into his pants) and settings/saves. There are two others I have yet to obtain. This is a land of mostly unhappy people, with sadness of their own. The sad people have no time or use for Dropsy, so Dropsy must solve their problems as best he can, in order to give them his trademark hugs.\n\nThe problem is that there are no words or speech in this land; all is told in pictures. Even sentences (of a sort) are related in little pictures, so the intent is usually vague. But mistrust of Dropsy is never vague, and his feeling are crushed often. Yet he never quits, working day and night in an interesting system that tells you where you currently are in a 24-hour clock. Some tasks can only happen during one or the other, and Dropsy must sometimes sleep, even though the result may be horrifying dreams about blood, or his deceased parents.\n\nI'm enjoying Dropsy enough so far as to justify its price. The OST seemed a bit steep at $10US, so I passed. Actually, the music included is more than serviceable, and I'm enjoying it very much. (Still, if I could justify the expense, and the OST is of the quality of the rest of the game, I'd be inclined to say "Go for it!)\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not recorded.)","September 12, 2015","true","11.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/274350/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Dropsy is a Point and Click centered around the adventures of the world's most horrifying clown. It starts off with you making your way out a burning tent only to later awaken in a bed realizing it was a dream. Even so you will quickly notice that the actual world is just as weird as your dreams and everyone in it is depressed. It is up to you to bring joy back into their lives, shockingly enough for such an evil locking clown. Your only real means of interaction is opening up your inventory and mashing an item into an object or person in hopes of some kind of result. Dropsy has very little in the way of hand-holding and no tutorial so it is up to you to explore this pretty large open world in search of random objects that may lead to opening up a new area or just making someone happy.\n\nSounds simple enough but there is not a single word when talking to characters instead they talk in a made up language and express themselves via speech bubbles containing a vague few pictures in them. It is up to you to decipher what is ailing them and finding some way to put a smile on their face which can range from giving them a simple hug to finding their father. It is easier said than done as you will gather up quite a bit of items in your inventory in no time and the solution is very rarely near the target. There is no way to lose, get hurt or die in this game so it is all a matter of patience and brain power. Fast traveling is unlocked near the end of the game and only then for a brief time meaning you will spend a lot of your time walking around to your destination. It is both a blessing and a curse as you will often times find something you missed your first time going through yet it does get slightly irradiating as Dropsy is move fast and the world is pretty large.\n\nAccompanying since the beginning will be your loyal puppy that is equally as creepy as Dropsy. He will follow you wherever you go and can dig up items as well as sniff out important objects. Two more pets will join you as the game progresses. A mouse to fit into tiny areas and a baby bird to reach objects that are out of reach. You can control any of them at any time so if you are stuck it is likely you are not examining the area closely enough for things seemingly insignificant things like a crack in the wall or a vent. These extra skill sets available to you make the game feel far more involving as you are not just looking for an item but how to best utilize your characters in the environment you are in. The world itself is quite odd featuring downed planes, vampire hunters and aliens. Though this is a game about playing as a 500 pound demonic looking clown out to hug everything from trees to said aliens so I guess it's to be expected.\n\nHugging people and making them happy rarely have any benefits for you other than the occasional achievement or important item. At the start everyone hates you but as you make them happy the only thing that really changes is them having a smiley face speech bubble when you pass by. Dropsy features a day and night cycle that has time advancing as you switch between areas. Different events occur during the night so it's not just a meaningless feature and can be the clue to solving a problem if you are stuck. There are a few beds scattered around the world that allow you to pick what time of day you want to skip to but they are far between and a simple wait for X amount of time option would have been preferable. Speaking of options the menus also follow that no text rule meaning it is just a weird mess of symbols annoyingly enough. You can save the game using the floppy disc with red arrow symbol which is useful to know if you don't want to rely on the autosave feature or want multiple saves.\n\nMusic ranges from jazz to other solemn melodies that makes the grim world of Dropsy feel even more strange and  depressing. I'm sure there is a story that surely puts meaning to this madness but it completely flew over my head and I left probably even more confused than when I started. Puzzles are simple enough though often times obscure in what needs to be done. The real challenge comes from finding exactly what you need to complete the job at hand which does at times lead to a wild goose chase across the map. There is no puzzles that require timing or can be messed up so with enough patience any obstacle can be overcome even for people terrible at this genre such as I. When all is said and done Dropsy doesn't have anything terribly unique on the gameplay front but it's weird and stylish presentation certainly draws it out from the crowd. So if you ever wanted to play as a clown straight out of a horror movie going around hugging children, animals and an angry man in a chicken costume, I can think of no better game.","April 22","true","4.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Gameplay wise it reminded me the strongest of the Legend of Kyrandia Series by Westwood. It also reminded me of a kids game I had on Commodore 64, which was a Winnie The Pooh game, where the goal was to collect all items and bring them to the right character. Despite those similarities tho Dropsy is a very unique game of its own kind.\n\nThe biggest strength of this game is its character design. The main character looks scary at first, but as soon as you play a few moments you notice how adorable he is and that you shouldn't judge a book by its colour. Besides of that the NPCs are really intresting as well. They are very well pixeled and even tho there is no dialogue, they all have their own character. All that is portrayed by great animations.\n\nThere are also quite a few weird and quirky moments in this game, some of you may even call them creepy. But if you like these kinda things like I do, it will only make you love the game more.\n\nDropsy is one of those games, that comes out of nowhere just to make you smile.","September 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

And yet, beyond the surface is a story that has underlying themes that don't hit you heavy handed with them, but cause those looking for them to think about what they truly mean. Dropsy is definitely worth your time and money if you've played any sort of point and click adventure and remotely enjoyed it, and the few faults that can be found are overshadowed heavily by the game's charm and it's ability to evoke feeling. This year a lot of good point and clicks have come out in Anna's Quest and Technobabylon, but Dropsy stands as the leader of the bunch at this point. 10 bucks? Well worth it.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IDAEGR7Pp4\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nBleeds Charm.

Use of imagery is strong and tells you all you need to know.\nPresentation adds to the storytelling with a good variety of locations as well as beautifully put together pixel art.

Dropsy the Misinterpreted clown is on a point and click adventure with his dog to find happiness and answers, with beautiful art (thanks to the use of psychedelic drugs I'd pressume) and the funkiest of soundtracks I've heard in a long time this game was fun around every corner, To the whacked out dreams and bangin' cassette beats. Being unable to hug anyone around you to start with is beyond upsetting (being able to take a poop in multiple areas of the game eased that upset feeling) I gotta say, but you soon befriend a squirrel and get your first hug of many.\n\nAfter fixing problems for people around the town, like giving a chicken some twinkies, to helping a little girl by planting a rose for her (while she's sleeping) in place of her dead rose, all the way over to a homeless homieless granny getting a sandwich after it was rescued from the local church with heavy metal, the town soon comes to like you and give you the hugs wherever you go.\n\nDue to this games point and click nature you'd assume there's not all that much to do, but for every new place you come across you have 5-10 new options of learning and seeing new and cool things. The added feature of a day and night cycle will have you going back to previous areas to re-explore. Dropsy is so great you can even hug a government operations agent all you like which felt pretty nice, Dropsy was super happy and that made me super happy.\n\nDropsy is beyond misinterpreted and I believe you all need to have a purchase, and a play of this wonderful game. If you would like a further look at the game I've created a short video that shows a large expanse of the Dropsy universe, to the fun and happy, to the sad and miserable, come one come all and join dropsy and I in an adventure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsZZXDAGldI&feature=youtu.be","September 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The four playable characters (dropsy, his dog, the bird, and the mouse), are all really cool, and interesting companions, each with their own character specific abilities.\n\nSo many of the gameplay mechanics are unique, and surprisingly enough they're implemented in a way that close to perfect. Some specific examples of said mechanics are the interesting non verbal clues the characters give you, as well as the different character, and team specific puzzles available.\n\nThere also is the larger puzzle of decoding the in game letters of the game, Fez did something similar, however unlike Fez figuring out what these specific characters mean is a significanlty easier task. Being able to read the in game languge will help shed light on the in game lore. Which is a fun bonus, and a nice touch.\n\nI like that you can complete so many different side objectives, and that the game allows you to keep track of what you've done via some pictures on the wall of the main characters home, as well as a small map in the dogs room.\n\nNeat little touches like that really show how much thought went into the game, not only from an asthetic standpoint, but also from a design standpoint as well.\n\nThere are some things I wish were handled differently, some items seem to stick around even after you've used them, some items don't get collected properly either. None of these are game breaking issues, and hopefully will get patched.\n\nSome of the puzzles were too easy, and at times literally were repeated (like the bird stealing two wheels). I also feel a newgame plus would have made this game more enjoyable, I doubt everyone is going to beat all the side quests the first time around, and it's kind of arduous needing to get everything all over again.\n\nThe game is also a little short, it would have been nicer to have been able to explore a bit more. On the other hand the artwork and animation are top notch, so it's understandable for a project this detailed to needs to limit itself, otherwise it would still be in development, and people need to eat.\n\nLastly I like that despite the dark aspects of the game, the underlying themes of teamwork, friendship, and  understanding are all present. It's so rare to have a main character these days who's completely magnanimous, there is something really positive about this game that just makes it a fun, and enjoyable experience.\n\n4/5 I would recommend.\n\nThanks,\n- Celx Requin\nwww.twitter.com/cancercinema\nwww.cancer-cinema.com/badtaste","September 11, 2015","true","29.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I would highly recommend this colorful hugventure to anyone who is a fan of the genre.\n\nAt a frist glance this game may look quite strange with an even stranger protagonist, but over time Dropsy the clown will grow on you, and you'll find that despite his looks he's just a lovable person that wants nothing more but to help. The more I played, the more I found a place in my heart for the misunderstood clown. It's the kind of game that really teaches that looks can be deceiving, and really follows an overall theme of acceptence of others no matter what walk of life they come from, as Dropsy wanders about trying to hug as many people as possible.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes I found the puzzles to be challenging, but not so much that I couldn't figure out what I was doing after wandering around for a little while. I got stuck a few times, but I still managed to figure things out myself with out having to refer to a guide. Other puzzles can be fairly straight forward, and a good amount are side quests that end with a hug. Even though the side quests aren't nessicary I still felt compelled to hug as many people as I possibly could. There's something so warm and fuzzy about it that I just adore!\n\nThe graphics are wonderful to look at, pixilated, bright, and colorful. I really dig the art style, and although it can be very cherry, it can also be just as creepy and brooding when it needs to be. There is some creepy/disturbing imagery in this game so if you're a fan of spooky scary things you'll love this, and if you're not don't worry the game mainly focuses on the bright and cheery as opposed to the morbid. I for one adore it, but I do love me some horror.\n\nI don't want to talk to much about the story, but the basic premise is that a during a circus preformence a fire was started burning the big top down and claiming a few lives. The media suspects Dropsy might have been the cause and most of the town hates him as a result. You do what you can to help others, while unveiling mysteries along the way. From happy, to tragic. There's also no text for this game, all of the dialog is done through symbols and pictures that appear in word bubbles. I was able to easily understand all of it, and only had a few that made me scratch my head. It's conveyed very nicely. Anyway that's all I want to say on that I don't want to spoil a lot, you really should experience it for yourself.\n\nLast and certainly not least, in my opinion, the music of this game is supurb! I'm literally about to buy the soundtrack right now as soon as I'm finished writing this review. It adds to the overall atmosphere to the game, and I found myself getting lost in it while playing. It can be calm and relaxing, unnerving and uncomfortable, uplifting and at the same time meloncholy. I'm not music expert so take this with a grain of salt, but I believe the genre is sort of Jazzy? There's also piano, guiter, and forms of electronic music. I suggest playing with headphones.\n\nThat's about all I have to say. I'll just continue to hammer it in, if you're a fan of point and click adventures, seriously, PICK THIS UP! You won't regret it. If you haven't played point and click adventure games in the past, and you're looking to try something new, I would still reccommend this game. It might be a little more difficult for a first timer, but just remember to explore as much as you can, and investigate signs and posters. The symbol speech does convey what you need to do well, so you shouldn't have a hard time with it.\n\nThanks for reading!","October 2, 2015","true","16.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

This means that some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse (or maybe that was the player), but when it works (and most of the time it works, especially now that some additional world details have been patched in), it's a deeply satisfying experience that delivers one of the more meaningful and human video game stories I've had the pleasure to play.","May 7","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's very reminiscent of old point and click classics like Day of the Tentacle or Sam & Max hit the Road, both in style, humour and game play. The graphics are a gorgeously animated retro style pixel fanfare, the soundtrack is incredible and the game is absolutely saturated with character. The idea of forcing the player to decipher some of the pictionary pantomime in favour of regular dialogue was a brilliant decision and adds both to the mystery of the world as well as a unique game play element that is a perfect fit for this style of game.\n\nAll in all, I found Dropsy to be an amazing experience, and a must have for the old grognards who pine for the olden days of Lucas Arts and Sierra adventure games.","October 14, 2015","true","19.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Great music, great visuals, and a simple yet focused story that's keenly expressed through the gameplay. Dropsy is an altruistic character and all of the puzzles are based on making everyone happy. The game is as long as it needs to be and has lots of fun from beginning to end. I'm glad that the game has no dialogue but uses pictures and character animations. It helps sharpen what is there and overall does way more with less. Sometimes the goals aren't entirely clear but it's not often and you won't be stuck for long. The game is able to balance bizarre imagination and create a wonderful little universe.  One of my favourite parts of the design is the wall of portraits drawn by Dropsy as he earns the affection of others.\nYou should probably go buy this game and have fun while you're still alive, else you might wake up in a cold sweaty regret late one night and be caught in a parallel universe without hugs.\n","September 11, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had fairly high expectations, and they were totally blown away by this game.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of adventure games. Even the easier ones have me lost and confused most of the time, desperately searching for the one small nook or cranny I missed to find the critical item to advance. I won't lie, I had a period of that in Dropsy for a little while, but otherwise this was a very smooth ride compared to my experiences with the rest of the genre.\n\nBut wow, this game. The way it manages to balance out the absolutely grim themes with gushing optimism was more than enough to play my heart strings like a fiddle. It's a very offbeat adventure game where you play as a scary-looking clown named Dropsy who, even in the darkest moments of the story, strives to bring happiness to everyone he meets.\n\nDropsy can hug virtually anyone (and anything, including inanimate objects) in the town, though some cynical citizens are either too miserable to accept it or flat-out don't like Dropsy much. In these cases, you can go through these optional "hug quests" to do light adventure game puzzles, in the end bringing joy to the townsfolk and earning a hug in the process. Along the way you also get animal friends who can help with a variety of puzzles.\n\nAnother truly unique aspect of it is that, aside from the title screen, there isn't a single bit of text in the game (at least that's in any human language, all hieroglyphics). All characters talk in sort of picture-book pantomimes, creating this visual language which adds both challenge to the puzzles and a bit of nuance to the storytelling. There are a couple instances where this system can be unfortunately vague, leading to the occasions where I got lost, but outside of that it's a brilliant way to do narrative.\n\nThe only critiques I could really come up with is that the wonderfully mellow soundtrack is desperately crying out for better transitions between screens, and that the ending is a huge trip which might be divisive for some. Everything else just cements this as one of my top favorites for this year, and I wholeheartedly recommend playing it.","September 11, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

He's a little scary. I certainly wouldn't want to hug him if he was walking down the street. But he is such a completely pure person that it physically hurts me to watch people run away from him when all he wants to do is help.\n\nI think that's the real strength of the game.

The story may not seem like much at first, but you're definitely in for a ride as you discover the secrets of this town. Graphics and colours are pleasing to the eye and the game runs smoothly. Overall I recommend this game for adventure game fans, and even people that don't play this genre a lot will enjoy it!\n\nBrief overview, story-wise:Dropsy the clown lives with his father in a small town. He's a caring and loving clown, but a tragedy happened in the past that led to the townspeople shunning him. Dropsy starts off helping some wildlife and inhabitants of the town, but he has to get them to trust him again first! This is the basis of the "quests", you help people in need, after you convince them to let you help! I really enjoyed this type of quest because it felt meaningful and at the end you get hugs! The graphics and sounds for the hugs and other actions are really nice too in this game.\n\nAs for a deeper overarching story - I promise you there is one, and not just the hug/ helping quests. However from my experience the best way is to just play it without knowing anything, and I can't really cover it without giving anything away.\n\nThoughts, game play wise:Dropsy plays as a standard adventure game, however there are some differences from a typical game of this sort. Firstly there isn't a large inventory, and the interface is relatively simple. Secondly there's no reading - everything's done through visual and audio cues, which I really enjoyed, it allowed me to interpret things my own while being fully immersed in the experience. Also, there's minimal "pixel hunting" which is sometimes a problem in other similar games. During my play through, I didn't run into crashes or bad bugs at all and the game's performance is very smooth.\n\nConclusion:I'm happy to say that Dropsy exceeded my expectations - I was expecting a really simple story and typical game play. However the story really delivers in the end, and the puzzles felt very meaningful and left me with a nice, warm feeling. I recommend this game to any person who likes games and story.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","November 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","2"

My review comes with a bias.\n\nSo here's the deal: point-and-click, no text (pictograms instead, makes for easy non-localization), and a story about how we -- the people in town, the clown, and you, and me -- learn to love that which seems on-the-surface unlovable.\n\nSpoiler: there's also some stuff about aliens.\n\nOriginally based on a character that cropped up on the Something Awful forums a decade prior, Dropsy The Clown may look hideous at times, but he's just a ball of joy and love and everything you tell yourself you wish the world was like. And yet, when one tragedy occurs, it's this innocent, lovable creature that takes all the blame. You'll spend the game helping citizens to reclaim your good name. But the overarching plot gets crazier than that. Just play it and find out.\n\nMechanics include an inventory system (with pictograms instead of text, puzzle-solving becomes less obtuse), three helper-critters to get to hard-to-reach places Dropsy could never get to, a world map with ease-of-access quick travel (after playing to about the 1 hour mark), and lots and lots of hugging.\n\nMusic by Chris Schlarb, he of "Psychic Temple" fame. He also did the soundtrack for the game NightSky. He's great. His music is great.\n\nJust get this game.

Absurd and melancholic tones. Interesting to see themes of pharmaceutics, cults, and riot grrl music in a nonviolent adventure game about an ugly clown. Unlike Telltale's recent surge of choice-based endurance tests, this is a very traditional, slow-paced adventure game about finding and using items on things and activating flags to move the story forward. There are some interesting mechanics to mix things up: you can switch between Dropsy and his friends to solve puzzles, and NPCs have a schedule and appear in different places at different times during the day, similar to Majora's Mask. Save often, as there are copious optional quests and the game does not warn you when you pass the point of no return.","January 1","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I felt better whenever I hugged someone. The bouncer gives you a fist bump which works fine as well. The idea of putting up all the drawings of people/non-people that have been hugged by the you is great. I wanted to go outside and just start hugging random humans just so I could have a pretty wall. I love meeting the preacher lady in the playground at night. During the day she can be pretty stuck-up; saying that metal is satan and all that stuff, but at night she's just having a smoke and wondering about life in general. Sometimes when Dropsy is opening his inventory it might seem rather inappropriate (especially when there's a little flower girl jumping around Dropsy) but it's just my poor sense of humor, I suppose.\nAll in all I enjoyed playing it.

It's an odd mix of sometimes conflicting themes with a very real world for the player to connect with.\n\nIt has done something to me that a game hasn't done in a long time: I actually CARE about the troubles of an NPC. I can't remember a game where an NPC wasn't just a store, or a worshiper, or a quest giver, or someone that just spouts flavour text. Dropsy present these pixelated characters as 'sad', 'troubled', 'jaded', 'angry', and so on. Due to a combination of minimalistic sound design with excellent pixel art and animation, these feelings are presented as very real. Combine that with the main character, a bundle of misunderstood sweetness, and you have the recipie for a beautiful "feels" fest.\n\nAs a game though, it's not what I would call 'fun'. Due to the scope of the world, it was difficult for me to figure out how to solve certain puzzles because some items were faaaaaar away from the NPC that needed it. Simply because there are so many NPCs with a vauge idea how to progress (especially when starting out), this can be a bit frustrating at times. If the game was restricted in certain areas with new locations opening up as the player progressed, solving NPC problems would have felt a lot more managable.\n\nAs an experience, it's incredible. The story is presented to you with pictures, symbols, sound effects and music. That's it. Everything you experience is based on how you perceive these elements. If adventure games aren't your thing, I'd recommend looking up a guide just to complete the game. It's worth it.\n\nWhile I wish I could reveal the spoilers and discuss the game's core themes, play the game yourself and take from it what you will.","December 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But that’s only a tiny bit of what made Dropsy a great game, instead it’s the character gallery and the minor tales they tell throughout the game that really shines.\n\nDropsy’s cartoon world is very much like looking at our own contemporary times through a laughing mirror, where a world on the brink of self destruction is inhabited by the last broken remnants of humanity. In a run down town that saw it’s prime a long time ago you will sleep with the homeless in p*ss stinking back alleys and let yourself be exploited by big pharma to get to your hugs. And on the way you will meet characters with a humanity not often seen in gaming.\n\nFrom the priest trading sandwiches for lectures on religious dogma and the lonely unemployed stoner to the megalomaniac junkyard owner and the dropout recluse - they all want something in their lives that they can’t seem to find on their own.\nThat’s where the titular Dropsy comes in, like a child unable to grasp the terrors around him he just want everyone to be happy, and in helping him the player gets to experience these little diamonds of everyday happiness in return.\n\nIn the end it’s a tale of finding beauty and friendship in a hopelessly dark world, and that is what makes Dropsy such a great experience.\n\nHighly recommended.","February 8","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonadi/recommended/274350/","Vonadi","\/onadi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonadi/","119 products in account","FOREWARNING, BUYER BEWARE! This game is noted for black screens and not running visuals on Windows 10! Hopefully they'll update this, and if so I'll remove this warning. I have Windows 10 and managed to run the game using the Windows 7 service pack, HOWEVER, cutscenes won't work. (This doesn't really matter since there's only two, beginning and end.)\n\n\nDropsy is a marvel of indie games development. One of those shining gems that comes few and far between everything else. The game is a masterpiece, truly beautiful. It should sit among games like Super Meat Boy, Faster Than Light, Binding of Isaac, Fez (If we are able to ignore Phil Feesh.), and a few others.\nHere's something different: THERE IS NO COMBAT. AT ALL. This is your old, classic, 100% point'n'click adventure game! Oh, oops, I meant "Hugventure". Because you hug everything.\nFor those of you that LOVE puzzles, point and click, and/or non-combat/bloody games, this is a game for you! Lemme explain.\n\nMOTHERF*CKING PUZZLES.  The game, as said, is a point and click. And it wouldn't be a point and click if it wasn't for the puzzles! YAAAAY! This game legitamitely made me want to play Portal 2 again and it has no relation to it, simply how  aggravating  fun the puzzles are. But seriously, this point and click, unlike others, makes sense! I mean, the world doesn't make sense, but how you solve the puzzles does! You do not need to use bucket on hospital lady to acquire fish so you can summon the goblin peasants. Hooray for half-logic!\n\nHUG (and p*ss on) EVERYTHING.  F*CKING.  EVERYTHING!!!   You want to hug the fridge? Boy you can hug the fridge! You want to hug the NSA dude who looks like he'll shoot you? You can hug him too, and he won't shoot you! You want to hug a tree, you tree hugger? YOU GO HUG THE SH*T OUTTA THAT TREE. Oh yeah and anything that looks REMOTELY like a fire hydrant (or is a fire hydrant) your dog can p*ss on. And he even has a wittle map in his wittle doggy home to mark all the things he's p*ssed on. I love it.\nWAIT DON'T SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH YET! Dropsy does the most heartbreaking thing after he hugs people, too. I didn't notice until I had almost finished the game- Dropsy draws kindergarten-esque pictures of everybody (and everything) he hugs and puts it on his wall. I, being the perfectionist I am, tried to hug as many people possible, but I never visited Dropsy's house (nothing to do there, really.) Well, I came there at one point, and I looked at the wall, and said "This looked empty at the beginning, wtf." And so I clicked on one of the paper's, and I saw... It was an adorable little drawing of the fridge, with a smiley face!\nI kept clicking, and seeing crude (but adorable) smily-faced versions of the characters I had hugged. Some even made me laugh (Trust me, the NSA dude and Bouncer drawings are a scream.)\n\nIT WOULDN'T BE A MASTERPIECE WITHOUT THE STORY.  I won't spoil it, but I will say the opening half. Dropsy is a clown who, as a kid, watched the circus tent catch fire and his mother, several performers, and some audience members burn alive. This doesn't come into play in the game except for two flashbacks, one being optional/by chance. However, the towns folk blame Dropsy entirely for killing those people, and have labeled him a murderer. This leads to most of the first part of the game being people yelling at you and calling you scary, as your heart breaks watching Dropsy get depressed and scared. Oh yeah, and the ENTIRE ISLAND is depressed and angry. Literally. EVERYBODY is sad, angry, or just a downer.\nSlowly, if you actually play the game the RIGHT way, you do small tasks for the people, gaining their trust and making them happy. Hugging people makes them happy, but they will refuse to hug you unless you've actually gained their trust via these small tasks. Some tasks are forced to continue the game, but most of them are optional. But you'll do most of the optional ones, anyways. Right? You're not some kind of monster, are you? YOU WANT DROPSY TO BE HAPPY,  RIGHT?\n\nCHARACTERS ARE ACTUAL CHARACTERS  These people have personality. But, here's the confusing part. Dropsy can't read, and assuming from the game (I may be wrong so don't quote me here) I don't think he fully understands English. Or any language, for that matter. People make little emotes and noises showing what they want, their mood, or otherwise, but there's no actual readable text in the game. Dropsy's character is a sweet, 100% innocent, naive, gullible, damp package of joy and love. He is dedicated to just making people happy, and keeping his father well. Call him "Stupid" or "autistic"- but he does more than any of the normal people. I may be looking to deep, but this may be a statement on society.\nIt probably is.\nAnyways, the other characters are great too, but I won't spoil it for you you naughty little buggers.\n\nGWAPHICS GWAPHICS GWAPHICS  The color scheme of this game is how you'd expect a game about a clown to be. EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND VIBRANT. But not in the OH MY GOD MY EYES ARE BURNING way, in the good, pastel kind of way. Few pixelated games are able to make me understand what it is I'm looking at, but this works! That and the colors mix well, day, night, or otherwise. The environments are pretty, EXTREMELY detailed, and well-made.\n\nRETRO MUSIC IS STILL STYLISH  B*tch you thought Retro was out of style? HELL no! Much like the graphics, the music is very fitting, and compliments the art style and environments well. AND AND AND! You can collect these Casette tapes which you can play elsewhere. The music in the casette tapes are great, but they only play in certain places and in your car. (Although I did see a boombox icon in the settings, you may be able to play them on the go, but I doubt it.) So the casette tapes, if I'm right about not being able to use them on the go, are pretty useless but add a good amount of flavor.\n\n\n\nTL;DR and final results: 9.5/10 for a game. The concept, graphics, characters, music, and everything else are great. The only complaints I've had are for the starting issues with windows 10. Aside from that, I never encountered any bugs, and only met with some mild frustration towards certain puzzles. I recommend this game to EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY if you're depressed or have a loss of hope in humanity. This game has a cheerful beauty to it.\nIt's cute, sweet, warm, damp, creepy, loveable, sad at times, but brings you right back to happiness.\n\nP.S; The ending is a bit confusing and maybe a bit disappointing to some, but the game itself makes up for it entirely, and that's just if you don't like it. I personally didn't like it much, but I'm one person, and other people seem to love it.","September 21, 2015","true","12.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

These are two entirely different kind of games but they do bear a resemblence in signature. The color palette, bizarre storyline, strange characters and awesome soundtrack made me feel right at home from the very first pixel. This is one point and click that has been done really well.\n\nDropsy is a beautiful, warm point and click varied with some fittingly disturbing elements. Like with Machinarium there is no speech or text involved, communication is with little rebuses that almost all of the time make perfect sense. There are phones and writings that you'll never be able to comprehend since well.. you're Dropsy. Your main activity will be helping - and hugging - all the people around you, gaining their trust and love while making the world a better place. It is by exploration that both story and the pretty big game world unfolds, giving you that great sense of wonder with each new screen you walk into. The surroundings feel fresh and slightly weird, comparable to those of Sam and Max (albeit a bit less over the top I guess.. maybe).\n\nThere are some minor sidequests to be done besides following the main story line. That gives the game some longevity besides the four hours give or take that it would take to complete otherwise, but also I do believe that you'll get different endings according to how much you have done. I only finished it once so far though so I'll have to figure that out myself as well. Steam achievements are not yet working at the time of this writing, but that's about to be fixed very soon so that will be an extra incense to explore thoroughly.\n\nSo yes, give this game a hug and buy it, the fart button alone is totally worth it! 3<","September 20, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack is incredible.  And the character of Dropsy himself is so unique and special.\n\nOverall the puzzles are very easy, and not all of them are mandatory.  Most of the game is spent wandering the world and making people happy.  Usually you do this by finding a specific item for that person, but there are a lot of exceptions.  The developer has somehow made solving these sorts of mini-puzzles incredibly satisfying and rewarding.\n\nThere are parts of the game where you feel a lack of direction, and you can get stuck not really knowing what to do.  The only happened to me a couple of times, so it wasn't really a major concern.\n\nThe "horror" aspects are not a big deal at all.  There are a few dream sequences that have some slightly disturbing imagery, and the end of the game also has some kinda messed up stuff, but overall the game is about an innocent being who just wants to make the people around him happy, even when they don't accept him.\n\nGet this game, it is easily worth it.","September 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style is amazing, the story is emotional and you actually CARE about Dropsy and the people he becomes involved with. That is very rare for most games and the point and click mechanics are done with pictures, absolutely no text here-- so any language can enjoy this game.\n\nWhile I have not reached the finish of this game, I will say that is is slightly challenging and took me a bit to work through some of the puzzles. It is a truly open-world experience path and you are not timed or given a penalty for slowly figuring things out. The only real improvement would be to get some trading cards/backgrounds for Steam, because this has to be one of my favorite indie titles out there-- has a lotta heart and hugs put into it.","September 12, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It follows a cartoon clown who has a tragic back story and a love of hugs.  It follows the general adventure game formula of encountering people with problems then helping them fix them.  However, it has some distinctive qualities in gameplay.  First, there is a day night cycle.  Sometime problems can only be solved at certain times of the day, othertimes you will encounter someone in a different situation that might give you a hint about what they want.  Second, the game has no dialogue.  Unlike most adventure games where the protaganist and characters chatter, this game uses only pictograms.  It ends up being very effective and still communicates distinct charatcer traits with just a few images.  Thirdly, the game features animal companions who have access to areas that dropsy doesn't and can help you solve puzzles and complete side quests.  All in all, the puzzles were at worst competent and at best surprising.  It avoids the pitfalls of impossible or incoherent puzzles, but still manages to be challenging enough to satisfy.\n\nThe art and animation are quite brilliant.  Dropsy has no right to be as cute as he is in this game.  It's like the developer challenged himself to make a horror clown cute and succeeeded.  The way he hugs things is adorable and the compasion and diginity the game gives this outcast clown are really special.  It's a pretty memorable art style that mixes psyachdelic art with classical cartooing.\n\nAs a last note, the game may be worth playing for the music alone.  Many game soundtracks seem like workmen efforts.  They effectively hit a tone you need for a point in the game, but don't stand out.  In Dropsy, the music stack in my head.  I found myself listening to casettes (a collectable item with music on it) for no reason other than to hear the music.  I didn't buy the special edition with the soundtrack, but maybe I should have.\n\nThe one drawback I had was that the game hit a bug (after the scene in the shed).  I restarted the game and it worked, but it was a tad bit annyoing.  I noticed a few minor moments that might have benefited from some polishing, but overall the quality of the game as pretty high.\n\nIn the end, I gladly recommend this.  This game is great for: fans of adventure games, people who want to play something tripy, people who like pictonary, video game music fiends, people who need to get over their fear of clowns, and honestly probably anyone interested enough in the game to read this review.","September 11, 2015","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game features a huge world (thankfully with a fast travel mechanism that you unlock fairly early on.) It’s the only game I know of which has a “hug” interaction… which, it might be noted, is the only interaction – everything else is either context sensitive or using objects on things. It also doesn’t have any text – all interaction with other characters is accomplished through a series of pictograms.\n\nDifficulty seems to be pretty good, and is aided by the semi-open nature of the game. Generally speaking, if you’re running into a problem dealing with one person’s problems, you can switch to someone else. I was able to complete most of the game without having to hit any hints or walkthroughs, basically right up until the point where you lose one of your animal companions, where I felt that there could have been more direction, as I found myself hitting multiple walls that eventually required me to search for answers.\n\n+ Solutions to puzzles are generally logical.\n+ Unique character/theme.\n\n- Sometimes not enough direction on what to do next.\n- Some pixel hunting required for interactive objects.\n\n-/+ Fairly short – I completed it in 5 hours.\n\n+ Worth buying on sale – as of this writing (4/21/16), it’s available from the Humble Bundle, along with a bunch of other great games.","April 21","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afroryan/recommended/274350/","afroryan","AfroRyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afroryan/","1013 products in account","Full disclosure: I helped beta test this game, so my attachment to the game is higher than most.\n\nThat said, I really love Dropsy. Ignoring his humble beginnings as a choose your own adventure game on the Something Awful forums and focusing just on this videogame release, Dropsy is a simple clown with simple pleasures. First and foremost, Dropsy likes making people happy. Dropsy has no hatred for anyone in the game, and only wants to help. He likes hugging people, animals (which he can understand equally as well as humans), and innate objects. Dropsy is someone anyone would be lucky to know.\n\nThe game is a non-traditional point and click adventure. It lacks traditional dialogue, and instead Dropsy understands people and animals through descriptive pictures that appear in speech balloons. It's an effective way to convey story without giving too much away, and with enough context in the world, easy to make sense of. I think it's as unique as it is effective. The story itself is very compelling and kept me engaged throughout the adventure.\n\nPuzzles in Dropsy follow a set logic; nothing as obtuse as a puzzle in say, any Lucasarts point and click ever made. While a solution might not be forthcoming initially, with enough observation and exploration, any puzzle can be solved with actual logic and not just randomly handing people everything in your inventory (also you could still try that if you were super stuck I guess).\n\nDropsy also has 3 animal friends that can all help him solve puzzles in different ways. Eugh, the puppy, can sniff out clues and dig in the dirt. The mousey can fit through tight spaces and climb on things. The birdy can fly to places Dropsy can't reach.\n\nOne more thing that adds to both the puzzles and the overall atmosphere of the game is the day/night cycle. Some puzzles can only be done at night and some only during the day. Time passes a little each time Dropsy enters a scene, and if you need it to be night or day, you can always make Dropsy go to bed. Sometimes Dropsy will dream, and these surreal dreamscapes offer a glimpse into Dropsy's mental state; his likes, his fears, and his memories.\n\nThe visuals in Dropsy are colorful, charming, and effective. They convey a cheerful tone, despite some of the not-so-cheerful situations Dropsy finds himself in. I don't think anyone would ever call Dropsy the game ugly, although they may say that about Dropsy himself (which isn't very nice to say; Dropsy can't help it).\n\nThe music in Dropsy is absolutely phenomenal. It is an eclectic mix of jazz, electronic, and many other genres, and that's just in the core game; there's many tapes you can find that add even more diversity that can be played in a tape player or (once you unlock it) on the fast travel screen. If you're anything like me, you'll want to buy the soundtrack as soon as possible after hearing it in game.\n\nFor what Dropsy is, I feel that it is near perfect. I am playing through the first gold build right now, same as everyone else, and have not finished quite yet so I can't say if the game is truly flawless; I may run into a bug or two. However, all throughout the beta process the developer was very quick to note and fix any weird things I may run into. I have no doubt that within a couple months, Dropsy will be 99.9999% bug free regardless of how it may or may not be right this very second. The build I played through right before launch was nearly spotless, so I assume the full version is even better.\n\nAnd with all that said, Dropsy is getting a free add-on after launch that adds a new beach area to the game! I can't wait for the new characters, music, and puzzles that will come with that.\n\nI highly recommend Dropsy to anyone who likes point and click adventure games, to anyone who likes surreal experiences, and anyone who loves good music.","September 11, 2015","true","32.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics style and animation are awesome, and the soundtrack is really good.\n\nHowever a very bad decisions regarding the storytelling and whole gameplay design were made. First of all there are no dialogues, or any other text in the game (the only existing text pieces are written in cypher), so basically you have to figure out the personal stories of each character (and the main story of the game) by interacting with them and solving their quests. In the beginning it seems like an innovative idea, but very quickly you discover that it just making the game story empty, and some quests absolutely pointless.\nFor example there's this costume guy in a wagon - he has this display case with some rings that some alien dropped some time ago, but the rings are decayed already. So you go find that alien, get new rings from him, and bring the new rings to the costume guy again. End of story/quest. Why this guy sits in a wagon all day and shows everyone his rings? What was the point of all this quest? I have no idea, probably a hefty amount of very creative imagination needed from the player to actually enjoy this kind of stuff.\nMore than half of the game is basically pointless quests without a proper writing like that, you find some character - you see what they need in an image box - you bring it to them - you hug each other - end of quest. The fish in the pond, the aircraft crash site guard, the music dude who wants an album, etc, etc...\nAnd then you get to the finale - a rushed, weird, out-of-context, and again without any proper writing, that probably supposed to be left to the player's imagination - but if you won't find through the game an extremely difficult hidden secrets, you won't understand anything (and even with all the secrets it's still hard to figure out what's going on), and the game will leave you with a very bad taste.\n\nStill I have to say that even with all these bad design ideas. I enjoyed the game while I played it, and can't say that I disappointed too much, so in the bottom line I'll recomend it, and hope that the author will make another point-n-click adventure, but this time with a better storytelling.","September 12, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But enough about my social life, let's talk about the game. Dropsy is a point-and-click adventure game, so there's not much to talk about, but there are a few noteworthy things worth mentioning. The game has a main storyline series of puzzles to solve, but there are also a number of optional ones that you can do in order to cheer up and hug the various citizens of the town the game takes place in, adding a sense of exploration to it. The game features a 4-part day/night cycle, and the characters move around and do different things depending on the time of day, and while this does get somewhat tedious at times, it's a pretty novel way to handle an adventure game. It's hard to really tell how long an adventure game is because it depends pretty heavily on how stupid you are, but it took me around 6 hours to finish most of the puzzles, only missing a few collectibles here and there. Overall Dropsy is both funny and pretty surreal at times, and it tells about as good of a story as you can tell with a protagonist who can't read or understand what people are saying beyond charade bubbles.","December 6, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","45","5","11","5","0"

He wants to be friends with every person he meets, even if it means listening to their problems and helping them out any way he can, the end result of all these new friendships being a big, warm, slightly damp hug.\nDropsy's put more smiles on my face in just a few hours than most games can manage in hundreds of hours of play, I ended up caring for lots of the characters despite none of them having real dialogue, and Dropsy's personal struggle to prove his worth to the populace won me over without an intelligable word ever being spoken.\n\nIf you want to play a fun adventure game, try Dropsy.\nIf you want to reconsider a fear of clowns, try Dropsy.\nIf you want to feel like you really helped someone, even if they're virtual, try Dropsy.\nIf you're into hugging everything you see, definitely try Dropsy.","November 22, 2015","true","13.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's sort of messed up, there's grief and hopelessness, people stuck in their unhappy ways not sure how or not willing to change them, a whole cavalcade of human emotion and strife but it is so refreshingly single-entendred and honest.

Whether you will like it or not depends heavily on your tolerance for weirdness.  The videos and screenshots give you a good idea what you're in for.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt's unique.  There is minimal violence, and almost all of it is directed toward the player character.  It is very psychedelic, and disturbing in places despite the relative lack of violence.\n\nDespite how bizarre the setting is, the solutions to the puzzles all made sense, and seemed fair.\n\nWhile mute player characters are a common defect in game design, it is intentional here.  Dropsy also cannot read well.  Coping with this is part of the puzzle solving.  I haven't seen that done before.\n\nEven though Dropsy can't read most of it, all text in the game is meaningful, and you can find translations online.  You may get more out of the plot by reading the translations after completing the game.\n\nThe ending is satisfying.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are no volume controls.  It really needs them since it is pretty loud by default.\n\nThe music won't appeal to everyone.  It's not all like the videos.  I'm not sure what the genres are, but some of it is very distorted and noisy.\n\nIt's easy to get ‘stuck’.  I can't fault the game for this, but it is a problem nonetheless.  Almost every time I had to resort to a walkthrough it was because I had missed a mousehole somewhere.  They're inherently hard to notice.  Unlike some adventures, I never got into a state where progress was impossible.","November 27, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One thing that differentiates this game from most other point & click games is the icon based dialogues. However, that means that dialogues become just a few icons, such that I could not sympathize with the main character at all. There are a lot of optional quests that grant no other benefit than a hug. The day/night mechanics make it easier to accidentally avoid some important bit, and harder for you for almost no reason. One example would be the costume shop clerk that visits the cemetary at night. There is no obvious hint that would happen, and this example can really block the main story.\nGraphics are OK for most part, but the inventory is awful. With no text to help identify objects, you are left with your imagination. One clear example of this difficult to identify items is a necklace that looks like some sort of hammer from a distance.\nMusic sounds good - although a lot sounds like elevator music to me. However, use of music might be inappropiate at times. It clearly does not react to whatever is happening on screen. The music is varied, maybe too varied.\nAs far as the story goes, it is not really coherent to me. Main character is acting in good faith most of the time, except for when it needs something from S-Corp. You know how most of the time, Point & Click games show that the main character is a cleptomaniac, taking everything that is not bolted down. However, Dropsy usually acts in goodwill, except for a break into S-Corp in order to steal secret thing guarded by two killer robots.\nFor the reasons cited earlier, I cannot recommend the game to anybody else I know. There are definitely more enjoyable games out there.","January 3","false","3.6"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

The handling of those serious topics is also rather serious.\n\n- Will the setting is novel and fun, the gameplay is absolutely boring - this is a point and click adventures and those can be tremendous fun! (Like deponia or monkey island!) - but where Deponia and Monkey island embed their riddles in their storyline so that figuring out one riddle after another feels like progress and fun, Dropsy takes another approach. You have to convince every npc that you are good and collect hugs after they're convinced. That's the whole story. In a sense, this gameplay feels like a typical questgrinder from an MMORPG - you run around to find the items that match what the npc needs, give it to them and move on to the next search-quest. Gameplaywise, figuring out these "Riddles" feels tedious because you know after you have done one, the story won't really progress - all that waits for you are 20 other search quests.\n\n- Characters don't develop any depth. The developers tried their best to develop characters without the use of language (there is no text-speech or voice-speech, people speak with pictures in their speech bubbles) and while the concept is interesting, it ultimately falls short on developing a rich story or characters. Characters you meet feel completely exchangeable (in comparison,  think of monkey island where characters like the pirate captains, captain le Chuck, the three headed monkey, Elaine, your own pirate men etc. brought so much fun to the experience) - in Dropsy, none of the characters (except for your dog companion) is memorable or interesting or entertaining at all.\n\n- The story is poor. There is not much of progression, but you basically need to do 50 fetch/search quests and that's it.\n\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone unless it's on sale for under 2.00$. It's a bit of a disappointment really. the dropsy trailer was great and I hoped I could support a point and click indie developer but there are far better point and click games out there. The Deponia series or games from wadjet games for that matter.\n","December 19, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","6","26","0","2"

Suspected as the cause of a circus fire some five years previous which claimed the life of Dropsy’s mother, your goal is to turn the hatred the town feel towards you into love. By hugging them. And animals. And trees. And inanimate objects. Your inventory is in the crotch region of your bouncy clown pants.\n\nOverall, I found Dropsy to be a great experience. Although the difficulty is at times rage-quittingly tremendous, this is counteracted by the wonderful and vibrant world you’re introduced to. Thankfully, none of the frustration is technical – the game runs like clockwork. The characters all feel human in their desires and flaws, and I cannot express just how effective this game is graphically. The story elicits so much bewildering, tragic joy for a game featuring no words. I’d recommend it to any point and click aficionado, although – and I mean this in the best possible way – it is definitely not one for the casual gamer.\n","October 13, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It follows standard point and click mechanics similar to the Lucasarts paradigm. But I'd describe it as more a "graphic adventure sandbox." For instance the map is huge, well-designed, and fun to navigate. The puzzles are more non-linear, meaning you sort of stumble upon the answers by naturally exploring and prodding the environment. It's not a strict "I need to complete these 3 objectives to get in there" kind of adventure. If you are the kind of person who likes to explore and "live in" an odd and original world, you will find lots to love in Dropsy.\n\nBonus: the art and music are fantastic. And while the "no text" setup seems annoying at first, deciphering the pictogram nature of the dialog balloons becomes half the fun. It lets you peer into the way Dropsy sees the things around him.","October 13, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After all this game embraces “show, don't tell” by having absolutely zero dialogue or exposition. But as an advocate for the power and utility of words, I should probably give it a shot.\n\nBeing nice is hard. For Dropsy though—the eponymous moist demonic-faced clown—it is simply second nature. He's the last innocent in a jaded world. By some sinister stroke of misfortune however, Dropsy's circus tent has burned down and the blame is pinned on him. Townspeople are quick to turn against him. It's up to Dropsy to prove their reactions wrong by performing good deeds—doing so only because that is simply Dropsy's way.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Dropsy's gamplay is its nonlinearity. An open world point-and-click adventure? Outrageous!\n\nBy nonlinear I mean that almost the entire map is available to explore from the get-go. This is a questionable tactic for an adventure game, as it is overwhelming for the player to have so much immediately available. There's a reason after all why most adventure games are step-by-step structured—it is easier and more fluid for the player to process the information that way. Overlapping sidequests and mainquests mean a lot of inventory-collecting and information-gathering without a clear idea of how either is to be implemented. The result makes Dropsy suffer from a general lack of direction, the player not receiving much feedback from their actions nor gaining a definite sense of progress. Open world also means traversing the same maps over and over again, which can be repetitive. A day and night cycle makes the exploration even more daunting.\n\nYet the charm and liveliness of the world is undeniable. An eclectic, catchy soundtrack complements the bright, vibrant visuals. The music ranges from hardcore punk to poppy little diddies, the musicians here composing fantastically low-fi representations of popular genres. Meanwhile the pixel art is beautiful, with a variety of unique settings and smooth animations.\n\nThe characters are diverse and endearing. Three little critter buddies accompany you—a bird, a mouse and a dog (whose mission is ostensibly to pee on as many things as he can). Along the way, Dropsy also runs into an angry all-women punk band, a preacher who believes that rock music is the devil, a vampire-fearing cult and the corrupt CEO of a pharmaceutical pastry corporation. To name just a few.\n\nDialogue is shown through visual symbols. For instance, a character complains about work. Instead of simply saying “I hate work,” the character's speech bubble has a little person with a shovel followed by a red circle with a cross through it.\n\nNonverbal communication in an adventure is a phenomenal idea, performed well in the past by Machinarium. The difference here is that Machinarium had a very simple plot. Dropsy meanwhile is ceaselessly complicated. This demands a lot of attention on the part of the player. On its own this isn't asking too much—it only gets increasingly convoluted as we delver further into a plot involving aliens, conspiracy and evil corporations. Things get a little lost in translation.\n\nDropsy also at times refuses to keep the player in the loop of its game world logic. Take, for example, when the player might want to enter the nightclub in town. As an adventure game, would we not want to explore every single possible location? Yet whenever the player tries to make Dropsy enter the club, he simply walks in front of it then shrugs. No clear indication of why he cannot enter is given. Other similar information is often failed to be communicated to the player—instead of explanations, we are often just met with a shrug.\n\nDespite problems with a sense of plot progression and generally just getting lost in the game world, there is an undeniable satisfaction to going around doing nice things for people and getting hugs. It is one of the purest examples of positive feedback in gaming—do good things and people will like you more, will want to support and assist you. Dropsy's rather horrifying appearance is ignored in lieu of his benevolent actions. It is heartwarming to see, both funny and touching.\n\nWhile Dropsy isn't quite as fun as it could have been, it does have its moments. Some puzzles, such as a sequence in which you must break into a building as a mouse, are quite challenging and clever. The world it builds is inimitable. It just doesn't flow as smoothly as it might—the player finds the narrative moving in jumps and starts, progressing almost accidentally as they stumble upon new information, collect a new item or else discover a new location. This can be frustrating to experience, make the game more tedious than need be.\n\nAs a whole, though, there is nothing else like Dropsy out there. It has its shortcomings, but it is a one-of-a-kind, lovable, huggable experience. For that alone it is worth playing.\n\nA copy of the game was provided by the developer for review on PC.","October 24, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, such a creature does exist. His name is Dropsy.\n\nDropsy is the story of a simple clown, living a simple life, with his beloved parents in a simple circus. But that all changes when one night, a fire breaks out, taking the circus and Dropsy's beloved mom with it. For whatever reason, Dropsy is blamed for starting the fire; soon after, his beloved father suddenly falls ill.\n\nAlso, the poor guy is bald, overweight, illiterate, and gap-toothed to boot.\n\nBy all accounts, Dropsy looks like he should be a deranged lunatic. But the thing is...he's not. Even after suffering all this trauma, all the poor guy wants to do is make friends, help people, and give hugs. Dropsy's a grown man with the innocence of a child, but it somehow doesn't come across as creepy. He's just a good-natured clown who loves other people and animals (like his puppy, mouse, and bird friends), and he just wants to help.\n\nVisually, this game looks a lot like those old point-and-click games, such as "Monkey Island" or "Sam & Max Hit the Road." There is one major difference though: this game has no dialogue. At all. The entire story is told through word balloons and pictures; some people might need time to get used to this, but it's not that hard to follow. The soundtrack is pretty good, too; there are a lot of different songs, and they stick with you.\n\nYeah, the story's not a very deep one, and there are plenty of other stories with the "beauty is only skin-deep" moral. But at the same time, "Dropsy" makes it work. If you're a fan of old point-and-click games or just like stories or characters that help restore your faith in humanity, I'd definitely recommend "Dropsy."","October 29, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll probably do all the extra stuff which could take at most an hour but afterwards, there is no incentive to go back and replay the game. Still really damn good. Check it out.","October 10, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me a lot of the early Sam & Max games in its humour, aesthetic, and gameplay.\n\nWith that said, it is also a lot like Sam & Max in that the "puzzles" span from the mindlessly simple to the astonishingly obscure solution. I never used the help of the walkthrough because none existed when I played, but I must have spent about 2 of my 6+ hours of playtime scratching around the big map trying to figure out what to do. It doesn't help that characters speak in sometimes difficult-to-read images rather than true dialogue.\n\nThe redeeming qualities, though, trump the aforementioned cons. Dropsy is really visually stunning in every scene. And the "puzzles," while obscure in some areas, are rewarding to figure out. The story, also, if you can decipher what the characters say, is very deep and meaningful.\n\nI'm very hopeful for future releases from the "Dropsy" devs!","September 30, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a beautifully crafted game.\n\nBut, of course, that isn't what makes it special.. while it simply says to hug everyone on the tin, I would define the core gameplay as.. you are a dumpy idiot that wants everyone to be happy and is striving to cheer them up, even though they all hate you and blame you for a tragedy.\n\nBut you're never explicitly told to do this; you are simply given a hug button and shown early on that you can hug people. From there, I became overcome with an inexplicable compulsion of random kindness. This turned into an obsession on my second playthrough.\n\nI now find myself intentionally ignoring the main storyline because I want to cheer everyone up instead, and in at least one case found a happier solution to a puzzle. I don't want to set off that final quest, and even though I don't think there is a way, I'm trying to find a different ending, or at least a better way to reach that ending.","September 29, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game doesn't overwhelm you with text boxes or tutorials. You start the game and you're a clown. What you do from there is up to you.\n\nEven the NPC's won't use text. They have their own unique language based on a series of clever symbols. You can quickly figure out how someone is feeling or what they might need just by hanging around and listening to their thoughts.\n\nThe game does an excellent job of showing you just enough to give you an idea of what you need to do next. There's plenty of extra stuff, too. I completed the game and noticed there were a few areas on the map I never reached.\n\nThe art and animations are very unique and endearing.\n\nIf you like adventure games, you'll like Dropsy.

Seriously, I can't remember the last one I played where I didn't hurt in some way at the very least one (usually innocent) NPC. Over time being mean to other characters has become a staple of the genere. Even if this is rather usual in other kind of games, it feels very different when done in point and clikc adventures. More concious, more meditated, with a far clearer mischievous intent. And I love it :-P\n\nDropsy isn't really different to similiar games in that sens, though it definitely does feel different. The main character has an aura of innocence about him. All his actions are clearly aimed to ultimatley helping his neighbors, even though they openly despise him. It is very unsual to find games where the main objective is making everyone happy. And I truly appericate this.\n\nDropsy the clown isn't alone in his adventures. As his jorney progresses, a trio of additional playable characters joins his party: a dog, a mouse and a bird. Each of these are different sizes and have different movement possibilities. These differences are cleverly exploited to block acces to specific areas or objects until the needed friend has joined the party. It may be not immediately obvious how these additional characters are supposed to be used. They lack inventory and all their puzzles are very physical, usually consisting in finding the path to a specific position.\n\nI find laudable the effort that was put into telling the whole story without resorting to text or voices. Unfortunatley the meaning of some of the icons used during dialogs is not always clear. Speaking of which, keep in mind there is text in the game though it just contains additional details which aren't really important to understand the story. These texts are in english but written in a custom alphabet instead of the latin one, so they must be deciphered by the player.\n\nThese game is rather non-linear. In fact, many of it's quests are optional. This is great, though sometimes it may be a bit disorienting. It's not always obvious whether helping one of the neightbours leads to a dead end or has further reaching consequences.\n\nArtistically the game is great. Backgrounds and characters and detailed and full of personality. The animations are also great, very lively and charming. The music is excelent too and very varied. It's also integrated into the gameplay since there are a handful of additional pieces that can be optinally collected through your journey. The SFX are fine, though not very impresive.\n\nAll in all, and although I felt disapointed by the ending, I enjoyed playing Dropsy. It's quiet easy and not very lengthy, so I recomend it to anyone looking for a frugal, pleasant and warm experience.","January 16","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Big thumbs up, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the most interesting things about this game (besides its phenomenal presentation) is that it doesn't use dialogue but instead a series of pictures in a thought bubble appear when you talk to someone. It really gives the game a unique flavor and reinforces the "childish innocence" approach that Dropsy has toward the world.\n\nAs a side note if you're looking to get into point & clicks or maybe just haven't tried one, this may be a good entry point. Many popular titles in the genre have super obscure solutions to vague/difficult puzzles where you may be forced to consult a guide.  I found Dropsy's puzzles to be solvable - yet not immediately obvious or boring by any means.

This is one very interestring aspect, trying to hug everyone and make everyone happy even though your world is crushed and burned. Unfortunately, the ending really disapointed me.\nGraphics look horrible at first, but once you get used to it (and see some Dropsy's happy animations), you will like it.

Through some easy-but-not-too-easy puzzles (and lots of hugging), this short story is heartwarming without being saccharine, with some surreal and at times grotesque visuals that complement the genuinely sweet concept.

A good amount of "awww" with a dash of "WTF!?" Sprinke on some sadness and you have a great game.\n\nI'm not real sure what I can complain about, it's not buggy. Maybe if it was longer?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LUCKY5HOT/recommended/274350/","LUCKY5HOT","luckyshot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LUCKY5HOT/","532 products in account","Dropsy is a game that you can tell was made with vision and passion. It is not a perfect game, but the love that was put into this game is so charming and beautiful that I am more than willing to overlook its flaws. Dropsy is a 2D point and click adventure game very reminiscent in style to the old Lucasarts games like Day of the Tentacle and the Curse of Monkey Island. The story is about a circus clown who's mother died during a fire which burned down the tent where they performed. You befriend a cast of animal companions who go around town trying to help people in return for hugs.  There is distinct feeling of tension in the game as to the nature of Dropsy. Dropsy is visually scary, but he seems to just want to give hugs to everything (and anything) he meets. This is further obfuscated by the use of pictograms in lieu of text dialog to convery the speech in this game. I found the use of pictograms to be an interesting choice that for the most part worked, allowing the player to fill in the narrative themselves, but at some times confused me as to what they meant. The main innovations are what they call an open world where you can essentially travel to any location in the world at any time and the addition of a day/night cycle which changes in real-time. I found these design choices to be interesting but tended to make the game more difficult towards the mid to late game where some critical person may only be available at a certain location at a certain time of day. The game difficulty starts out fairly simple, yet enjoyable and then quickly ramps up towards the end where a lot of logical jumps a-la-LucasArts games are required. Thankfully, a quick google search was all that was needed to get back on the right track. What I really enjoyed was the story. I won't spoil it, but I found it to be worthy of the LucasArts games I mentioned before. The soundtrack is great and while I don't typically purchase soundracks for games, I am considering this one.","June 4","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
