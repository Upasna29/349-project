I have not bothered to play the English adaptation nor do I intend to.\n\nStory: The tale revolves around the sword with the power to destroy the eponymous Tsukumogami, objects which have gained sentience after long years of use. The protagonist loses her mother and her father goes missing after the Tsukumogami raid the capital city, leaving her to grow up and learn swordsmanship under foster care. Her destiny is then intertwined with the sword. How the tale is resolved is then up to the choices made by the player over the course of the game.\n\nSetting: Early medieval/medieval Japan with magic and the supernatural weaved into the fabric of society. The Tsukumogami are based on the Hyakki Yakou legends and the paintings associated with them over the ages.\n\nCharacters: Hayabusa's characterisation is quite standard, trained to wield the sword and seeking vengeance against the Tsukumogami responsible for taking her parents away from her. Over the course of the journey, she does change perceptibly and is given a more human side to her. The people and deities she interacts with have their own personalities, players should not have trouble distinguishing one character from another due to distinctive character designs and the personalities given to each character.\n\nArt: Very distinctive designs for each character as well as the Tsukumogami enemies themselves. Highly reminiscent of the old paintings of Japanese scenery and the supernatural mostly found in museums.\n\nMusic: Traditional Japanese melodies with a heavy emphasis on the piano for the slower tracks. Players who like the music can purchase the soundtrack as an extra on the store page, but it is purely a matter of personal preference and budgetary constraints.\n\nGameplay mechanics: This game is built on the KiriKiri engine which has been a workhorse for Japanese games for over a decade. The interface is simple and requires players to move from one end of the playing field to the other whilst defeating enemies which stand in the way.\n\nThe combat system in this game is both a strength and a weakness. It is unique as it requires players to identify the opposing enemy before it can be exorcised or captured (reflecting traditional East Asian perceptions on malignant spirits). Unfortunately the novelty of the combat system will wear off once players become accustomed to the mechanics and discover they cannot breeze through regular enemies in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe "RPG" aspect of this game is reflected in the spirit capturing mechanic and upgrades to the sword. After a certain point in the game, players are given the option of capturing spirits in order to exploit their abilities instead of simply exorcising them. There is a wide range of abilities to choose from as each spirit offers two abilities when captured into service, most abilities provide a useful boost to players with a small minority strong enough to upset game balance. To simplify the process of grinding, the sword can be upgraded very early on in the game with points granted upon each level-up. A fully-upgraded sword significantly shortens the time required to defeat regular enemies, but the time investment required from players might be off-putting for many.\n\nGame stability: The version provided by Steam is 1.10, however it is not completely bug-proof as certain enemies or combination of enemies will crash the game forcing a reset to the main menu. Hence it is strongly recommended players save before and after significant milestones in the game to minimise disruption.\n\nRecommended Japanese proficiency: There is no English in this game (that's why this game only comes bundled together with 99 spirits). Players are expected to be familiar with the Japanese syllable table and to associate the various Kanji which emerge when using the sword's spirit identification function with the objects the Tsukumogami relate to. There will be quite a number of occasions when players need to manually input the correct syllables to unmask the identity of the enemy in question (with at least one very annoying phase in which the syllable table is scrambled) but most of the time the enemies can be identified using the handy master scroll of enemies which is filled in upon discovery or purchase of new scroll parts.\n\nThe dialogue and exposition in the game doesn't utilise complex grammatical structures, but some of the vocabulary used isn't common for non-native speakers. Anyone interested in playing the game through without a full-blown walkthrough should have JLPT N2 or N3 with a good grounding in Japanese mythology and culture. Either way, having a good Japanese dictionary on hand (hard copy or online) is extremely handy.\n\nThe developer Toraiki does have a blog page with tables listing the characteristics, locations and abilities of the Tsukumogami enemies so those who can read Japanese can consult the tables to save time.\n\nConclusion: For a debut work, this is a decent attempt with a coherent storyline, unique if eventually tedious mechanics and characters which leave an impression long after the game is completed. Thanks to Steam's decision to bundle this game with the English adaptation, more players can experience the Japanese doujin market which is more popular than ever thanks to English translations of games like Recettear. Highly recommended for anyone looking to improve their Japanese vocabulary while having fun at the same time.","December 11, 2015","true","43.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
