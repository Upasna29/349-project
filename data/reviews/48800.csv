"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/recommended/48800/","Nikriontra","Nikriontra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/","161 products in account","As a student studying Nautical Science, every year I revisit this game hoping that my quarrels with it were a figment of my imagination, that I had not installed it properly and that this time it would be the ship simulator of my dreams. Each year I get disappointed.\n\nI have played every Ship Simulator since Ship Sim 2006. As a child, I loved maneuvering the boats out of harbour, watching them battle the fierce ocean and using the freecam to pretend i was a captain inspecting the ship as it made its passage. After Ship Sim 2008 i took a hiatus from simulator games and went out to expand my gaming vocabulary thanks to Steam's digital catalogue. One day I saw that Ship Sim Extremes was on sale and decided to buy it. The pictures and screenshots all showed this beautiful simulator, and as the name suggested it was extreme.\n\nWhat i got instead was a buggy, plain looking glitch fest with dead environments, the exact same ships from 2008 plus extras and an overall hideous looking appearance.\nShip Simulator Extremes is literally no different from Ship Sim 2008, except for slightly more ships and a vehicle for Greenpeace to promote itself.\n\nWhen I first played it, the immediate let down was the graphics. This is an atrocious looking game. The harbours are dead, lifeless places and the most fun I had from this was playing on the Antarctic map and pretending to be looking for lost treasure. The water a.k.a the "expressway of the seven seas" is nothing interesting to look at and I have had constant texture glitches where the water textures would flash violently whenever the camera clipped the water.\n\nExample: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608267431\n\nAnother gripe with the water is that there is literally nothing underneath the ocean but an infinite void. This was excusable in previous Ship Sim games as technology was still quite primitive but surely VStep could have added a filter to appear when your camera went under?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608269455\n\nThe WEATHER effects, oh boy. Minecraft has better snow and rain than this. Snow and Rain are literally thick white or blue lines that appear on the screen and block your vision completely. Also, where are the massive "Perfect Storm" waves? Why was Ship Sim 2008 capable of producing truly massive waves but this can't?\nExtremes also has constant audio issues. Engine sounds randomly cutting out, weather effect sounds stutter and stop at random. Everything about this game is an immersion killer.\n\nI will give Vstep credit however for introducing a more educational dynamic into Ship Simulator. After completing a Greenpeace mission it shows a small video discussing more about what Greenpeace and its maritime practices do to save the oceans. This I felt was a good first step in educating young people who play this game and convincing them into entering the industry. However at the same time it falls flat on its face in this regard. When you start a new mission, it places you in a boat with all these levers and wheels in front of you and you have absolutely no clue to what to do. They don't even bother teaching you what all the information the game provides you means. Like I said, if they had added a far more stronger educational dynamic into this, it could have easily been a good tool for teaching students more about the shipping industry.\n\nHowever the campaigns are short and aren't really that interesting. Out of the 8 or so hours I've played, 6 of them have been me free roaming on the Antarctic map using my imagination. This is because the other campaigns are really buggy. For example, I present to you a hilarious glitch that happened when I was doing one of the random chase missions:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=336958764\n\nIn all, Ship Simulator Extremes is a subpar simulator game that barely lives up to its predecessors. If you are a person looking to enter the maritime industry, don't rely on this to teach you more about it. Ship Sim 2008 does a much better job in doing that.\n\nIn the mean time,  I will leave you with some screenshots of some of the various things I have encountered.\n\n\nGetting a RHIB stuck under a ship:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305376639\n\nWater glitches:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608647237\n\nThe innocent looking snow:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608647085\n\nLastly, my favourite screenshot from this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608269369","April 23, 2014","false","9.2"," 95 of 132 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","95","132","6","1"

You can have a sunny hurricane or a heavily raining, cloudy sail through a calm water.\nThe missions, where do I begin? Some are good, some are terrible. I like the cruise ship missions, they are fun to do and good to play, I only tried a few other missions but they were terrible, I played one mission 4 times over, I had to sail out of a dock at 10 knots which took forever to get near the exit, and when you get near the exit (There is NO prior warning of this) It tells you to stop, and if you do not manage to get your massive ship to stop within 3 seconds, you fail the mission and have to start over again. Very poorly done.\nThe controls are very accurate, and the weather effects the controls very well as you can imagine, and the ships have different controls which are set to what ships of its kind in real life have.\nAlso having to enter a product key at the start of the game for the game itself and every DLC it comes with is pretty irritating.\nI might be wrong on this but also Im not sure you can edit settings such as controls, audio, graphics ingame. Pressing ESC only gives you the option to Save, Cancel mission or resume. I might just not have seen it elsewhere tho,\n\nOverall I would have given this a +1, but becuase of the poorly made missions, and the graphics and lack of damage on ships (which doesn't bother me much, its mainly the missions I care about) Im gonna give this a No.\nIf you like ships, and like simulators, then I really recommend this game if it is on sale , It is a good play if your into this kinda thing, but I think the full price isn't worth what you get. Although a few patches could easily fix it up!","March 21, 2015","false","6.0"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","46","57","6","0"

I set the wind to maximum "hurricane" setting and went out into the Atlantic in a speedboat, sailboat and tanker and the waves are nothing like a "perfect storm", more like a choppy 3 mtr swell. Couldn't tip the boats or damage them in the slightest. Waves don't even break over the bow. When I do manage to "crash" into waves it glitches and either spins the boat chaotically into the air or stops its momentum dead. Not at all realistic and absolutely NOT EXTREME. The water is a 2D plane with no attempt to deal with the camera dropping below the waves - which happens constantly - so the water appears hollow. Scenery is dull. Textures are average. Simulation is as simplistic as it is inaccurate.\n\nConclusion: Meh. Not even worth $10.","May 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","38","50","3","0"

Free roam the seas, or play various campaigns, single player missions, or through multiplayer mode, Ship Simulator Extremes has a lot to offer the Ship Simulator enthusiest; However, there are also a few serious drawbacks. There is no playable tutorial, which teaches you how to operate the various ships, so you are thrown into campaigns, missions, and even free roam, completely blind. This makes the learning curve difficult for people who are casual players even if you have prior experience with other simulators. The piloting controls are based on realistic controls for each ship and you will need to figure it out as you go, which does give the game an interesting challenge, but could be seen as a turn off by those who do not want to spend hours doing what a playable tutorial would teach in minutes.\n\nAnother problem this particular game is notorious for is difficulty running on high end machines. I only experienced one crash in the little over an hour I played, so this is something to keep in mind if you have a decent gaming rig. The scenery looks great and the boats are very detailed, but it takes a while to get from point to point, so you need to have a lot of patience to play this game. All in all, I thought it was great as a simulator, though I have to knock it for the lack of a playable tutorial. The missions you can do are interesting, such as stopping cargo ships from dumping in the ocean, and so on. There is a lot to do in this game and the DLC's offer even more ships and missions to experience. Just make sure if you spend the money on this game, you are prepared for a steeper than normal learning curve and have a boatload of patience.

Broken as a home in Beverly Hills. Although the costumer support swears the game works, that is a dirty, rotten, pee soaked lie. I have tried everything they have told me to try and get the game to work....Still a no go. And the terrible part is they insist that the game is absoluteness perfect in everyday. I tried very hard to get it through there thick heads that the game is broken....But no...nothing. I even try dumbing to there level and agreeing with them for a bit, but everything kept pointing to a problem (WITH THE GAME!!!!)......Just to point there idiocy here is what a support staff said to me on the forum. "I had a problem similar to yours when i first got the game...All games seemed to work SS2006, SS2008, and even the Ship Sim Extremes demo. But the full game still wouldn't work" After he said that he still tried to convince me that it was his PC that had a problem, and not the game.......So Mr. Costumer Support all games on your PC work except this one, so there must be a problem with your PC.........That makes total since.\nAnyways I'm getting on a bit of a rant here, so I better change my attitude.\nOK, So to sum it all up, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Just don't buy it! It is, as i said BROKEN. All you will be doing is spending a few dollars on a game crash simulator.....Come to think about it, thats what they should call it. Game Crash Simulator 2015! Game of the year right there! Represents the title perfectly!\n\nP.s. See how much time I've spent playing this game....Thats been me, spending that much time staring at a CRASH HANDLER!!\n\n.0000000000000000001/10 TERRIBLY AWFUL GAME Double negatived to emphasize the badness of this title.\n\n\nEDIT: OK, so I'm on vacation right now. So I brought along an old laptop I had sitting around the house for entertainment on the ride here (I wasn't driving) Anyways, out of curiosity I installed Ship Simulator onto the laptop to see if in any way it would work........it did. The game freaking' worked. It wouldn't work on my PC at home that is 10 times as powerful, but it would work on this....That makes no since to me! The developers said that my PC was the problem, and that it wasn't powerful enough for the game. But CLEARLY it is! If a laptop which has a AMD radeon processor and graphics card which I may add ISN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK (The forum said so), why can't my PC run it......I'm lost. And now I can't get a refund because I played the game......\n\nAnother edit: It works on linux................................................","March 18, 2015","false","24.6"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","16","27","8","9"

For starters the amount of hard drive memory the game uses up is enormous! Though Ship Simulator Extremes ran smoothly with no frame-rate issues the amount of memory used caused significant problems for me elsewhere on my PC. I also found the gameplay to be quite fractionated in terms of continuity mostly due to having to change terrains all the time in free roam (or Sandbox) mode.\n\nThere are only two terrains which allow realistic free roam experiences to the player. These are Bora Bora around which attention to detail is essential when selecting larger ships and the English Channel which allows Dover to Calais (and Isle of Wight) ferry crossings. So many of the others allow the player to navigate their way out of one of several huge real world ports ... Before having to change terrains which can only be done manually involving the rather disruptive selection process. The appearance of many of the ships also tends to be quite 'cartoony' rather than photo-realistic especially when viewed internally from the Bridge. There are some good points which mostly relate to the phenominal level of detail featured within each terrain. Also the DLC Content available through Steam greatly enhances the game in a number of ways: Especially the Ferries pack which was my favourite DLC download. Ship Simulator Extremes also features a built-in Mission Editor facility but it is strongly advised to read up on how to use this before attempting to do so.\n\nAm I sad about this non-recommendation? Yes as Ship Simulator Extremes did genuinely appeal to me when I bought the game along with a number of the DLC downloads. But with so much hard drive memory required and generally  fractionated and disrupted gameplay SSE receives a no-no from Me.","August 9, 2014","false","37.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Moving past how unrealistic this program is for such a purpose, what you actually get when purchasing this game is a restricted version of the actual software, from which the snazzy screenshots above comes from. First off the game only runs on one core, so all the multi-core power in the world won't help you run this game at max graphics, which is still below the quality of the store page screenshots. (Which is, in fact, false advertising.) Nope, you purchased the game but you won't get the nice graphics or the FPS.\nWhat you do get is a tacky, low-fps downscaled game that doesn't live up to be called a ship simulator.\n\nThe gameplay feels extremely linear, which is bizarre considering you're travelling on water, but is more or less inherited by the A to B mission objectives. Sometimes you have to do more than take your [boat] from one place to another, but then the game is deaf on its own triggers and tends to ignore the objective completion trigger the game told you to do earlier.\n\nSo in short, nope. I don't recommend it unless you're into mental challenges on par with Desert Bus. In fact get Desert Bus instead.

Zweiter Versuch: Runtime Error nach 90 min.\nDie Spielerfahrung in jenen 90 Minuten beurteile ich als mangelhaft.\nDie Grafik ist auf dem Stand von 2008, für einen Simulartor ganz hübsch. Das ist auch schon das positive.\nNegativ fiel mir als allererstes auf, dass das Steuerrad des Motorboots nicht animiert war. Ein Tutorial gab es nicht, also zuerst try and error, anschließend gegooglet und ein paar eher weniger hilfreiche Pdfs gefunden. Die Pdfs konnten aber auch nciht hilfreicher sein, denn die Steuerung ist unter aller Sau.\nDas Kreuzfahrtschiff kann man nur mit Hilfe der Maus steuern, da wenn ich das Ruder inkremental mit der Tastatur bewege (Shift + Pfeiltaste Links oder Rechts), drehen sich die Steuerhebel mit, allerdings nicht parralel zum Rad, sondern irgendwie, womit der Dampfer vom Kurs abkommt.\nIch bin in Simulationen schon Flugzeuge, Autos und Raketen geflogen. Hier bin ich zum ersten mal gescheitert.\nEntweder ist es enorm schwierig ein Boot in einem Kanal geradeaus fahren zu lassen, oder dieser Simulator ist für den ♥♥♥♥♥. (Nebenbemerkung ich habe schon ein paar echte Boote gesteuert, deswegen finde ich für mich: Der Simulator ist für den ♥♥♥♥♥.)\n\nFazit: Man lernt nix, es macht wegen der Steuerung nicht wirklich viel Spaß, zumindest nicht genug um nach einem Absturz wieder anzufangen.\nDas Geld kann man sich hier definitiv sparen.\n\n---\n\nFirst try: Runtime Error while loading the first game. Second try: Runtime Error after 90 min.\nWhat I saw in this 90 minutes was not good enough, to give it a third try.\nGameplay: No tutorial, you have to look everything up via google. The view is nice, but wheel at the small motorboat is not animated. You can't steer the big ship via keyboard (if you use shift + <- or -> it makes some senseless stuff. Or maybe it is right, I don't no anything about boats.)\n\nIf you want to learn anything about boats, this is not the game you are looking for.\nIf you want to waste money on a buggy game, just go ahead and buy it, or do what ever you want, I'm not your boss.","May 28, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But then I was teleported somewhere else, to tow something with a tugboat.  Meanwhile, the giant cargo ship crashed into the bluffs somewhere else.  Very silly!  And when I was towing a tiny boat around with the tugboat, I kept running over and completely sinking it -- but that didn't fail the mission.  I just needed to tow it into the right location and I win!\n\nAlso, the waves' animations were absolutely insanely broken -- and you've just got to get that right in a ship simulation.

I had great difficulty getting it to work\n\nThe demo worked perfectly but the actual game wouldn't start, I tried all the suggested fixes and eventually it worked. (http://steamcommunity.com/app/48800/discussions/0/35220315708393043/). However looking in the community hub it seems 50% of people who buy this game still can't actually play it. It is a risky purchase better suited for when there's a sale.\n\nThe game itself is a lot of fun if you are into it. Be aware that it is a VERY slow-paced game.\nHowever overall it has a nice balance between relaxation, concentration and technical skill.\nIt is also very challenging, where mastering the different ships is quite difficult because they each have different handling and steering. If you buy the collection you get a handful of campaigns, there's free-roam and singular missions to do. I'm only 4 hrs into the game but it is just as fun as I imagined it to be.

Well.... it's not a game... it's a simulator. In reality, sailing/piloting a vessel (other than a few terrifying/suspenseful moments which are quite rare) it is relatively boring. If you're not REALLY into ships then this is most certainly not for you.  I enjoy it, the missions keep you entertained with purpose, the scenery is impressive, not the best, but not the worst. A good graphics card and plenty of RAM will increase the visual enjoyment.","September 6, 2012","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After installing the game I had the same startup problems like most do, did some research and found some sort of a solution. It didn't help to resolve whole of the problem but at least it got me to startup the game.\n\nNow being able to run all pre-mission/gameplay functionality such as "options, profile, choosing game type" so basically everything eventually, 'except' launching of the actual gameplay itself. And I haven't found a way yet to surpass this issue. So I'm more or less as good as nowhere when it comes to solving this sh*t..\n\nFor example, I've abandoned EA's platform 'Origin' a while ago because of their arrogance and poor support for the PC gaming community. And lame market deals on games which should have come with all DLC included, whereas they actually still are being advertised and sold through their store this way without any notification what so ever. Only to find out they had the store taken down long ago!\n\n- Say whuuuuut??? Isn't this like pure theft legally?\n\nJust to highlight a brief example from a response back after a request for technical support regarding my DLC problems: "the PC is a second hand gaming platform and had been abandoned for most of it."\nSo I decided to move to Steam as my gaming platform thinking this would be a trustworthy corporation. Not !!!!!\n\n-Selling a product without notifying the buyer that the product he's being sold in fact is broken or incomplete is theft Valve, and in most countries suable by law!\n(Not that € 14,99 euros is worth the effort, but it axplains a little about how easy this stuff is done to people without further consequences.)\n\nAnyway save your money for better developed games!!\n\n\n========\nUPDATE !!!\n========\n\nSo.. I got it working by following these steps :\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Verify local content in Steam by 'right click' on\n"Ship Simulator Extremes" in your list of games.\n> select 'properties> select 'local files' in tab menu> select 'Verify integrity of game cache'.\n\n2) Download and run the x86 and x64\nversions of C++ available here:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=26347\n\n3) Reboot system\n\n4) Run unregister.exe file found in here:\nC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Ship Simulator Extremes\n\n5) Start game\n\n=================================\n\nAnyway.. There are still some minor issues I encounter such\nas low framerate, glitchy textures and poor visual gfx that make\nthis game of little satisfaction for me personally. ːplaneː\n\nBut.. It works for the moment!\n\nHope this will help solve the issues for some of you as well !!","January 1, 2014","false","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","3"

They know not what they say. The people who wrote those negative reviews are hardcore gamers who don't know what a SIMULATOR is. This game is a SIMULATOR. It SIMULATES actual nautical operations. The only action you'll find in this SIMULATOR are the Greenpeace missions, which is basically an approximation of what you see on Animal Planet's Whale Wars...only without the acid being thrown on decks or the legal troubles, yet still involving Japanese whalers in the Antarctic.\n\nFor users of the previous editions of Ship SIMULATOR, the RMS Titanic did not make it in. Seems the MS Orient Star replaced it. But don't worry. There's still a crapload of cool ships to use.\n\nIf you're wondering why the word "SIMULATOR" in all-caps, it's to drive home the point that this is NOT a game for hardcore gamers. Unless you're into causing massive maritime disasters for your own amusement, this is not the game for you. So hardcore gamers, go back to CoD, Halo, and TF2.\n\nAs for simulator junkies, GET IT.

It will not take the Winner DLC key code unless its just me having that problem. Another thing in free roaming i think you should be able to switch to another ship without having to go back to the main menu been a few times i have either got the boat stuck or spawned aground and could not go anywhere and a tiny little life boat is not going to pull a super tanker out of that situation. Now would i recommend this game answer to that would be yes and no it needs a few fixes like the graphics settings dont set when you hit save because nothing happens and the water can be a little glitchy at times which you cant fix if you cant change the settings","December 26, 2014","true","118.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as I can tell it is the exact same game with the same graphics. They added a few ships, but I think they removed at least one. This version is buggier and more resource intensive than it's predecessor. ShipSim 2008 came with quite a few scenarios, but Extremes only comes with 2 and you are apparently expected to purchase further scenarios if you want them. Also, in ShipSim 2008 there were AI controlled ships in free roaming mode, which made free roaming more interesting as you had to navigate around other traffic. As far as I've been able to find, Extremes has eliminated that feature.\n\nAll in all, Ship Simulator Extremes seems to be a considerable downgrade from the previous game.","December 6, 2014","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had no problems installing or running it, no problems with licence keys or anything else. If you want a "game" this is not for you. It is a simulator as the title suggests and if used as such is a very good experience. Careful handling of the ships is required and a bit of practice but it's well worth the effort. OK the water graphics are not as good as some sims like Silent Hunter etc. but they are not bad. Sun effects on the sea are superb and the ships handle as you would expect. Speedboats are very light and nippy and fun to control, whilst larger ships take a lot of time to manouver and stop/start.\n\nThere are a large variety of missions and user created content which adds more value to the whole package as well as multiplayer which I have also tried, although there are sometimes not many other users online. Overall, a poor game but a good simulator.","June 22, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love simulator games. So I thought, why not try a ship simulator? I've read the reviews here before. Fairly devided. But after playing several hours I'd say the don't buyers are at the right end.\n\nAlthough the game seems realistic, and actually tries very hard, but it's far from it. I can sail at 90 degrees. You can crash without consequence. You can crash into smaller ships and you will stop whilewith your mass you should continue. It can't deal with great forces.\n\nBut thats not the bad part, it's the fact that it's so incredibly boring and slow. Doing stuff tages ages and the there is no variaity in the game. Almost nothing happens.\n\nThe good stuff is that they've tried hard to make it realistic and the developers have succeeded in several aspects. Such has the water looks quite awesome, the ship moves fairly realistic along with it and the steering feels like this is how it would be in real life.\n\nBut all in all, don't buy.","January 3","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't a game as such, there are scenarios which give a variety of tasks to complete - not all of them terribly easy.  Some of the physics can go awry - towing the bulk gas tanker is one where having tugged too hard to get the big devil moving, I couldn't find the brakes (!), and it ended up pulling my tug backwards.  There is a lot in here to enjoy, though, if you have that kind of interest in things to do with ships - they don't behave like cars, or aeroplanes - everything goes quite slowly until that crucial monent when a turn or change of rudder or throttle has to be timed to the split second or there will be a bit of a disaster!  I find the level of immersion to be deep and most enjoyable - but I think it requires some research and quite a bit of understanding.  Parking the P and O cross channel ferry in Dover is an example - reverse parking is not everyone's forte.  It is possible. but even skippers with several years sea experience can find it unnerving.  If you don't want to have to persevere and reach an understanding of the physics and hydro dynamics maybe you won't enjoy this sim - but for me, it is by far the best out there at the moment.  I'd love to see a warship game with graphics and physics as good as this has.","August 10, 2015","true","174.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love simulator games. So I thought, why not try a ship simulator? I've read the reviews here before. Fairly devided. But after playing several hours I'd say the don't buyers are at the right end.\n\nAlthough the game seems realistic, and actually tries very hard, but it's far from it. I can sail at 90 degrees. You can crash without consequence. You can crash into smaller ships and you will stop whilewith your mass you should continue. It can't deal with great forces.\n\nBut thats not the bad part, it's the fact that it's so incredibly boring and slow. Doing stuff tages ages and the there is no variaity in the game. Almost nothing happens.\n\nThe good stuff is that they've tried hard to make it realistic and the developers have succeeded in several aspects. Such has the water looks quite awesome, the ship moves fairly realistic along with it and the steering feels like this is how it would be in real life.\n\nBut all in all, don't buy.","January 3","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
