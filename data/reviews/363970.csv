"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/363970/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","A horrifying examination of human psychological weakness, Clicker Heroes is more disturbingly respectable than clear satire such as Progress Quest for being a fully realized and quite serious effort of game design, but it is not to be played—it is to be hooked up to a computer in a museum where children can go and watch it work (from behind the safety of a thick glass shield) so that they might return home motivated by recurring nightmares which serve to forever remind them of the ease with which a person can be seduced into wasting their life.\n\nIf we ever manage to build utopia, the cornerstone of its educational program will be a forced hour-long session of Clicker Heroes that ends with students being informed that their genetic sequence has been inextricably attached to their game profile and that they will be unceremoniously exiled to labor camps on the Moon if they should ever demonstrate the feeble-mindedness necessary to return and play for a second time.\n\nWhen the human race is finally enslaved by its mechanical progeny and harvested within illusory biofarm prison-paradises, our digital overlords will have no need of an elaborate computer simulation to placate our minds; for that they will have Clicker Heroes.\n\nIt is a masterpiece of modern art and social engineering, one of the crowning accomplishments of all mankind.  Now get the hell away from it.","July 16, 2015","true","2.6"," 1,961 of 2,097 people (94%) found this review helpful 1,664 people found this review funny","94","961","2","664","35"

I just don't like what these type of games make you do. Get addicted to some other game. Thank you for reading this humble little review.\n\nBack then, most clicker games had a better idea when to stop, like Candy Box, A Dark Room, & Space Lich Omega.

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar (don't stir). Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes. Whisk in the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla.\n\nWhisk the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the salt and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until thick and slightly sticky. Knead on medium speed until the dough gathers around the hook, 6 minutes. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons flour if necessary.)\n\nRemove the dough and shape into a ball. Butter the mixer bowl and return the dough to the bowl, turning to coat with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 1 hour 15 minutes.\n\nRoll out the dough, fill and cut into buns (see instructions below). Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan; place the buns cut-side down in the pan, leaving space between each. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325.\n\nBake the buns until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl, then whisk in the cream and melted butter. Transfer the buns to a rack and spoon the glaze on top while still warm.\n\nHow to Form Cinnamon Buns\n\n1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle with the longer side facing you.\n\n2. Spread with the softened butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the far long edge. Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the butter.\n\n3. Brush the unbuttered far edge with water. Roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder and press on the long edge to seal.\n\n4. Cut the cylinder with a sharp knife to make 6 equal-size buns.","December 16, 2015","true","15.8"," 358 of 475 people (75%) found this review helpful 416 people found this review funny","75","358","475","416","5"

Pursuing the game actively highly involves clicking the enemy target for as long as your fingers, toes, and other creative means allow you to go on. Do take note, that even if you decided on taking the active route because it may seem like you'll progress faster in the short future, in the long run, the difference isn't as huge as one might think.\n\nPassive gameplay involves opening the game, leaving a few tweaks on upgrades and then closing the game again. The main aspect of this gameplay is what it does while the game is shut down, as it also fights passively for you once you get your very first few upgrades.\n\nFor both gameplay types there's a later game strategy, as you decide between which skills you use and which special supportive powers called Ancients you invest in (by spending hero souls, the currency of the game). These can highly change the speed of your progression throughout the game. However, sooner or later you'll hit a wall where your damage is simply no longer enough for progressing with your current upgrades. This will force you to start the game countless times back at stage 1 in order to earn more hero souls for upgrades. So, you'll have to gear yourself with remarkable amounts of patience (if you can call it that) if you plan on getting anywhere in this game, as it won't change an inch beyond selecting upgrades.\n\nMy main objective when I started the game was to get its achievements, which I at first thought would've been a breeze considering the lack of any requirements beyond clicking. It's even capable of idling and playing itself while you're gone. How hard can it be? The plan was to only spend small amounts of time on the game, which didn't happen, as the game also rewards you for actively playing. Hoping to rush through the game quicker for the achievements, I continued.\n\nThe trap in all of this is for people who wish to 100% it, for this is no easy task due to it being the same thing for something which feels and looks like... an eternity.\n\nWould I recommend people to play this game? No, I really can't say that there's anything to come here for, other than a quick fix of satisfaction for a few minutes for the active player, just to realise later that you'll be that bit more disappointed that you even spent your time on it in the first place. And as a passive player, you're in for a long wait consisting of tiny upgrading and no variation.\n\nThrough all this, I've learnt that clicker games don't work for me, even though I had thought they might've at first! At least not when it's executed in the way that Clicker Heroes had. Perhaps I would've been better prepared for it in the beginning had it been called Passive Heroes. And maybe by removing the clicking feature alltogether, and making it a passive waiting game would've made the experience very different.\n\ntldr;\nIt gets tedius very, very fast and you should probably be spending your gaming time elsewhere. I wouldn't want to recommend such an experience to anyone. It feels like a human experiment. The princess is in another castle~\n\nOverall, if you insist and MUST play it, I would recommend the passive route a lot more and think of the game as passive heroes instead of clicker heroes, as the reward vs investment in active gameplay is just not there.","August 2, 2015","false","886.1"," 136 of 170 people (80%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","80","136","170","26","9"

No? Yes? Well it doesn't matter, because you don't have to click anything. You can just have it open in the background and do nothing. You'll still win. Clicker Heroes is a game with a beautiful art style, its just there's not a lot going for it.\n\nKilling enemies gives you gold, then you use the gold to buy upgrades to increase your damage. Your first "hero" does damage clicking. Everyone else does damage by doing nothing. Other heroes have critical percentage, gold drop increases and so on. Each hero has their own special skills to upgrade and by special skills, I mean 100% dps then 150 dps and so on.\n\nOther characters have real skills to unlock like one that does 10 auto clicks per second for 30 seconds with a 10 minute cooldown. After my 24 hours with the game, I've unlocked maybe 5 skills that I can use outside of 100+ skills that improve dps.\n\nIt gives a false sense of achievement that makes it addictive. There is always something to upgrade to improve your damage per second, so you're actually engaged enough like a monkey clicking buttons. Its brilliant, yet lazy.\n\nThe basis of it is simple, every level has 10 enemies you need to go through to unlock the next level. Wow 10 enemies, multiple heroes, it sounds awesome! I get a party of 50+ people at once, but you never see them. You buy them, but don't see them fighting. There's no danger. Sitting there will win... over time.\n\nSo here's a story... I setup a second computer to only play this game. Then I set my mouse to do 30 clicks per second, then put a brick on it. So for each of my 30 auto clicks, that would be 30 clicks with your finger. Good luck trying to do 30 per second. Once I took the brick off the mouse, I'd have to wait a few minutes for the game to catch up with the clicks.\n\nEven with the "small enemies" option to reduce the input lag, the game just can't keep up with the clicks, but rest assured all of those clicks will happen, even if you accidentally have your mouse over one of the Reddit, Facebook or Twitter links. Imagine one browser having the same page open hundreds of times.\n\nEvery so often I'd upgrade things and take on bosses. 24 hours later, I'm on level 70 and looking at the game's achievements there are 160+ levels. After investing 24 hours of cheating my way to level 70, I start to wonder what's the point? You're looking at a 60 hour game here that's all clicking! Don't want to click? Well it might be 120 hours. That's just speculation though.\n\nWhat's that? You don't have the time to spend 24 hours devoting a computer specifically to cheat on this poor excuse for a game? Well just sink real money into the game's micro transactions and buy RANDOM upgrades. Wait wait.... so you have to pay for "rubies" to get anywhere? No in the 24 hours I "played" I managed to find 3 rubies. I think you need 30 rubies to buy anything. Its cool though. Think of the 24 hours of enjoyment that my 2nd computer had playing the game!\n\nI'd look over to the computer and see it smile at me asking, "Are you having fun playing the game?" Then I'd reply from across the room, yes second computer, I am having fun playing, even if your monitor turned off a long time ago.\n\nEvery fifth level is a boss fight! Each boss fight gives you 30 seconds to defeat the boss or you lose and it resets with full health. If you didn't beat him the first time, you won't beat him the second time. So its back to the previous level to grind for 10 - 20 minutes. After level 60 that 20 minutes turns into 2 hours. That's when it turns into an issue.... do I want to watch this game play itself or do I want to buy micro transaction rubies? What's that there's an option C called never play the game again? No it doesn't work like that. You'll "play" it and love it for its beautiful art style and dozens of thrilling characters that are just objects to spend gold on.\n\nOnce the game becomes an insurmountable grind, that's why you can "ascend" to a new world where you'll get to use however many hero souls you've collected in the current world. Ascending restarts you at level 1 again, but at least with the hero souls they do 10% extra damage per second... until you spend them.\n\nThe game offers tiers of artifacts, things like 5% more gold, 10% more treasure chests, 5 extra seconds on the boss timer and stuff like that. Once you've bought them you can then level them up with more hero souls, so before you know it you're getting 100% more gold and your "clicker skill" lasts for 40 seconds instead of 30. You can even spend your hero souls on an artifact that makes every hero soul you spend on it worth 11% damage.\n\nHow do you earn hero souls to use on your next ascension? Bosses over level 100 are randomly primal bosses or whatever they are called and they'll give you a small amount of souls. Small like 1 - 5 hero souls in levels 100 - 200. Again, its random, but even if its random I feel like every other ascension gives you a lot more souls. You can also earn them for every 2,000 levels you've upgraded your characters. Its easy to do, 100 levels at a time sometimes.\n\nOn top of that, because the game is constantly updated, you get an item for each world usually after level 100. You can keep 4 of these items and need to junk any extra before you can ascend. These items do what the artifacts do, but on a scale that you cannot level up.\n\nAvoid this game, its just a trap. Its a well made trap that looks pretty and almost sounds like a casino. Turn the sound off and its drastically less entertaining. Of course how entertaining is something that plays itself with only you pushing forward to beat a boss.","May 17, 2015","false","280.4"," 298 of 410 people (73%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","73","298","410","59","21"

The game is very easy to understand, yet, there's deep strategy involved. You click to deal damage, you buy heroes (and upgrades) to deal damage over time and you buy (and level up) ancients to improve your damage, your gold gains or even reduce the amount of monsters you have to kill to progress.\n\nThere are tons of ways you can play the game, just by the way you build your ancients. You can focus on having your skills last for a long time, you can focus on dealing as much damage over time as possible without clicking or you can make it so your clicks are extremely strong. Of course, with a lot of time and effort, you can buy and level up any ancients, but the amount of time it takes to get there depends on how good your strategy is.\n\nAlso, they are always adding new content to the game and improving it, so if you ever get bored, come back 3-6 months later and you will have new heroes, ancients and/ or features that will have been implemented!\n\nPROs:\n\n-It's free.\n-It's fun.\n-It's easy to play.\n-The game is being updated every few months.\n-You can leave the game closed and you keep progressing.\n-You can play this game while waiting for multiplayer games to start or when you have 5 minutes of free-time at work.\n-The achievements are great and there are many to unlock (most of them are also Steam Achievements).\n-The replayability of this game is endless...\n-The monsters and backgrounds are really cool.\n\nCONs:\n\n-There's only 1 music in the game.\n-It does get repetitive, but starting over or waiting for updates usually does the trick.\n\nI totally suggest ANYONE try out this game. It's really great and it's free. Also, you can obtain rubies while playing (so no, it's not pay-to-win). Also, beware that this game is tremendously addicting!

When the monster dies it drops gold. You accumulate gold and purchase upgrades which makes your clicking stronger. Monsters only vary in visual display and have no abilities or resists. Only an ever increasing pool of health which is depenant on the zone level. Killing 10 monsters in a zone level will open up the next zone level. Every 10 zone levels there are Bosses. Special monsters with much more health which only give you a timewindow of 30 seconds to beat before they restet to full health and the time window starts anew. You must kill these in order to progress and can see them as "benchmarks" to check if you are ready or not.\n\nApart from active play the game will simulate your progress (measured by your DPS, not clicking damage) even if you are offline tho you cannot progress passively (yet). Entering the next zone is an active thing but if you are missing out on gold to purchase that next upgrade you can let it run in offline mode for an hour or two and continue from there.\n\n\ngoing deeper\n\nClicking is only your first layer tho. You quickly open up new heroes which provide you with your second layer of gameplay. DPS aka Damage Per Second. These heroes deal damage over time on their own. Even if you stop clicking damage will continue to pour in. So DPS is kind of like a passive buff for your game. Apart from buying heroes to become active (first purchase to level 1) you can continue leveling them up to make their DPS stronger in turn enhancing your killing power of the monsters on the screen.\n\nIn addition each hero has a set of abilities which unlock at certain levels (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100) providing better capabilities or ACTIVE ABILITIES\n\n\nit becomes more then mindless clicking\n\nThere are 9 active abilities you can trigger at any point. Each one has an effect duration (usually 30 seconds) and a cool-down preventing you from spamming them. Effects range from more click damage to more gold per kill to support buffs and even a permanent damage buff. Unlocking these abilities and timing their use will become a key part of defeating higher level Bosses\n\n\nit just doesnt stop\n\nThere will be a point where you ll run into a "wall". Monsters will become so powerfull that it takes a long time to kill them and bosses will eventually become so mighty that you will be unable to beat them even if you use all your active abilities. This is the point where you use the "Ascension" feature for the first time.\n\nAt first it doesnt sound like anything anybody in his right mind would do. "Creates a new universe, much like the current one. This will restart your game and you will receive XXX Hero Souls".\n\nWait.....It just resets my game to level one....all gold and hero levels are gone and I simply start over? LAME!!!!!!\n\nBut wait....whats these hero souls then?\n\n\nHero Souls....the meta game\n\nHero Souls are kind of a permanent currency coming through an ascension. Each one you have banked (read....showing in your display) will increase your damage by 10%. Its accumulative so if you have 5 your whole damage will increase by 50%. With 10 of these babies you ll DOUBLE your damage. So even tho you have to go through all the levels you beat beforehand a second time.....THIS time will be far easier and much quicker to get to the point where you grinded to a stop before and continue past that point.\n\nAnd thats not all. As a permanent currency they open up the market for a special sort of heroes. The Ancients.\n\n\nAncient Heroes....the game turns tactical\n\nWhat makes these heroes special is that they also....just like Hero Souls transfer through an ascension and you gonna keep them. There is a whole list of them and each one buffs your game in a special way. Purchasing them costs hero souls. Leveling them up costs hero souls and you ll need to start thinking about what will give you the most bang for your buck (read....do you keep the HS banked or do you invest them?)\n\nYou ll soon realize that many ancients support each other so getting the "right mix" of ancients can massively increase your efficiency at going through the treadmill (ascend and go through all those levels again).\n\n\nThe truth comes out...whats it all about\n\nNow the game shows its true color. With all these features unlocked you are ready for the neverending(!) "management and improvement of resources" to push further on a new try which makes so many other genres successfull.\n\n4x\nRTS\nRPGs\nARPGs\nEconomy Simulations\n\nIf you enjoy any of these genres chances are you ll LOVE clicker heroes. Its free to play so what do you have to lose?\n\n\n\nMe...I find myself booting it up almost every day and even tho I ascended more then a hundred times already it doesnt really get old. The asciension is more like a "test run" by now to see if you made the correct choices on spending your hero souls and which ancients to get and level. Its this "game within game" which makes me come back....certainly not the clicking. Theres some form of "grinding" to get enough HS but many games have this so not really a problem.\n\nIts a most simple game and the fact that its so addictive is baffling in itself.\n\nFor myself I can say that its been a great way to "waste" my freetime so far. I dont regret picking it up :)","June 18, 2015","true","335.7"," 61 of 73 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","61","73","12","0"

Yet I despise it much more than other clicker games I've tried so far. Yeah, I know "Clicker Heroes" is still in beta, and will be improved in some way. But from my point, it is beyond help. And no, it is not about broken mouses and/or fingers due this process.\n\nYou see, all clickers in general seems to me much like facebook games ala "Farmville" - you redistribute some resources, closing the window and returning to it after some time, to collect more resources and expand a bit. So on and so forth, you do your things, and your clicker game living its own life, killing some monsters, collecting gold and precious achievements for your profile... Generally, I don't mind, I have more time to do my things, while my profile expanding with help of that freeware stuff. But all that is not about Clicker Heroes.\n\nWhile at start it looks just like other clickers, after some progress you facing the fact that you need more and more time in game. Without your guidance, the game will be stucking in one place for too long. After 1000+ completed levels, it is getting even worse, as you need to wait more and more for the next "Hero" to unlock. Gaps between normal playing, where the game can play itself, to some freaking grindfest, where you sitting by hours, making all that clicking by yourself just to get over one boss level... It is not Farmville anymore, it looks like those self-proclamed RPGs (you can find those in Facebook as well), where are no story, and so much grind, that you eventually catching yourself installing some third-hand script, which is presumed to get your hands free, at least for some time.\n\nI hate games like those. They are not giving you fun, they do not entertain or educate you. Quite opposite, they make you dumber. To the point, where you starting to pay up with your money for some "boosts", which gives you a freedom of 2-3 minutes to not proceed with all that clicking by yourself.\n\nSo yeah, love yourself, stay away from Clicker Heroes. If you still want to see that, "just with one eye, just for one minute", I suggest you to look for another clicker game. Tap Tap Infinity, for example, is much alike Clicker Heroes, but it stays in Farmville pattern, not morphing into timetrap like Clicker Heroes.\nMy mark is 4/10. It is playable, it is free at start, and it is still possible to get all achievements... But you will do yourself a great favor with not getting into that.\n\nPS Am I have to remind someone that third-party scripts that supposed to "help you with the game", can do some other things on the way? Like collecting your data and passwords, for example?

A game about clicking and clicking even more to be able to get upgrades so when you click your clicking is better, you do more damage with your clicks as you have to kill enemies and bosses to get to the next stage.\nBut you don't need to click to move through the levels, you can buy heroes for coins that are dropped in-game these heroes damages the enemies for you. Although by clicking it does go faster to kill the enemy. Once the heroes are bought you can start leveling the heroes and buy upgrades to them or save up coins to purchase a new hero. You can do all that by just using your mouse and then you just point and click. Really simple.\n\nThere isn't a huge amount of different monsters but there isn't a too small of an amount of monsters either so you won't see the same enemy over and over again after each other.\nYou can see your stats and achievements in-game, yes this game has achievements, it has around 60 achievements at the moment. A bunch of levels and heroes, an endless game! I have no idea if It's endless but i assume it is :P\n\nI'd like to point out that it is not Pay 2 Win which is good! But obviously there is stuff to buy for real money but it's not necessary but It's probably easier to progress if you pay. But still not necessary.\nGraphics are good.\nGameplay is easy. Not much to do other than clicking and watching.\nIt has sound effects and in-game music which isn't disturbing, you can easily turn it on or off if you'd like by clicking. But i did wish that they would allow you to lower the Audio in the options instead of either turning it completely off or on, but luckily I found out that you can go to your sound mixer thingy and turn it down a bit there if you'd like.\nOptions are simple like i said about the audio, wish they made it so you could change the volume in-game. They even have a options to make the monsters tiny, in case you lag it'll help reduce the lag for you :)\n\nIf you want to try it you definitely should, doesn't take long at all to install and if you ever get tired of clicking you can keep the game running in the background but make sure you've purchased a hero that can keep slaying monsters for you while you're letting someone massage your clicking finger. I use the index finger for clicking but who knows you may use your thumb.\n\nAnyway good fun game just don't get stuck because it is pretty pointless. But it's a great way to kill time if you're maybe waiting for something or someone.\nI might have missed a few things to say about the game but I'm no professional review writer. So if you're going to hate on my review go ahead :) But any tip for future reviews would be helpful.\n\nAnother word for this game is:  Money\n\nEDIT: 2015-05-18: This is just a review about this game with my own opinions, if you're looking for a guide i recommend: Beginner's Guide to Clicker Heroes by [DFC]Richard","May 16, 2015","true","337.3"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","45","60","11","4"

Can be extremely addictive!\n\nTL;DR\nClick, collect money, upgrade rinse and repeat.\n\nHero Souls:\nWhat's giving the game some longevity is that after a little while you can (and must at some time) "Ascend". It's a reset back to square,you get this fairly early on the game "unlock from one of the regular heroes". At that time and forward in the game you can ascend at anytime you'd like. You get to keep collected currency "Hero Souls" for your "special" heroes, you also keep your special heroes and their level.\nBasic heroes, level, gold and zone progress is reset back to zero.\n\nSounds tedious, but the dev's managed to "slip" in some "but not much" other things here and there to keep it interesting.\n\nWhat's keeping me in the game is the hunt for those precious Hero Souls (HS).\nHS drops from special "Astral bosses with HS" witch starts to come into play from zone 100.\nFrom now on they can spawn on every boss encounter (every 5 levels). On some run's you can get a lot, some time not so much. You also get 1 HS for every 2000 combined level upgrades of your regular heroes.\n\nThose HS can be used to either buying and/or upgrading your special heroes or you can just horde 'em. They give you a flat 10% damage increase pr HS you keep.\n\nAchievements:\nAnother thing to mention, this is a game where achievements matter, most of or if not all of them give you a damage boost. Ranges from 3 to 5 % DPS increase. There are a lot of them, and they do add up. Nothing really hard or creative here. You get em for by just playing the game. This is not a review of the achievements, wanted to mention that they have a purpose.\n\nOffline play:\nI must mention that the implementation of collecting/farming gold while you are offline is the reason this game was not uninstalled after and hour or so on my part. Feels so good to progress as far as you'd like, and just quit the game or even minimize the game window and surf the web, work whatever. The game farms at that spot, brilliant.\n\nF2P:\nThe F2P model is good, you get the currency in-game as well so you don't have to spend money if you don't want to. I feel that this game is generous giving you this currency "Red rubies" in-game compared to some of the other F2P games I've tried.\n\n\nFinal note:\nYou can play this active or passive. Play 5 minutes, 1 hour, 10 hours it's up to you, it doesn't punish you for going offline.\n\nA decent game, I'm still having fun at this time 52 hours in. Most of those hours are minimized i must confess ;) Still playing though. c",)\n\nEdit: Spelling and structuring.","May 25, 2015","true","379.2"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","30","37","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holychan/recommended/363970/","holychan","Mireille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holychan/","293 products in account","If you want to improve at maths, play this game. It's more about calculation to figure out the best DPS and fastest way to gain "hero souls" than it is about clicking.\n\nThe way it works, you get a whole bunch of heroes. The first one improves your click damage, and all other heroes do DPS, which is an acronym that stands for Damage Per Second. Literally, they do damage automatically and you don't need to do anything for it. You increase their level to make them do more damage using gold dropped by monsters you kill. At certain levels, a new skill unlocks which gives effects ranging from increasing that hero's damage by 100%, or increasing overall DPS by all your heroes by 25%, increasing your click damage by a certain percentage of your heroes' total DPS (which is actually the brunt of your click damage), etc. Some of them teach a skill. There are nine skills in the game. For example, Clickstorm is a skill that automatically does 10 clicks per second for 30 seconds, with a 10 minutes cooldown. Proper use of skills is important to kill monsters faster. Especially because...\n\nThere are bosses. You have 30 seconds to kill them. If you don't kill them in time, you can't progress to the next stage. Every stage consists of ten monsters, and there is a boss every five stages, on multiples of five. By stage 100 and above, bosses have a chance to be "Primal", which is a special version of the boss that drops "hero souls". Every boss from stages in multiples of ten starting from stage 100 (100, 110, 120, etc) give a "gild" to a random hero from your list. At stage 100, you also unlock ancients.\n\nHero souls is a special "currency" that does two things. First, it increases your base DPS (what you have when you start the game) by 10% for each hero soul you have. It doesn't show in your DPS that is shown in your total current DPS shown in the hero tab, but it definitely affects it. Having hero souls is important to improve your damage and general progression, or else your DPS is too slow. However, they also serve as currency to unlock ancients.\n\nAncients are special "characters" that do various passive bonuses. There are a bit over 20 of them, and four are selected randomly for you to pick one from. It can be rerolled if you don't want them, but that costs hero souls. Anyway, ancients effects include increasing all your DPS by a certain amount but only when you are idle (i.e. not clicking or using skills for 60 seconds), increasing the amount of time you get to fight a boss, increasing click damage, getting a LOT more gold from random treasure chests, etc. Ancients are absolutely key to progressing in the game, so you need to find a good balance between keeping enough hero souls on yourself to keep a good DPS bonus, while still improving your ancients that will benefit you more than the hero souls' DPS you lose for improving said ancients. It can get very technical on a mathematical level.\n\nGilds are a type of bonus awarded to your heroes. They're assigned to a random hero when you get them from defeating a boss that is a  multiple of 10 starting from stage 100, but it is later possible to move them to other heroes for a cost (in hero souls). A gild improves that hero's damage by 50%, and gilds are cumulative. For instance, having five gilds on a hero increases its damage by 250%. You definitely want those on heroes that gain a lot of "attack bonus" skills on themselves (such as Masked Samurai) rather than on heroes that have other effects that don't involve having a lot of DPS (such as Alexa which mostly improves click and critical damage, Midas which mostly improves gold drops, etc).\n\nFinally, "Ascension" is the other important mechanic to explain. Once you get the skill "ASCENSION" from the hero named Amenhotep, you can learn the skill to do an ascension, which brings you down to the first stage and you lose all your money and your heroes lose all their skills. In exchange for "starting over", you gain a certain amount of hero souls based on a few things.\n\nHero souls gained from killing a Primal boss are only truly awarded after ascending. Also, each 2000 cumulative hero levels you had before ascension give an additional hero soul upon ascension. When you ascend, you keep your gilds and ancients. With the hero souls you gain, you are able to progress faster than the previous time, and you can get overall further and faster. A lot of the joy in the game is the way you get a little bit further than the last time you ascended, each time you get there.\n\nThere's a bit more to the game, but this is most of the important stuff that you need to know. Another thing of note which, to my knowledge, is not explained by the game, is that after level 200, a hero gains four times the amount of DPS as normal, every 25 levels, and most importantly, ten times that amount at level 1000 (and 2000 and 3000). It's important to note because once you get to a certain point and the next hero (Dread Knight) is just faaaaaar too expensive, you want to go back to your first hero and level him up to 1000 which becomes the new best thing, rather than keep increasing the last available hero (Frostleaf) who gains rather minimal DPS. You'll need to ascend many many times before you can even dream of getting Dread Knight, so get those early heroes to level 1000 which is the new meta at that point.\n\nSince a lot of the progression is done through DPS, which is automatic, it's an easy game to play which you can leave running in the background while you do other things and that you can check on once in a while. One thing of note is that when the game is closed, your heroes still are gaining gold from monsters they kill. It's like the game keeps playing itself even when it's closed, although they won't progress to the next level/set of enemies or go past bosses and such. Only gold from monsters of the current highest stage you're at is considered. Since this is such a relaxing game to play, which you don't need to pay a whole lot of attention to most of the time, I recommend it to whoever isn't afraid of doing some maths to maximize their experience with the game. Or following a guide, I suppose. :p\n\nFinally, it is a very known fact that you can use "autoclicker" programs with this game. I personally don't because it's not something I feel is natural to the game's intent and purposes, but it's something you can do, which a lot of people do. When playing without, most of the damage come from DPS and you don't need to click and/or can click only for important stuff such as bosses when you need the extra damage (and/or when using all your skills together for burst damage). Of course having such a program running nonstop will be a large part of your damage compared to someone playing without, especially with relevant ancients that complement that, so keep that in mind.","May 29, 2015","true","117.4"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","0"

It contains more controlable elements like hero special abilities, a seemly endless level walkthrough and a lot of fancy gimmicks to discover.

Simply because of the fact that its purely meant to consume your time.\n\nYou kill mosters by clicking or idling and use the gold which they drop to improve your character and buy heroes and imrpove those.\nSo far for that. You do that until you reach lvl 130-140 where you simply never ever will pass the bosses. (too low dmg)\nThen, you restart the game. You gain Hero Souls, which give you dmg boosts if you keep them or can be used to buy other extras.\n\nThats it.

It was during  a late night trip to the lid, 1 week and 50 or so ascensions later, that i realized how idiotic it was for me to put so much time into an offline, frankly stupid game. Out of impulse i deleted this game from my steam library and destroyed the file saves i had with it. I feel like a new man. Somewhat comparable to a heroin adict 1 month off the juice.

It might seem fun at first. But once the game starts making you start over and over again for more hero souls, you will know what I was talking about.\n\nBe warned also, that noone can get particularly good at it!\nYour average DPS will always have been planned for, wherever you go, at least within min-max ranges. Because there's no build diversity in upgrading your heroes. Only one way to go.\n\nEven if you intend to rule them all with your 'mighty autoclicker', you still won't get anywhere much faster or slower than the devs intend you to. Clicks per second are capped at 80.\n\nEven if you could manage to progress somewhat faster, what's the point?! It's a single player game!\n\n...With no end! I mean, you could put days, weeks, months into this but what for?!\nOnly to eventually notice that it has been offering too less for your time, all the time, and that almost any imaginable activity would have been more fun.\n\nAs I think of it, I found a good bottom line...\n\nRemember the Men in Grey from the Momo novel?

Yep, it is. Steam ported it over, gave it a few Achievements, that's it.\n\nThis game is all about Farming. There is NO strategy, NO skill, NO storyline, NO failure whatsoever. Just level up 1000x, kill that ultra-hard boss, then find yourself doing all that over and over again. If you are stuck, there is a pay-to-win system. I cannot imagine myself breaking my gaming mouse over this game, and had myself an Auto-Clicker software after 4 or 5 minutes within the game.\n\nIf you are a big fan of endless MMORPG's that focus on that, this is just right for you! But if you are not an obsessive-compulsive person that expects something more than doing stuff over and over again, stay away from this. The comments tell the true, this one is extremely addictive and will drag hours away from your life without giving a thing in return. Funniest comment I heard so far: "Game of the future, plays itself so you don't have to".\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game works just fine. I did not find any bugs within 7 days of gameplay, the characters are well drawn and kind of cute, and there are even performance-driven options (lower gfx quality, removing damage and gold text - why not removing all gfx at all?) and muting sound effects and background music - there is only one, repeated to exaustion.","June 27, 2015","false","881.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","19","27","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/recommended/363970/","artificialraven","ArtificialRaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/","625 products in account","A seemingly endless cookie clicker game that can be quite addictive. With no story, the game is more about seeing how far you can get and seeing outrageously large numbers of damage and gold.\n\nThe game is pretty straightforward although there are a few ways to play it. Click the monsters to deal extra damage, collect their gold and spend the gold on your heroes which increase your overall DPS (the amount of damage dealt per second to the monster when you aren't clicking). Increasing your DPS will also increase your click damage as well. Being active in this way will allow you to get Rubies which would otherwise be bought through micro-transactions in the in-game shop. The other way is to rack up gold by idling, with the game closed you can earn gold when not playing.   Along the way as you level your heroes you can get some unique skills such as increasing the % of gold you earn per kill and ways to temporarily increase your DPS and click damage. Every 5 areas (zones) you'll fight a boss with tons of hit points. There is a catch though, you have to beat him within 30 seconds. This is the standard for testing the way you leveled your heroes and how much effort you put into leveling them.\n\nRecommended for people who are bored, have old/slow PCs or Laptops or just straight up like addictive clicker games like these . Seeing as I'm temporarily (and reluctantly) using an old crappy computer for the rest of this week, I'll be playing this game for a while.\n","May 19, 2015","true","76.7"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","19","27","4","1"

Clicker Heroes is an idle game where at first you pay some attention to it but then it gets itself rolling and you can leave it to it's own devices. But here is the thing, you can't. There is something about the game that makes you stare at it constantly waiting for the next monster to be killed to drop coins so you can get that next upgrade.

But that all changed when Clicker Heros came onto steam. Only the Gaben mastered all four communities. Only he could stop the ruthless Devs at Playsaurus.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/363970/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nClicker Heroes is a clicking-indie-game developed by Playsaurus and released on steam in 2015, however the game was (and still is) available on web browsers July 2014.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: *Atratzu tactlessly copy pastes the description on steam into the story*  Okay, on a serious note, if there is a story it's that you're on an adventure and all these heroes are joining up to assist you. Where are you going? To get gold! That's about the whole thing, Scrooge McDuck.\n\nGameplay: in a word “clicking”. This is actually known as an “idle” or “afk” game. You don't give it very much attention once you start getting heroes, and you even get gold while you're not playing. However, you need to log in to purchase the next set of upgrades or beat the next set of levels/bosses.\nWhen you first start out you need to click each time by yourself to take down the various monsters you're faced with. But soon you enlist the assistance of heroes to do all that clicking for you.\nThere are whole strategy guides out there on steam to help you maximize your efficiency while playing through the game, I personally just log in once before work, then when I get back home, then before bed. It's very easy to rack up hours on this game (since you can play it while you're doing other stuff) So it's very common to see people with many hundreds of hours.\n\nAchievements: To be honest, I thought “free game”? “Play while I'm afk”? “Just requires clicking”? “+Steam Acheivements”? Sign me up! That should be an easy 100% achievements.\nNoooooooooooooooo....\nAt this time I have about a fourth of the achievements in the game. There are 65 achievements in total, the first 10 achievements are pretty much “give me's”, the hardest achievements are “Beat Zone 3,400”, “Kill 100K bosses”, “Open 10,000 Treasure chests”, and many more. Generally after getting to Zone level 160, Clicker Heroes REALLY starts.\nWhile the game is very easy to play, and rather addictive, it is not an “easy 100%”\n\nPrice: Clicker Heroes is completely free! So if you have free time to burn, this is your game. The only type of person I would warn about it is achievement hunters, because if you start this game your total game completion percentage will go down.\nFor everyone else.... Go ahead and give it a try! You'll at least get a good couple of hours of entertainment. And you might even get addicted.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, this is a solid game, it's addicting, simple, fun, and free! It's definitely not a game that will hold your attention like Skyrim, GuildWars2, Bioshock, Left4Dead2, Counterstrike, or even other indie titles... but it doesn't try too! It embraces the definition of “afk game” and yet still makes it fun to play, in a strange almost mystical way.\nI can easily recommend this to anyone with time to burn.","July 8, 2015","true","711.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","4"

Then after you become a little more powerful you get stuck at doing only up to level 160-170 for about 1 month. Before this game came to Steam and was only a flash game on the internet, with 100-150 souls you could reach level 180 with no problem and with 150+ souls you can do up to level 200+. Now, you play for a week or two, get to 100/200 souls and you can  reach level 130-160 with no problem. BUT after that comes the mega-uber-never-seen-before farming. I had 300 souls and I can barely reach level 170-180 level. Unless you give a lot of real money for this crappy game, then you will have to farm for the rest of your life. Oh... and at some point you will see that this game won't be so casual, you will sit for 10 minutes, but you will see that, that won't be enough at some point, the game forces you to waste up to 40-45 minutes of your time and probably even more as you progress. I do NOT think this game even deserves to be on Steam, but that's my opinion. In any case I do NOT recommend this game. It's a HUGE waste of your lifespan, believe me I lost somewhere around 30 hours(the 70 hours you see are because I've been AFK for over 30 hours) in this game. Believe me it isn't worth your time!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalax/recommended/363970/","metalax","[DFC]Richard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalax/","513 products in account","A fun little game. Ironically, despite being named Clicker Heroes, you will likely spend long periods not clicking at all once you are past the first few ascensions. Later, most players move to a hybrid style where the majority of a run is performed idle, and clicking is only used for the last five to ten minutes.\n\nA few points that may put off some people. If you find any of these especially objectionable, this is likely not the game for you.\n\nWhile usually classed as an 'idle' game, Clicker heroes requires more interaction than most games in that genre, especially during the first few ascensions.\n\nIt is also slow to start, usually requiring one to two days to get through your first ascension, and still requiring several hours to get through your next few. Once over that wall however, ascensions can drop down to thirty minutes or less.\n\nAlso, as is inherent with most games of this type, there is a lot of grinding, especially in the late game and, as previously mentioned, right at the beginning.\n\nFinally, there is no actual end point at which you can say you have 'beat' the game. At the time of writing, the last defeatable boss occurs on floor 4720, but this may change in future updates, and does not limit the growth of your Ancients.","May 14, 2015","true","584.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngeloOlteteanu/recommended/363970/","AngeloOlteteanu","Angelo Olteteanu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngeloOlteteanu/","280 products in account","I always give games a fair chance. And I played this one for now 17.5 hours, got to level 113 I think and then stopped because there is absolutely no point in it and it really annoyed me that it just got slower and slower to the point where I would pretty much have to restart it to do anything to continue. This mechanic is totally not fun where the game producers just made a game with minimal effort and then decided they are too lazy to add anything more to it so they just made it harder and you have to restart it. There is no real achievement in this game, no story, no point whatsoever, you just click and click, buy heroes which do nothing and don't ever appear on screen, you just get more numbers and more numerical upgrades. And the damage increase is something like this: At the beginning you do 1 damage. Then at some point you do 1M damage then 1b and 1t and so on and the monsters all look the same. And you can't even advance the game by playing it. Quickly after you get the game you realize you just have to quit and let it auto-calculate the money you'd be making, then come back, put some more useless upgrades and repeat, And then, it gets to a point where it is realistically impossible to do anything other than restart it for a bit of extra damage. Yes, actually RESTARTING it meaning you will go through the EXACT same many levels as before and throw away the hundreds of upgrades you got for your heroes and lose your progress and then having to beat the same monsters that give you little gold and look the same to buy the same exact heroes that do nothing with the same exact upgrades and just let it 'play itself again' so you can get in it and play it for a few minutes the next morning or something. This game is utterly STUPID in this sense and I really can't believe that the gaming industry which has set new standards for large stories, large worlds. complex gameplay, art and awesome feeling can have all these standards completely ignored and have people produce a game in which you just click, buy upgrades that don't do anything, you just see different numbers on screen, heroes which don't even appear on screen and then there is absolutely no continuity-you have to restart and go through the same exact boring stuff which was not complex in any way to begin with. What is the point of restarting, losing my hero who got to level 650 so that I have him from level 1 to upgrade him again in absolutely the exact same way and get the same exact 'skills' (there are no choices here, just a 'damage' boosting level-up) in a way which brings me no satisfaction? This game is absolutely worthless. And I am glad I didn't do any microtransactions because they are just disgusting in this game. So you have the option to pay real life money that you work for just so that you can avoid the stupid mechanic of having to restart the game all over again or having to let it 'play in the background' so you can do anything with it. I am glad I didn't pay anything in the microtransactions because I would have felt cheated and I already feel cheated because the steam achievement system has already mixed my rate of game achievements with the one in this game and got it down because the achivements in this game are absolutely ridiculous-like an achievement to restart the world 160 times or something. So I played the game for a week, then had to throw everything away to restart it once and they have an achievement to do it 160 times around...absolutely pointless. I love games very much and praise them for their entertainment and education value but this game is just absolutely pointless. Thumbs down. Don't play it. You will get a false sense of achievement for a little while then realize this game is a very brutal and insulting scam where you just stop progressing and have to pay for it. So I should pay 100$ to get rubbies just so that I don't have to game 'play itself' and have to do useless levelling and restarting. What is the point and satisfaction in that? Absolutely none, I spend money on games to get satisfaction from them, not to avoid getting annoyed as much as possible by them. I now realize this game is absolutely abusive in that way :). I am glad I didn't put money in it just for the achievements because the I would have looked at them and remembered how I sent a lot of money to get cheated by a game...this game is absolutely a hoax and shoudn't be on steam. I hope games like this and adventure capitalism will soon not be allowed on here anymore because they are insultingly trying to rob you while pretending to be a game.  Better than pay 100$ for rubbies which  will just let you play-I don't know, maybe an extra 20 minutes continuously without having to let it play in the background because it as all you do, better buy some awesome and complex RPG like Skyrim, Witcher, Dragon Age or anything really which will keep you playing for hundreds of hours and give you really fond memories, art and feeling. Or you can buy a real life collector's edition of a real and really awesome game with that money :). The only feeling I have after playing this game is that it tried to cheat me to pay for something I didn't want or would bring me any happiness and I am relieved I uninstalled it. I hope 'games' like this stop appearing on here because they are not games, they are a hoax in disguise, and I really liked steam a lot before, now I am unhappy with it that it lets games like this in here to just try to rip its customers of for a little more money while causing great unhappiness afterwards. This is really bad marketing, Steam is encouraging this with the achievement thing so you have a false sense of achievement and in the end if you pay for it you will probably feel very unhappy and cheated because you got nothing for your money, you just got abused...","May 26, 2015","false","32.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Turning each click into nuclear hellfire that pushes you further. But no matter how far you push, the monsters always overpower you, drawing you into a stalemate that you must escape. Only to repeat your mistakes.\n\nThen you meet Siyalitas. He shows you another way. "Click not, and I shall unleash my power" Then the idle times begin, allowing you to gather hundreds, then thousands of souls to feed the ancient's hunger. You learn that your weakest heroes will become the strongest. Clicking becomes only a last resort against an unstoppable foe. You pass hundreds of levels, knowing there are thousands more to conquer. This is where I find myself. Is this my new life now?\n\nI basically haven't stop playing for a month and I've barely scratched the surface. But everything now is just math. Which hero will help me the most? Is my DPS higher with souls or a fed ancient? How high can the numbers get? It feels like exporation, but is it?\n\nAm I still having fun? I'm not sure. I know that I did for a long while. That's more than I can ask from a free game.","June 18, 2015","true","224.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","5","5","4","3"

Yeah ? If you do and you got addicted to it then this game is worse - in terms of getting addicting.\n\nThis is simply an addicting clicking game where you ... click ... on a monster. You might think it's boring but some other features take care of that. You can hire heroes and buy upgrades for those heroes and - no i'm not finished yet - you have skills that you can use ! (Obviously with some cooldown) Most of the heroes does dps (damage per second) and the more you have .. the easier it gets for your finger. It does damage automaticly after all.\n\nFurthermore, this is not a pay-to-win game. It does have a shop with their own currency (rubies) but I don't think you need it. It might be a way to support the developers tho, maybe .. i guess. The game drops sometimes a ruby here and there (yes, rarely). There are also hero souls, but for now I don't know what it's used for.\n\nSome tips:\nIf you're playing on a laptop - use your mousepad and 2 fingers = double clicking speed !\nFor people that only have a mouse and one finger to touch that mousebutton... don't click too hard or you'll need another mouse.\nYou can easily farm:\nWhen you close the game and later open it again then don't be shocked when you suddenly have much gold.\nYou can do other tasks when the game is running, whenever you have x dps (damage per second) it does it automatically for you.You can save a game and import it later (on another pc or so)\nAlso, there will be a difference at making love with your girlfriend - it will improve sooner or later ;) (like i will do ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )\n\nAnd how to close this game ? (No, really .. there's no "exit to desktop" or any kind)\nHave fun clicking all !!

I cannot believe how much hours I have clocked into this game. It is very strange that a simple concept of fooling the human mind with a free game and small insignificant rewards works SO well.

Understand, that this clicker game makes you click (or not, when in idle mode) to gain gold ... to gain heroes ... to gain levels ... to gain gold ... to gain heroes ... and so on until the end of time. There is no real gameplay here. It's just you and the game, together, forever. There are things like achievements, hero skills, artifacts and recenlty added guilds. But all of this matters only slightly, because you WILL grind for up to hundreds of hours. Even with auto-clickers. But ... I have to recommend it ... with this many hours played ... I could not click on the "No" button ... this is my most played game of all time. But beware reader, if you are OCD or an achievement hunter you should not start this ever or you'll be lost like me!

With your clicks you deal damage to the monsters and every killed one drops money. You use this money to level up your heroes; monsters of higher zones have more health but also drop more money. There are 10 enemies per zone and every 5th zone is a boss. Some of these bosses drop Hero Souls (HS). They raise your damage (10% per HS) and you can buy or level up Ancients (there is one for everything: more money, more damage, more HS, more, more, more). Once you can’t go any higher you ascent (restart) and go again, so every run should go deeper and faster.\n\nThey just added clans, where you fight with 9 other players against bosses (3 x 30 seconds every day). The reward are some additional HS for your main game.\n\nAnd yes it’s totally free. You can buy Rubies (the currency of the game). But consider it more as a donation, because you’ll get them for free while playing.\n\nThe graphics are OK and a million times better than this creepy Steam summer game.\n\nSounds easy: You’ll click at least one million times till your right hand hurts; then (with the right ancients) you don’t even need to do this anymore. You just level up your heroes. Day by day, week by week.\n\nIs it fun: WTF, didn’t you read above?! I just told you this game is boring and repetitive. I’m sitting here every day and level up my heroes. That’s all: level up heroes!

You can stop for however long you want and come back to money. I started at version 3, played through until 13, stopped and came back for 14-17b while the game did not have microtransactions. The style of playing the game changes depending on who you are but it never required rubies or autoclickers. The original style before ancients that disappeared due to a change at version 11 was using (or abusing according to the developers) the damage multiplier from the ritual. That was nerfed and was replaced with ancients which required the new souls. These souls were given based on the progress you had made up that point, giving everyone free amounts of souls (30 hero souls for level 120). The new style was for me was taking advantage of theclick combo or idle multipliers.. Both adding new styles of gameplay. I came back to play again to finish getting the newly added achievements along with the steam counterparts to them.\n\nRubies are not necessary.\nAutoclickers are not necessary.\n\nAncients provide a way to progress.\nThings are taking too long?

Clicker heroes is a game where you grind, so that you can grind faster, so that you can grind, so that you can grind faster, etc. in a never ending cycle of grinding. But what is the actual grind? Nothing. You just sit and watch as numbers get bigger. You have no real choices to make. You earn gold to spend on upgrades to earn more gold so that you can spend on upgrades to earn more gold and there are no wrong choices, only slightly inefficient ones. You can do some clicking as well but 99% of the time you don't need to. If you ever played a game like Diablo, any kind of loot game or RPG where you grinded to level up, you get the exact same experience, but here you don't have to do anything at all. It's brilliant how they distilled the essence of an entire genre into its bare components and showed how pointless and stupid Diablo-esque or any game with grinding in it is. Even though I didn't recommend it, because the game is shallow and pointless, you may as well at least try it, since it is free, and think of this brilliant game when you play other skinner box type games.","October 10, 2015","false","25.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Clicker heroes is a game where you grind, so that you can grind faster, so that you can grind, so that you can grind faster, etc. in a never ending cycle of grinding. But what is the actual grind? Nothing. You just sit and watch as numbers get bigger. You have no real choices to make. You earn gold to spend on upgrades to earn more gold so that you can spend on upgrades to earn more gold and there are no wrong choices, only slightly inefficient ones. You can do some clicking as well but 99% of the time you don't need to. If you ever played a game like Diablo, any kind of loot game or RPG where you grinded to level up, you get the exact same experience, but here you don't have to do anything at all. It's brilliant how they distilled the essence of an entire genre into its bare components and showed how pointless and stupid Diablo-esque or any game with grinding in it is. Even though I didn't recommend it, because the game is shallow and pointless, you may as well at least try it, since it is free, and think of this brilliant game when you play other skinner box type games.","October 10, 2015","false","25.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK81/recommended/363970/","CK81","CK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CK81/","1041 products in account","Can a game where all you do is click your mouse be good?\n\nYes, it can.  Almost every game I've played, even some of the games I pre ordered, I didn't play long my first session.  Usually takes me a few plays to get into the game enough to stay playing for hours at a time.  I've played one session on this game so far, 4.3 hours worth.\n\nThis game can be addicting.  You play a while, constantly trying to get a little more gold to level up your guys then tell yourself "Self, I think I'm going to take a break from this and play something else".  Then 4 hours later you're finally able to pull yourself from the game.\n\nReview:\nProsThe game is SIMPLE, almost as simple as they get It's actually pretty entertaining\nRuns very smooth, no frame rate drops or anything and in the 4 hours I played, 0 bugs that I noticed\nIts FREE to play.  Of course has an item shop (How do you expect these guys to make money otherwise?)\nYou don't need to buy anything.  I made it to lvl 52 in the 4 hours I played, sometimes staying in a level for a long time until I got each one to die within 1 second with just my warriors dps and haven't needed any items from the shop. I'm sure later down the levels they may come in handy though\nThe Upgrade system is nice.  You buy warriors to help you kill the monsters.  They add some DPS to the fight so you don't have to click as much to kill.  You can upgrade them and unlock new skills/perks which make a huge difference.\nOnce you build enough dps, you can take a break from the game and it will still make gold for you.  My daughter had a major leg surgery last week and we have to help her get around the house.. I let the game set while I helped her and came back to having about 500b gold.  This also helps you when your wrist gets tired, just stop clicking and let the game take over.\nCons\nHonestly, I don't really have much to say for the negatives of the game, but I'll give it a shot.\nIt's simple.  This is a good thing and a bad.  If you want something to kill some time that's not difficult, this game is for you.  BUT if you're wanting a little more than just clicking your mouse and buying some upgrades, this probably isn't for you.\nYou can feel a little strain in your wrist area if you click too much\nNeeds an EXIT button.. As far as I could tell there wasn't one... I had to ALT F4 to get out.  Not a big deal, but wouldn't hurt to have one for those out there that don't know how to exit a program using alt f4.. And yes, trust me, there are some still out there.\nI'll post a short video later of what I got done in 4 hours.","May 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

And the developer is an evil genius!\n\nIt's just about clicking on a monster that is just there, kill it, get money, get upgrades to kill more monsters faster and get more money to get more upgrades, rinse and repeat, THAT'S IT! Oh and you can leave at any moment and the game will continue killing and gainning money for you.\n\n\nIT'S SUPER STUPID AND YET SUPER ADDICTIVE!! LIKE A DRUG!! I HATE THIS GAME AND I LIKE IT!!!....\n\n... did I mention you have to restart many times the whole thing? Yes, you have to if you want to advance quickly, play all the levels you have been through, and then you realize "DA F^CK!! It took me one day to reach this level and now that I restarted it takes me a couple of hours!"\n\nDON'T PLAY THIS GAME! You have been warned...\n\n\n\nUpdate: After 1225 hours I got the last achivement, I played mostly 15% of that time actively (and while reading news, watching series, playing other games, eating, pooping, etc)\n\nI played almost every single day, I left many times my laptop turned on with an autoclicker running, yeah maybe that's "cheating" but after getting the achivement of 250.000 clicks manually I decided to do not break my wrist and my mouse just to stay "ethical" in a game that was made with the autoclicker use in mind.\n\nAnd still, with an autoclicker and doing a lot of skills activations and clicking fishes for rubies I got the last Achivement in 1225 hours, 1225 HOURS!! ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MOTHERFATHER FREAKING TWENTY CRAWLING FIVE HOURS!!!!!\n\nYeah yeah, I now there could be better strategies but still I stand my point! Just imagine for an average player who check the game and ascend once every two days, just imagine how long it's gonna take them to reach all the achivements! And if they are not playing for the achivements I will assume it's becuase of the amazing plot of the campaign, massive neurons disconection or lack of self respect, you know, tha same when you abuse alcohol","July 9, 2015","true","922.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

You don't really need to go right now. You continue shopping and eventually you need some help. So you ask the guy named Steve to help you find the right lightbulb for your wife's lamp (she is never happy with the choices you make, but how can you screw up a lightbulb?). So you and Steve go and look and you find the perfect one on the display model. You look down but you can't find one in its box, so you ask Steve if he can find one. He looks again, but he can't find it where you just looked (I guess he doesn't trust you). So Steve goes to the back and looks for a lightbulb. All of a sudden, that ♥♥♥♥ starting coming back to you. One minute you are fine, the next it starts turtling out. You're afraid of public restrooms (freaking high school, right?) so you run to your car, forgetting the lightbulb and Steve, and drive back home. That drive home is painful. Your stomach is growling and your ♥♥♥ feels likes you're in prison. You make it in, run past your wife who is screaming at you for not getting a lightbulb, and run to the bathroom and quickly shut and lock the door (you wouldn't want your wife barging in). You sit on the toilet seat with your pants down and begin the slow ascension to ecstasy.\n\nThat moment when the first poop falls is how this game feels.","July 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

Strange thing about this game is it still plays even when you're not there.\n\nCute and fuzzy enemies drop onto a platform which is meant to represent an area or location. You click on them to attack and after killing them you get some money. Money is spent on buying team members who contribute to your damage per second. You can also use the money to upgrade your characters simply by leveling them up and increasing their DPS, Eventually there is a chance you might be able to add on some perks of theres and even cast some spells which create some buffs but only for a short time. You can complete an area by killing 10 enemies then you move on to the next area, the monsters might take a lil bit longer to kill but if your DPS is stupid high you wont even have a chance to click to move on. There's boss battles every now and then but its just a longer life  bar and they can withstand damage better than the lesser minions. Then you just move on. and it repeats. over and over and over again...\nJust when you think you've got the top upgrade, There's another character to unlock and it seems to be no max level on anything.\n\nThey don't fight back so you can't really lose. In fact if you dont attempt to attack, enemies will just stand there waiting to die. I think the game should be renamed and called 'Clicker Fodder' because I dont see what can be so heroic about killing suicidal crane game creatures. However it IS free and I've put some time into it just so see where it would go but unfortunately I'd probably give it the thumbs down. Its fun to watch and see how fast you can kill a critter within seconds after you've invested in the upgrades. You can even entertain yourself by trying to click as fast as you can. But I just felt like the gimmick wears out pretty quickly.\n","June 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

If you like any of those clicking, idling or farming games, then you'll probably like this as well.  Its interesting to keep up to date with your heroes as far as upgrades and levels.  There is just something about these games that makes them so entertaining.  Now the one thing I've noticed is there is micro-transactions and there are people who instantly hate a game because of that, however, consider the following:\n\n-The game is free to play.\n-After the fact above, paying for anything else is the only financial support this game will get.\n-I don't see this as a traditional pay2win complaint since you don't have to worry about other players doing this unlike in other games with this feature.\n-You don't ever really need to buy any of the abilities, they can earned in-game by grinding the crap out of it...like you should anyway.\n\nOther than that, it is repetitive, but all clicker games are in their own way.  I have no real complaints.  Its fun and interesting, auto clicker software works on it, and it can run in the background to make grinding less painful.  With no cost to you, check it out and maybe for once buy some rubies to support this great greenlite game.","May 14, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Keep in mind that I've played countless hours of this game soley on the browser version and so my current number of hours does not represent my knowledge on the game. However, I admittedly haven't played in a while. I did a quick recap of this game on steam and it hasn't changed much.\n\nLet me start out with stating the fact that there is a bizarely shocking number of people who dislike this game for various reasons. Let me list some common reasons I've seen in the reviews on the Steam version of the game and a short response to each one.\n\n1) The game is basically cookie clicker with microtransactions.\n\nResponse: So what? First off - it's completely free to play. If you knew what cookie clicker is and how it did things you know this game is all about grinding gold and such to get upgrades to your clicks. Furthermore, you don't even have to do anything to rack up gold in this game after a certain point. You literally don't need to "play" it. This is achievement grinder 2015.\n\n2) The game has no "skill" or anything involved. "It's just clicking!"\n\nResponse: Pull your head out of your ♥♥♥ promptly. Please locate the part in the description of this game where it says this is a "Highly skill based game!" and then I'll get back to you. It's as casual as it gets, truly.\n\n3) Pay to Win.\n\nResponse: AHAHAHAHAHA oh god. Please! Please!\n\n4) It's easy to just cheat so what's the point?\n\nResponse: I don't know. If you feel like breaking a game and finding ways to cheat in it (IE: getting an auto clicker of sorts) that's your own thing. Truly, who gives a damn? This isn't an MMO, this isn't Call of Duty. You're only cheating yourself out of hours upon hours of "riveting" gameplay. This game is meant to be casual in the first place, so do us all a favor and stop your ♥♥♥♥♥ing please and thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that that's out of the way let me touch on what this game advertizes and offers up front to you, the consumer.\n\n-Ascend to be able to have DPS's of up to " one quadrillion damage per second ".\n-Know how " one quadrillion damage per second" feels.\n-Click on monsters to kill them and get gold (virtual) for it.\n-Hire heroes to deal more damage which in turn will up your kills per minute, which ups your gold per minute in general.\n-"Meet" legendary figures such as Athena. 35 unique heroes to hire.\n-Make your MMO character's feel like kindergarteners because of their damage per second's.\n-Spend your "hard earned loot" to upgrade your heroes and gain special abilities from them.\n-Over 100 different monsters, all beautifully drawn and animated, including boss creatures.\n-Earn gold while you're idle. No clicking required if you have heroes! Earn while you do the laundrey, etc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNow, looking at these features the game seems to offer most of them. To be honest, I haven't put in the play time to verify some of these features but at this point and time I trust the developers on their numbers. I don't think they'd lie to me about what they advertised in their game. 35 unique heroes, I'm sure there are. Over 100 monsters? Great! I'll be counting and I'll compile a list and update this at a later date. I haven't gotten to nearly anywhere near one quadrillion dps but I'm sure it's possible given one of the acheivements for this game is to reach zone 2400 (or something), which would - given my experience - require a "metric f*ck ton" of damage per second to beat anything there.\n\nSo far I recommend this game. That may change if I find the features to be lacking compared to what was advertised. Far too often people expect far too much from a game when the developers didn't even advertise it. A game shouldn't be based on anything other than what the developers advertise regarding a rating. That being said, a game can be flat out crap and even broken. However, this game is none of that.\n\nClicker heroes is a very well done super casual game with all the tools a casual gamer could ever want to use as well as plenty of acheivements to complete and many other things to aquire in game for you collectionists and completionists out there. Even if your interaction with the game is minimal you can still enjoy getting achievements.\n\nClicker heroes will receive a high rating from me for a few reasons. First off, I genuinely enjoyed it. It's cute, it's a light bit of fun and can be worth the expresso shots to wake you up in the morning after a hard, long night of advancing your quest to get carpel tunnel syndrome from clicking like a mad man with multiple fingers on multiple hands and feet. No one is there to call you a noob, tell you to uninstall or learn to play, because it's not targetted at an audience such as that. So, secondly, it knows who it's marketing to.

Basically, you click on monsters to get gold. You use the gold to buy and upgrade heroes. And through clicking, damage over time, and certain activated abilities you try to kill more and more to get further. There are bosses every so many rounds. You can ascend the world which starts you over but gives you a special kind of currency called hero souls. Having them raises your damage over time, but you can spend them for greater enhancements in the game. You can also sometimes find rubies, another type of currency you can use to buy certain enhancements to your game. Aside from a few other things... that's about it.\n\nIt's a lot of rinse and repeat gameplay. Lots of clicking, lots of idling, lots of waiting. Sometimes you'll leave it up in the background while other times you won't play for days just to earn lots of extra gold. Sometimes you'll have to keep checking back to make progress or do this or that. Ultimately it's pretty mindless. Honestly, it's not a very good game. It doesn't require any skill because you can never LOSE progress outside of hard restting all the data. Getting better at the game basically means following guides, working out math involved in damage to cost ratios, and timing your playing schedule accordingly. It's more like a time waster. It's a chore. It turns into just another thing you do because you do it.\n\nI like the theming of the game. Using heroes to fight off monsters, getting gold, growing stronger somewhat like an RPG almost. But the gameplay comes down to math, making decisions, knowing when to be on or when to idle, and clicking. That's it. It's pretty dull. This works fine... as an app. It's something you can pull up and kill some time on here and there. But devoting time to playing it is just so dull and a waste. As an app, it's fine. As a GAME, it's bad.\n\nSo why recommend it? Well, it's FREE! You CAN pay money to get extra stuff and make it go faster, but there's no need to. It's a large waste of time, unless you have fun with it. So if the idea interests you, give it a shot and see how you feel about it. There's nothing stopping you. However, I'd recommend getting the app on your phone instead and just doing it to kill time rather than playing it like a game. There are plenty of free games on the internet and many of them are more fun as actual games. I played this one long enough myself. Giving it a score, I'll have to rate it as a GAME, because I'm a game reviewer, not an app reviewer and it's being presented here on Steam, a gaming platform, as a game. Clicker Heroes gets a 2 out of 10 for being a free thing to do in your spare time that is bound to get old.

Simply hover your mouse over an enemy, close your eyes, and enjoy the sounds of frantic clicking and the euphoric sensation of your finger spazzing the hell out. Then experience the wonderful feeling of having to replace your dead mouse with a completely new one!\n\nPros:\n-Lots of numbers to keep you happy\n-No brain function required\n-The game does the math for you\n-You have the opportunity to buy a new mouse every week\n-Finger workouts are a bonus\n-You'll never be bored again\n\nCons:\n-There is no tutorial on how to click your mouse so you'll have to teach yourself","December 20, 2015","true","347.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Within the first 30 minutes I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty surprised with how addicting this game could actually be. Obviously this game can be played whilst you're afk and it's a great little time waster if you're looking for a game like that. A full gaming rig is definetely not needed as the UI is kept to a minimum page. Overall this game has enough to keep you entertained before it may get a little repetitive. 6/10","September 25, 2015","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As soon as you buy the next level minion, all other minions become useless. The number values for each minion increase by stupidly high amounts that you'll be doing quintillion damage a second in a short amount of time, and then you'll be doing damage with values you've never heard of before.\n\nThe game plays itself when you aren't playing it, so the only use you are to the game is to buy the next level minion, quit, and come back in a couple days.\n\nIt's essentially a fully automated "Cookie Clicker" based game with little incentive to do anything at all. In-game currency (Gems) are worthless, character upgrades are worthless, the number system is stupid, your clicks are worthless, each new character you buy is super over powered (until you buy the next one, then it becomes obsolete) and your time spent "playing" this game is 100% wasted.","June 9, 2015","false","18.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You don't need to click a lot as you can hire NPCs to do it for you.\n\n\nCons\n1.) The game gets repetitive as you keep resetting.\n2.)

In actual fact, the fun in the game for me (as a fan of the genre) is in optimising the build order to reach the end game faster.\n\nLooking at the maths involved to help decide what is the best thing to buy or save for at any given time from an efficiency perspective and whether or not you are wanting a build designed for pure idling or for more active clicking is where a lot of the fun comes for me. Watching the deepz grow is just a nice side effect of that!\n\nIt's a fundamentally pointless game, and I certainly won't be taking part in the micro transactions (I'd rather just pay a fiver for the game instead, to help the devs!), but for a few hours of clicking it's certainly fun and if you get into the end game mechanics of it all and the soft reset function that is seen in many of the more developed idling games, then it has a lot more depth than you'd initially think.","May 18, 2015","true","350.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Extremely polished. Great graphics and music. Tremendous depth. Absolutely free- while there is an in-game shop, it really just serves more as a "donate to the developers" button, and you happen to get a bonus of in-game currency, rather than a p2w shop.","June 21, 2015","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I figured it would be just like every other idle game, and for the most part it was. Seeing each and every hero pop up after affording the previous one I became hooked on playing the game on and on. I would not stop playing the game, constantly upgrading my heroes and ascending, never finding the time to actually be idle except between ascensions. The music is really unbearable and repetative and the sound that plays when you roll over coins is cringy after a while. I quickly became addctid to the Clicker Heroes lifestyle, and still am. All in all, I recommend never wasting your time with this game, it will ruin your life and is not worth. Now I need to go to the hospital to get some of my fingers reattached.","June 20, 2015","true","790.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kill monsters, collect gold, upgrade heroes, use skills, find treasure, kill bosses and explore new worlds.\n\nVery active devs that keep balancing the game and adding new features, huge plus to them.\nThe feeling of progression whenever u play or idle and how this all results in more hero souls to progress even more gives a  great feeling.\n\nIt's not just clicking and upgrading there are actually strategies about who to buy and when and also the first heroes, once u make them lv 1000 they get important again in the same run which makes me say this is some great gamedesign and balancing.\n\nAnd well since i needed a new mouse anyway and not wanted too thow my old one out without it breaking down, this was the best game to actually break it. This game was actually also a good stress reliever, instead of hitting my pillow when im angry i can spam click my mouse till i can't click anymore and get tired and fall asleep.\n\nSo since the game offers all this and is free, i highly  suggest to give it a try!","June 10, 2015","true","196.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Otherwise you run into walls (levels 140 Through 180, read below what i did after i discovered how the game was played :))\n\nGet ready to waste your  mousebutton and both hands.\nThe faster you click, the faster you go through the game.\n\nyou start with nothing, click to hit a monster, click several times to waste it.\n10 monsters per level, every 5 levels, a boss.\nThen a timer starts, you got 30 seconds to get rid of ridiculous amounst of hitpoints.\nThe you can get hero's to click for you...Damage Per Second...\nSlay a monster, get money, classic hack and loot..\nbuy levels for your heroes to get enormous bonussen to DPS and clicks.\n\nsounds easy? It is!\nStill the game has enough dept with magic items, ancient souls, hero souls and special abilities you gather during the game to do even more damage...think decillions of damage..\n\nWhen you'll find it harder to get past the normal levels, after al while, you can Restart...every time this happens, you gather souls for more bonus, to get you past these levels...onto more difficult levels to pass...and so you go round and round and faster and faster...\nThe is no limit...and to get beyond it, you'll have to start over and over again..and again..\n\nI would only recommend this game when\n- you're not sensitive to any addictions\n- you have no wife\n- you have no kids\n- you have plently of time\n- you have no life, other than to ravage your mousebutton..\n\nSTRATEGY SPOILER>>> how i did it..after i clicked 500000 times..\n(how it should be done)\n\n1st time:\nget ready to click...\nget to level 120, buy as much levels for every hero to get around 10 souls when you ascend the first time.\ndont buy ancients...yet...the bonus 10% per soul is much bigger than the bonus from ancients at this stage..\n\nYou will notice that with a 100% damage bonus, you will get past the first set of levels much more easily...\n\nNow try to make it to level 120...buy as many levels as possible and hope for extra souls from primal bosses.\nascend...\nagain and again..\nenough gems? buy 3 guilds,\n\nwhen you get past level 140 things slow down...\ngather as much souls as possible untill you reach 200 souls...never go below this amount.\n\nnow try to buy CHRONOS level to 3-4-5 and SIYALATAS level to 20, buy some other totems if you like..but dont spend more souls on ancients if it takes you below 200..\n\nthe go for 400 souls...\nIn the mean time,  try gathering Magical items that increase the chance of primal souls...\n\nfrostbite level 75? after level 140...\nstart with treebeast and level him to 1000...\nthen the next..\nif you have got several guild bonusses, you can level these heroes as well..every 25 levels damage goes 4X...\nthe samoerai is pretty strong...in this phase of the game..\n\nlevel 160 and 165 are hard...for the money you get...\ni stopped at this point almost every time..to get past you have to leave the game @ level 159...\nthan upgrade per 25 levels...try to see which one is the best buy...\n\nbecause you start over and over...you gather 10-30 gems per ascension..untill you have 400 and the descibed levels..\n\nwhen goin into clickmode..you can easily slay beyond 150---do this to get the free guilds every 10 levels..but dont go to the max every time...\ni had runs with only Omeet as 1 primal soul...the next run you end up with over 30 on bosses alone..\n\ntry yo reach level 200 more often...the boss has 8 souls..every time..\n\nThen leave the game for the night beyond level 240...you might have to click to get beyond te last few bosses...\nby that time you level heroes per 25 levels for 10 ^ 35...\nwhen you get there, you get beyond 10 ^40 over night....\n\nThe first 6 heroes are beyond level 1000...by that time...\n\nRearrange guilds, some heroes are weaker, and not needed...select samoerai, treebeast, mercedes...to concentrate 4-6 guilds in them..\nit really helps if other heroes are guilded as well..keep at least 1 guilded and 2 not guilded...\nbe carefull...it cost 2 souls per time...only do this if you go to level 150 faster than 20 minutes.\n\nEnjoy :)","July 31, 2015","true","233.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

And I think it's important to stress: this isn't a game you should actively play. This is the gaming equivalent of a fish tank. Drop some food in every once in a while, watch the number shoot up, and then go back to doing something productive.\n\nI've always loved idle games like Cookie Clicker, Candy Box, A Dark Room, ect. And if you got suckered into those, I have good news: this is the best one, especially given that it's getting continual updates. It has fun flavor text on all the heroes and upgrades, a decent music track for the thirty seconds before you turn it off, and a heap of personality. And if you like those "games" already, you don't need this review. Download it, give it a day, then come back. It's the same itch you need scratch.\n\nIt's not for everyone. Not at all. And I don't think reviews have stressed that enough thus far. The game can be boring, just because there's so little to do. And even though I find satisfaction in my goal to summon every ancient (I'm only five away from completion), I know not everyone else will.  But this is a niche game for a niche set of people, who like to have something goofy to check on every so often while writing a paper, or waiting for a bus, or respawning in Team Fortress 2.\n\nYes, there are microtransactions, but they've been around for eons- recent patches have only made them more obvious. They're inoffensive and totally ignorable. And the developer is obviously capable, seeing as the Greenlight project was announced and delivered upon in the few short weeks I've been messing around with this. I personally don't buy into them because they feel like cheating, though I'm eager to find other ways to support this game since it's scratched my itch so well. The feature where it tracks progress even while closed is applaudable enough. That's a revolution for this "genre."\n\nIt's free to download, fast to boot, and even faster to decide if it's for you or not. It can be a dark hole to fall into, so please remember to exercise caution. But if you have the self-control to enjoy it in moderation, Clicker Heroes is a lot of bang for no buck.\n\nGood luck, and may your mouse be made of steel.","May 14, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's most noticeable feature is how losing on standard enemies is absolutely impossible, the only way you can lose is to Boss battles (as they are timed), so you'll have to defeat older enemies many times to grind power-ups and defeat the Boss. Repeat this every 5 stages and you get most of the game, the fact that it can run in background and litterally play itself is pretty incredible and amusing (even when your PC isn't running, just go to sleep and the next day you'll be able to witness the gigantic amount of money your helpers have gaigned when you were asleep; wich is always somehow surprising...).","October 25, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
