When you name a game "Adventurer Manager," my first thought is that my job would be to outfit the adventurers and let them go on their way.\n\nI didn't do my due diligence before buying this game exactly for that reason.\n\nInstead, most of your time in Adventurer Manager is spent locked in slow turn-based battles or an equipment management system that takes just a little too much effort.\n\nI'd rather be handling diplomacy, town economics, or really anything other than having to do yet another dungeon crawl.\n\nNo one likes a micromanager, but Adventurer Manager forces you to be one.\n\nUpdate following the developer's response:\n\nHi there,\n\nI appreciate your response. First, I'd like to say that this review is a gut reaction. It's not a mechanical critique of the game.\n\nI admitted that I didn't research the game to drive home the fact that my experience is based entirely around impulse buying your game. I'd read an article on either Rock Paper Shotgun or PC Gamer about Adventurer Manager, saw that it was on Steam, and picked it up without a second thought.\n\nMany reviews come from members of a game's community that either love or hate it. I'm a guy who bought it, played it for a couple of hours, and didn't end up liking it very much.\n\nI'm definitely not accusing you of false advertising. You explain exactly what the game is and what to expect on the store page.  Most of my issues with the game stem from core mechanical problems that can't be expressed through screenshots or gameplay trailers. I'd have had to watch someone play the game to see the stuff that left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nHaving bought the game, though, I've also bought my right to share my opinion about it. Steam only lets me give a game a thumbs up or a thumbs down, but in many cases I'd probably pick a middling option.\n\nI decide by imagining if a friend — someone I know who likes this type of game — asked me what I thought. If I could imagine myself saying "You might like it" at some point, then it's a thumbs up. If I can't imagine myself suggesting it to anyone who I know, then I rate it negatively.\n\nHere are some after-the-fact critiques:\n\nI didn't feel like I was progressing very quickly. Most of why I play these lightweight, casual-ish games is to get the distilled seratonin that can only come with upgrading my dudes.\n\nTying class unlocks to reputation didn't feel fun. I'd rather just tell my rogue that he's going to be an assassin now.\n\nI did some thinking during my commute this morning about what I actually meant by "slow" turn-based combat.\n\nThe auto-adventuring feature is a neat idea, but it's functionally identical to the vast majority of the dungeon crawling gameplay. I think my issue is that I'm only exerting agency over 4 of my 48 adventurers at any given moment.\n\nLet's say that the game took a cue for FFVII's "active" turn-based battle system. The adventurers would handle the fights on their own, but the player's job would be to check in on them and reveal enemy weaknesses, give stat-boosting pep talks, and pull them out if the going gets too tough. The time-based turns combat would then give the player breathing room to swap between adventuring parties on the fly.\n\nThese automated parties could adventure simultaneously, and the total number of adventurers you could have in the world at one time would naturally be limited by your ability to multitask between however many parties were adventuring at any given moment.","December 11, 2014","false","2.8"," 206 of 268 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","206","268","4","33"

I'm just having lots of fun managing the kingdom, going on adventures, getting loot.\n\nSeriously, though, the loot in this game is not joking around. There's SO MUCH LOOT.\n\nFortunately, it's easy to manage all of that loot.\n\nA lot of the game design is perfectly fine, in small numbers... but you can have up to 48 adventurers. 48! That's... like 12 parties of 4. I've only got... 20, I think? It's getting kind of ridiculous to manage it. This game could really, really use some better large-group management design.\n\nExamples include, for instance, the university. You select an adventurer, and pick what he's going to learn. Easy, right? Yeah, it's fine if you've got like 4-8 people. At 20, I'm like... okay, someone finished the thing they were learning... who was it? Who's ready to learn something new? Wait, I have to go through this ENTIRE list, one at a time, to find the one guy who's ready to learn something?\n\nI'm really at the point where I don't want to hire any more adventurers, because the management is getting crappy. I've got one favourite party, and the rest can go off with relatively random, fairly mismatched gear. Whatever. What would be nice? A big box, to put "Random Gear of Doom" into, and the adventurers can equip themselves however they damned well please, if you check an auto-equip box or something. Nice and easy! Dump in nice gear, forget about it, profit.\n\nAnyway, aside from problems with scale, the game is just plain fun, and I'm really loving it. Hope you love it, too!","February 1, 2015","true","40.8"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

(3 groups of heroes around lvl 12-14).\n\nThe dungeon crawling itself is done well enough. Most enemies have a weakness against certain attacks or elements and sometimes have special effects or buffs like vampirism or things like that. The loot from chests and monsters is motivating for more and the fact that every class has  it's own skill tree offer different strategies to make the dungeon runs more interesting.\n\nAuto save- a lot of early access games and betas that I have played until now suffered of bugs that made the games crash a lot...and they did not automatically save the progress, so I was often thrown back many hours, which is god damn frustrating. Not with this game, It may crash from time to time and it has its bugs...but I never lost much because of that.\nI also really like the humor of the game.\n\n\n\nThe not so good/bad things:\n\nThe game in its current state is not really pretty, but the Ui does it job and the gameplay can make up for it.\nThe crafting system does not seem really that interesting, same with the vendors because I almost always find equipment in\nthe dungeons that are way better than the things that I can buy or craft.\n\n\nBugs:\nAt the moment the game still suffers from a lot of bugs, which is probably to be expected from an early access game.\nFor example, I once entered a dungeon and the navigation buttons on the Ui just disappeared, so I could not move through the dungeon, nor could I escape it - a restart fixed it and it only happend once and almost no progress was lost thanks to the autosave option.\nAnother bug that appears more frequently is that sometimes when a hero has had a level up, the game is not showing the stat points that I had already invested or the bonuses from the current equipment, which made it appear as if the character was completely broken and useless - which is luckely not the case, a computer restart always helped and sometimes it's just enough to enter a dungeon and teleport back to the city.\n\n------------------\nAside from those points, I really like and appreciate the information that the developers are giving potential customers on the steam page before buying the game.\nThey make it absolutely clear, that the game itself is still very far from being complete and they also make clear which features are already working and what they still want to add. Also, the game seems to be updated frequently. That is sadly not as common as one might think it should be with Early Access games, so well done devs.\n\n\nTL;DR\nTo be perfectly honest, when I bought this game I was not really expecting much of it, it was more like a "it's only 5 euro, it won't hurt me that much"- decision.\nBut, until now I have not regretted it. The game delivered everything the devs promised and I really want to dive into more dungeons, grab loot and level up my characters and I really want to see the game getting big, because it has a lot of potential and can already be quite entertaining.\n\n\n5.5-6 out of 10 for the game for now, because it still needs work to make the dungeons less repetitive and for the grafics.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention some bugs that I have found.\nFor once, sometimes when I revived a hero from the graveyard, the message that pops up won't dissapear. If I hit escape the menu will pop up behind that message and I have to restart the game (the hero will still be alive after doing that)\n\nYou can actually put four heroes into a group and can save that group in one of 4 slots, so you don't have to make a new group before entering a dungeon over and over again. BUT the game allways overwrites all my save slots with the last group that I have saved, which is annoying because of if you have almost 30 heroes things get really confusing.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point, the Ui in the Adventurer menu really needs something to filter the hero list for level, classes or maybe equipment. My suggestion would, to let the player put their heroes in groups on the main/map screen. I think that would help a lot.","July 7, 2014","true","12.5"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","39","45","0","0"

Invasions also need to be sought out and clicked on the map, without it ever really telling the player about them (tutorial issue or much clearer identification, possibly a different color or pulsing aura?)\n\nOverall, the generally clunky interface is not made up for with in game humor or the spark that makes indie games appealing, and the lack of really engaging, well, anything about the grinding, makes it a frustrating mess to me personally.\n\nI can put up with a little grind for a fun story, and the reward of another new one liner or groanworthy pun every few minor tedius tasks (what made me spend so much time and money on Knights of Pen and Paper) can make up for a myriad of sins.\n\nEven discounting the mix up between what I thought the game was, and some shaky wording from what I remember (something about avoiding grinding.) the lack of sufficient little QUESTS makes this game a meh at absolute best for me.  Give us new bits of text, or, even better, new dungeon options or variety, and it would make grinding less of a chore or job. (Something I do NOT do for fun. As it stand I put this on the same tier as scrubbing a floor or cleaning the fridge in a dorm.)\n\nThe autoplay mechanic will definately salvage that, because I do not need to be bored to tears grinding the same exact layouts of 4 or 5 dungeons near endlessly to advance to the next dungeon... and do the same thing again there.\n\nBut as it stands? This makes it a negative review still, and a strong "Buyer really needs to be aware before buying" situation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nSaving original review so people can see it.------\nI was incredibly frustrated, and, well,---------------\nIt felt like a bait and switch at the time.------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal:\n\nIt was pretty fun in alpha.\nNow? Now it is horrible.\nThis is not what I wanted, this is the OPPOSITE from what I wanted.\nClunky mechanics, bugs everywhere, it forces you to micromanage every friggen aspect while doing all the tedious annoying grinding the game was supposed to avoid.\n\nBest of all 9 times out of 10 at level 7+ you have absolutely no way to win if you accidentally trigger an invasion.  Congrats, 45 hours in game for a town to be available to turn in this quest, because, whoops, all your adventurers died due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics.\n\nOh, and don't bother trying to "retire" your adventurers or any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that- no reasonable bonuses till way late in the game, and if you made it that far, you don't NEED them anymore, because you obviously cheated, or are a god of patience.\n\nLame as hell.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs unless you absolutely adore mindless grinding without any real chances of progressing regularly, and a sense of overwhelming frustration excites you.","February 5, 2015","false","29.0"," 46 of 59 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","46","59","0","5"

I am of the generation who saw the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) come out when I was a kid in the mid-1980s and fell in love with video games since.  Without fully realizing it, I was waiting for Final Fantasy to come out in 1991.  Once that game came to America, it pushed every button in my video game life (pun intended).  I knew then that I was a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) fan, and all I ever wanted since then was basically just Final Fantasy with more depth.\n\nAdventure Manager reminds me of those days when I first discovered Final Fantasy: the graphics, music, and play style.  Adventure Manager also fulfills my desire to have "Final Fantasy Plus" - extensions of the game concepts that use modern programming languages to enable greater customization, etc.  I really think that the developer of Adventure Manager did a great job with a concise presentation of classic turn-based RPG elements and a fluid game concept.  While Adventure Manager comes off as an homage to the late 80s and early 90s RPGs, it still goes one step further in areas like item crafting (not hard to do and somewhat rewarding), user decisions when leveling characters (stat allocation and special ability augmentation), and making questing be fair (two difficulty levels, Energy restoration after each fight, resurrecting dead characters after the quest, etc.).\n\nI also read here on Steam that the developer is going to update the graphics and a few other features (including the "Auto Adventuring," which is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, if you've ever played that game).  I am hoping that not too much of the current Adventure Manager system will be altered, though.  However, as odd as it may sound, I do seem to have some faith in this developer's decisions, as I read elsewhere how they tweeked some initial elements of the game to result in what we have now.  Also, the developer has made a game with great attention to detail - you can tell it's been play-tested and optimized.  (For example, filtering item lists for individual characters, saving party formations for easy deployment, etc.)\n\nTo close, Adventure Manager is a game that I will be spending very many hours on.  Yes, it is easy to pick up and play and learn how to optimize, and soon you will get the hang of how things are handled.  You may even get into a groove that some non-appreciative folks might call "tedious" or "monotonous."  But for fans of the genre like me, it's more like "doing work" so that you can build the "perfect cleric" or whatnot.  It's like investing the time and effort to have things go a certain way so that you can bask at your end accomplishment.  In other words, playing a game like Adventure Manager has had me pondering the future possibilities, which I love to do.  So I guess this is a speculator's game.  :P  Nevertheless, for me, the ability to auto-adventure and the ability to create new characters and level them through re-playable quests/levels is the kind of "work" that I enjoy performing.\n\nI've put in about 30 hours of game time in about 7 days of owning Adventure Manager, and I have found myself succumbing to the same issues I did as a kid.  Things like arriving late for dinner, rushing to meet an appointment, etc.  So I have appreciated both the nostalgia that Adventure Manager has invoked within me as well as the genre itself, which I love dearly.  So I'd actually like to thank the developer for keeping something like this project alive, and I hope more will support him.  Adventure Manager is the game I would make if I had completed my degree in computer science instead of changing it.  And I paid $5 for this game on sale.  I highly recommend that you do the same, and keep your eye out for other games from this developer.  This is the kind of stuff that guys like me want more of.  :)","April 29, 2015","true","78.6"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","32","37","4","5"

This isn't a game that takes itself seriously, and yet endears itself in many ways.  Every adventurer has his/her own bio that is completely randomized (and I do mean randomized.  You may laugh at some of the combinations that crop up).  The automatic questing system is a bit slow, but it's meant to be used alongside the manual dungeons where you can control toons actually fighting your foes, picking and choosing from dozens of abilities to win each fight.\n\nThere is much to do here besides dungeon fighting.  You can meltdown gear you find, crafting the leftovers along with gems to tailor the optimum suit for your adventurers.  You can build your castle up with a handful of improvements, send adventurers to University to earn dozens of powerups, and when they are ready to collapse, let them rest up for more forced dungeoneering.\n\nIf paper-dolling is your thing, you may enjoy this game for that reason.  In addition to a ruler/adventurer barbershop, there's a great variety of different items to dress up your adventurers, along with several races that become available who have their own distinctive appearance.  The different graphics that each tier of equipment brings to the equation really sells the idea of progression, and you might feel proud of your little pixel people as they go from rags to weapons and armor of mass destruction.  Of course, the graphical style is pixelized, but the art style is consistent as far as I can tell, and will hearken back to the golden age of console rpgs, and yet this is more than a good, old-fashioned rpg.  The management aspect of the game is very present, with the ability to send your characters on random adventures which will see them slogging through some menial task on autopilot, while you either fast forward, fight off invasions, or go manually dungeon delving.\n\nSince release, I've yet to delve into the game as much as I'd like to, but there is much depth promised as the level cap is set to fifty, and if you play on ironman mode like me, it might be a while before you actually complete all of the content.  As of release, or shortly before, they added the feature of character aging, which sells the progression aspect of it even more.  It's an interesting idea to have your mortal adventurers retire, although I've yet to play enough to reach the stage where I'm incilned to retire them.  Just the idea that your beloved pixel people might die really bursts with intrinsic story, even while it tries to be as silly as possible, it can't help but create its own story as heroes rise, age as the seasons pass, and eventually fall.\n\nYou can visit your adventurers who've fallen in battle in the graveyard, resurrecting them if playing normal mode. I'm unfamiliar with this feature as of post release, but I'm hearing that there's some sort of debuff that's applied when you resurrect them.  Otherwise, you can strip them of their gear if you wish to dishonor them, or leave the gear, and engrave a tear-soaked epitaph that's sure to induce a fit of sorrow.\n\nOverall, if you like pixelized, old-fashioned rpgs or manager simulators, or just wacked out humor and are in need of a few hyucks, you'll probably find something to like about this game.  There's a story filled with humor and over-the-top silliness, but more than that, there's some juicy gameplay.","October 7, 2014","true","99.2"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","35","44","2","2"

The bosses are unique and challenging (depening on the gear you have I suppose)\n\nThere is also a auto adventure mode, where you can train up to 4 parties at the same time and earn money/items.\nThe crafting feature wasn't fully functional when I played it in EA, going to check it out later. The management system (where you can extend your castle with various different stuff) is a nice addition.\n\n\nIf I had to rate this game I would give it a 8/10.\n\nP.S. hope you don't mind my poor english.

If you find my review a little one sided, then just put it down to me loving AM! :)\n\nFirstly what is Adventurer Manager?\nTo sum it up in a nutshell AM is a retro style RPG with a traditional 80's / 90's feel JRPG combat system with a heavy emphasis on humor, customisation and dungeon grinding, loot finding goodness.\nThe game is still in it's alpha stage so a large quantity of what the developers still have planned has yet to make it to release, but it is clear that when it's all in AM will lack for nothing and will be in my opinion one of the most content rich and fun to play games of it's genre.\nDont believe me? Want to check out what the developers has in store? Head on over to the VA Studios forum and have a look  - I think you'll agree...it's gonna be large! ;)  http://va-studios.com/forums/\n\nDialogue, NPC's and Story:\nThere has been a large amount of effort into scripting and designing some of the most hilarious NPC's and random quests and I take my hat off to the devs for still making me chuckle every time I get smited with a paperclip upon completeing a quest. Seriously...The Baker anyone?  :D\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nWhilst the 8-Bit retro feel isn't to everyones liking  I personally find the design of the game to be top class - The amount of detail and effort into making each piece of gear, each mob (be it standard or boss) and each dungeon unique and well crafted is extraordinary. In so many other games of it's type you end up seeing a large number of 'pallet swaps', but not so in AM. Every element has a vibrant and chunky feel to it. There are still missing pieces to some of the art (mostly with regards to skills/spells), but these will be upcoming and I'm confident they'll be just as good as what is currently completed.\nThe same with the sound and music - There are some missing sound effects in the game, and one or two of the tracks are a little short before they loop to beginning however, the music itself is addicting, well composed and well implemented. A few of the tracks have that 'sticks in your head' side to them so all in all I'd definately rate the audio.\n\nGameplay:\nSo far  lvl range 1-21 is unlocked, 3 races and 5 classes to choose from and a host of skills for each class to play around with. The customisation at the moment is limited as the developers primary focus was to get the UI and dungeon, loot and combat mechanics in place however considering the alpha status of the game it will still take many, many, many hours of grinding and getting slaughtered by boss's to 'finish' the current content and with the amount of things on the cards I couldn't want for more! Each update and new feature that gets added is exciting  and I constantly look forward to seeing what is round the corner.\nWhilst in a lot of games grinding can be repetative and dull I think this game has captured well that diabloesque feel to it. Each time I go through a dungeon and find that legendary or unique class piece of loot I get that 'OOOoooo shiny!' feel and I still don't get tired of slaughtering pixelated bats by the thousand lol.\n\nProduction and the development team:\nIt's not often a reviewer would add something about the guys making the game, but my alpha testing has given me the opportunity to speak to the developers via chat/forums and I can say unreservedly that the team itself is one of the friendliest, open, and passionate about their game teams I have encountered. I strongly recommend any who like the idea of being part of Early Access to head over to the VA Studios website, sign up to their forums and get involved with the AM community :)\n\n10/10!","April 23, 2014","true","293.6"," 59 of 88 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","59","88","0","0"

Don't look at my playtime, as I've played many more hours offline.\n\nI greenlit this game a while back, and kept track of its progress. This game has lacked update for quite some time, but the devs at least claim to continue working on the project.

The game's "story" actually will take a while to complete, which makes this game even better. There is also a good randomization system with many bosses and monsters.\n\n8/10: Fun, unique, cheap indie game, but will get repetitive after time.

Yes, some elements feel redundant and grind-y after a while, but the game, even as it stands, contains plenty of other features to play with if boredom kicks in. The gear-forging system is fun, and the mad lib-style generation of auto-quests and character bios is a cute touch. I also enjoy the way skill points are distributed. Rather than gaining a tree of progressively awesome skills, you're allowed a certain number of skills to drop points into as you please. The number of skills allowed (as well as proficiency in those skills) progresses with level. It isn't without flaws; the gold-earning system is a little unbalanced, and as others have mentioned, the combat gets repetitive pretty quickly. However, considering the depth of the game in its current unfinished state, I'm excited to see how it develops.","October 11, 2014","true","77.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Adventurers do not appear to need to get paid after recruitment, and I could see no other obvious restriction (such as adventurer boredom) on recruiting up to the cap. In fact, constant recruiting is encouraged as new adventurer classes are unlocked regularly as you play.\n\nEach dungeon run is done by a roster of 4 adventurers and nets a minimum of 10-15 items, any of which might theoretically be a slight improvement for any one of your up to 48 adventurers. As a result, to genuinely min/max your roster you need to literally flick through each of your up to 48 adventurers every time you hit your inventory cap (which is constantly) or risk tossing potentially useful gear.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a common/uncommon/rare etc loot system, and you can vendor all commons, uncommons etc. this is a blunt instrument because rarity seems largely related to the total number of stat boosts an item gives.\n\nIn practice, because of the usual adventurer stat system, you’re really only focusing on one or two stats per adventurer class anyhow (eg strength and constitution for warriors) and therefore most of the extra stats are largely useless. This means that even common gear can occasionally be better for your particular adventurer than rare.\n\nIn any case, as you’re constantly adding new adventurers to your roster, and these guys arrive with almost nothing, you really need to maintain a fairly large standing pool of basic gear to equip the new guys with.\n\nAll the above aside, the game could be a nice, casual game with some interesting progression, and I like the simple way that dungeon crawling is implemented. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of potential actions available at any one time, and the lack of any noteable quality of life automation, puts this game firmly in the category of games that are much more trouble than they are worth.","April 17","false","4.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

The premise appealed to me, it reminded me of the Kairosoft iOS game, Dungeon Village. But the gameplay just isn't fun in it's current state.\n\nThe turn based battles are just far too slow. The assigned missions aren't too slow (around 30 seconds each) but you need to grind so many of them to level up your adventurers and you need to level your adventurers to progress.\n\nThere are some minor things that I'm sure will be improved upon in patches such as UI improvements. During battles for example you have to select the default attack, select an enemy and then confirm the attack. I'd much rather see this as a one click thing, two clicks if you want to use a special ability instead of the default one. Perhaps streamlining the turning in of quests as well, right now it takes six mouse clicks from the map screen to turning in the quests and back to the map again. It seems like a lot of work for something that must be repeated so many times to progress. Other things that I'm sure will change in patches is the cost to revive fallen adventurers. The cost right now seems very high for such low level people, far more gold than is affordable so instead of reviving them you need to grind levels for new adventurers.\n\nIt's just not fun. Yet.

A lot of features have been implemented so far and for an Early Access title it's definitely got some punch, but a few things still need some attention. The user interface, while reasonably complete, still feels a bit kludgy:\n\n-When dealing with sixteen or more characters at the same time some ease of use functionality like a 'Next' and 'Previous' button for sliding between them would make life much nicer instead of having to repeatedly back in and out of menus to deal with them.\n\n-On the subject of characters, two words: Party Management. The ability to group them out and sort them manually instead of the game's auto sort process which is a constant hindrance to things like University training and gearing them out. Some fashion of control over the list at the very least would go a long ways.\n\n-A way to speed the crafting process (read:salvaging, which is super speedy with greens and greys but takes aeons with yellows and purples) would be dandy. Perhaps a 'Salvage All' option with a confirmation box to make sure you don't accidentally torch something you wanted?\n\n-On the subject of confirmation boxes one would certainly be welcome with castle upgrades, I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally torched a section because the game's mouse settings don't align with my system's setting.\n\nAgain, I realize we're still in Early Access but these are definitely things that need addressing.\n\n\nThat said I've gotten a lot of entertainment out of this one and consider it well worth the five or six bucks spent, and with 1.0 in the not too distant future I've hope that what is all ready entertaining will become even more so.

I read some of the other reviews on here complaining about the slow pace of the game but I really enjoy playing these kinds of games after a long day at work because it just lets me chill and unwind. You don't have to think too hard to play; the adventures they send you on don't even make sense so you don't even have to read the descriptions before you decide to send your adventurers into a random cave. It's just hours and hours of mindless fun haha.\n\nThe only reserve I have about recommending this game is that you need to realize that every time there's a big update there's a chance you'll lose all your progress since this game is still being developed. It might feel kind of discouraging to wake up and realize that you have to start over from scratch, but it is what it is.","July 13, 2014","true","211.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You'll love it or hate it.  I love it.  In it you manage individual heroes which are placed in parties of four and then sent out adventuring.  There are two types of adventuring, auto and manual.  You will juggle resting characters and questing character.  There is a lot of equipment managing like in the old days of MMOs before the streamlining of stats and the auto-stats on gear (expect bows with stats for wizards).  Expect long looks to see if this dagger or that sword is better.  For the $5 I paid, it'll probably give me 20-40 hours of game play.\n\nMy biggest warning is that this feels like a beta.  When I bought it I thought it was a beta.  The devs have openly admitted to possibly reworking some MAJOR game mechanics (time progression).

The bantering gurads on the title screen, and the tongue in cheek reference to Star Wars gave a glimpse at the humor to come. Then that annoying Jester showed up, and I understood why people hated that stupid paperclip in Microsoft Office.\n\nThe game has a unique sense of humor, and solid gameplay mechanics. It gets repetitive fairly quickly, but I could see it appealing to both casual players and hardcore number crunchers alike. Unfortunately, there are too many little things wrong. It makes the game feel unfinished, like a it's a port of a mobile app instead of being built to run on the desktop. On the positive side, the devs are engaged and seem commited to continually updating the game.\n\nAs much as I dislike the Jester, my biggest issue with the game is really the UI. None of the interfaces are intuitive, nor are the elements of the UI consistent. The shop gives you a "Buy" button, but no "Sell" button. Some dialogs can be dismissed by clicking on the background, others have to be closed using the "X" button. Audio settings aren't available while in a manual dungeon. There's no audio or visual feedback that to confirm you hired an adventurer. In fact while there's a lot of audio elements (some of which are quite annoying), there is very little in the way of audio feedback (button clicks, notification sounds, etc).\n\nThen there's "Fast forward". Maybe you're waiting for an auto adventure to complete, your adventurers need rest, or they're training at the university. You can use fast forward until they're done, but this increases the risk of invasion. If you don't have any free adventurers to take on a manual dungeon crawl, you'll have to fast forward. It will stop automatically if an invasion occurs, but ironically not for any of those other things that are the entire reason you use fast forward in the first place. There is a notification, but you won't see it if you're in the shop, or otherwise not on the world map screen. This isn't a criticism of the ability to fast forward as much as it is a criticism of how useless the UI is in managing it.\n\nI really wanted to like this game in spite of the annoying harlequin. Maybe with the next update....","September 13, 2015","false","5.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","6"

It was rough around the edges but it had a lot of potential. The dialogue is amusing and even though the combat was a little bland the quaint graphics and management system were promising enough to keep me playing for several hours and stil lwant to come back the next day. Then I took a couple month break and teh game left early access.\nI hate the UI now, even though there should have been improvement in the way management works it got even more tedious. Instead of only having to deal with groups now there is a single list of all the heros you own which can make it frustrating and annoying to organzie people for a dungeon crawl. Not only that every single fight eats away at the stamina of your heros making it possible to do a couple main runs before they are completely out and have to sit around and recharge. Not only that instead of being based on real time you have to play with other lamer characters who you can't even do autoquests to level up with anymore. As a result you are left doing tedious grinding of the same dungeon whiel your main group is resting. As a reseult I haven't even managed to get past the first dungeon area because it's too tedious to run through the level again and again.\nThey have implimented a new crafting system, but i can't say how good or bad it is at the moment because it's such pain to even get there. Anyway hopefully in a few months i'll come back and it will get better again, but right now i can't reccomend.\n*Edit\noh wow I had no idea you guys had replied to my post, I'm so sorry for not responding. As I said I'll definitely keep checking you're game out and am definitely excited for the new patch. You make some very good points that thi game is supposed to be about multiple groups of heroes, and I think the endurance system is a good way to encourage people to get people to play with multiple parties. I also really liked how I didn't have to level up a bunch in the story to go visit different villages to get heroes. Instead of just spanking people on the butt for only wanting to play one hero group so to speak it might be good to offer a carrot to the horse so to speak. There could be something like story heros, who are slightly stronger then other average village heroes who you can get at the village, but they don't like to party with each other so you ahve to form new group for each of them.\nI also did like that you guys added the university to the game, it seemed like it would remove a lot of the tedious grinding that I felt like i was doing the last time I played.\nOh yes, I did manage to find the blacksmith, I even figured out that you could break equipment to create parts for new stuff, I also saw the gems that you could find in the dungeons, but I jsut didn't see the point of actually crafting things, the loot from the bosses seemed better then anything I could make for where I was at.\nAnyway, thanks for letting me know about the new patch I'll definitely play again in the next couple days abd hopefulyl change my review :D good luck guys I know you're working ahrd on the game and it's awesoem to see you replying to the reviews ^_^","February 2, 2015","false","12.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","3"

I've put up with restarting with each new build because the new features are worth it. It's low stress and interesting enough to keep bringing me back -- I feel that even if I only have a short amount of time ready, I can do something meaningul, whether it is character / gear management, party assignments for auto-questing, or taking charge of a group and running through a dungeon myself.\n\nA surprisingly deep turn-based combat system with interesting abilities and a push-your-luck element to dungeon exploration as you try to best manage your group's health and energy. Good variety of different classes and it's fun organizing parties to auto-quest, seeing which combinations work well together, or if you can tackle a high risk dungeon run with lower level characters to try and level them up quickly. Good variety of choices both in and out of the dungeon mode keeps the management aspect from getting too repetitive.\n\nIt's less a game to focus on intently and more of something to have on in the background. It's the perfect complement to a lazy weekend afternoon spent watching baseball, or having the auto-quests progress while working on another project, or toggling back and forth to the game while playing something else. But even with that, it's still worth it -- especially for the price.\n\nThat said, I would have liked a bit more variety among the classes / race combos, so that once you unlock a new race (like elves) there was a greater incentive to create new PCs using those races. If you play for a long stretch at once, the gameplay and your decisions can feel like you might as well be on auto-pilot.\n\nUltimately, I think the game delivers what it says it will. The publisher has shown a commitment to improving the game and has done a great job providing value in a pre-launch title. I cannot wait to see what the final game has in store.","September 28, 2014","true","80.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You have to actually manage the party in this fights, and the rest of your adventurers you can send them in auto-adventuring, you choose a side-quest for them, and they will keep going until they have depleted their endurance, die or you call them back.\nEvery time your party gets to a new room the endurance of your party will get lower, and if it gets too low they will get a lot weaker, so you have to choose if it's wise to try to kill the boss or leave the dungeon and let them rest. To rest you can play with another party while the tired one does nothing, or you can fast forward the game, if you FF the partys which are auto-adventuring will keep doing that, but Miraj(the main enemy) will send enemies to attack your cities (while you FF you are doing absolutly nothing to stop him after all), you can let them do that, which will make the attacked city to like you less. The invasion isn't really hard to destroy and is a nice way to not let you AFK until you are overpowered.\nYou also have a castle which you choose the rooms, those are useful for bonuses, like more exp, more gold, less resting time.\n\nPros of the game:\nA lot of classes, and you can especialize them in different things (A ranger can be a dmg dealer with the bow, or a support who can heal and weaken enemys with Willpower).\nSecret bonuses if your party has specific members (Example: 4 womans will get you +3% crits).\nThe music is actually good (especially the invasion one).\nIt has the best of the "basic" manager games and the best of old school rpg.\nThe endurance is something new for a rpg game (or at least I didn't see it before)\nIronman mode, if an adventurer dies, you can't revive him!

The game is secretly amazing and the devs deserve more.\n\nThe largest flaw that this game suffers from is the title, which is misleading. You put 'manager' at the end of a video game title and people are going to expect some variant of glorified fantasy football. This game is not that. This game is essentially Darkest Dungeon with a healthy dosage of Knights of Pen and Paper sprinkled on top.\n\nHow the formula works is that there are seven distinct cities within the kingdom from which you can recruit adventurers, one for each predominant fantasy race. Each race is limited to their own preferred class, but as you complete tasks for that town or complete quests with their race's adventurers, your reputation within that city increases and your pick of the litter improves as well. You have your own castle as well, which you can construct upgrades onto which grant improvements to your characters across the board, and a university where you may send errant adventurers off to for training between missions, with several dozens of possible upgrade paths.\n\nSo you form your team of dudes and take them on a quest and engage in a series of turn based jrpg-styled battles where careful team planning and prioritized targeting can make the difference between life and death. If they survive then you get showered with the glorious Diablo looot fountain. If they die, well, they die. They can be revived later for a steep fee, or if you're not a baby ban and play on the ironman difficulty setting, death is permanent.\n\nEven if you do survive, characters have a slowly recovering stamina bar which is exhausted with each door kicked down, and the lower it goes, the bigger a hit to their stats they take. In order to give them a chance to recooperate, you can hire a few entirely new teams of adventurers. One team goes out while another is resting while a third is studying at the university while a fourth fifth sixth and seventh are doing automated AI missions and the 8th is on standby for when the evil overlord tries to invade one of your cities, which is a thing that can happen and it will quickly undo all of your progress unless you can put a stop to it.\n\nThe 'manager' in Adventurer Manager comes from trying to juggle all these groups at once. Do you spend your cash augmenting and gearing up your highest level team, risking it all if they wipe? Do you put investments into low level recruits even though they have a higher mortality rate. Characters age in the game as well, and their stats deteriorate appropriately. Do you let your teams retire early rather than dump time and funds into sinking ships, or do you keep pushing grandpa sword n' board until he either collapses in a dungeon or dies of old age (or both?).\n\nThere's loads more I haven't even begun to touch upon, from the equipment crafting system to the lovingly crafted sprites to the generous effort thrown into the tongue-in-cheek quest dialogue to the excellent musical score. Do yourself a favor and pick up this woefully underrated gem.","April 5","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ofmidnightskies/recommended/280320/","ofmidnightskies","Trickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ofmidnightskies/","528 products in account","Not a bad game, but I was hoping for something more like Towns, almost autonomous NPC that you sort loot for, build a base for and send on missions.  This is more of a dungeon crawler than a management game.  The management almost feels tedious actually, since you have to drudge through dungeons, sort items, then shift gear down so the parties you have automated (if you automate everything your allies get raided and you lose access to some classes temporarily) dont kill themselves while being able to progress.  The dungeons are pretty bland too, weaknesses don't make sense to me either.  They follow a lot of DnD feeling stat sorting (elves are good with bows, dark elves are best clerics, humans get boosted exp, but theyre greedy, etc), but then skeletons and other undead arent weak to holy.  Everything I've fought I havent found a weakness for yet, just resisitances.  It really feels like an early access game, but I don't think it is?\n\nOverall it's not bad and I've only run into a few bugs where the UI sticks.  If they make the actual dungeon feel more complete I would probably enjoy this game a lot more.  Currently, if you go north, you move right.  South, move right.  West?  Move right.  Kind of kills the feel that you're actually controlling them.\n\nI have played this game since the early stages of development, and all I got to say is that it only got worse, and worse.\n\nPros\n- Lots of chances to micro manage things.\n- LOTS of loot to sort through, makes you feel rich.\n- Good variation of classes to build parties from\n- Sems to be a lot of content to go through (though you will have to repeat some things)\n\n\nCons\n- Not a very good UI.  You have to click to access and exit everything.  Hitting esc will only cause problems trying to clear your screen.  Can be confusing when youre trying to leave a shop that doesnt have a door or when an NPC's hit box is bugged out.\n- Dungeons can be long and boring.  Some groups of mobs ahve taken me over 5 mins to kill because they dont seem to run out of energy, so they all heal one another over and over and over.\n- Your own kingdom doesnt seem to matter aside from a passive bonus here and there.\n- Remember the micro management and loot?  You can have up to 48 heroes.  You need to personally gear, choose stats, and skills for all of them.  Every time they level, or they can't do anything new.\n- Loot is unfortunately randomized with no way to salvage it.

The manual adventures seem to take way longer than they should to complete, and any signs of unpreparedness can easily wipe out chunks of your party that were breezing through the automated quests no problem.\n\nThe UI is also a bit clunky, with the path to what to do next not always obvious.\n\nThe graphics are very nice, crisp and retro without being too full of themselves, they get the job done and provide this game with it's atmosphere and flavor. Some may call it amateurish looking but it works very well.\n\nThe biggest thing I want to stress about why I think this game will succeed and be an amazing experience: The Developers. I've seen many Early Access games flounder and practically waste away under the eyes of neglectful devs, this is NOT the case for Adventurer Manager. As of right now this game is getting more frequent updates than any other game I own on Steam (which is over 300 titles!) and it's obvious from each update that the devs are really listening to player feedback and making the game better. Not just with bug fixes but actual new content is rolling out on a regularly consistent basis.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, support these devs, and be able to brag to all your friends that you had this amazing game from the start!","July 19, 2014","true","4.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It quickly gets old and you'll find it's more fun to BE the adventurers than it is to be manager.

I tried to enjoy it, I really did but I just can't.\n\nPros:\n-Cute pixel art\n\n-Fun drop system: Plenty of items, usually you will find something with stats higher than what you have. And better quality items are quite common. Satsfying seeing two epic items dropping from some random mob, then getting a mythic when you turn in the quest.\n\n-Funny: Often times this games random generation will throw you something nonsensicle as a quest.\nEX. "Quest Named "Bread.   I am John, the mayor of Toliets go find me 143 cookies and I will reward you by eating you with a spoon."\n\n-Variety: Many classes, Races, Items, and special passive bonuses for trying differnt class/race combinations. Makes the game interesting to experiment.\n\n\nCons\n-Bad Stat system: Many games suffer from this. Most of the stats are useless on any given character, and items do not show bias to granting stats to the classes that can use them. Got a Mythic Maul? Gives a +50 Int, and +45 Wis which is fantastic at your level? Too bad the classes that can use the weapon actually get zero benifet from those stats. Oh is that a Wand that gives an obscene amount of strength? Well the Wand is a ranged weapon, and strength only works for melee damage... So yeah. This is also a problem because it leads to the illusion of choice  your heroes level when there is only one responsible (usuable) choice on which stats to increase.\n\n-Bad Skill Sytem: You have the freedom in the skill selection to often follow two or more roles. This is nice because you can have your rogue be a primary damage dealer, or a support who increases a teammates dps. But after brief experimentation or simple calculations you will quickly notice that this is not only suboptimal but actually not viable. Want a damage dealing priest? Well after investing 5 skill points into the priests attack ability you will deal around 45% of the damage you would heal if you invested 1 skill point in the priests recovery ability. That is just a trap, not a choice.\n\n-Healing enemies: If you decide to run a fairly defensive team and have the misfortune to run into a mob with a healer you might spend the next ten minutes waiting to land a critical to make progress due to enemies being able to mitigate, and reverse the majority of the damage you deal. This is fine if you are fighting a boss, but on a random encounter it's just frustrating.\n\n-Bad UI: Really this is spending a good amount of time not playing the game, but more of figuring out how to navigate. Most of the time you will spend moving your cursor around looking for something interactable to light up. This is a problem when you are looking for things that are crucial for continuing through the game, like the hero recruiter or the exit of the shop.\n\n-Unreliable Difficulty indicators: So I ran a party through a dungeon that was three levels higher than them. The game said taking it on would be "Suicide" but it actually wasn't hard. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't really difficult. So I try another party on an autoadventure that is two levels higher than them. The game said it would be really risky, which is not as severe as "Suicide".... They died on the first battle. That is just too inconsistent.\n\n-Fastforwarding: This is already a turn based game, why would they add a real-time mechanic like fastforwarding instead of just clicking a button to pass a day. Fastforward for a second too long, and you run the risk of having one of your races villages getting razed, which just takes away most of the progress you worked for in that faction.\n\n-Music: It feels like there is only two songs that last only 30 seconds before looping. Gets annoying really quick.\n\nReally this game had, and still does have plenty of potential but as it is now I kinda feel cheated. Really wanted to enjoy this game, but I just couldn't... 3/10","June 17, 2015","false","10.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

There are some things that need work, but the game is loads of fun and definatly worth the money.  Will be doing an in depth review once I have more playtime with it.   My original review is below.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBought this game on sale to support the devs.\nThe developer seems to really work with their fanbase, listen to feedback and produce new content based on that feedback, something that is rare in the industry today.\n\nI've only played enough to get a glimpse of what the game has to offer so this wont be an in depth review right now, but will update as I play.\n\nThe art style and music is very reminiscent of old 8-Bit games and brings nostalgia for me.\nZone's/map size is pretty decent for this type of game, and the ammount of classes, item slots, and things to do gives the game a fair amount of content, and apparently with DLC coming and the developer's active with their community, its a safe bet that this game will evolve and grow.\n\nSo i bought this game on sale for less than 2$, and for me that was worth it alone to support these Dev's.  Even at full price for 5$, this game seems to be worth it if you enjoy the game.  If you like this style of game but have oppinions or objections with it, then commincate amongst the community and to the developers and maybe they'll just listen and create the game you always wanted.  That's how the game industry should operate and supporting that idea to me is worth my money.\n\nAll in all the game is a good bit of fun, and perfectly worth the price as long as you can look past some bugs here and there which should be sorted out over time, as well as some features that need to be tweaked or adjusted.    Bottom line:  If your patient and you like turn based dungeon crawlers with a little bit of resource managment/party management thrown in, you'll enjoy this game.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","December 8, 2015","true","25.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

On the other side, you've got a micromanagement game where you have to send parties to "auto-adventures" to get gear and exp. Both happen more or less at the same time and the devs force you to pass the time in a real dungeon/fighting off invaders in order to advance the time. You've got a fast-forward button, but you get punished for having it.\n\nAll in all, as of july 2015, I cannot recommend this game as there are plenty of things that are not decent enough for it to be worth your time such as the time mechanics (that makes the game last 2x more than it should), the gear crafting, the gearscore mechanics and of course the inventory.

Also did I mention you can name every single hero you hire, every party you make and can craft yourselves your own weapons from the very intuitive blacksmith system.\n\nThirdly this game is something I would recommend buying even at the full price, I believe the devs have worked hard on here and I think that the game itself really shines through as a game with a lot of character.\n\nAll in all the game is enjoyable and replayable, so much so that in the future I may make a video on Youtube as a sort of review to back up what is written here but for now I just had to express how much I enjoyed buying this then spending ten hours as my party of four became legends across the World!","June 20, 2014","true","20.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Although it might take some grinding, it's fun with the fact of while you're adventuring through a cave with 1 set of adventurers, the next set is working on a quest 'collect my 99 socks, and i shall seduce you with a toenail.' The Auto-Adventure quests are randomly generated, as it might seem there. The actual quests provide a weird backstory, but still sound of an adventure. Also a jester who I wouldn't mind to punch in the face a couple quintillion times. Also, you can fast-forward so when you're JUST focusing on auto-adventures, it'll fly by quicker. BUT. Fast Forward has risks, as added in a previous update (that i wasn't aware of, damnit) that automatically 'pillages' a village by a unforeseen invasion, proving the place 'unusable' for 48 hours. You lose 'points' that if you basically buy, sell, or use a warrior in that place, you gain points, and if you gain enough you get an achievement etc: Friend Of Dwarfia.

On one level it has the 8 bit chic dungeon crawl, where you have races, classes and gear that you can manage, optimize and use to go through dungeons. There's an overarcing plot, events, and more goodies that get unlocked as you go. However, in addition to this, you get to manage a couple of dozen adventurers that you send on quests on their own! You have  a large pool of adventurers, you assemble parties, outfit them with gear and send them off to a dungeon. After a period of time, during which you can do whatever you like, the adventurers finish their quest and come home with tons of loot for you to use, sell, or convert into materials to craft. You can have a half dozen parties out adventuring on their own while you take your "A" team to advance the plot.\n\nMy only quibble with the game isn't even that serious: The number of races, classes and gear types is large enough that it's really kind of difficult to keep track of what the optimal configurations are. (Are Giants better Barbarians or Warriors? Should they have polearms or short ranged melee? Which race makes the best archers?) If I was motivated I'd create a spreadsheet or a wiki page or something to track all that information.\n\nAll in all, the game has great depth.

The castle is upgradeable and towns offer services such as blacksmiths and shops. Once you send your party out to do a quest, it becomes a dungeon crawler where you take control of your party members and fight monsters in turn based combat. Each party member seems to be unique with their own class and ability to level up whichever way you want.

Actually Scooby-Doo is not for anybody, I hate that show! All 12 versions of it,[en.wikipedia.org] but I digress.\n\nWhen A.M. was in early access I had expectations about the game that it would be like 'Final Fantasy: My Life As King'[en.wikipedia.org] and it wasn't, so I frowned. Then I splunked a few dungeons and realized that I was splunking dungeons, kind of like an RPG and while I had wanted to do that in FF:MLAK, here we have a stamina system so my favorite adventurers would sooner or later have to be benched in order for me to bring in team 'sit on the bench because I don't love you'.\nThat is always the problem with rotating teams around. You will always have your favorites, its a lot like love. Yes you love your wife and kids equally but your daughter keeps making smug quips about you behind your back and your wife seems to be spending a lot of time with 'friends from out of town who I wouldn't possibly know!' in hotels, but your son will always love you. Until he confesses he is gay and while you are not homophobic it feels like the final betrayal and so you...\n\nGot a little sidetracked there but what I am saying is when you play a role playing game you get invested in your team and when you play a management game (those of you who play football manager will know this) you have your favorites who you give special attention too and spoil a little bit and it becomes even more heartbreaking when something happens like they break a foot or they confess to being gay and it feels like the final betrayal so you...\n\nSo while I meandered back and forth between trying to play like a traditional RPG and trying to get my little slaves to make me money to pimp out my special team or die trying too, I found something was missing and I know what it is.\n\nRemember when I said this is a game for kids? When we played games as kids we would make storylines or adventures alongside the game. Yes, yes in pokemon I need to catch all 151 but I am also on a quest to save the endangered Ratatta population and so I must catch 50 of them and fill Bills box with them or else they will go extinct! While I play Super Mario 3, I can't touch the floor on stages where I get a racoon tail because the floor is made of lava.\n\nIt wasn't until I was burying my sons body for his final betrayal that it dawned on me just how much A.M. encourages you to make your own story within a story. It wasn't the game I expected it to be but that was the problem, it wasn't trying to be. It just wants to be a simple game that you love and enjoy without the, 'the world is doomed, so go kill 5 rats' or any of the seriousness that accompanies the more serious RPGs nor did it go all out on being an in-depth, serious management style game either, rewarding min-maxxing or punishing you continually until you 'get it right'.\n\nIf you still have a passion for games or you are still young (or young at heart) then Adventurer Manager might appeal to you and you will have a lot of fun with it.\n\nWhat about the game as a whole?\nThe graphics are okay. I apprechiate them and I am a fan of the style because they are not a rehash of the '8-bit NES' style which I am rapidly growing tired of seeing in indie games. Drawing 2D assets is hard! Making an effort (in art direction) however, is not and truly the effort was made.\n\nThe sound engineering is okay and I put that in italics because the sounds do seem a little out of place at times, like when I shoot an arrow and it sounds exactly like...A sword hitting metal, so yes some of the sound effects are mismatched and it is noticable. It is very rare for any review to ever comment on sound effects as they are usually simply assumed to 'sound' correct but it is the smallest of niggles and for an indie company I suspect they may have felt the same way. Time is finite and sometimes you just need to get the game out, warts et all.\n\nThe music is better than it was in early access and boy am I glad for that! It's not the fault of anybody since early access by its nature means the game is unfinished but even the tracks that were included have been remastered so they feel fresh upon release. You can even change the town music which makes me immensely happy.\n\nOverall Adventurer Manager is a lot like Minecraft. Yes their is a story and an element of 'these things must be done' but their is also the amendment of 'eventually'. While the goal in minecraft is to kill the netherdragon, you are free to do as you please and while the goal here is to kill Miraj, you are free to create your own stories and to manage your many, many teams however you see fit.\nIt reminds me of those ambitious Playstation 1 games like Monster Rancher or Jade Cocoon.\n\nNo, this game is not for everyone and it is really hard to pin it to any particular genre since it is quite flexible but if you are the kind of person who has an active imagination then you will certainly enjoy Adventurer Manager.\n\nJust to clarify I don't have a wife or a dead son or a daughter, that was merely written for humour. As it turns out humour doesn't translate 100% in written text or people will just quote you out of context because they feel like it so while it is sad I even have to write this, this is just the internet age we live in now","April 26, 2014","true","53.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I could have probably finished it a good 10-20 hours ago actually but was doing some extra grinding for achievements instead of continuing the quest line.\n\nAnyways, Adventurer Manager feels more like a Darkest Dungeon lite (or casual I guess) then say a guild manager or something of the like.  You recruit various heroes to create parties with and can either send them into dungeons to control manually (the primary portion of the game) or send on auto adventures to grind levels and accumulate gold/gear (secondary).  There are a vast number of classes and races to mix and match with so you can optimize (or not) as much as you wish...provided you unlock the other classes in each race.\n\nIf you liked adventuring in Darkest Dungeon than I feel like you may like the manual part of this game too.  It's nowhere near as complex as DD with the stress mechanic and moving rows and the like, but you still have to consider your parties endurance as each encounter saps some of it.  The mixture of classes, races, and genders all contribute to possible party bonuses as well so there's that part to consider if you like a lot of customization control.  Each encounter in a manual dungeon counts as a hour tick for the auto adventures (and the world in general), the game pretty much directs you in this path instead of just idly grinding adventures in the auto adventures....otherwise it auto sacks towns and screws with the allegiance levels.  Ouch.\n\nSpeaking of customization....there's plenty of it.  Each level gives you 5 stat points to distribute as you wish, 1 skill point to go into a skill that you want (provided you have the levels for each tier), and the look for your king and any party member is customizable as well (cosmetic yes, but it's there).  You can reroll the stat points and skill points at any time on the world map without penalty so you can adjust how each party member is used, well, indefinitely.\n\nDoing quests for towns builds their allegiance with you, and allegiance is built as you use races corresponding to those towns in your party.  The higher the allegiance level the other classes you can hire of that race, the better shops are to you, and a few other benefits.  And yes, there is grinding throughout all of this to accomplish these level ups.  In the mean time you can build up your castle to give your parties more benefits, train your party members in the university for more buffs, and work with the crafting with the blacksmith in case the shops, drops, and gambling don't keep you going (and they may not).\n\nI haven't tried Ironman (permadeath) mode, which could have sucked as I lost all but my main cleric in one early dungeon run and had a few deaths much later on.   I'll continue to sink some more time into this from time to time as I work on the last achievements I want to get.  Perhaps I'll pick up the Endless Tower DLC if I want to do those achievements too...but that's just more grinding as it is.\n\nIn any case, I really enjoyed the time spent going through it as the dialogue of the quest givers as well as the choice encounters in the dungeons (I have a few screenshots of those) livened things up through the grinding.  The added ambient sounds made it a bit more interesting in each area and while the music didn't grab me as much as other games it didn't put me off at all.\n\nAnd yes, the UI and merchant areas are a bit...clunky I'll give it that.  I personally didn't find it enough to put me off the game though.  Just something I learned to manuever around.\n\nSo yeah, pick up the game if you'd like to spent time every so often running a group of 4 in a dungeon and going after the various bosses it sends you at (and go after them again and again as you may need to for levels and gear).  Not an idler if you're thinking it's that, but I found the game relaxing and enjoyable anyways.","December 19, 2015","true","71.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Make a stop here, lower your expectations and just go with the flow! Adventure Manager is a sweet turn based RPG where you recruit strangers to forward your campaign as a ruler. Surely Sir Kurt whom wields the dagger you gave him will save the day? He seems to be pretty stabby with it, so surely those cave spiders will lay vanquished in no time at all.\n\nSo what's good? Well, apart from the jester's occasional witty rhyme (a welcome sight!) there's quite a bit to do. Train your recruits to master the quests you undertake, recruit more to help further your cause, build a castle to support your kingdom, and perhaps expore the lush world you intend to rule? Of course as a ruler, there's no need for you to be doing any fighting. Just uh... stand back and let the barbarian do the dirty work. The cleric you hired yesterday should keep him alive, right?\n\nAnd now, what's not so good. Battles seem to drag out quite a fair bit early on due to missing a fair bit, scarce gear and generally underleveled characters. The grind is fun to an extent, but sometimes watching your barbarian swing his club at a zombie and miss a few times in a row takes a little bit from it. Sure, maybe my "barbarian" is a little rusty at his job. But never imagined a zombie being swift to dodge a swing. Suppose I'll just blame that hasty random number generator, but the machine is simply doing its job. Also I don't think the "gamble" tab is explained at all in the game. Am I missing something? Probably.\n\nAfter the early stages of the game, the pace picks up and things get real. But the gruelling curve can be a little hard to embrace. And I'll say it again, for five bucks, what do you really want? I'll admit, I picked this up at a steal (I really do feel bad for that...) and it looks like the developer is more than happy to listen to players. So yes, you're getting your money's worth from this game. I do recommend it for that sweet sweet single player diversion.","September 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you only like visually stunning graphics, this is not for you. If you are a fan of content then keep reading. I am an old school gamer that started with pong. I have been through most of the systems over the years and RPG's are my favorite genre. It has never been about the graphics in an RPG though, it's about the content. I like to be able to equip several things on my character, have a multitude of magical variations, crafting, skills and a large selection of stats with a leveling system. This game has all of that. Graphics, it does not. It is a very cartoonish overview world map with point and click to travel to each destination. The graphics in town are even worse.  The dungeons and battles are very similar to the original Final Fantasy.\n\nYou play a ruler of a kingdom that must hire adventurers to defeat an evil wizard. You can hire a multitude of adventurers but must use them in parties of 4 to battle. There is an auto adventure option which is what makes the sim aspect of the game, but you do not have to do this. You must build repore with other races and gain quests from them. You are able to perform quests over and over and this allows for grinding levels, money and crafting  materials. There is also a lot of humor in the game. The bio's on you adventures are set up in a "mad-libs" sort of fashion with a basic background with random words inserted. There is a fun basic crafting system for any of the items you can eqiup. This game is not as in depth with story line and content that you would find in Skyrim for example, but it is a very fun game that you can walk away from and come back to over and over again.","September 12, 2015","true","22.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But they have done that in a  "Starwars" way.\nI do not like this.\n\nAlso the tutorial, the jester sound is really annoying.\nMusic is sort of ok i think, but i had to turn it much lower.  It is not a music that u want to hear for hours though.\nThe text is very difficult to read in the text balloon. So i usually skip this fast.\n\nOnce u have started a mission, you have to play on some dungeon map. You see a map infront of you and if u click on the button below, that is how u are able to move. You can fight, equip, loot. The game however is very calm and relaxing. If u are in a mission, and u walk on west/north/south/east - the animation stays the same and it wont change. Which is a shame.\n\nYou can level up and get abilities aswell. Quests or move to different nations.\nThis is all 2D and has old style graphics.\nThere is even a gear score, i think that increases the drop rate but not quite sure.\n\nYou can change how the character looks. It's a minor thing but u might be into this.\nThe fights are turned based like, People in the back are able to hit if they have magic/ranged or long weapons.\n\nThey also have an age, which i find interesting - the older they get the weaker the adventurer will become.

I've had hours of enjoyment out of it, and I have no doubt it's a game I'll be coming back to for a long time to come.\n\nThe little flaws? Well:\n\n1. It'd be nice for the game to pause when an attackable invasion force appears. It seems to pause a couple of times to warn me about continued use of the fast forward button, but then suddenly an invasion appears, sacks a town then disappears in what seems like a few seconds. That's mildly irritating.\n\n2. An auto-assign option for core stats when a hero levels, based on their class, would be a good addition. It's nice in early stages of the game to assign stats when you have a handful of adventurers, but after a while when you've got a full compliment, it's mildly iritating.\n\n3. Minor menu options you wish were there/more obvious, blah blah blah. Lot of games guilty of this to some degree. Mildly irritating.\n\nHaving said this, the best way I can think of describing this game is potentially like some kind of fantasy-RPG-Master-of-Orion-2 hybrid. For anyone that can't remember the beeps and chirps of 56k modems, that means it's good. *Real* good.","May 5, 2015","true","44.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I think I watched a video or two.  But that's about it.  After a slow start, where I tried to find my way around everything, the game became quite addictive. :)  I like the amount of adventurers you can have and the fact that they can always be ressurected should they fall in combat.  I'm also a fan of the 'endurance' system, but I have to ask, does it have any real-time effect on the way the party battles. It didn't seem like it did.  I was able to complete a quest, even though the party members were hovering just over 40.\n\nAt any rate, I really like the game and would DEFINITELY recommend this game for old-rpg fans and simulation fans as well.","July 17, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcjackmove/recommended/280320/","mcjackmove","mc_jackmove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcjackmove/","180 products in account","Thus far, Adventure Manager has been a lot of fun for me.  But I tend to enjoy games that require a bit of a grind and a head for numbers, and boy does this game deliver on both sides!\n\nAll stages thus far (except the invasion stage, which I will discuss briefly later) require your party to have an average gear score of a certain number, which it uses as a difficulty level.  Getting your party up to snuff is not really easy to do most of the time, and will require multiple trips through a dungeon to get there.  Further, once you start dabbling in crafting, everything becomes a bit more of a cake walk, and then the grind shifts to finding gear to have crafting materials, and running dungeons over and over for that.\n\nThe one difference is the Invasion level, which randomly pops up through the course of your adventuring.  I really think that this level needs to be better announced rather than just a red flashing text in the upper right corner of the screen.  Half the time, I'm running a dungeon and don't even see it blinking because I'm pouring over stats, or trying to keep my party alive through spell caster's volleys of multiple hundreds of damage.  Anyway, the invasion level is always "tailored" to your party's gear score, providing a decent challenge with a boss at the end.  The end boss has thus far been a more improved version of a boss you'd beaten in a previous dungeon, with updated versions of their unique gear as well.\n\nAbilities of the classes are fun and flavourful, but I felt like many of the abilities could be removed from the game, or changed in a more meaningful way.  Most of the time, I just go for the damaging abilities because everything else seems really ineffective.  Yeah, an increased critical buff is nice, but when it takes a round away from my damage class to activate, only lasts two rounds, and only affects one person...it seems useless to me.  Some abilities I would LOVE to have affect multiple party members.  Especially a heal spell (the closest thing I've gotten to a heal spell was after I unlocked a special class, and even then it was a heal over time.)\n\nAlso some stats I feel could be better utilized for certain bonuses.  For example, Strength only increases melee damage, and does nothing for your chance to block like it does in some games.  No direct stat (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) increases your parry chance or your riposte chance, even by a fraction of a percent.  Nor does anything seem to affect your Dual Wield percentage, even though you can pretty much make most classes dual wield.\n\nSome weapon types should also have their own identity with little bonuses as a basic to the weapon.  Many have the same damage range, so it makes no sense to really use more than one type of weapon.  Hammers increasing your chance to stun, for example, would be a wonderful way to add some flare to classes who have abilities that can stun, and make them a little more viable.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game a 7 out of 10.  It's a fun ride, but I don't know that it has the power to keep people interested in it long enough to beat it, especially with it's difficulty and grindiness. Many of the complaints I have are personal wants for the game, and really don't detract from the overall experience of the game.  I would recommend it to RPG fans,  but it certainly requires an investment of time to play.","May 5, 2015","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You get to manage your parties of adventurers (Up to 4) giving them equipment, deciding what skills they have, and pumping up their stats, and it all sounds good so far right. Well there is some down sides, and a lot happened after the current update.\n\nFirst: Before the update you used to pick adventures from the signs in town, and you would get information from how many encounters your party would get, to how dangerous the adeventure was, and then you would get the time limits of said adventure and rewards there of once your adventurers had said number of encounters.  Now they have added a Endurance bar, they have put all the adventures that is automated on a menu that shows up in the center of your screen, and they give you info on how much gold  and experience you'll get from each encounter., and as you form your party you get told the difficulty of said adventurers, However, while this all sounds good and everything, you do not have the ability to leave the game and let the adventurers do their thing when your not controling them(well you do but you'll see what happens if you do so if you continue reading) manually, in addition you notice how I didn't say the number of encounters are now shown, that is because essentially since they put the Endurance bar in, and saying you have so many encounters, so much award(Gold wise), and it costs so much Endurance, they went with a system, in which you have to tell your adventurers when to stop the adventure, before your party comes home, and then you have to rest them, improve their stats, give them new equipment etc. Now I understand this is a management game and all, but let's be honset folks, if you hired workers to build your porch, left for the day, and came back to find they built your porch, tore down part of your fence, tore through your neighbors yard,  and basically your the proud owner of the great porch of China, complete with exhausted  workers ready to collapse all around, all because you weren't there to tell them to stop(Your adveturers stats get sapped when their endurance goes down to a certain level, and can actually hit zero, in which you have to rest them to get their stats back up.) You would be very upset with all the problems this would cause along with the sheer incompetence of not knowing the job well enough to know when to stop, you would be very upset. indeed, and after making sure they are taken care of you probably would not hire them again, but alas, while you can fire the adventurers and never have to hire them again, the people you replace them with will do the very same thing and cause you the same problems(well in this game they would anyway.)  While this can be worked around,  with enough time and patience, it basically took what should be a click and forget game and turned it  into something you have to stay on and at times feels like you have to dredge through.  Of course this is all the management side of things.\n\nSecond: It seems there is a lot of things that have changed, the skill tree for instance only has a total of nine skills, down from twelve, not major, and the game is more refined for it, so that is basically a good thing, However it seems the adventures have gotten harder on your party as well, also good equipment pops up a lot more rarely now, of course these factors can be good or bad, pending on how you look at it, but the worse thing is, there seems to be a few more bugs then before, and this is the reason for my  ultimate conclusion at the end.\n\nIs this game good, yes if you like management games, and you have a lot of patience, you'll get hours and hours of gameplay already, and this is still a incomplete game, but for 5 bucks it is well worth it. If your a classic role playing fan, it is a iffy call, you might like parts of the management, but might get frustrated with it in it's current form, but you will like the manual adventures , the skills and the classes, though they are basic for this kind of game.  Overall it is a enjoyable little game and well worth the check out at 5 bucks, but be warned, your mileage may very.\n\nOverall I give this a 7 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it is good enough for me to recommend.\n\n\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","12.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Its a cross between Diablo and a JRPG.  Diablo in the form of random loot drops with randomly generated stats and crafting, JRPG in the sense of combat and questing.  The humor is off-the-wall random to the point that quests details are randomly determined without any sense; Go defeat the 32 mice and recover the 56 bales of hay; find the 15 merchants and dispatch the 82 legions of spoons.\n\nThe one mechanical difference between this game and other JRPG types is that you can create up to 12 different adventuring parties and have 3-4 of those parties go on seperate adventures simultaneously while the others rest up or train at the university; thus you manage your adventures (roll credits).\n\nThe story is just an excuse plot to make you go kill random things in random dungeons and goes so far as to poke fun at the entire JRPG/fantasy genre.\n\nIf the random humor is the up side, then the down side is the micro-management.  if you have 12 parties with 4 members each, then you have 48 heroes to level up, choose skills for, assign gear to and send to school (wow, did I just inherit 48 children?).  Eventually you will develop a pattern that works for you, but, about 60% of my game time is spent managing my parties and only about 40% is spent grinding the dungeons.\n\nIf you want a simple rogue-like/JRPG experience with some satyrical humor give it a go; just don't expect it to be GOTY.","March 20, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is currently littered with all sorts of poor design choices that in its current state make it an overall unenjoyable experience that gets boring very quickly. Being a fan of turn-based RPG’s myself, I can vouch it has nothing to do with the actual genre, just the overall execution. Perhaps over time the game will improve and I really hope the community can help push this game on the right path, because it has potential, but unless you are really into the idea of the game, I’d recommend staying away for now, until significant improvements are made.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsdOPejtcNY\n\nIf you want to hear my full opinions and thoughts, feel free to watch the video preview above.

The player is the sole heir to the royal family and must restore order by recruiting adventurers and sending them on quests.\n\nHow many times have we taken up sword and shield and stormed a dungeon in the name of loot? How many dark corridors have been plumbed looking for chests? How many monsters have we fought? How many stats and skill points have we agonised over, wondering if we made the right choice? But have you ever thought it would be sort of cool to act as a manager to the people who go delving into those dungeons? Probably not, but that’s exactly what the developers of Adventurer Manager thought.\n\nYou take on the role of the sole heir to the King or Queen of Adventuria, and your goal is to build up a small army of adventurers whom you can dispatch at will to tackle quests and retake the land from the evil Miraj. Despite the name of the game  you’ll actually participate in the questing often, taking a group of four heroes into deep dungeons while other parties partake in their own objectives. The first step is to go through the limited customisation options to create your wannabe ruler, a somewhat pointless step since you’ll see very little of them throughout the game.\n\nSo, go there with your best crews and give it a try Adventure managers !!!\n\n","February 12","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

My original review of this game could be summed up as "Great idea, but too grindy and slow to be much fun." I was hardly alone in my concerns, and clearly the developers were listening. After the most recent update, almost all of my complaints are either greatly reduced or completely resolved. It no longer feels like half-finished collection of interesting ideas, it feels like a coherent collection of mechanics almost forming a good game. It's still a beta release, and there's a lot of tweaking left to do, but it's clearly on the right track.\n\nDo I recommend yet? Yes, but with conditions. If you're up for a bit of grinding in a simple RPG system where you take control of multiple parties, and with a VERY slow leveling feel, it's playable. If you're looking for a complete and immersive experience where you can just sit down and play, it's not there yet. It still feels like the game is running in molasses, and I've only started to genuinely enjoy playing it after well over six hours of effort.\n\nThat said, I think the devs are on it, and the game will only improve with time.","April 23, 2014","true","22.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OOcoldsteel/recommended/280320/","OOcoldsteel","[OO] coldsteel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OOcoldsteel/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is very early access but it's still a lot of fun and I find myself quite addicted to it. The loot is great and I think they've nailed that part of the game. The strategic map layer stuff is good too. I think the game has a lot of promise and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops from here.\n\nThat said, there are some issues that are going to need to be ironed out before release. I hope they address some of the design issues in particular. Here are a few of the main things I found to be problematic currently:\n\n1) The cut scene that plays in dungeons when you are walking between rooms becomes tiresome very quickly. No one wants to have to watch the exact same thing over and over and over and... you get the idea. This is compounded by two things. The first one being that there is zero feedback on your party's progression on the map while the walking cutscene plays and second being that it is so long.\n\nI would recommend that they take a look at two games with similar mechanics for this portion of the game.\n\nBlackguards handles this by only showing the overhead dungeon map with the party as a blip on it moving on the map from room to room. When there is en enounter of some kind when moving, then their tactical combat map pops up. The movement is quick and keeps you staying right in the action (the combat). This method sacrifices a bit of first person immersion to expedite gameplay and  would also be a good choice for AM because the walking cutsceen is failing to immerse me at all anyway.\n\nThe second game, The Darkest Dungeon, also has similar dungeon crawling mechanics to AM and they show a party walking along as does AM, but they also show the overhead map on the screen with a moving torch to indicate the progress of the party through the dungeon. Using this method you get more immersion and also the benefits of using visual map progress to help keep interest up and boredom down between encounters.\n\nWheatever method is used, they need to do something to address that portion of the game. It really makes dungeons drag out and, because the user has no interaction with the game and because there's no visual variety at all during that time it becomes frustrating and not-fun.\n\n2) The other big issue I see is the jarring difference between autoquest levels when going from one quest area to another. The level 3 autoquests from the first quest hub show as "very low risk" for my level 8 party. The level 4 autoquest from the next hub is "medium risk". I tried one of these level 4 quests with my main party of level 8 adventurers and two of them died. It cost me 1500 gold to ressurect them and I can tell you that took some real grinding. I was not able to do any of the new 4-6 quests with my level 8 group. Instead I've been forced to run the same level 3 autoquest over and over and over. I'm hoping that by the time my characters are level 10 I can tackle the level 6 quest dungeon. So, I think they need to have a smoother progression between quest hubs and not have moving up a single level be such a huge jump in risk.\n\n3) The tactical combat and party leveling is the heart of the game but in the early levels at least, there seems to be few real choices in that regard. Because hitpoints mean so much to your survival, it nevers makes sense to choose anything other than the character's main atttribute stat and the constitution stat on level-up. The only exception might be the rogue where some few points in focus would be good for the crits. You can also go with dexterity rather than strengh when choosing to go ranged vs. melee, but that's about it. Also, there aren't any skills to choose every level or two like most RPGs and so the combat remains the same tactics over and over and there's nothing new to look forward to until you hit level 10. That all makes it more of a grind thatn it could/should be.\n\nThere are an awful lot of clicks involved in the game's common tasks so I think the UI could use some streamlining.\n\nAll that said, I do not regret buying this game for one second. There are few games in this particular niche and this one has a chance to take the crown if the developer is smart about how they finish the development and listen to feedback.","April 26, 2014","true","29.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I'm not so keen on having 4 adventurers at a time as there's ultimately always one who is utterly useless and is stuck at the back only being able to defend or reflect. I like that you can pick from different classes with all sorts of cool abilities. It's easy to earn badges for this just by having one of each class.

My original review of this game could be summed up as "Great idea, but too grindy and slow to be much fun." I was hardly alone in my concerns, and clearly the developers were listening. After the most recent update, almost all of my complaints are either greatly reduced or completely resolved. It no longer feels like half-finished collection of interesting ideas, it feels like a coherent collection of mechanics almost forming a good game. It's still a beta release, and there's a lot of tweaking left to do, but it's clearly on the right track.\n\nDo I recommend yet? Yes, but with conditions. If you're up for a bit of grinding in a simple RPG system where you take control of multiple parties, and with a VERY slow leveling feel, it's playable. If you're looking for a complete and immersive experience where you can just sit down and play, it's not there yet. It still feels like the game is running in molasses, and I've only started to genuinely enjoy playing it after well over six hours of effort.\n\nThat said, I think the devs are on it, and the game will only improve with time.","April 23, 2014","true","22.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The loot is great and I think they've nailed that part of the game. The strategic map layer stuff is good too. I think the game has a lot of promise and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops from here.\n\nThat said, there are some issues that are going to need to be ironed out before release. I hope they address some of the design issues in particular. Here are a few of the main things I found to be problematic currently:\n\n1) The cut scene that plays in dungeons when you are walking between rooms becomes tiresome very quickly. No one wants to have to watch the exact same thing over and over and over and... you get the idea. This is compounded by two things. The first one being that there is zero feedback on your party's progression on the map while the walking cutscene plays and second being that it is so long.\n\nI would recommend that they take a look at two games with similar mechanics for this portion of the game.\n\nBlackguards handles this by only showing the overhead dungeon map with the party as a blip on it moving on the map from room to room. When there is en enounter of some kind when moving, then their tactical combat map pops up. The movement is quick and keeps you staying right in the action (the combat). This method sacrifices a bit of first person immersion to expedite gameplay and  would also be a good choice for AM because the walking cutsceen is failing to immerse me at all anyway.\n\nThe second game, The Darkest Dungeon, also has similar dungeon crawling mechanics to AM and they show a party walking along as does AM, but they also show the overhead map on the screen with a moving torch to indicate the progress of the party through the dungeon. Using this method you get more immersion and also the benefits of using visual map progress to help keep interest up and boredom down between encounters.\n\nWheatever method is used, they need to do something to address that portion of the game. It really makes dungeons drag out and, because the user has no interaction with the game and because there's no visual variety at all during that time it becomes frustrating and not-fun.\n\n2) The other big issue I see is the jarring difference between autoquest levels when going from one quest area to another. The level 3 autoquests from the first quest hub show as "very low risk" for my level 8 party. The level 4 autoquest from the next hub is "medium risk". I tried one of these level 4 quests with my main party of level 8 adventurers and two of them died. It cost me 1500 gold to ressurect them and I can tell you that took some real grinding. I was not able to do any of the new 4-6 quests with my level 8 group. Instead I've been forced to run the same level 3 autoquest over and over and over. I'm hoping that by the time my characters are level 10 I can tackle the level 6 quest dungeon. So, I think they need to have a smoother progression between quest hubs and not have moving up a single level be such a huge jump in risk.\n\n3) The tactical combat and party leveling is the heart of the game but in the early levels at least, there seems to be few real choices in that regard. Because hitpoints mean so much to your survival, it nevers makes sense to choose anything other than the character's main atttribute stat and the constitution stat on level-up. The only exception might be the rogue where some few points in focus would be good for the crits. You can also go with dexterity rather than strengh when choosing to go ranged vs. melee, but that's about it. Also, there aren't any skills to choose every level or two like most RPGs and so the combat remains the same tactics over and over and there's nothing new to look forward to until you hit level 10. That all makes it more of a grind thatn it could/should be.\n\nThere are an awful lot of clicks involved in the game's common tasks so I think the UI could use some streamlining.\n\nAll that said, I do not regret buying this game for one second. There are few games in this particular niche and this one has a chance to take the crown if the developer is smart about how they finish the development and listen to feedback.","April 26, 2014","true","29.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The UI is also a pretty clunky, crowded mess with too panels and buttons that dont always do what you expect them to.\n\n-The RPG aspect of the game failed to engage me, the difficulty curve encourages long grinding and the action during combat is just a bit too slow. When the actions are so simple things should clip along at a fast pace but I found my mind wandering to other subjects during combat because there just wasnt enough happening. The skills available are also pretty standard to what you would find in a lot of lackluster rpgs these days. They dont produce interesting, or even useful effects, and again they are totalling lacking in visually interesting effects.\n\n- The simulation aspect of this game just fades into the background. I got it set up, then forgot about it. When I went to check on how my auto adventurers were doing while i was manually adventuring, the game fails to explain what they did or why it was of any value. You get handed some loot, and im not sure if they could just keep adventuring or if i was supposed to set up another adventure for them or what was the deal with this second team. There is also a suprising amount of micromanaging that takes up a lot of time and doesnt really give you satisfaction. i spent maybe 1/4th of the time i played just moving around equipment, deciding which stats to crank up, and reading skill description for the dozen or so party members you need to get the most out of your auto adventuring.\n\n-The writing is also pretty terrible. Overly long, and in tiny text that prefers to crack off lousy one liners intead of give you useful information.\n\nAll in all, a waste of time and money.\n","December 7, 2014","false","2.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

I have run into a bug now three times where I complete a mission, but it didn't register that I defeated the boss of the dungeon, so I couldn't turn the quest in. This just happened and my castle got sacked during an invasion, meaning I can't access the graveyard (to resurrect my dead characters) or use the blacksmith (to make equipment) for two days. This is unacceptable, and it needs to be fixed.\n\nOther minor bugs occur when you hover over something like a move that you want to use, and it failes to dismiss after you remove your cursor. This continues on other screens, and makes the game very difficult to use when you have the bug.\n\nAnother thing is the interface... it's awful. There is no rhyme or reason to it. You have some 42 adventurers to manage, and while you can order the initial list when you bring them up, you scroll by them seemingly randomly. Every time you want to put a party together to go do a mission, you have to search each and every one of your party members to make sure that they are able to:\n\nA. Do the mission (there is an endurance mechanic)\nB. Are an appropriate class/race\nC. Meet the gear threshold.\n\nWhile the information is available, there is no readily apparent way to sort it so that the experience is streamlined. A lot of time is wasted just trying to find the right party. That isn't fun, it's just a slow paced time sink and uniquely irritating.\n\nThe game isn't exactly what I'd call deep, either. It's just a stat and gear crunch for your party. You can pick 5 skills for each party member to have, but some of the skill trees are just dumb. There are very clear ways that you should be doing things. For example, you CAN give your cleric a damage dealing spell, but it is rarely more potent than just training up their weapon of choice at the university (which also has a poor interface, but for different reasons). Therefore all of your clerics just end up being carbon copies of each other because there is no reason for the damage dealing spell.\n\nOh, and you need carbon copies. Each character ages as the game goes on, so you can't really hold on to your dream team for long. You also need to cycle each of them out as time goes so they don't lose all of their endurance and you're caught with your pants around your ankles during an invasion or something. Not that it matters, though, since apparently when you kill a boss now, it doesn't even register.\n\nAnother major bug is that quests consistently register even you have beaten them. You can only have four active quests at a time, and sometimes they remain active in your questlog after you've beaten them. This is infurating.\n\nOther, minor bugs include many misspellings and grammatical errors. Text not fitting in dialogue boxes. This is relatively minor, though, so not ultimately a big deal. I wasn't expecting Skyrim 2, upon this buying this game, but I was expecting it to be functional. Which it really isn't.\n\nThere is no reason that the game should be out in its current state. It is fun in theory, but very poorly executed. I have gotten my money's worth, but I am a patient man. I can't recommend this game. If it ever gets debugged, I will most likely change my mind.\n\nThis game has so much promise, and it could be a real gem, but this feels like I'm playing an alpha instead of a finished product. I wish more time were spent with it so that it could have been fully realized.","June 21, 2015","false","73.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

If I hadn't already had more than 2 hours in the game when I discovered any of the things I don't like I would have requested a refund.\n\nI'll start with what I do like. TL;DR version at the end.\n\nYou can pick up and play for a couple hours here and there and actually make progress and not feel like you wasted your time. Basically you do not have to devote a lot of time to this game to have fun with it.\n\nAll the class/race combinations. Yeah, some races are better suited to some classes than others, but you can make whatever race whatever class you want and still do ok.\n\nActual skill trees with branches and not just linear skill progression like you'd expect in a small game like this. True, some branches of some trees underperform compared to others, but if you want to make a character to specialize in them for the situations it would work you can.\n\nDifficulty of invasions scales to the level of the characters you send. Of course, the loot also scales so it's your choice whether to send a low level group to get them some easy exp or a higher level group for better loot but a higher chance of getting their asses kicked.\n\n\nNow for what I don't like.\n\nThere is one save slot per game. ONE. And it's an autosave. There is a manual save button but it is entirely pointless as the game autosaves constantly, and if you run into a problem where your save glitches (this happened to me and I had to completely start over) or gets corrupted you're just SOL. The game leads you to believe you have 3 save slots since it shows 3 slots in the menu but each one is a slot for a different savegame, you start a game in one slot and it's locked to that slot, you can't save in one of the others. I cannot stress enough what a bad feature this is, if anything happens to your save you're SOL unless you manually go into the folder with the saves and make a copy every time you play. Mandatory autosave should be an option for the ironman setting, not standard.\n\nSpellcasting classes do less damage with weapons but nowhere in the game is this information given, this was only revealed in a thread on the forum by another player who discovered it in tooltips during combat. Some spellcasting classes come equipped with a melee weapon, leading you to believe they are proficient with it but this is not the case. Build a Shaman with a Str/Int build because it came with a Spear and you thought you could do a hybrid character? You're SOL. Hybrid characters perform poorly regardless, even classes like the Death Knight that ARE proficient with melee weapons and also have spells.....if you try to balance Str/Int they just end up being bad at both instead of being decent at both but not excelling at either. You're pretty much forced to min/max if you want to get anywhere.\n\nThe crafting system is heavily RNG based and you can easily end up crafting gear that is utterly worthless because the bonuses that were rolled for it are pointless for the classes that can equip it. Plus, you need to actually level the Blacksmith by crafting low level junk before you can even start to craft anything good, but I saw nowhere in the game that this was explained. You can use gems to guarantee a certain stat on a crafted item but the bonus from that gem is still going to be determined by RNG. Gems are rather uncommon, though not stupidly rare, so you won't want to use them constantly. To craft gear you have to break down other gear instead of selling it, which means you have to choose between gold to upgrade your castle and revive dead adventurers or material for crafting gear. While this isn't really a bad thing it is hard to manage early on when both resources are going to be at a premium.\n\nThe official forums are basically ignored by the dev team and they like doing everything through the steam forum, but the "report bug" button in the game menu directs you to the official forum which is full of bug report topics that have no replies. This could easily lead people to believe that the devs do not support the game, which is not the case.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you aren't bothered by forced autosaves, getting constantly shafted by RNG based crafting, or being forced to min-max despite the illusion of freedom in assigning stats you might enjoy this game, but if you're like me and don't enjoy these things you'll probably want to give it a pass.","August 9, 2015","false","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

Games like Romancing Saga have features beyond typical RPG fare, which make them awesome to play. This game feels, to me, more like it's stuck between wanting to do a meta-RPG, and a standard RPG, and not presenting either as well as could be done. This game is, at least, quite a bit unique, and that's welcome.\n\nThe graphics stand out for their mediocrity: it's presented in a "retro" style, yet even in the era this game styles itself around, these would be considered bad graphics. Not every graphic is bad, and some of them are nice to look at. But there are also graphics to make you question your decision to play this game. Some hilariously bad sound effects; and the just awful, short music rounds out this game. Just mute the sound, if you're going to play this.\n\nAre there good things? Yes. The simplifed pathing through the game makes it easy to play--even if that is held back by pretty bad controls--you feel like you know what to expect, and moving forward happens at a steady pace. Item collecting is presented well: I would love to see such clear representations of what items you find, in other games. In a world without a lot of meta-RPGs, the meta-RPG qualities are welcome. However, these intriguing features are floating on a sea of mediocrity. Is it worth playing this game to see them? Only for the stout-hearted meta-RPG fan.  . . Or someone who only has $10 for a game. It's a pretty good $10 game.","December 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Do not get this game.\n\n---\n\nA long time ago I wrote a review for this game and was basically told by the community and the development team that the lack of features in the "early access" was because it was early access and that later it would open up and I would see that it really was exactly the game it tried to pretend it was all along.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nIn this game you create a team of 4 individuals of different races and classes and then you go through a dungeon and collect loot. When you level you put your skillpoints in one of a few available skills, leveling them up. Then you can spend your gold on buildings that either give universal benefits or unlock new features such as training.\n\nYou can also unlock crafting where you melt down objects in hope that you can collect enough materials, of which there are four grades of metal, and then you select premade recipes and build them. Which would be interesting if objects weren't more then random stats, be prepared to melt down a lot of magic wands of strength.\n\nThe active quests you put the party into a dungeon where you select one of the four cardinal dirrections, they walk, they go inside a room, perhaps there is an encounter, perhaps there is treasure, perhaps it is a healing campfire. Otherwise you click in another cardinal dirrection and go there instead.\n\nFinally there are "Do nothing" quests and training. You select characters for a mission or training and then wait until they are finished. They tend to do far worse then if you were controlling them yourself, do not be surprised if this gets them killed.\n\nThat is pretty much it as far as the gameplay goes. You do not "manage" your "Adventurers" anymore then you would do in baldur's gate, in fact you do even less. They do not have personal needs, or character, or anything that would make these adventurers anything but cardboard cut outs with "stats". You do not feel either the in depth control nor a subtle influence on your adventurers.\n\nNow I could talk more indepth about the game itself since honestly there is a legitimate complaint in just how overly simplistic and horrifically unfunny the game attempts to be (Youtube the opening intro, TRUST ME!). Yet you have plenty of other reviews that do that, for this I just want to warn anyone thinking about buying this game to look again, find a video review, and then reconsider this game on this basis.\n\nI am not a professional or really an amateur reviewer, I just speak the way I think about these games. Unfair or fair as it might be.","August 7, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","7"

Even though I'd finished the lengthy tutorial, I got another tutorial speech bubble popping up asking me to start a quest that wasn't present. In fact, no quests were present, and a lot of the functions (except hire heroes) were locked out. Literally all I could do was hire heroes and buy things - no quests could be undertaken, no time would pass, and quests are required for dungeons to be active and interactable. Auto quests required "more of the story to be completed" before I could do them.

Adding in a heaping load of absurd "mad lib" like random generated quests for some chuckles. Showing that the game does posses some promise and heart. However, just as in most of those old classics, there is a good ammount of grinding to be done. And not the good kind either. This can get to be a bit tedious and can potentally drive away some people from the game. I find this a great game to play while I'm busy doing something else so I can't play a game that requires all or most of my attention. (I am imagining that this could be a great "office" game, something to play while in your cubicle pretending to work. Of course I could be wrong. Anyone have an office job like that? We should test it.)\nNow this isn't going to be your next new obsession. This isn't going to be the game you spend all your waking hours playing forgetting to eat, sleep, and wash, (thankfully for that). But it is a great little time killer with a sense of humor. I have high hopes for the title and hope to see it grow into the amusing and funny game it has the potential to become.","May 16, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In fact, no quests were present, and a lot of the functions (except hire heroes) were locked out. Literally all I could do was hire heroes and buy things - no quests could be undertaken, no time would pass, and quests are required for dungeons to be active and interactable. Auto quests required "more of the story to be completed" before I could do them.

Honestly I'm suprised this game has as many positive reviews as it has. The writing on the box clearly leads you to believe that you're getting a Tycoon game, but the actual gameplay is that of a substandard RPG. The biggest problems are:\n\n1. In order to avoid getting your towns raided, you HAVE to take charge of a party yourself and enter a dungeon. You can't just use the fast forward. But the dungeons are lame and incredibly repetitive.\n\n2. There is just too much equipment generated to keep track of it all. You'll come back from a manually run dungeon with about 40 new items. An autoadventure might get you 10. And each item has different modifiers, some of which make the item in question useless for any characters that can actually equip it. So you might have 20 characters (you can have as many as 48), and you have to manually sift through all this equipment to see if you can optimize this character or that one. It's a lot of mindless work.\n\n3. Likewise training is the same way. You're a "manager", but there is no quick way to sort through your characters and see what training is best for this one or that one. If I were to start a new game of this I would never have more than 12 characters at a time.\n\nAdventurer Manager pitches itself as a Tycoon style game, but the tycoon stuff like training and autoadventure is a total afterthought. If you buy this game, buy it with the idea that you're buying a JRPG with a couple of innovative features that raise the game from 'awful' to 'not very good'. Nothing more.","October 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is no real "management" here at all.\nSecondly, because of a huge, game-ruining bug that keeps coming back to haunt me... If you venture away from the Tutorial for even the tiniest reason, things will go wrong, and the game will become practically unplayable ad you must restart.\n\nExamples:\n- For my first play-through I ventured from the Tutorial by not accepting the Quest it asked me to accept. I wanted to explore the town! But alas, because of this choice, neither the aforementioned Quest, nor any others, were then available. I had to restart.\n- My second play-through I tried to avoid that fault but found another. The Tutorial told me to do an "Auto Quest" and when my Adventurers were done, it told me to click the "Portal". I decided I wanted to scroll through the information from their quest and look at their character information first. My mistake... Now there is NO WAY what-so-ever to bring my adventurers back from their, you know, adventure! So I have four useless characters now.\n\nI MIGHT retry one more time... Possibly... But I truly should not have to obide by the Tutorial one-hundred percent without game errors. ESPECIALLY since it forces you to do this every. single. time. So if you want to play through the full game again and again with different characters, etc, think again. Unskippable, lengthy, buggy, boring Tutorial.\n\nI hope they fix this, because I WAS enjoying it!","February 18","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought this game to have fun, not to beta-test for the devs.  I am on the fence for how to reccomend this game, it is fun, but buggy enough that it is just depressing.  Most of the bugs I have found really speak to very poor quality programming.  For example, the wrong background will load in a town, or a cooldown reduction upgrade will actually increase the cooldown timer, or buttons will just disapear untill you restart the game, or tool-tips will not not update as you scroll across your items, or when you defend for a second turn in a row you just pass your turn without recieving any defense bonus.

Well that's what I experianced, First off I'm mostly a FPS kind of guy but I do like dungeon games. This game really had my interest when I started it up. So basiclly you go to towns and recruit people to be in your "adventure team" every town has people with different classes. So on your adventres you can collect gold, weapons shields spells whatever or you cna buy them. So then you can give certain adventurers certain weapons and accessories. You explore more and then Boom everyone dies. So those adventurers die and are put at the graveyard you have to go there to collect their loot and then hire people all over again. The positioning is very annoying like if "John" has a shortsword and is put in the back of your party he is absolutely useless. Not to mention these quests are the most childish things ever example: Iddly Oodly find the ancient sword oodly iddly and stupid stuff like Bagels and stuff. My main issue with this is that it gets boring within 20 minutes of gameplay and if you like games to be exciting this is NOT the game for you.","July 14, 2015","false","8.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

While I have only played the game for a short time I have already become quite bored of it, and that is never a good sign in a video game. Now, granted it is Early Access but this doesn't protect it from any criticism aimed at its current build and as of the time of this review I would have to give this game a solid DO NOT BUY. Now here is why:\n\nAM promises you many adventures to go on and to run dungeons with various parties of adventurers. While this is true, what it chooses not to tell you is that many, and I mean MANY, of these adventures you actually get no direct involvment in. In most cases you simply accept the quest and send your little minions off to do the task for you for about half a minute while you decide to go back to talking to your friends while it finishes up. What did I just mean? Yes, that most of this promised content is much in the likes of a cow-clicker, meaning you set it to go and come back later when the game finishes it for you. Sounding fun yet? No? Well how about...\n\nFive minutes into the game you hit a sudden spike in difficulty. Yes, five minutes. After doing the first three or so 'tutorial' quests (which actually do its bare minimum to explain anything about the mechanics of the game itself) you run into a quest that is impossible to complete without first doing a few of the 'auto-complete' quests. Immediately I found myself second-guessing just how much of this 'game' I will be playing myself as opposed to the game doing it for me then congratulating me for being an obedient little boy who waited so patiently for the Master AM to finish up whatever it was doing offscreen. So what do you think of it now? What? You still don't like the sound of it? Let me try again...\n\nEDITED (As of May 2, 2014): I had originally believed there was no keyboard functionality in the game, but turns out there is some within the runable dungeons where you can use the number keys to select your skills. It is still the only place to have keyboard functionality, which is very weird. END EDIT\n\nThere is almost no keyboard functions for the game (I would know, I mashed every button to see if anything would happen). Now this just makes no sense. Why would a PC only title have no concern for the main component of a PC, that being the keyboard? Well, an interesting little comment from your 'helper', the Jester, made me realize why. When I had visited the Skills tab of one of my adventurers, mind you by random wandering to figure out what kind of 'customization' there really was for the poor saps, he had made mention of 'tapping' the screen. Tapping. Sorry. What? I'd love to say I spent the next ten minutes poking my screen just for the sake of comical effect here, but I knew better than to do something like that. It hit me, this game was 'not' designed for PC, at least not from the start. From its auto-complete missions, to minimalist appearence, to a near lack of sound quality or even just interesting sounds, to the fact there is no keyboard control, this game was designed for a tablet.\n\nNow you must be looking at me like I'm crazy or something, don't worry I give the mirror the same look every day but it doesn't seem to help in any way. Why would a game just switch to PC? Honestly, I have no personal idea and really don't care, but the evidence is still quite clear. Just look at any video covering this game by now, does it 'really' look like it was originally intended as a PC game? Its funny, but this wouldn't bother me one bit if the developers had bothered to actually change how the game ran depending on what device they wished to release it on. But they didn't, instead they decided to release the title into Early Access on Steam without the slightest care in the world to make it run better on a different platform, and for that I am sorely disappointed.\n\nSo finally, I leave with one last word. AM is a shoddy piece as of this moment. Promising you the moon when simply handing you a rock and asking you to simply believe it came from the celestial body it had said it would give you. For all you know that rock could just be the mummified remains of a cat's 'delivery' to the litterbox. AM is boring, fails to meet its promises even from the start, and hopes you'll simply look away because its super cheap and tries to make you laugh (by the way, random sentences isn't funny, and that's what most of this game's 'humor' consists of.). Well I say no, and I hope you will, too. Stay away from AM. As of right now its just a dressed up Cow-Clicker in the form of high-fantasy fart jokes.","May 2, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

I mean that's a killer deal for any game.  Anyhow, I grinded this game for hours and hours...  No, the truth is that I was watching TV while pressing a single button the entire time for free cheap XP and loots.\n\nI'm still not happy that the Endless Tower turned into a DLC, but what evs.., but remember a long time ago I paid $10 for this game, I checked my purchase history and I'm pretty sure that was the 50% off sale.  Meaning the original price was $19.99.  So, you are getting a huge deal and who cares about the DLC.  The price is so much more cheaper now.\n\nThis game gets 4.5 out of 10 stars.\n\n=================================================\n2nd Review a long time ago\n=================================================\n\nI finally beat the game, and I believe my biggest motivation was to show [VA]Strikes that I could clear the game 13 levels below the mobs I was fighting.  I have no idea what the max level is for these characters.\n\nI had the most fun after figuring out how the crafting system worked.  Having the best crafted gear pretty much means the most between failure and success.   Before crafting gear, my teams were gaining a weak amount of XP per kill.  After crafting my teams were leveling up multiple times in dungeons because of the XP bonus of killing higher level monsters.\n\nI made a playlist showing my progress, some of it contains "spoilers":\nYou must copy and past this to see the playlist---------------------------https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDlFimmZXpM&list=PLJqoU7EItaZd2yU-_heaTswwuYmmvERFt&index=10\n\n\n====================================================\nOriginal Review on Feb 14th, after ~40 hours played\n====================================================\nI really wanted to like this game.  I loved the old school Bards Tale II style from the 1980's.\n\nPROS: Extremely interesting items (RNG stats), unique items, craftable items with RNG stats, group combat(4), MANY classes and some are earned, Some corny dialog\n\nCONS: Grind from Level 15 to 39 is way too long and is pure repetition of doing the exact same thing for what seems like 40 hours (WOW, I'm not max level but can't play this game unless I'm watching TV and totally ignoring it.  All I click is button 1, 1,1 ,1 ,1,1,1,1,1,1,,1,,1,,1,1,1,1,1,  I'm not exaggerating, I don't even look at the screen).   Not enough item space (200 is way too small for over 20-30 toons), too many useless abilities, too many overpowered abilities (just no balance), overpowered classes, useless support classes.  I think support classes need to be upgraded or increase group size to make a spot for them.  I have come across some minor bugs (some time stopping bug for invasion danger warning, or during an invasion; they need to add a automatic portal out when a auto adventure group is out of endurance because they die.  This is just silly because the game glitched for me once, and went from 1000 to 0 in a split second killing my entire group.)  I have already uploaded several of these bugs on youtube.  Most of the bugs are graphics related only.\n\nI'm still playing, I reserve the right to change this review in the future.","February 14, 2015","true","78.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","12"

There are also reviews mentioning the clumsy UI is, and the terrible effect that nearest-neighbor interpolation has on the pixelated graphics in full-screen, especially on the text which becomes barely readable.\n\nI'll chime in to mention that I felt shame when my girlfriend was standing behind me, reading over my shoulder.  The writing of the game is...  let's call it uninspired.  Starting a fantasy game with a Star-Wars-like intro of yellow scrolling text entitled "Episode 1: a new pope" is not funny, not witty.  It's out of place, it's cheap, you have not demonstrated yet that you had a humor of your own, and making random pop-culture references and gratuitious play-on-words (is there even a pope in the story?) does not make your text funny.\n\nThen comes a Jester, whose first sentence means "I usually rhyme, but I won't rhyme this time because tutorial is important".  What I understand from that is that whenever the jester rhymes, he's not saying anything worth listening to.  Why even bother?\n\nI agree with the other negative reviews, I wanted to add my own feeling about the writing.","February 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being able to customize more than one party is a lot of fun, even if most classes only have one (mabe two) good builds and roles. The layers of gameplay make it pretty fun. The lowest levels are a lot like a much more forgiving version of Darkest Dungeon. Beyond that, you have your different parties developing at different speeds and in different ways, sending them on automatic adventures you don't control so that they gather loot and experience for you while you play another team. The university system has potential, but it's too expensive and expansive. It's generally best to just train each character's main stat over and over, if the character is worth it. The world layer gives you towns and invasions, and a quest line that develops as your "army" does. In all, it's very basic, but there is enough depth to have fun.","January 29","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to say that the problems I'm having with the game will hopefully go away in time as the new developer works on the project.\n\nAs others have mentioned in their reviews the pixelated graphics do not scale well to any resolution changes that I can find. The UI is a hot mess of busyness, bad fonts and horrible layouts. The game seems to be more about turn-based RPG mechanics than managing adventures. I actively hate the soundtrack which is odd because the music in the trailers made it seem good.\n\nTL;DR: My only happiness from writing this is knowing that at least I didn't pay full price for this somewhat flawed game. 6/10","February 7","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
