The game hasn't let me down yet.  The Steam videos made this game look entertaining, and I wasn't wrong - I found myself laughing while playing because it's my kind of humor.  When I purchased this game, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, because it was only $5, but I am quite pleased.\n\nThe music is upbeat, and while I'm fighting I'm reminded of the 1970s Batman tv show.  The graphics are basic but fun.\nI haven't really paid much attention to the story line, if there is one, because I was having fun running around and beating up people.\nThe controls are easy to learn, but I struggled with lining myself up with the npc's in order to talk/beat them up.  Other than that, I just smashed buttons - fun and easy!\n\nFor my $5, I would give this game a 7/10 from what I've seen so far.\nVideo footage will be posted on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenLevelStart\n\nUpdate: I beat the game in a little over an hour.  There's roughly 1 quest in each zone, and 6 zones total.  Who you choose to beat up or help determines what rewards you get (which aren't important), what you write in your journal (a funny gimmick) and what happens to the npc's, but ultimately won't affect you.  Short storyline, yet entertaining.","April 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","1"

As I remember them, they had a charming, if not minimalist art style, interesting or zany premises and usually did one or two things pretty well for what they were. I think that's a fair generalization of this game.\n\nThe game starts off as the player character, who is a professional wrestler, shows up drunk to work and is about to take a fall, giving up the championship belt to another wrestler. After a few clicks through the dialogue and it's now the future. The player character is homeless and goes around a city map bumping into his old friends/rivals from the glory days of wrestling in the WFF. Some are just as down on luck as the player character, others have become high ranking officials in the police department of even government. The player will then decide to talk or fight to solve these former wrestlers' problems.\n\nHumor is a hard thing to capture in a game because humor is not universal. Something funny to someone can be an annoyance to the next. The humor in WFfF is zany and irreverent so I found myself smirking a couple times while playing the game. It's hit or miss but doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to be funny which is a good thing.\n\nThe humor serves the dialogue well and the highlight of the game is probably the dialogue system. In certain situations the player will have to convince characters to do things they may not want to do, a screen pops up displaying certain traits about the person the character is talking to and it's up to the player to decide how to tackle the situation. Adopting an agressive style, disagree with the character and do so in a snarky way and the person that needs the convincing may disapprove while assuming a different stance, agreeing with the person and being a little more to the point may be the required combination. It's definitely an interesting and organic way to handle dialogue and when it works, things go pretty smooth, when it doesn't work, I was forced to throw up my dukes and handle things through combat.\n\nCombat is a little too simplistic for my liking, even in a game such as this. There are punches, kicks, and a shoulder charge with rapid pressing of these buttons stringing the attacks into a combo which changes the animation a little bit. My issues are the AI isn't that bright and the combat moves don't feel particularly wrestling-esque. AI will often close distance and get within melee range but since this game plays like an old beat 'em up, the characters can sometimes overlap on the x axis and instead of the computer trying to reposition itself, it will swing blindy over and over until the player moves the character around.\n\nThere's equipment in the game that changes stats such as damage and speed and the different stats do have a visible effect on how fast the character moves or the damage that they do but I only wish that there was a change to the appearance of the character too. I think it would be a little toucht hat goes a long way to show that the developer cared about the little things.\n\nThere's about 8 locations, a quest or two per map and one of those maps are unlocked once everything else has been solved. The graphics aren't that good with a lot of assets being reused and for some reason there are minigames of sorts that don't amount to anything and aren't very fun.\n\nOh I asked a question in the beginning and for me the answer is no. Those flash games were little time wasters that were occasionally fun but they were free and some of them were really well done with a bunch of little nuances throw in. Will Fight for Food has some good ideas but it doesn't seem much effort is put into the game to make those ideas shine.\n\n","April 30, 2015","false","1.4"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","29","41","0","1"

Stands true here. Will Fight for Food has a variety of interesting ideas that are all treated with a strange humor. One that you will either enjoy or find not so funny. If you find yourself on the latter. Then you will find many issues with the game. From the very simplistic combat, odd graphics and short gameplay. However if you can see the charm in the dialogue and perhaps embrace the over all strange dynamics and storyline. Will Fight for Food may just surprise you. Personally I found the idea of an open world, side scrolling, beat 'em up style game very intriguing. However you can play the entire game without punching anything at all. The story has many possible paths and outcomes. Do you help your friends or punch them in the face? It's all up to you. To sum, if your looking for a very action oriented game. This isn't it. On the other hand if your looking for a quirky, whimsical game that doesn't take itself too seriously. You might enjoy Will Fight for Food.\n\nI did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game!

Reminiscent of a flip-book animation.\n\nMusic:  Perfect.  Sounds exactly like an arcade from the late 80s.\n\nDialogue:  Snappy?  Minimalist?  Abrupt?  I'm not sure how to describe this stuff.  Certainly not ordinary, though.\n\nExperience:  Bizzare.  Short.  Kinda feels like you stuffed a roller coaster ride in your ear and whirled your brain around for a while.\n\nMechanics:  Fighting is rudimentary, as in it consists of hitting the fight buttons.  Another check in the arcade nostalgia checklist.  Talking is convoluted because "social engineering [does not] come easily to Jared."  (I seem to recall a previous version of this game where talking is convoluted because the game had a "revolutionary conversation system...")\n\nBottom Line:  I...I like it?

Then replay the game since it's so short and try to go the pacifist route only to end up realising you still need to punch a fair few people anyway. The game is all about punching if I'm honest. Occasionally kicking. Punching is easier though. Shoulder bashing is also fun. There's pretty much no food involved. Or selling out, wrestling is fake afterall.\n\nDid I convince you to buy the game yet? No? Time to bring out the big guns.\n\nWill Fight For Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game of the Year: Colon is a game. Buy the game and play it.

Steam Trading cards are a good addition and were what lured me into this game, the humor however kept me playing through to grab those achievements.\n\nAchievements take a few playthroughs to get (alternative endings etc), but once you can look past this and the slightly clumsy feeling controls it is a fun short game. The humor of the game text is good for a cheap laugh though it might be more at home on a flash games website than as a standalone product on Steam. Developer is nice enough to drop some helpful info in the Discussion/forums on the Community Hub but it would be better to have those fitted into the game.\n\nIn short; a good game to grab if you need another 100% achievements completed item on your profile, earn a few trading cards or for a short game between other activies on your PC.","December 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

My time in game is grossly exaggerated because I left it open at menu when I stepped away from the computer to nap instead.\n\nTL;DR - This game is a waste of your time, money, and disk space.\n\nThe game is equipped with a detailed conversation system that I didn’t care much for in terms of wasting my time with pointless back-and-forth banter. I understand dialogue in games, especially RPGs or choose-your-own-adventure games, but if the game advertises a nonlinear plot to begin with, what’s the point?\n\nThe mechanics of the game are that of a basic side-scroller, beat-em-up, button masher with simple controls and equally simple animations. The fighting animations are about as dynamic as an early-2000s Flash game, and in my opinion, the lack of variety or ability to chain combos exponentially detracts from the initial allure to beat up NPCs. Plus, being restricted to walking across the screen and beating people up as you go gets old real fast.\n\nThe writing and humor were also a bit lackluster. Part of me also thinks the dialogue merely exists for the pure gratification of beating NPCs up in lieu of sitting through lengthy conversations that are often not even necessary to incite in the first place. The highlighted “ridiculously complicated conversation system” is primarily what turned me off from wanting to complete this game.\n\nIn the end, Will Fight for Food is the type of game meant for quick doses of mindlessly simple gameplay and flat, offbeat humor. Although to be honest, this game wouldn’t be my first choice for either; I’d rather play a better-executed free mobile game than pay money for and sit at my computer to play this.","April 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

While I do think the conversation system has something to possibly offer in the future, the confusion involved with it and the lack of its use in terms of number of times used didn't do well, and frankly, the combat just sucked. The humor is the only thing that may draw people to the game, but with it falling so flat for me, I can't recommend the game in question. Please watch part of the video content or other opinions to get an idea of the humor, as it may work for you.\n\n+:\n-The conversation system is interesting in terms of an idea with possible depth to it.\n-Some humor does work.\n-:\n-Game can be beaten in an hour or so.\n-Combat is horrible. Button masher to the extreme. No advanced tactics.\n-Conversation System under utilitized.\n-Humor mostly falls flat for me.\n-Writing is weak at times, relying on randomness more then anything else.\n-Feels like a game that's a husk of itself\n\nFor a video review & gameplay footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ySRcKr6zM","April 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","22","52","4","0"

The idea is sound on paper but the execution is barely on the level of newgrounds flash games from 10 years ago. The writing is forced and comes off dull instead of funny. The combat is equally dull and could have been improved with another month of development and a bit more animation. At its best you could spend 20 minutes on this game if it were free.\n\nBut it has a price attached to it.\n\nPass on this one.","April 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 13 of 35 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","13","35","0","0"

Sometimes more funny strange than funny haha. Will Fight for Food isn't a bad game, I just have mixed feelings about it. You play a washed up wrestler named Jared who is trying to get his life together by visiting all his former adversaries after a match gone wrong. The story is definitely unique. This is a light simple brawler / RPG adventure. Emphasis on the 'simple'. I think most or matter of fact the ONLY slightly complex part of this game is the conversation aspect.\n\nYou can fight just about anyone you see. Your fighting style is pretty straight forward punch, kick, rush. Sometimes Jared does a jump kick in between but there isn't much variation to it and every once and a while you'll pick up a random trinket that you can equip. Although with the exception of speed I don't feel like there's any noticeable difference in stats between items. Now the opponents you fight are all have the same move set and will attack you once you throw the first punch. Regular civilians will run away from you, or try.  They pretty much just move a little ways away from you and whatever brawl you started. The violent approach is the most straightforward and the quickest way to beat the game. It honestly took me about 10 minutes to finish it.\n\nThe non-violent route is a bit more complex. Each major character you'll meet will have a problem and for karma points or perhaps nothing better to do you'll have to find a way to solve it. It's not 100% peaceful as a few solutions require you to fix the problem with your fist. But the parts I enjoyed most were where you would try to convince a character to do something by choosing the appropriate body language approach for their personality. It gave a hint of depth to the one dimensional characters / situations. The writing is pretty good. There's some tongue in cheek jokes and the script has it's moments. Total time to go through the non-violent approach is about 1 hour. Slightly longer if you seek out all 3 endings. For the price though I'd say pick it up on sale based on the content and playtime. It's not bad at what it does but it certainly could have done better.","May 14","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
