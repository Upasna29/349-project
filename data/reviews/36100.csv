Playing it now, it might be a little more dull or a little easier (okay, a lot easier, took me an hour to get millions of dollars) but the nostalgia alone made me still really like this game. I can't do a pro/con on this because it just doesn't feel right. This is a very fun game, the other two are fun also, definitely worth it for the small amount of money it cost.","March 26, 2015","true","2.2"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","32","32","0","2"

Tradewinds 2 However still gives you the same chances and opportunities of being a merchant, however it becomes alot harder, as it gives you storylines to follow, and revoking the ability to make a fleet. Tradewinds Legends gives you back the fleet options however it limits your ship count to 8. Tradewinds Caravans gives you the opportunity to become a merchant that walks the silk road, your caravan count can only be a maximum of 15. Tradewinds Odyssey gives you the tradewinds experience inside of greek mythology.\n\nTradewinds, Tradewinds 2, and Tradewinds Legends, come as a bundle for a price of $4.99\n\nTradewinds Caravans, and Tradewinds Odyssey, being newer games come in a seperate bundle of $14.99","July 6, 2012","true","4.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

So many adventures just traveling all over the map doing quests and bounties hunts while building wealth from trading. The game itself is simple. It's such a good game to waste your time. From the start of the series to the third (as this pack only contains Classics to Legends), more interesting features are added in each game such as port battles and flying. First game has no story for each character, but in the second and third there are stories which you play and resolve their conflicts.\n\nI suggest buying if you're bored. It may be too short but it's a good waste of time :DD","January 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
