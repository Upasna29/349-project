Somewhat reminds me of the old NES Super Mario Bros, which is a good thing.","April 6","true","1.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Some of the instructions are a bit funny. To enable xbox controller support, Press Ctrl + Y and move all the checkmarks to joypad. To fullscreen press 3. To make the game not an autorunner, change the controls to dpad. The controls feel a little bit floaty, but overall I enjoy the game and the writing. Characters are snarky and you get achievements for lots of random things. Such as inspecting poo. lol\n\nAll and all, not the next Mario but a fun way to waste a couple of hours when you are bored. OST is bright and cheery.","April 6","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

This game just came out not too long ago and I honestly never would have found it if it wasn't bundled with some other games.\n\nIt is a wonderful little game with a lot of character. I don't see a lot of gameplay time in it because it seems like a small game but it has definitely gotten some laughs out of me. I think that's why I really play games, to enjoy myself and maybe get a few laughs. This definitely is delivering that and I can already see it giving me a few hours of fun. I'm not sure if the developers plan on expanding so don't expect a game with tons of hours of gameplay, go in and just see the world for yourself.\n\nNow, for the actual game. The best way to describe this game is a hilarious, stupid Super Mario knockoff, and I mean that in the best way possible. Much of the gameplay resembles the original Mario games, with a few slight twists here and there. The art, the characters, the music, the secrets, the stupid jokes, THAT is why this is actually a good game. It's very ridiculous and maybe I have a stupid sense of humor but I find this game extremely funny.\n\nAll that being said, should you buy this game? I say yes, it is definitely worth $5 for a few hours of entertainment. I could see this probably going on sale eventually so if a couple bucks make the difference then wait. If not, buy this game, it might surprise you.","May 4","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"
