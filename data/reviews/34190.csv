This game is arguably superior in at least one aspect: it has context-sensitive race announcer!  If you are torn between THIS VERSION or TRANSFORMED, start with this one--it's a great game and you will not be disappointed.  I have played Transformed on two other platforms so I can stand by this review.  That being said, if you want multiplayer, get Transformed.\n\nFULL REVIEWSonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a brilliant kart racer and nearly as good as any MARIO KART racer.  It's the only Kart Racer that I keep coming back to (e.g., I have purchased this game on three different platforms).  This game is bug-free (as of 11-1-2014) and runs beautifully on my gaming laptop.\n\nPros+ Creative, fun, and colorful course designs (the underwater ancient ruins is a particular fav of mine)\n+ Addictive and catchy music\n+ Stellar character models and animation\n+ Unique and varied voice acting\n+ Infinite replayability and variety\n+ Seamless controller support\n+ Several difficulty settings to maintain challenge over-time\n+ Local multiplayer\n\nCons- No online multiplayer support\n\nIf you are  a fan of Kart Racers, than this game is a must-buy!","November 1, 2014","true","50.9"," 76 of 84 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","76","84","0","9"

It seemed like there were more tracks than in Transformed, which wasted tons of space by making mirror versions of the already existing ones.  And because this earlier version had more tracks, you'd get different looks at more than one SEGA franchise, instead of Transformed having only one track for every series except Sonic The Hedgehog.  I also preferred the active announcer in this title over the one in Transformed.  This one actively says what's going on in the race, and does it with excitement and gusto, whereas the one in Transformed just uninterestingly states short phrases, item names, and achievements.  Sure, the graphics and the racing itself may be better in Transformed, but I think its predecessor did a better job at the content and the experience as a whole.","May 29, 2014","true","16.7"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","0"

You get lots of characters in game and different tracks and racers that you can earn when you do better in the game. I'm surprised that in this game, the House of the Dead Curien Mansion made it as a playable track. As you may know House of the Dead is a mature rated game :) The controls are great and the fun factor is in there. I believe they even came out with this game in the arcade as well. While we know a famous plumber won't make their PC gaming debut anytime soon it's a safe bet that this is the best racer on the PC hands down if your looking for a fun arcade style racer to play. You won't be dissapointed and the fun factor will be there. Be sure to get it on a sale if you can because websites that are authorized to sell Steam games discount it often.","February 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","1"

I'll make it easy. Buy them both. Wait till they're on sale and get them both. Why? Because both this and Transformed are excellent games.\n\nOk, so now that we got that outa the way, here's why I recommend this game. I actually started off playing Transformed first when I first got into PC gaming. I absolutely love Transformed which is why I was kinda scared to buy this installment. I had looked up video footage and it didn't appear to be worth my while. Well I had some extra Steam money and had nothing else to spend it on so I finally just bought this game. As many have complained about there is no online multiplayer. Boo hoo......I don't care. I buy games for their single player experiences. What I've always liked about Transformed is that it is a REAL racing game, unlike Mario Kart which feels like dodge ball on wheels. Sonic and Sega All Star Racing is no exception. Even though it is not as fast as Transformed, it is still a balls to the wall racing game. The A.I. DOES NOT rubberband on you like Mario Kart does and the weapons slow you down, but not so bad that your chances of winning are ruined by a few unlucky hits. If I had one complaint about the game, it would be the weapons. They're kinda boring (like Mario Kart) but that's to be expected because this was Sega's first crack at a kart racer. However to me the racing is important, and the drift and stunt boosting are still here though it's not as elaborate as Tranformed is. I love the tranforming dynamic in Transformed, but I don't miss it in this game. What I'm trying to say is that this is an excellent kart racer than stands on it's own and I still like it 10 times better than any recent release of Mario Kart. It still does everything right, and the best reason buying this game as well as Transformed is that all of the tracks are different from the second installment. I bought this game because I wanted more Sonic All Star Racing after I completed Transformed.\n\nLastly this game is not coded as well as Transformed is so don't be surprised if the game drops a few frames here and there. You won't see the drops in your frame rate counter, but you'll notice the slight stutters. They are not even close to game breaking, but just know that there's nothing wrong with your computer.","January 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

No ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boats or planes\n2. Less taxing on old computers\n3. Cheap as dirt\n\nIf you like Transformed, I also recommend this for the added stages and characters.\nIt seems to run on the same engine with only minor differences in gameplay. Characters don't level and only have one cart each, and you have to watch for cues as to what drift level you're on.

Sonic R and Sonic Drift were just terrible! The Sonic Riders series was a step in the right direction, but didn't sell to well. Then you have this, Sonic and & SEGA All-Stars Racing. Lemme just say, the fact they had to put Sonic in the title makes me feel like SEGA was trying to money ♥♥♥♥♥ this game. I get that Sonic is popular and all but c'mon now. Anyway let's move on.\n\nI really do recommend this game, but sadly not for the PC.\n\nWhat is wrong with the PC version:\n\n-No Controller Support\n-No Online Play\n-Split Screen only\n-Somewhat poor optimization\n\nI know SEGA isn't known for making good PC ports, but sheesh this is pretty bad! Now, I'm not saying the keyboard controls are bad on this game infact they're pretty easy to use. Most racing games, however are MUCH EASIER with a controller! I know. I know. There are ways to use a controller on certain PC games, but for me it's kinda a bad thing. I may just be stupid and can't find the option for a controller, but I doubt there is one. If you are wondering, the sequel Sonic and & All-Stars Racing Transformed DOES have controller support which a good thing.\n\nI also know what your thinking: How can you trust me with this Review if I barley played the game?\nSimple answer: I've played the hell out of this game on the consoles!\n\nThe Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and even the Wii got online features and exclusive characters! (PS3 didn't get any exclusive characters.) The Xbox 360 version got Banjo & Kazooie and the Wii got the Mii Characters! The PC version (and the PS3 version) didn't get any kind of cool characters which is pretty disappointing.\n\nI really do recommend this game, but I think it was a lot better back when I played it on my Xbox 360. If you can't get it on your console, the PC version is still ok. The game is a great game overall though!\n\nIt has memorable race tracks from different SEGA games, almost all the SEGA characters you know and love are playable characters (except Nights and a few others), kickass soundtrack, great gameplay, fun modes, fun challenges, great multiplayer, and many more!\n\nDefinetly recommend this game 9.5/10","May 20, 2014","true","5.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","7"

There are 24 tracks to race around in 5 grand prix of 4 races each. On top of that there is a mission mode that has a variety of 64 challenges. There is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, but there is split screen multiplayer The game is fun, but it feels inferior yet similar to the follow up, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. On top of that, a lot of the tracks are wide and vacant with no sort of precision needed to navigate them. Each track is inspired by what feel like six games. Sonic, Samba de Amigo, Jet Set Radio, Billy Hatcher, House of the Dead, and Super Monkey Ball. Out of 24 tracks, there aren't that many memorable ones. Mostly because every track is just feels like a road. Most tracks have jumps, some have giant loops and the Super Monkey Ball tracks have plenty of 90 degree turns.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you steer your vehicle and pull a trigger to accelerate. When you go into turns, you can drift by holding the other trigger and navigating your way through. If you drift long enough, you'll get a boost coming out of the drift. The longer you hold the drift, the bigger the boost. Its a great, easy to use system, but the tracks are always so wide that you can drift in a straight away to get boosts. There are purple arrows that will automatically boost you, but they're pretty rare. If that wasn't enough, you can pull the drift trigger when flying through the air to do a trick and get a boost when you land. Other than for a boost, there's no practical use for tricks. Each trick feels like it takes too long to be effective. Plus, with all of the drift boosts, the trick boosts are overshadowed.\n\nLike all combat games, you'll drive through weapon jars that will give you a random weapon from a wide variety. There is a boxing glove that stuns an enemy. A homing missile that locks onto whomever you target. A simple bubble shield to protect you. Giant rolling bombs that explode and do a radius effect. A star that you can lock onto an enemy and their view will be upside-down. Traffic cones that you can put down as obstacles. Standard boosts and many more items. Even after 4 hours of playing, I still have no idea what some of the weapons do. There is even an All-Star that is specific to each character. It is a good way to get to the head of the pack while decimating other drivers along the way.\n\nThe combat doesn't feel like it wins most races. Skilled players will always find themselves at the front. Although tougher courses with hairpin turns can be balanced by weapons. Very rarely will a last place player get an item that brings them to the front of the pack.\n\nThe game has several drivers, mostly from Sonic games and Dreamcast games, each with their own stats. To balance the drivers, they all have an equal total of stat points. The stars are put into speed, acceleration, handling and turbo-boost. You'll need to put strategies into each driver accordingly. Dr. Eggman has maximum boost and speed, but little handling and acceleration, so you really need to drift to get your boost or you'll be last in line.  Each driver has their own vehicle. Some drive cars, and others like Alex Kidd and Shadow drive motorcycles. Dr. Eggman drives a monster trucks and so on. Tails drive a plane. He doesn't fly it, he drives it. That feels like a let down, but Tails has always had a plane. Every mission and Grand Prix that you complete gets you these 'miles' which you use to unlock new drivers. After unlocking all the drivers, you can unlock the tracks for time trials even though they're already in the grand prix.\n\nThe 64 missions are very quick, but fun to play. Most of them are around a minute. The game assigns you a driver. It offers a nice variety. Things like collecting rings, or killing enemies to boss battles against other drivers and straight up races. As you do each mission, you are graded. If you get an A grade at the end and accomplish the mission, you'll unlock the next mission or so. Its a nice system. I'm happy the developer put in the missions, but each mission feels quick. In fact the tracks themselves feel quick, short and small. Each lap is about a minute, which is the right amount of time to not get bored of a track before its over. The follow up Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed featured tracks that would drastically change between laps. This game doesn't. Its the same three laps. While that might be the status quo for every racing game, they could have done more.\n\nFrame rate drops seemed to be quiet common in each race. Nothing game breaking, just a few times each race. Even when I lowered graphics settings and my PC is well over the recommended PC specifications. Yet with Racing Transformed, I don't have these problems. It is odd, but I'll chalk it up to this game being 3 years older than the other.\n\nAnother low point is the announcer. He's quite predominant and eventually I grew tired of him 5 hours in. He's always there. Not to mention the music. There needed to be more variety for me. Each track should have its own theme. Some of the music got old fast. A lot of the tracks also shared the same environmental feel to them. They weren't the same layout, but the same environment, like three tracks in a casino. I suppose 3 tracks of the same theme is forgivable when there are 24 tracks. I'd rather have more tracks with less environments than less tracks.\n\nIn all, its a fun game. However, I simply can't recommend it compared to the later version. Yet I can always tell people go buy Sonic 1, 2 & 3. Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a great starting point for any combat racer, yet the follow up is just so much better. Dynamically changing levels, you pilot boats and fly planes instead of simply racing land vehicles. If you only have $10 and will never ever be able to get the $20 needed to buy Sonic & All-Stars Racing, then please buy this game. It fills a car combat niche that Steam is sorely lacking.","November 19, 2014","false","9.9"," 31 of 59 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","31","59","0","0"

On PC, it's a different story: despite meeting (and exceeding) the game's recommended system requirements, no matter what visual quality the game is set at, I get horrible stuttering during races. Talking with friends who also own the game, they have the same problem.\n\nIt can be almost impossible to run a race when in the middle of a lap the game halts for a full second for no discernable reason. I get locked 60fps otherwise, it just suffers from unplayable stuttering. Several users on the Steam forums have posted ways to help fix the stuttering problem, but I've tried everything and it's still there.\n\nIf I had to guess, it appears the game streams a lot of its textures and graphical effects dynamically during a race. The first time anything appears on screen, it must be loaded in to memory. The stuttering is often worse in the first lap of a race and then gradually becomes less and less frequent as you reach the end.\n\nInstead of this game, get "Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed." It's a better game in almost every way, and the quality of the PC port is significantly improved over this one.","April 7, 2015","false","1.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

I found the drifting mechanic awkward to use - you basically hold a button to drift yet you can still continue in almost a straight line.  Drift is used to charge up boosts so you end up drifting most of the way around a circuit even sometimes on relatively straight sections.\n\nVisuals and audio are great, with good Sega music including classics from older games and colourful, very varied and well animated playable characters.\n\nAs far as arcade racing goes, this fits the stereotype perfectly - there's even a commentator announcing what's happening as you race.  So if arcade racing is your thing (which Sega have a history in), give this a go.","May 30, 2013","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's nothing wrong with that, but it is very noticable. At the time of its release, it was good (I've never played it, but I've seen reviews) but now its generic, especially with the Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which overshadows this game by a long shot. Like I said, it's not bad at all, but you might as well get Transformed, or a Mario Kart, if you don't like Sega characters. It was good for the time. And if you really like racing games I would recommend, also if you want more maps in the All-Stars games (Transformed).\n\nThe items are mostly ripped right from Mario Kart, but maybe act a tiny bit different or just looks different. Here I'll show you below: (Format: Sega racing = Mario Kart)\nPunching Glove = Green Shell\nHoming Mistle = Red Shell\nMine = Banana Peel\nRainbow = Blooper\nHorn (actually origional before Mario Kart 8) = Super Horn\nAll-Star = Bullet Bill (Not exactly, but some are)\nShoe = Mushroom\n\nMy rating 6/10, not because it's bad, it's because there are a few better options, but if you want the game, go ahead and buy it.

As far as kart racers go, it's quite exceptional, and for me it outdoes Mario Kart in a few key areas, but...\n\n...Oooo-WOW, this port is bad.\n\nI seriously cannot grasp how Sega left it in the state it is in for as long as they have. I figured that once I upgraded from my old Pentium 4, the absolutely ATROCIOUS stuttering would stop or at least be lessened, but NOPE. Here I have a custom built rig that can handle the game's graphically superior sequel, Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed, without a single hitch, and yet here whenever I try to run this game it stops, literally, STOPS for a full SECOND whenever a racer gets hit with a powerup, for example. It doesn't seem to run all that well whenever a lot of racers are onscreen at once, either.\n\nBottom line is, DO NOT BUY THIS PORT. If you have some other console the game was released on, buy that version instead. Even the Wii version is a better choice than this, as graphically inferior though it may be, and even if it does run at 30fps or below, it's still at least decently playable in comparison.","April 5, 2014","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just wish that the PC version didn't suffer from severe FPS stutter & slowdown that makes it nearly unplayable.\n\nPROS\n-Wide Variety of Content\n-Up to 4-Player Split Screen\n-Full Controller Support (X-Input)\n-Lots of Unlockables\n\nCONS\n-No Online Support\n-Too Much Motion Blur (Can be turned off)\n-FPS Stutters & Freezes\n\nContent\n\nThe game has a variety of features & has a very good amount of content for it's purchase price.  The Single Player has the standard Grand Prix, Time Trials, & Challenges that will cater to a wide variety of difficulties.  I myself like to start out at the bottom ranks & work my way up rather than start out on the highest difficulty right away.  There's also multiplayer split screen for those who have local friends to play with.  If you're looking for an online experience you should probably check out Sega All-Star Racing TRANSFORMED.\n\nPERFORMANCE ISSUES\n\nThere is a big performance issue I seem to be having on several of my systems.  A big FPS stutter that won't seem to go away.  I've tried the D3D9.dll fix along with several others but none of which seemed to do anything.  It's a real shame cause I wasn't having this problem when I first started playing.  Either that or I just didn't notice it as much as I am currently.  I'm going to try and find more fixes if there are any available.  In the meantime, be wary when buying this game.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nI have yet to try the multiplayer modes.\n\nOVERALL\n\nEarly into the game & I think it's easily a recommendable title if you don't experience the problems I seem to be having.  The stutter can get really bad & make the game nigh unplayable.  It's still got everything you'd want in a Kart Racing game & probably a few things extra.  If you're on the fence about buying it you could always wait for a sale like I did but with the severe performance issues you might be better off skipping this one altogether especially since there is a better Sonic Kart Racing game in the newer Transformed.","January 23","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They might as well have linked these to steam, at least.\n\nThe game itself is fun and enjoyable, and it definitely fares very well against similar mascot racers such as the Mario Kart series, but this version is just not as good as the console versions due to cut features.

Now, I'm not saying that it doesn't have its merits, but after playing just a few minutes you can get the whole point of the game. That's not a bad point, being easy to pick up is something that's a little bit refreshing in the ever-increasing difficulty of being able to just friggin' PLAY a game. So, it gets points for that. One thing I can say about Sonic Team is that I haven't really encountered any bugs in any of the games I've played over the past year (after buying the big fat Sonic bundle that Steam has.)\n\nWhat does this mean? Mostly that they make games that work. I'm not happy to say that this is something a game developer should be applauded for, but it has actually reached that point. So - no major issues, great job, Sega. I mean, this really goes for all Sega games I've played in the past year.\n\nWhether Sonic racing is a direct response in competition to the competition's go-kart plumbers "Lets-a-go'ing" throughout sluggish tracks (and I love Nintendo, too, mind you) or not, it stands on its own as a very fast and zany enough racing game with a few characters to unlock and some cups to achieve. It's fun, but you can probably finish most of the game (Based off of only about a half hour of playing it, and trust me, this is enough to base a review on for as easy as it is to pick up) within about 10 hours. As a party game it stands much higher because it's so easy to pick up. If you have a buddy with an xbox controller, hook it up, and play the crap out of it - though given the scale of most computer monitors, this could be a bit difficult.\n\nFor the money, I would get it as part of the Hits Collection, because singularly the game is somewhat pricey for what it is, particularly in comparison to Transformed, but you will get your fun out of it.\n\n6/10 - Better than mediocre, but somewhat dated by the time you play Transformed. Outside of being a really GREAT party game, you won't find a lot of incentive to keep playing it. Does have great "fanboy" or "fangirl" appeal, though.","April 16, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a competent enough Mario Kart clone, but there's nothing exceptional about it. The course design is decently pretty, the music is good, the voices and sound effects significantly less so but they're passable. There's a godawful commentator which, thankfully, can be turned off. The problem with All-Stars Racing is that, compared to All-Stars Racing Transformed, it just feels lacking. The controls aren't as tight, the courses aren't as well designed, the character selection isn't as good, the weapon balance is infinitely worse, the AI is substantially less fair. The all-star powerup is absolutely broken, it is absurdly overpowered. Unfortunately Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing copying of Mario Kart extends all the way to including all of Mario Kart's flaws. Where All-Stars Racing Transformed is flawless in almost every possible respect, this game is just decent, and while it's worth throwing a few hours at if you pick it up in the Sonic Hits Collection, I can't recommend it on its own. Also the PC port is fairly poor, with minimal graphics settings including no settings for anti-aliasing and anistropic filtering, and all options that do exist are in a separate program rather than the main game, which is frustrating. Optimization is also fairly poor.","July 8, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

No... apparently they got really good with that sequel because this version sucks.\n\nAnd they get absolutely zero respect from me for automatically crashing on launch if your audio driver is set to anything above 48 KHz.

The anger between the two and side switching would have made modern fan boys (i.e Xpox or PS#) look sane. The reason was Sonic or Mario; who was better. Forget the SNES was much more powerful than the Genesis.(it was)  Sonic could move really fast around the screen and that was cool. Damn that makes me sound old.  Last I checked though these two where aging like rock stars. Mario was is like the Stones or the Who... You know still doing stuff every now and again that may or may not be good. Then theres Sonic. Sonic is Skinard. The soul is dead and its still there.\nSo how surpirsed am I that Sonic finally beat Mario. Not at platforming or RPGs or Parties. But Kart Racing? Mario made that territory. This unlike the "sequal" is a Mario Kart clone. Nothing transforming, just racing and good racing.\nThis game is one of the best kart racers ever made and except for Allstars Tranformed I say its the best. Its strange though. Transformed does not feel like the second in a series but an off shoot. Like Diddy Kong racing. In Transformed most of the characters are either missing from the first or their vehicles are totally changed and the tracks are totally different. Its nice, because that means this still has high replay value.\nThis is a nostalgic trip thats fun for people who know nothing about it. Thats the best type of game. Good for everyone. My kids can plays as well as my wife. and here I am a hardcore gamer and I like it.\nI bought this for 2.50 and it is worth every penny, even though it is older now. Still it looks great and is a blast to play. Seriously worth picking up on sale, along with Transformed.

I prefer the latter, but my kids like this one better; it doesn't make them try to fly.  Both games include the "catch up" feature that gives more boosts and All-Star moves to players doing significantly worse than the computer; my five-year-old in particular loves going all-star.\n\nBeyond that, it's a typical kart racing game, with weapons, drifting, obstacles, characters from other games, and a nice variety of tracks.  Casual fun for the whole family, with a few Missions and Challenges (achievements) for the completionist.\n\nThe split-screen mode supports up to four players, which would be perfect for our family if we had that many controllers.  (Like other Steam games, it seems to assume XBox 360 controllers, which means my PS-compatible controller doesn't really count.)  The Missions are only available in single-player mode, but most of the extra characters and tracks seem to be unlockable with "Sega Miles" that are racked up by simply playing nearly anything.","October 10, 2014","true","81.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find it a really fantastic kart racing game, and it's good to have a quality title in this genre for the PC.\n\nThe graphics are really nice and perform very well!  I often play it on my budget Intel Core i5 notebook with nVidia 635m graphics in 1080p on my television.  Levels are interesting and fun to race and just look at.\n\nPerhaps overlooked, but one of the best features is the announcer.  The voice actor sounds very authentic like a real sports guy, and while family safe his comments are pretty humorous!  I can't believe they didn't use him again in the follow up Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed!\n\nI wish they had more of the more mature rated Sega characters in here from my 80s childhood.  I would have loved to see the Shinobi, Altered Beast, and Golden Axe themed karts!\n\nI'm not sure why this game scored lower on Metacritic compared to Mario Kart Wii.  I've logged about 10+ hours playing that on a friends Wii, and I don't see where that game excels over S&SASR.\n\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoy this game and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a soild kart racing game for PC.","January 2, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In some ways it is vastly superior to the (IMO stale and repetitive) Mario Kart series, with far more interesting/fun racecourse designs - some of which reflect the games they come from remarkably well - and AI that doesn't cheat like a mother. On the flipside, the power-ups are comparatively bland, and the tracks only feature a handful of aesthetic themes (eight different "themes" on 3 tracks each). The character roster contains a lot of obscure figures, many of whom I know nothing about myself. Still though, trying out all the different characters is great fun.\n\nIt'll give you your kart-racing fix for sure, and is a good stand-in for Mario Kart on the PC.

Casual fun for the whole family, with a few Missions and Challenges (achievements) for the completionist.\n\nThe split-screen mode supports up to four players, which would be perfect for our family if we had that many controllers.  (Like other Steam games, it seems to assume XBox 360 controllers, which means my PS-compatible controller doesn't really count.)  The Missions are only available in single-player mode, but most of the extra characters and tracks seem to be unlockable with "Sega Miles" that are racked up by simply playing nearly anything.","October 10, 2014","true","81.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/34190/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic And Sega All-Stars Racing is a racing game that features some of the characters from Sega games. It was developed by Sumo Digital, who also made Outrun 2, and released in 2010. You can also call it kart racing, since it has all those weapons and powerups, but eh. You can. One things for sure: it's drift and boost based. It was also released on other consoles and iOS.\n\nAs usual, game supports either keyboard or XBox360 controller. It will still show keboard layout no matter what. Also, Steam/PC version is pretty barebones. For some reason, Sega decided that it shouldn't support any online feature. No Steam achievement. There is no Internet multiplayer, only local one. So most of you will be racing only against AI. There are no exclusive characters, like X360 version had Banjo-Kazookie. And there are no DLC, meaning that there is no Metal Sonic or Shenmue hero in forklift.\n\nSo, what you will get is racing game. Imagine colorful characters of Sonic and heroes of games like Billy Hatcher, AiAi or the ever grinning B. D. Joe. There are around twenty of them, with eight unlocked by default. And then you got the awesome varied tracks, which may have drifty like Casino Park from Sonic, have 90-degree turns and be riddled with obstacles like Monkey Ball tracks, or just be spooky Curien Mansion. Which is censored or alternative name for House of The Dead. Now, pour in weapons and add in drifting mechanic. And then add modes like Grand Prix, Missions, Time Attack. And add in Shopping where you can unlock characters, stages and music tracks for Sega Miles that you get for successfully completing races.\n\nCharacters vary in venichles that they drive. Outside of the usual stats differences, their vehicles can be sorted into few categories. First, there are usual cars, that can be divided into light and heavy ones. Then you got flying vehicles, like Tails Tornado, that aren't affected by terrain, like snow. And then you will get bikes, which are fast and you can get boost easily by performing ground trick, of pressing up and then down. Seriously, bikes are probably the best, not even sure if it's so balanced. And yes, once again, stats change, vehicles have different acceleration and handling, and, for example, some may stay in air after jump long enough to perform multiple tricks while other are too heavy to stay in air for long.\nAt least, thankfully, all the various tracks will catter to different vehicle types. Some are more straight, some will reward handling.\nTo little geniuses who wonder why Sonic has car: game itself has info in Sonic's profile that he drives a car to give other a sporting chance. The end.\n\nAnd yes, tricks. This game heavily uses drifting mechanics and rewards you for drifting with boost. Drifting is very controllable there, you can take any turns with it or can even try to drift on straight road with some success. Though, you may want to release gas button for sharp turns. You can build up to three level of boost, that will activate after you release the drift button. I recommend you to release it as soon as you see three levels of boost and then drift again immeditly, there are some turns where you can do it twice!\nYou also will be rewarded with boost for doing tricks. First, at the start of race, during countdown, you have to start the gas somewhere between "3" and "2". Depends on each character. There are air tricks that anybody can do, you just have to press drift button while in air. But make sure to finish air trick before landing, otherwise you will lose all boost that was built up. Bikes, as said, also got ground trick where you just press up and down around.\nBoosting will also knock obstacles down, like balls, giant casino chips and zzzzzzoooooombies.\n\nThe game also got power-ups that are randomly chosen when you pick it up. It got a fairly standard package of them. Speeding up, bombs, rockets, rainbow that only colors screen for real players, but hits AI characters. You can also shoot boxing gloves and rockets back. Actually, you can knock off the incoming rockets by using weapon of your own, usually by shooting it back. What kind of powerps you get also depends on what place you are in. As for stopping players that managed to get really far in the first place, it got usual "screw you" shooting star. The futher you are in the back, the more likely you will get good ones, getting triple rockets, or nuke rocket that you can detonate any time after launch.\nOh, and they got all-star moves. If you are really lacking behind you may get All-Star weapon. Announcer will not be afraid to tell it to everybody either. It's really a jolly power-up, as it will not only boost you to allow you to possibly get into the top, but it gives a character-specific spin. Akira from Virtua Fighter will hit his Outrun-like car with dashing elbow. Alex Kidd will ride on his helicopter, being able to shoot little shiny missiles. And Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone will even lets you choose one of the three power-ups to use in this case. It shows off a great characters, variety and each one will play a short theme song.\n\nYou also got around 64 challenges to beat. What should I say, they are varied, changing between more standard ones and more of wacky. In one challenge you have to beat all Jet Set Radio Future tracks. In another you will beat up a huge zombie boss. Jolly.\nAnd yes, you can also unlock music tracks. You can then choose to play any one of them in tracks, making it more varied than having same song in all Billy Hatcher tracks. Pretty much all of music is taken from previous games. The only unique ones in the game are main theme "So much more" and some other tracks used for menues, that sounds quite what you expect to hear from 90s racing games.\n\nAnd since AI is the only opponent you will most likely get, he should be mentioned. You can disable "catch-up" in options, but I would not recommend you to do this. AI just isn't strong enough to figure out how to stop you if you will be far in the lead. It actually manages to drag itself down, as the last players will keep doing All Star move that will hit main pack but will usually fail to reach the top. So, really, let this option be, it doesn't rubberband strong enough to screw you up without reason. you can still stay in the lead, it's just that single mistake will get you back into main pack of racers.\nAi isn't that hard either. I was actually surprised that I managed to beat all the Advanced Grand Prix. And I was expecting it to be brutal at it's best. But I guess they tried to kept it fair.\n\nAI also playes pretty well, althrough there are some constant thing about it. Some characters are better than others. Some drag behind.\nFor sure, most of the time you will be seeing Shadow The Hedgehog on his bike on top. And you will learn to hate him, as he keeps popping up on top and getting on second place in Grand Prix, where you will even want to pay extra attention to drag him down too, so you will have more breathing air in total scoring. Bonanza Bros also somehow manage to stay on top.\nAnd then you got characters like Big and Eggman who keep staying in the last places and spam their All-Stars move. Which will make Eggman, for example, start spamming rockets around, but will fail to reach you. And you will be hearing announcer talking about them alot. Oh. AND AIAI GOT BANANAS, BETTER WATCH OUT!\nAnd then you got Amigo, who will somehow be on both sides: Staying on top and getting All-Star move going where he gets on top anyway. At least his conga all-star is fun, making others dance behind.\n\nSEGA All-Stars Racing is pretty fun racing. Easy to pick up and play, addictive. One of the best "kart-racing", especially on PC where it just doesn't have so much competition. The only shame is that it doesn't support any online features. It also has some exclusive content that you will not get in All-Stars Racing Transformed. At least from what I heard. Tracks are unique for sure.","June 27, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Works great, even on Windows 10, has good graphics (for a kid's racing game) and fun characters.  Controls are easy but fun.  Great for just picking up and having a good time.  Both my four year old and my seven year old really enjoy it.  It is great family game time.\n\nIt is obviously a direct competitor to Nintendo's Mario Racing titles, but honestly the Sega one is better with better game play, fewer gimmicks and better graphics and controls.  We own the Wii and Wii U with all the Maria Racing titles and now that we have this, we will never play those again.  Sega totally improved on the formula here.  Nothing ground breaking, just a more solid, more fun family facing game.\n\nMultiplayer is local only.  That's too bad.

Azune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/k_azune/","28 products in account","This game is a definitive kart-racing title on PC, probably running on the same engine used by Outrun '06: Coast 2 Coast. While the gameplay isn't very deep, the amount of content this game provide more than worth the price. Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is way less punishing than its sequel and allows you to unlock all racers, tracks and music just by earning Sega Miles for each played event. Recommended to every SEGA fan.","June 4","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
