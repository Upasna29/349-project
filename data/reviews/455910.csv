It was one of my first ever games on a c.d. rom back in 1998-1999 (17th grade) and playing it now was just as fun, maybe even more,\nBack than I had and awkward Microsoft Joystick, today I use the XBOX one controller.\n\nUsing the XBOX one controller the control is very confortalbe (after customizing it using the settings) and I had no problem what so ever to run the game. I had one crash during my 6 or so hours and that's it.\n\nImportant suggestion\nThis is for nVidia card owners, but I'm sure there's something similar for AMD cards as well\nThe game is from 1998. On modern screen the game is Jaggie as hell and even though you don't buy this game today for it's amazing graphincs, going into the nvidia control panel and changing the 3D settings specifically for this application, forcing Anti-Aliasin, Antistropic filterring and what not improved the visuals immensly. For example, in the mission select screen there are some kind of laser rays, before they basicaly looked like steps and after they looked almost completly smooth. And everything you do, no matter how 'expensive' it is in terms of GPU, it's on a 1998 game so no effect.\n\nOne very importnt issue for people planning on using the XBOX one controller on windows 10 (and maybe older windows versions). Tht triggers used to be buttons (with on/off state and that's it). now they are an axis (the value corresponds to how much the trigger is pressed). The problem is that older games that aren't aware of this keep receiving the 0 value of the tigger axis when trying to configure the controller in game. The result is that you can't configure the buttons the buttons.\n\nI myself have the xBox one elite controller, and the software that comes with it allows me to set the middle point of the axis to a comfortable place (like the end of the axis), then when I configure the buttons I just press the triggers all the way and I can set the buttons - no problem. Did this with Rogue squadron and also Assassin's creed II. If you don't have the software this is harder to do, but I know there are some 3rd party configuration apps that allow to do just that. Another option is to use the XBOX 360 controller, but I don't like it as much. It's triggers however are plain buttons so no problem there.\n\nOne last comment.\nI read some revires saying that this game is not configured well for the latest and greatest machines. Now I can't speak on behalf of anyone but me, but my rig is pretty strong (i7 6700k, 16GB DDR4, SSD, gtx 980 TI) and I had no problem at all. Before I had the game on steam I tried using my old c.d. and there were a lot of problems (it was on windows 7, about two years ago) so maybe there was a patch, I don't know. Either way, works great for me,\n\nOh, and, once you're finished, use these, their fun :)\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/70612-star-wars-rogue-squadron-3d/cheats\n","April 26","true","8.1"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","30","30","0","0"

I recommend this game, but only to someone who loves Star Wars and has patience, because the controls for this game are not the best, and I suggest experimentation with different control schemes and take your time to get used to them.

(For those whining about needing a controller, grow up and get over it. You used to have to buy memory cards to save games. It won't kill you to buy a controller to make your PC games all the more fun for games designed for controllers)\n\nAn easy way to increase the resolution is to download nglide from zeus. (search it) It works with old 3DFX games and the like and it'll allow you to universally set the resolution of all similar games like this but remember you can't make this game widescreen.\n\nThis game really comes into its own when you try and get gold medals on every mission.

You will need a gaming controller for this game (360/XONE/PS3/PS4/Steam/Whatever). Don't even think about trying this on keyboard. You'll thank me later.\n\nI remember this game extremely well from the N64 era. Though I imagine for a lot of people, you might remember Shadows of the Empire better than this game, it's still a worthy entry to the Star Wars series, set between Episodes 4 and 5 of the movie series. I spent countless hours in the original flying around, blasting the Empire's forces to pieces, and eventually I got the Gold Medal for every single mission in the game (No easy task, especially on some missions).\n\nUpdate #2 (April 3): I've now Gold Medalled every mission in this release of the game too, so I can verify they're all doable.\n\nNow that the PC rerelease is out, consider this game if you're a Star Wars fan. Especially if you're into the air combat aspect of Star Wars games.Unfortunately, there's no space combat to speak of in this game (Even when you play one of the bonus missions), so if you're here looking for epic Star Wars-themed space battles.... Look for a different game (Sorry)\n\nFor you newcomers who are finding this game for the first time on Steam, do NOT expect it to be an easy flythrough and romp through the Star Wars universe. Expect to fail/Game Over many missions repeatedly before passing them. It does become a lot easier once you know what to do and where enemies spawn to reach for many of the elusive Gold Medals, but focus on passing the mission first, and worry about medals and extra stuff after.\n\nAnd finally, don't expect this game to be like Ace Combat, because it really isn't. Take it for what it's worth and you'll have a good time blowing stuff up.\n\nUpdate: After playing with the Steam Port for a bit, the camera is a bit clunky at first and takes some getting used to (You'll be changing it a fair bit to force the game to refocus on the ship, I recommend playing Level 1 repeatedly until you Gold it). And maybe it's just me, but the ships themselves aren't as nimble as I remember... Or maybe it's just been so long since my last playthrough that I'm rusty...\n\nNow excuse me while I swipe an X-wing and blow up some more Imperial forces...","March 30","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game only has a high rating because of nostalgia. And to be fair, the game was awesome and is still lots of fun to play.\n\nOr at least it would be, if this wasn't a terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port and a blatant cash grab.\n\nThere is virtually zero effort made here to make this game work on modern machines. The default mouse and keyboad controls are the worst I have EVER seen in a game, to a point of beng utterly useless. This would be fine if the game had proper controller support, but shockingly the controller support is actually terrible. The game doesn't even detect my ps4 controller, and even after I used Xpadder to make my ps4 controller work and mapped the in-game keys to it the controls were terrible and very unsmooth.\n\nThe graphics options aren't very good either, with there being no option to play the game at any modern resolutions. I hope you enjoy pixelated graphics!\n\nSimply put, I feel ripped off even though I only payed 10 bucks for this. Unless you just so happen to have a joystick that works perfectly with this, this isn't playable. Since this is a re-release, this is not acceptable in any way.\n\nI will probably ask for a steam refund, but first I want to see if doing so will make this review will go away. If it does, then I won't refund the game so that this review will stay here as a warning to others. Ignore the hype and the high rating, this port is ♥♥♥♥♥.","March 31","false","0.4"," 50 of 94 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","50","94","5","14"

I figured the price had something to do with making the game compatible, but I was wrong.\n\nI see most people are using xbox 360 controllers, and these don't work as smooth as people are saying. They are ok at best. You cannot reconfigure the controller in the options, and the menu tends to fade to black randomly. Changing sensivitity doesn't seem to exist at all.\n\nIn game, it seems the camera is buggy especially if you boost with the x-wing. It is incredibly frustrating when your vehicle barely turns or makes huge circles depending on the camera angle. One time I even was stuck in the cockpit mode flying into oblivion. It could definitely use some sort of patch. I certainly see why some of the youtube playthroughs have terrible aim. So good luck gold plating the levels to get to hoth.\n\nAfter about 2 hours of trying to get back into it and thinking maybe I just suck at flying (trying to keep an open mind), I realized the controls, camera, and the random crashing made the experience not worth it. Honestly, I had such high hopes to play these levels again. The compatiability effort on the developer's end is just not there. Guess they figured everyone (like me) would purchase out of nostalgia. I just requested a refund as I approached my 2 hour limit.\n\nOnly neat thing for anyone that wants to keep the game, I typed in the chicken password, and I started level 1 as an at-st...it was sweet, but the aim head stick is the same as the move stick so it was akward. It might be cool to try on another level as the at-st.","April 5","false","1.9"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

This is also, as that suggests, a very old game.  Although I have had extensive experience with this game when I was younger, I am going to try to make this a nostalgia-free review.\n\nAlso, for everyone having trouble with the camera, just press the 'view' button a few times (START on a 360 controller).\n\n\n\nPROs\n++Good flight handling.  I've seen plenty of more modern games that I wish had the same flight handling as the classic Rogue Squadron series.\n++Fun game.  This game is just fun.\n++Caters to fans.  The more you know of the SW EU (now "Legends") the more things, small and large, you'll appreciate in this game.\n+Enhanced graphics (compared to the N64 version).  This game is about 200 MB or so, which is much larger than the old N64 cartridges could hold.  I presume that's mostly in better textures.\n+Compatibility.  So far, I haven't experienced any problems other than a small default camera setting issue (as much complained about, as noted above).  It works much better than my attempts to emulate the game in the past.\n\nCONs\n--Graphics are old.  I noted that the graphics are superior to the N64 version, but that is not to say they are at all up to modern standards.  This is a game from 1998.  If you want nice graphics, this isn't for you.\n--EU reliant.  If you don't know much about the EU, some of the later missions, especially, won't make much sense.\n--Difficult.  If you want a challenge, this game is definitely that.  If you're a more casual gamer (like myself), I would recommend enjoying this game with infinite lives.\n--No Alt-Tab.

I'm sure it wasn't, as I was MUCH younger back then. That said, this game has a number of flaws. It may sound nit-pickey, but leaving these flaws in this re-release is just ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. There's no excuse for this. It's not like they spent thousands of hours designing a game, and left a few small parts unpolished; I'd be more forgiving if that were the case, but there was zero effort put into this re-release. I recommend that you go buy an old N64 and play this game properly, instead of rewarding lazyness with your money. You will get a much better experience out of it.\n\nThings that ♥♥♥♥ me off about this game:\n\nHalf the game is designed for a mouse, the other half for a game pad. For instance, there's no way to map a controller's start button to bring up the menu in-game (using just the game, not joy2key or something), but once you press Esc and actually get to the menu, you'll find it's designed for a game pad. If you want to use the mouse for this menu you can't just point and click, you have to move it around, because the game thinks the mouse is a joystick. You can get used to it, sure, but why do I have to have a keyboard, mouse, AND a game pad all right in front of me just to play a game THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR A GAMEPAD?\n\nThe chart indicating which ships you can use on the level you're about to play is almost never right, and the use-any-ship-on-any-level cheat doesn't seem to work. I can't remember if this was a problem on the original or not. Either way, it's the result of lazyness.\n\nThe camera won't keep up with the ships. If you speed boost, lots of the time the ship will fly off into the distance, and you have to press the camera angle button to get it back to normal. This happens so often, it's almost unplayable. Rogue Squadron is an amazing game, and it's such a shame that a game breaking bug like this would ever see the light of day.","April 30","false","5.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","2"

The game has a launcher where you can calibrate a "Joystick", but the dropdown list of recognized gamepads is empty, which means it's looking for a compatible windows-recognized game-controller but is not finding one... the steam controller is a mouse and keyboard according to windows. This means that the in-game joystick/gamepad settings do not accept any input, because no controller was loaded from the launcher. So... the remaining possibility is to configure the steam controller as keyboard/mouse and set the ingame binds accordingly (since the game can be played with a keyboard and mouse). After some messing around, I got the steam controller joystick to produce a mouse signal for the game to use, so that the joystick would steer the ship. But (as another reviewer pointed out) the mouse control is totally messed up, delayed+unresponsive... so the only way to make this work is to steer the ship with arrow keys... the joystick can be configured to simply replicate keypresses of the arrow keys, but then you have no control over the speed at which you steer, so you might as well play the game with a SNES controller... eugh, I spent hours hoping that I could figure out a way to at least make it feel ok... even if it was a tricky configuration... but I've concluded that it is not possible. Additionally, if you try to configure the steam controller specifically for the game, it doesn't work... it will stay with your Desktop configuration after the game is launched... so as I was testing, I had to keep going back to the main controller config (not in the game's menu) and manually changing my desktop config... I hope this makes enough sense, and that if you're hoping to use a steam controller for this game, you will understand what I'm talking about and not waste your time like I did.\n\nI even have the N64 cartridge... just thought it would be nice to play high frame-rate with newer hardware/controller... guess I'll be refunding this and busting out the N64 :P","March 29","false","0.6"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","9","31","0","4"

This game is a total nostalgia trip for me. The game doesn't emulate at all and actual carts of it aren't exactly cheap, so it's been quite a while since I've played it, and man, does it hold up. The framerate's even better, too!\n\nThere are some issues with the port, though. This is literally the PC version of the game that came out in '98, with all the problems it brings to a modern system. I've had few problems with it personally, but that doesn't mean it won't be completely unplayable on someone else's system.\n\nTwo big things are standing out to me, though. First off, the game only supports 4:3 resolutions. While I've heard of mods to change that, it does not do it natively, so, depending on the screen you have, you're either going to have to deal with black borders (which I would prefer) or a blown up image that makes everything look super wide and off (which I have). I'll look into that further and post my fix on the forums if I find one. Also, the game does recognize my controller (a wired 360 one) just fine, but I can't seem to bind the pause button to it, meaning I have to use the keyboard's Escape key to pause, no matter what. The default controls are also a little off-putting, but easily changable in-game to something more practical, in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR: That all being said, this game is a classic that plays amazingly to this day. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone, and it was absolutely worth the $10.","April 3","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In that folder, you'll see an app called Rogue Squadron (not the other one called ROGUE). Right click Rogue Squadron, hit properties, click on the compatibility tab, and check the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings." box. Now your issue should be resolved!\n\nThis is possibly one of the best games I've gotten from Steam. Nostalgia aside, this is possibly one of the best star wars fighter games made for PC, and yes, even better than EA's Star Wars Battlefront dogfights. See, the dogfights aren't as fun if there are no objectives, which is what EA doesn't seem to understand. Even Battlefront II's dogfights are better because you can choose to cripple the enemy capital ship, engage in 1-to-1 combat, or land in the other capital ship and wreak havoc. Anyway, back to my review.\n\nPROS:\n+Nostalgia value\n+Dogfights with objectives\n+cheatcodes for messing around in a Millenium Falcon, AT-ST, Naboo Starfighter, etc.\n+Death Star trench and Battle for Hoth gameplay\n+Racing minigame with T-16 Skyhoppers\n+Decent difficulty, enough to make the dogfights not boring, and fun in most cases\n+Amazing first person cockpit view (I tend to use this for all levels that don't require speeders. It's great to feel like you're in the actual cockpit.\n+Very smooth, at what seems to be 60fps\n\nCONS:\n-Took a bit of research on my part to make the resolution match my screen in order to get the full screen, instead of 1/4 of the screen, to appear\n-Defection from Corellia is the worst level ever. So many places where you can mess up, and you have to restart the whole thing if you mess up anywhere.\n-1998 Graphics, although for 1998, these were excellent graphics\n-Some of the audio is a little odd. For instance, when you beat Battle for Hoth, the General who commands you (Luke Skywalker) says that the Millenium Falcon made it out all right and warns you not to do anything stupid like flying off to Dagobah. HOW DID HE KNOW THAT LUKE WAS GOING TO DAGOBAH???!!!!\n-Turning the ships around can sometimes be a pain in bulkier fighters\n-No alt+tab support\n-Happened once, so it might be a fluke, but I beat a level, and the game crashed. Before that, I had probably beaten about 7 levels, so it might have been some kind of pile-up error in the code. I beat more than 7 levels upon restarting the program and didn't have any crashing issues.\n\n\nVerdict: 9/10\nIf you give me alt-tab support, I will switch this to a 10/10","March 31","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has very basic but good and working controller support including joystick support.\nOnly issues are lack of the ability to alt-tab (likely for stability purposes) and pop-in that occurs when you are catching up to shoot down fighters that got a bit of distance on you.\n\nThe game has not aged gracefully graphically speaking, but the gameplay is just as fun as I remember it.\n\nFor the price of a movie ticket?

Keyboard and mouse controls are a bit clunky but my Xbox One controller has full support and is way more comfortable than the N64. You can pilot multiple vehicles and take on a vast majority of missions. In a mission you can also search for weapon upgrades and try to get enough requirements to reach a gold medal to unlock more crafts. Another plus, unlike other Star Wars games, this one mostly has original music thats fits John Williams scores very well. I highly recommend to pick this up to prove that this game takes skill to fly unlike Battlefront EA's lock on, insta-dodge mechanics, and QTE AT-AT takedowns. Hopefully we'll see a Rogue Squadron Trilogy remaster in the future for both console and PC, more people need to experience the Star Wars games back when they were good.","March 29","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In that folder, you'll see an app called Rogue Squadron (not the other one called ROGUE). Right click Rogue Squadron, hit properties, click on the compatibility tab, and check the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings." box. Now your issue should be resolved!\n\nThis is possibly one of the best games I've gotten from Steam. Nostalgia aside, this is possibly one of the best star wars fighter games made for PC, and yes, even better than EA's Star Wars Battlefront dogfights. See, the dogfights aren't as fun if there are no objectives, which is what EA doesn't seem to understand. Even Battlefront II's dogfights are better because you can choose to cripple the enemy capital ship, engage in 1-to-1 combat, or land in the other capital ship and wreak havoc. Anyway, back to my review.\n\nPROS:\n+Nostalgia value\n+Dogfights with objectives\n+cheatcodes for messing around in a Millenium Falcon, AT-ST, Naboo Starfighter, etc.\n+Death Star trench and Battle for Hoth gameplay\n+Racing minigame with T-16 Skyhoppers\n+Decent difficulty, enough to make the dogfights not boring, and fun in most cases\n+Amazing first person cockpit view (I tend to use this for all levels that don't require speeders. It's great to feel like you're in the actual cockpit.\n+Very smooth, at what seems to be 60fps\n\nCONS:\n-Took a bit of research on my part to make the resolution match my screen in order to get the full screen, instead of 1/4 of the screen, to appear\n-Defection from Corellia is the worst level ever. So many places where you can mess up, and you have to restart the whole thing if you mess up anywhere.\n-1998 Graphics, although for 1998, these were excellent graphics\n-Some of the audio is a little odd. For instance, when you beat Battle for Hoth, the General who commands you (Luke Skywalker) says that the Millenium Falcon made it out all right and warns you not to do anything stupid like flying off to Dagobah. HOW DID HE KNOW THAT LUKE WAS GOING TO DAGOBAH???!!!!\n-Turning the ships around can sometimes be a pain in bulkier fighters\n-No alt+tab support\n-Happened once, so it might be a fluke, but I beat a level, and the game crashed. Before that, I had probably beaten about 7 levels, so it might have been some kind of pile-up error in the code. I beat more than 7 levels upon restarting the program and didn't have any crashing issues.\n\n\nVerdict: 9/10\nIf you give me alt-tab support, I will switch this to a 10/10","March 31","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not much character developemnt or major EU legends gound breaking things to see here. But all the fun is playing in Luke's X-wing, and several other Rebel ships shooting down tie fighters blowing up the imperials crap.\n\nThe Pc port gets  the most criticism for not being like the N64 version, for being buggy, or not even running at all on a top notch pc. I'm glad Steam has released this game on here so it can fix all those issues, GOG also has released this game and it works pretty well on there too. I haven't had issues, i think it has do with what kind of pc you have.\n\nOne thing i have a problem with the pc version, is the fact the camera gets really annoying, your ship would fly away from your camera really fast, there are some ways to fix it like switching craft positions or dying at least once.\n\nSetting up a controller is pretty annoying, i use the xbox 360 and an xbox one controller and i generally would like to set it up to a degree i would like it, but i'm just fine with where its set up as default controls with some tweaks the control setup.\n\nOther than that, its a good port to steam hopefully as time goes on, this game will increase in popularity and the mod community will grow and people will be able to mod this game and make new interesting missions, i only hope. Now Steam, Disney, EA or whoever is running the Star Wars floor of games, RELEASE MORE CLASSICS TO STEAM! Such as Shadows of the Empire, Pod Racer, Battle For Naboo, Battlefront 1 (2004), and release a pc version to Rogue Squadrons 2 and 3!","April 6","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
