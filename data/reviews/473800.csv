"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/473800/","nekomimibadik","XJ9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/","2090 products in account","This is a very nice and fun to play variation of good old bullethell scrollshooters, but in this one bullets coming from left and right, and towards you so you have to dodge stuff in 3 dimentions while shooting mobs. It's pretty short but plenty of difficutlies each of which changes the game significantly gives it great replayability.\n\n+various playstyles - you can pack your girl with different weapons, subweapons and skills so you can find what fits you better - more hp and more damage or higher mobility and faster shots\n+4 difficulties - i completed the easy one with the 1st try hardly understanding what i'm doing, when i got to hard difficulty i've got used to controls and bullet mess on the screen so i got through all the levels pretty good, but the last bost killed me zillion times so i did not managed to beat him ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, *harder* difficulty is very hard i still cant stand it and i cant imagine what's going on on the last one.\n+very nice for short play sessions - 4 levels takes not very much time to complete, well 5 levels if you manage to beat the game on the hardest.\n+has local VS multiplayer (only if you have 2 joysticks) and online multiplayer so you can connect dirrectly to your friends ip or something like that.\n+practice mode\n+graphics are not the best, but it fits the style of the old touhou games pretty much so it has its own charm\n+Has very good value for money ratio :)\n-music tracks are okay\n\nAfter all it's a good buy, specially if you were missing touhou games on steam :)","May 21","true","2.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"
