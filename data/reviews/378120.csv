I had it all. Fame, money, women, and league title wins. Then, the new season came around and we were ready to do it all over again. We went on to lose our first match, but I figured it must surely be bad luck. Then, the second game came around, and we lost that one too. Interesting. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. It was obvious to everyone that it was a fluke, though. Fourth time? Referee's fault. Fifth? THEY LITERALLY CHEATED.\n\nAt the end of the season, the team found themselves in the relegation zone.

As I've said, I've played this franchise for quite a while now, with thousands of hours pumped into it, and I must say that this is probably the most balanced of them all. I say that for a couple of reasons. First, I don't run away with games against teams I have no business beating. It sounds like a lot of people on here will take a team like Aston Villa and expect to be world beaters, lose to Man Utd, and say "the game's cheating, I lost." Look at the real life table and you'll see something shocking! Villa are dead last. You're not meant to win every game all the time. I'm sorry, but you're not - if you did, the game would be broken.\n\nI find it funny that people come into sim games and expected it to be realistic, but only if you're winning, like you're the best manager in the world. If a real life, qualified, and experienced manager can't get wins, or stay afloat in the top flight, what kind of gall do you have to think you're better than somebody who does it for a living? It's a bit arrogant.\n\nYes, I understand it's a video game, and that you, as the player, have a hero complex. You've played Mario, you're a fat Italian plumber who's doing acrobatics and crap, killing monsters. Then you play FM and bring that mentality to a sim game, and get pissy when you're garbage. Well, Mario isn't a realistic game is it? We all know Italians can't do anything, let alone save a princess over and over again. ;)\n\nJokes aside, the positives of this game vastly outweigh the negatives. Another positive to the match engine is the realism in the highlights and game play. In the past I've noticed that in the final 10 minutes or so, teams would dominate you. This was incredibly present in FM15. It didn't seem to matter who the teams were - Spain vs. Malta, didn't matter, Malta would destroy the final ten with nearly 100% possession. Sure, it could be written off as tactics, and player fatigue, and all that, but it was too consistent to be a fluke. This version has none of that. Evenly matched teams seems to have equal spells of possession through the game, which is good.\n\nThere are still some issues with possession mind you. I have found that in the majority of my matches, even against superior teams, I'm dominating the possession and shot game. In fact, it can be a bit ridiculous at times with me having upwards of 75% control over the game. I suppose it's a good problem to have.\n\nLet's take a look at scorelines. Again, in past installments, scores could reach outrageous numbers on a consistent basis. I can't tell you how many times I was apart of 5-3 games. Sure, it happens. But not 15-20 times a season. FM 16 provides more realistic scores, despite the odd possession bias. Most of my games are 1-0, 2-1, etc... I had one 4-0 game. There really isn't much more to say on this other than it seems like it's more realistic.\n\nDefending - oh boy, this has been a personal problem of mine for years in this game. I just don't have the tactical know-how to keep the ball out of my own net, and I like many, ticked it up to a poor ME. This year's version I'm quite pleased with. Either I figured out the defending myself, or the game changed to allow more realistic scorelines. I don't mind losing - it's part of football. But I HATE losing 5-0. It was a turn off for me, and often times I would just quit and not play for a few days because of that. Like I said, save for one game where we scored 4, I haven't seen obnoxious scorelines for seemingly no reason. It's good, I like it.\n\n"But, we've dominated the game, have 30 shots, and lost 1-0. The game is broken." - Many negative reviews. I suppose these people have never heard of defending/counter attacking. Absolutely that can happen. Look at Chelsea's Champions League win a few years back. They sat in their own end the entire game, and scraped out a win. It's not pretty, but when you're up against a stronger team, it's what you have to do. I feel the AI in this game is better than it has been in years past. Opposition knows when they're up against a stronger team, and they pretty much line up 10 guys at the edge of the box, forcing you to have control and possession, taking bad shots, and frustrating your strikers. All the while, they're sucking your defenders in. Fullbacks get too deep, to try for the wide ball, and central defenders slowly creep forward losing the only striker up front. Next thing ya know, they have a 1-on-1, and you're down 1. You get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and say it's broken. I say, change your tactic. Draw the defense out, so press so much. Etc...\n\nFootball is a complex game, and FM 16 is just as complex. If you don't want realistic football, if you want to go and rout your opponents at every turn, play FIFA. Managing a team in a realistic setting is frustrating, but it also has it's rewards. And in this version, I feel that SI has finally nailed down a realistic, fun, and interesting experience.\n\nThere are other aspects I haven't touched upon, like the transfers, UI, and press conferences. But other than the new design, it's all pretty much the same old. The new skin looks alright, takes a bit getting used to, but ya know, you can just get a mod. :)","November 30, 2015","true","312.4"," 650 of 759 people (86%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","86","650","759","95","6"

If you are new to the series, or indeed the genre, you should buy this game. It is by far the best available in the genre. Highly recommended.\n\nHowever, if you have owned virtually every CM/FM game that has ever been released, then perhaps the following comments will constitute a review which is closer to your heart?\n\nSomewhere along the line, these games lost their soul. The most identifiable yardstick along this path was the moment the developers introduced overall star ratings for players. There was a time, in early CM games, when signing a player was a risk. You would look at their form, stats and overall value and make a decision. Sometimes, you would buy a flop and othertimes you would make a great signing. Now all you need to do is have a good scout and you can go on the star rating they provide. That might be good for your average ADHD fifa manager type players, but people buying these games, for the most part, WANT to spend time trying to make these decisions and don't want to have their hands held through the process. In a real-world scenario, a player who has scored 20+ goals in a season immediately attracts interest from bigger clubs. In this game however, you will simply overlook such a player if their star rating is poor. In these games form has absolutely no relevance when making signings. This is NOT an accurate simulation of how decisions are made in real life.\n\nIf you are a long-standing player of these games, ask yourself this question - when was the last time you bought a player who ended up not being good enough to make it at your club? This is something real-world managers live and die by, but is an element of football management which has been woefully overlooked by the developers. Somewhere along the way the developers have made the hardest decision in football management the easiest one. Signing new players should always be a risk. Think of the countless examples in real life of signings which on paper should have been stars. If there is one thing which is clearly evident, it is that even the most experienced and talented of managers occasionally buy players who flop. This should be the most important aspect of any football management simulation. Instead, this game provides you with god-like ability to predict just how good a player will be in the future through an overall star rating. In real-life, managers would make such predictions through a combination of the player's professionalism, age, determination, injury history and availabilility of experienced players for the youngster to learn from. These factors would also fluctuate over time and be subject to change. Hence, a player like Michael Johnson at Man City comes an goes.  By forcing players to consider these things the developers could make this game SO much more rewarding and return the franchise partway to its former roots.\n\nAs for the matchday engine, it is simply a non-event. The quality is just not there to warrant ever using this view. The ardent FM fan will not even care about the 3D view as it is not the aspect of the game which they find rewarding. Rather, it is taking the plunge and signing players and working them into a functional tactical system. Incidentally, tactics is the one area of the game which the developers have virtually got spot on. You cannot sail through a season just repeat using the same system like in the good old days.\n\nMy suggestion, stop trying make a stats-driven simulation and try to return some atmosphere to the game. You can make a start by providing authentic match day sounds. I could go for hours explaining how this game could be improved, but ultimately this is intended as a review and not a 'blue-sky' suggestion session for the developers.\n\nI will obviously keep buying these games, if only for the reason that there is no other franchise which comes close in this genre. But everytime I buy the latest version a little piece of me (and the genre) dies. It is for this reason that I have to send a message to the world that as long as this game is not fulfilling its enormous potential, I cannot in good conscience recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n","May 3","false","218.8"," 219 of 248 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","219","248","11","9"

The last few editions, they roll out several dozen new features (burger vans at the stadium, players growing facial hair, create your own Frankensteinian manager, etc.) while stubbornly refusing to fix problems that have been repeatedly reported for several years. They use their early-adopters to beta test well after the full release, send out a couple partial patches and then declare the game "good" and start working on the next edition.\nIf you report a bug, they want a game save from before the bug occurred, which means you either need to keep weekly in-game saves or discover the bug before periodlic saving.  And then...maybe they fix it, maybe they declare it a neglible flaw in the program.\nIn this year's edition, the "create a manager" is a ugly, horrible mess, the "create a club" is a barely-supported feature that's more work than it's worth, the player regens look like the unholy cross between extras from "The Hills have Eyes" and Sloth from "The Goonies", with misshapen heads, cross eyes, and fairly frightening hairstyles. Large portions of entire continents with fairly-developed football systems are ignored (Africa, South America, North and Central America, etc.) - maybe everyone doesn't want to play European football, and although most countries can be unlocked in the editor, they are not realistic countries/leagues without major alterations.\nOverall, I'm going to play FM 16, and probably log too many hours (because it's bought and paid for), but I just can't continue to endorse this product if they're not going to fix what is consistently wrong while continuing to add features that don't improve the product.","December 10, 2015","false","690.2"," 311 of 376 people (83%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","83","311","376","25","5"

I've spent hundreds of hours trying to like this car crash of programming.\nFM16 nonsense in no particular order:\n\nA player will do everything he can to force a move (except actually put in a transfer request - to keep his loyalty bonus). Then when you finally give in and sell him, his team mates will be annoyed at YOU for seling him. Ridiculous.\n\nA young player, at the end of a meeting, will almost always say "I'll get going then. I'm sure you'll want me for something else soon..."\nExcuse ME? I'm a strict disciplinarian with a fierce reputation (think Fabio Capello). No young player in his right mind would DARE be so damned rude like that in real life.\n\nEndless, pointless, media. PLEASE there is absolutely no need for all the daft questions over and over again. All that time spent programming them could've been spent better elsewhere for God's sake.\n\nYou take over a new club and are instantly bombarded with meetings with players disgruntled at their lack of football under the PREVIOUS manager. They'll even make threats like "if the situation doesn't improve we'll be talking about this again..." and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no such thing as a clean slate in FM. Why do all players, regardles of their personality, THREATEN us constantly?\n\nAlso when taking over a new club (at the end of the season/beginning of the next) you are forced to hold a team meeting where all you can do is annoy half the squad. The best you can say is "this season coming is going to be a good one for the club" (or words to that effect), which leads to a near-unanimous response of "what a waste of time..."\n\nAbsolutely non-negotiable contract terms are infuriating.\nEvery. Single. Part. Of. A. Contract. should be negotiable. You're supposed to be sitting at a table with a player and his agent. You can't tell me that when you bring up a release clause they both stick their fingers in their ears? Money talks. You should be able to negotiate ALL parts of a contract no matter how much the other side wants to "stick".\n\nPlace an advert for a coach. You are allowed another 5 coaches. Sign the first coach. Advert is automatically removed and so you have to place another advert. WHY? Stop this ♥♥♥♥. Let me decide when the advert ends ffs.\n\nStaff respond to said advert. You "approach to sign" and find they are not willing to negotiate a contract.\nWHY DID THEY APPLY THEN??? Bloody idiots.\n\nWhy are team talk choices changed for each match? Each half? Each post-match? Feels a bit iffy.\nSurely I should be able to say whatever I want at all times, rather than select from a handful of pre-determined choices?\n\nAssistant manager's in-match advice is complete and utter useless drivel. He's just picking out stuff at random and saying it. You are playing a short passing game; he tells you to play long-ball. You play long-ball, he tells you to adopt a short passing game (apply this to every other kind of tactical decision - he will simply tell you to do the opposite). Pleb.\n\nSome players will refuse to move to your club citing that they don't think they "will get the 1st team football they need" at your club. You can't even open negotiations. You can't even guarantee them key player status.\nThey then move to another club on half the wages you would've given them, and rot away in the reserves. LOL.\n\nWhy does the game make a big deal out of the tone of voice I use in press conferences? What purpose does that serve, exactly? "Is often calm but has been known to be assertive on occasion..." What on EARTH is the point in this?\n\nI could go on forever but you get the idea. If you suffer from insomnia, I definitely recommend this game to you. It is so boring you might just slip into a coma. 1/10","January 15","false","522.2"," 406 of 508 people (80%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","80","406","508","175","25"

Also, this review is intended for Football Manager players that already know how to play this game.\n\nPros:\n\n\nMost advanced animations yet in any Football Manager edition. What I mean by that is the fact that FINALLY you can see the difference in Flair / Quality between 2 players. New dribblings, crosses, decisions and finishing in front of goal. It was FM13 since I've been asking for more realistic dribblings / decisions / crosses in the final third but the game never got quite there, until now. Let me give you a short example: I am playing as AC Milan and Jeremy Menez was attacking the right flank as a Winger-Attack. In any of the previous versions, he would have done 3 possible things: attack the byline and cross, cutting into the penalty area or pass the ball back to the overlappting full back. Now, I noticed something absolutly beautiful: He did neither of those. His decision was to dribble 2 players like they were nothing by cutting inside the penalty area and then he launched a lobbed-cross to Luiz Adriano who was rushing forward from a deeper position. Now, besides his way of dribbling (which i've never seen before in FM), we can easily notice another MAGNIFICENT improvement: lobbed crosses. This kind of crosses are a must in a game like FM and I am finally happy it was introduced. So yes, new animations / decisions / dribblings / crossings. You can finally see the difference between 15 Flair and 18 Flair so to speak.\nGame is in a much better state beta wise than it was last year (loading times, match engine and leagues)\nFast loading / saving times. Last year's beta was awful regarding saving times. It was something that eventually got fixed, but FM16 doesn't have this problem at all. In fact, to me it seems than the game loads/saves faster than FM15.\n3D Match Engine is another thing that pleasantly surprised me (played 3 games). By this I mean it feels smoother, no visible glitches and artefacts. Last year we had all sorts of problems with 3d engine performance until it got fixed (the game ran choppy and stuttering a lot on anything above "medium" quality no matter how powerful your machine was). In this regard, FM 2016 shines right from the start. I am able to play the game on highest graphical settings.\nOne of the biggest improvements in my opinion is ProZone analysis tool. This tool is so so much better than what we had before. If you are the kind of manager that likes to keep tabs on every aspect of the tactic you are creating, than I swear, ProZone is exactly what you've been waiting for.\nNew tactical framework is excelent  in my opinion, definetly much better than last year's, especially if you are a newcomer to the game. For new players it is much easier to make them understand what each setting does and for the experienced players, well, it makes their "job" easier.\nAnother pro of FM 16 is the actual Player Profile Screen which wasn't completly revamped but the slight adjustments SI made are welcome. You can get almost every necessary info about a player just by clicking Profile Tab.\nContract negociations screen has been completly revamped and its new look is very neat. It wasnt bad in any of the previous versios, but these new adjustments are always welcome.\nCons:\n\nThe only con that I feel I must put out is how the Formation Tactic screen looks like. By this, I mean the players on the pitch in the tactics screen. I feel that player's "thumbnail" takes way way too much space than it needs to. This gives me some sort of claustrophobic feeling. This is something that bothers me, but it might not bother anybody else.\nNow, I didn't write about all the new features that SI has introduced because that's not relevant for this review. I felt like I only need to adress things that need to be adressed considering the game is still in BETA state. This said, I conclude this review by stating that FM16 BETA seems far better than FM15 BETA and I will enjoy every minute of it. I will write a full review after the game comes out in the final version (13 November). By then I will know more. Consider this review, as a review at a glance if you will. Enjoy the best football manager simulator out there.\n\nI also recorded some videos of it, which you can see on my profile/YT channel.","October 28, 2015","true","283.8"," 209 of 249 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","209","249","15","13"

It's worth getting. If you have FM15? It's not worth the upgrade.\n\nFirstly, I've gotten promoted twice in a row and qualified for champions league in years 3 - I'm going OK! I have played it for years and years, this review is not on the back of me doing badly in the game.\n\nBasics*\n*(note - a lot about match engine, but this is a large part of what makes the game enjoyable for me)\n\nThe main issue I encountered was the quality of the match engine. Prior to the release, we heard about how the developers were improving this area of the game. However;\n-Goalkeepers are making STUPID decisions, the visual standard you watch would have been disappointing in a game that's 10 years old. It hasn't a patch on the FIFA Manager game I played 10 years ago.\n-Defenders are nearly as bad - they can't track a run, they give away stupid penaltys and can never cover the back post\n-Tactics enforced can't really be seen in play. If you target a side in your tactics, the stat's never display this, the highlights never show it.\n-Match engine overall has not improved. The lack of progress since FM15 is absolutely TERRIBLE\n-Negotations are still unrealistic - small clubs will still demand 30 million for a hot prospect who has never played a game for a club.\n-It still hasn't allowed for better negotiations on contracts etc. - I would have liked more career development talks etc. when taking on and dealing with young players.\n-The press conferences are just irritating - again, very little progression from last year. Even most of the questions are the same.\n-The 'new club' feature just isn't good. Picking a new team has been made far too irritating and long winded by the way you have to search. It's as if the developers got bored at this part and just gave up before they were finished. I was really excited about this feature, but it has a number of HUGE flaws too such as you're able to get players who haven't got work permits, then if they can't be renewed at the end of the season - they're gone (I lost half of my team after the first season on free transfers because of it).\n\nOverall, I would advise getting FM15 for a fraction of the price and getting an update for the new players etc. This is one of the worst updates I've played and it's really not worth the effort that has been put in since the release of FM15. I really don't think they're keeping with the times, there are lots of new features that they could of added but haven't.\n","December 29, 2015","false","123.9"," 146 of 168 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","146","168","11","0"

Before I list my complaints, I would like to emphasize that I have no problems with winning games, competions or creating working tactics and that these complaints are merely observations which cause a huge amount of frustration.\n\n- Goalkeeper intelligence is laughable as they will frequently concede goals easily in their close corner due to terrible placement and movement. And even with frequent clean sheets, your goalkeepers (or anyone else) rating will rarely reach an average above 7.0.\n\n-Defenders (particularly centrebacks) will track a player's run only to make 180 turn and run away from the attacker, which usually results in an easy conceded goal. And it doesn't matter whether you play as Bayern or Gateshead, because you will concede more than a fair share of goals from crosses at the far post, due the defender(s) inability/will to follow the run made by the attacking player.\n\n- You will never/rarely actually get a goal, when you need one. Whether it's drawing level or winning a close encounter. And to pile on the misery, the opposition will also more than often score in the dying minutes, snatching either a draw or win.\n\n- The aforementioned point makes the matches feel extremely predictable as you either absolutely smash opposition, go ninety minutes without a single chance or get the dreaded late conceded goal and all is visible/predictable due to the way your/opposing players move about on the pitch during the whole match/last minutes.\n\n- Different tactical approach isn't as visible on-screen as one might imagine, which gives little incentive to create/tweak own tactics.\n\n- Corner instructions are ignored (short corner instruction results in floating crosses being hit).\n\n- Generally lack of new features with the exception of the terrible manager creator screen.","December 21, 2015","false","293.9"," 204 of 250 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","204","250","14","9"

From the superb to the shocking.\n\nFirstly, I must say if you're looking for a game with superb aesthetics, then Football Manager 2016 is the game for you. The menus, tactics, training, transfers, fixtures etc. screens look superb, as they always have and probably always will. Aesthetically it's a 10/10 game.\n\nHowever, once you press that play button to start the match, it all turns truly dire. Never mind your coaching badges, your club's level or your standard of players/staff, you'll suffer (and receive - it can go both ways) some of the most shocking, and in some cases bizarre, pieces of gameplay you'll ever likely to see. Goalkeepers diving away from the ball, sometimes not diving at all, players not tracking the most blatant of runs, your star attacker continuously missing sitters while the computer's youth debutant with a finishing attribute of two bangs in a brace from outside the box. Those are just some of the things you can expect to see in Football Manager 2016 (though, that's been the case for years in FM to be honest.)\n\nAdmittedly, I'm definitely not the most skilled player, no question, but even so it's clear to see the game needs a lot of work to firstly get to the standard the developers give it and secondly to merit its price tag. I'd honestly say don't buy this game, I regret doing so especially given it's the same stuff (gameplay-wise) as in FM2015. I've been underwhelmed with FM for years now, they've seem to have slipped since the superb days of FM2009, FM2010 and FM2011.\n\nBut hey, this is just my opinion. Make a decision for yourself. It's OK to play, but it's definitely not enjoyable in my opinion.

Me? I'm one of those that bludgeons the game and the reason for that is simple;\n\nThere's a comprehensive lack of useful in-game documentation to help create sensible tactics. In fact, if you go on their official forums you'll find thorough posts (a bible's worth of pages) on how to defend, attack, counter attack and whatnot. It shouldn't be the case, that if I want to better understand the basics of the tactics creator, that I have to go out of the game to get access to that information.\n\nWorse still, is when that information almost directly or indirectly contradicts in the in-game information. For example, Counter Attacking mentalities is stated in game to be a mentality to choose when "you will lose the battle for possession, but expect to break with some regularity." IN fact, Counter and the lower mentalities appear to be better options for a possession based game, and not necessarily the more direct game that the in-game description appears to give you. The reality is the mentalities are all about 'risk taking', so in real terms (according to the forums), Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid and so on, all play counter attacking mentality and NOT attacking/control or any other aggressive mentality.\n\nThe game is basically not user-friendly, nor is it newbie friendly. In fact, I'd go as far as saying it isn't accessible to those who may not have pre-concieved ideas about tactics and football. The tons of reviews moaning about the 1 shot 1 goal losses, when they batter a team with 50 shots themselves, lends credence to that idea, especially when the tactical experts state that these results are purely down to tactical issues.\n\nThe problem is getting the information across to the gamer in a valid way, outside of having to watch full matches and passages of play, particularly for those who simply don't have time and just want to get on with the game, and no - FM"Touch", with its in-game purchases and advertisements, is not FM "lite" that people can just plug and play in, the tactical issues still apply over there.\n\nThings like ProZone's analysis is null and void if the official tactical experts are saying that the clear cut chances stat tracked by ProZone is bugged, or not valid. In fact, the amount of times I've seen people get told that counting CCC's is pointless and you should 'watch chances in the highlights to decide if it is really a clear cut chance', makes me wonder what is the point and purpose of having the tool in the game in the first place.\n\nTl:dr - I feel the tactics have gone beyond simple concepts and understanding, maybe that is my own fault, maybe I just "don't get it", but I think I'm not the only one who struggles with it. At some point, it just stops being fun, and that's when I stop playing. For me, FM16 is that rubicon.","December 13, 2015","false","151.2"," 107 of 134 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","107","134","6","0"

Nothing works the way it should do.\n\nThe AI is ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous, you could have 20+ shots every game and score one goal, if that.

FM12 for me was the last decent version of the game. Since FM13, the game lost the magic and became predictable and boring. Despite the disappointing FM13, 14 and 15, i decided to give the game one last chance. FM16 unfortunately, is no different than 13, 14 and 15. SI once again, failed to deliver a decent game. Match Engine is once again full of bugs. For example, the opposition scores a goal after one single shot very often and usually on the first minutes (under 10') of the game under. Opponent's most goals come from crosses.Also, if the opponent always scores the same number of goals with the half chances of my team. For example, if i score a goal with 4 shots, the opponent will score a goal with 2 shots. Check it out and you will understand what i mean, Tactics actually have no real effect. In general the main problem with FM is that what rarely happens in real football, happens very often on this game. The game is more like a Hockey Manager. In a few words, FM16 is a polished version of the disappointing FM15. Except the transfer update, the rest of the features are pointless. No way to buy FM again.

Thee are a number of glitches in the game not big, but signs of sloppy or hurried programming, as you play the game more, you notice a few things like this.\nI had an issue with the game starting up on FM2015, wasn't satisfactorily sorted it, it may have been eventually, but I had lost interest by then.\nAfter the latest update I am getting "Game won't save messages" I've discovered that if I create a new Folder I can then save it, and can carry on for a day or so before it recurs.

FM16 is much better than the poor shadow of a game that FM15 was.\n\nJust some quick comments:\n\n1.  The goalie AI is miles better.  The reactions are more realistic, and diving saves are made when they are meant to.  A lot less opposition goals scored with keeper just standing there.  I feel like my team has a locked door again!!\n\n2.  The defence AI is also much improved.  Where last year they would let players through easily, there is a real feeling that the defenders respond to tactics you set and that makes such a positive difference.\n\n3.  I love the new animations for scoring, celebrating, remonstrating, falling and tackling.  I really like the little flicks of the ball that have been introduced as well.  Also some nice improvements in the build of players' faces on the pitch.  My computer was rated 3* for graphics, but there has been no problem with the best quality setting being used.\n\n4.  The new tactics screen is super.  It makes it a lot more clear to use the 'pie' graphic to show whether the players are suited to a position and now a role.  Much much better.\n\n5.  The new manager builder is a great idea.  I kind of managed to match my face but I have heavy stubble and glasses - any chance that SI could introduce facial hair and glasses settings for this?  Wouldn't mind so much if it was just for the match engine, but my attempt at my face comes up whenever I am quoted on screen and whatever.  However, that is the only thing I don't like about the manager builder.\n\n6.  Injury frequency is much fairer than in FM15.  I no longer have an injury list the size of Glasgow.  I've gone from a consistent injury list of 8 first team players out to just 1 or 2 - much more realistic.  This makes such a difference SI - please don't change it when you release the final version.\n\n7.  Injury type and associated time out of the team is much better balanced than in FM15.  The option to play through injury is good too.  SI have listened to us here, which is excellent.  I was kind of dreading playing this game after forking out for the beta, simply because the injury system crippled FM15 in my eyes, and I was afraid that this would be more of the same.  I am very happy that I have been proved wrong.\n\n8.  The prozone tactical system is great.  Now we can access substitutions in a much slicker fashion, and it doesn't take an age to go through.  This helps the game continue quickly.\n\n9.  There is a definite distinction between match fitness and match sharpness, and both affect the performance of the players in their own way.  A lot of thought has gone into this, and it works extremely well, even in beta.\n\nCan you tell I'm a little impressed??\n\n10.  I haven't tried the team builder yet but looking it over, it seems a great option.  I'll comment more fully when I have the chance.\n\nSI, thank you for giving us a much better offering (so far) this season.  I will be playing this version of FM a lot more than I played the last one.","October 29, 2015","true","27.7"," 86 of 112 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","86","112","4","4"

Although if you can buy FM14 for under £5, then buy that, get an updated database and in terms of value to what you play there wont be to much difference.\n\nThe thumbs down is purely for players who play FM year in year out. This is just not worth the £35. I wouldnt have bought FM2016 but it was bought for me as a present that I didnt ask for.\n\nIf you are in any doubt then have a look at the new features on the store page, 3rd down is manager on the touchline. 3rd down, it must be pretty important, it must be a huge new feature! now scroll through the screenshots until you get to the picture of the manager. That is what you get. Basically a huge slap in the face to every long-term FM user.\n\nOn the Sports Interactive FM forums there is a huge wishlist thread with over 6000 replies. Pick any random page and there are countless wishes for in-depth training, media pressure, player interaction, ME improvments, Board improvements. With the exception of the ME there has been no noticeable improvement in any of these over the last two years. This year we are treated to new features such as create a club, fantasy draft and manager on the touchline. Fine new features in themselves, widely asked for? no.\n\nThe game is all to easy to create all conquering teams that win trophies year after year. In real life how many managers stay at the same club and keep constantly winning trophies? Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson and a few others, but it should be hard, really hard to do. Its just to easy in FM. How many young players who are deemed wonderkids in real life go on to actually become superstars? Not that many, a handful from each generation. Not so in FM, buy a wonderkid, play wonderkid, watch wonderkid fulfill potential. On the other hand, want to pluck a kid from the french second division who no one really rates and watch him suprise everyone (ala Marhez of Leicester), no chance. The constrictive CA/PA system wont allow that until a FM researcher updates it for you. Its a system that is showing its age. They may have served the series well, but many of the systems FM16 incorporates are basic and easy to control because they havent moved forward in the last few years.\n\nFootball Manager really hasnt moved forward with the times. 15 to 20 years ago a lot of managers did run the club from top to bottom but these days top, top clubs arent run like that. FM does a really poor job of reflecting this, sure there is the token Director of football, the token head of development, but again very simplistic, basic systems that just doesnt reflect top level football in 2016. Managing a top club in FM16 feels more like a quaint throwback to the 90s than an actual reflection of what fooball has become in the last 15 years.\n\n3 years ago I thought FM was about where it should be. Now its coming across stale and out of ideas. Going by the wishlist thread in their own forums theres 100s of great ideas, but for whatever reason SI has entered the change UI, tag on some light weight features and sell for full price approach. Its sad to see. I will still play it, but every year its getting harder to justify paying £35 for a game that isnt moving forward and is no longer reflecting the sport I watch and read about. I will still rack up the hours, but more because there is no other game to buy than what SI have developed.\n\nThe FM series needs a huge shake up. Every year real life football grows, the juggernaught keeps getting bigger and expanding. Every year that goes by where we have new features like create a club and fantasy draft is another year where FM loses ground on the sport its trying to represent. Its sad that the people in control of the games direction have completely lost sight of what gave the game its cult following. It got the basics of the football world right and let the players imagination fill in the gaps and build from there. The basics of the FM world dont feel right anymore. Without that basic foundation the imagination has no support, FM needs imagination to work or it is just a game and FM was never just a game.","January 1","false","95.5"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","58","70","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/378120/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Alright, in hope that I can beat the unfunny reviews of this game, let’s crack this one out!\n\nFootball Manager 2016 is part of the continual football (or soccer depending on where you hail from) series. This is the eleventh game in the series and will release officially in November 2015. The game was made available early for people who pre-purchased the game to take part in the beta testing phase. This review is based off my time in the beta thus far.\n\nThe game play of FM16 is exactly the same as all of the others; you take management over a football team and run everything to do with the sporting side of it. This includes picking your team’s tactics, choosing which players to take part in matches, setting training regimes for your players, buying and selling players, agreeing contracts of your back room staff and players. Pretty much anything which a manager of a football team has to do, you also do in this game.  Each yearly release of FM comes with over 200+ changes compared to the last years. Some of this year’s biggest changes are as follows:\n\nPlayers can now customize their player’s appearance. I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of this; mainly because I have no real interest in what my manager looks like in game, you hardly see the character at all. When creating my manager, it seems as if the actual appearance of your character doesn't change all that much when editing the face, you just get a strange looking mess of a face. For me, I hated this feature as it adds nothing real to the game.\n\nThe feature I am most excited about is the addition of a Fantasy draft - we see all sorts of drafts in American football, but not so in soccer. This feature will allow you to play with friends, set a budget, and draft your own team to go head to head with people online. I have played a bit of it so far, and it is awesome. It has a sort of pick up and play feel to it; if you have maybe just an hour to spare, rather than getting engrossed in the full game, load up a draft and play a couple of games. This is a welcome addition to the game if you ask me.\n\nA create your own club feature has been added; this feature was already kind of included in previous generations of the game via the game's editor tool, but now it has been encorporated into the main game. Personally I have never used the old create a club feature, and probably won't even in this release. But what this does do is allow you to create a club from scratch and build it from the very bottom of the league structure and turn it into one of the best teams in the world. This is what I would call a hard mode difficulty setting and is a project which you need to set probably hundreds of hours to if you wants to succeed.\n\nThe main screen display you'll be seeing the majority of the time, looks just like an email inbox, you'll be sent items of news regarding your team, the league you are in, potential players you'd be interested in, injuries etc. You can choose whether to show more items, or fewer items depending on how in depth you want to go. When playing the matches, you'll be shown a 3D match engine. This has gotten a pretty heft face lift compared to previous titles, and it now looks even better than before. The players have a much smoother animation cycle, the stadiums look better; weather effects look more prominent too.  The game has various options for how you can view the match; such as bird’s eye view, or touchline settings, personally I went with the director’s view most of the time because it adjusts to the best angel depending on where the ball is.\n\nFM2016, has the new game modes as mentioned above, the regular full FM experience,  and a sort of watered down version, aimed at an audience who don't want to spend hours looking over numbers and statistics, this mode allows people to play matches in a couple of minutes and maybe complete a season in a few hours. If you want to get the full experience out of this game, the Full Game mode is the way to go, if you want a casual experience, maybe try with the classic mode.\n\nAs with all other FM games in the series, this game has ample replay ability, and I will easily see myself racking up hundreds of hours in this game. It will suck every second of your spare time and more if you let it. You can finish a season in the regular mode in maybe fifteen hours, that's just one season. You can effectively play this game forever, the game will just keep going and you'll eventually have yourself your own footballing universe which you'll probably find more interesting than the real world.\n\nEven though this game is still in beta, I have had no technical issues with this release thus far. I will keep this review updated in case I do run into any, but as of now, this is a technically sound game and runs like a dream.\n\nTo sum up, if you are a fan of Football, and want to learn about the management side of things, or want to drop the FIFA franchise and try something different, you will find no other game out there that does it as well as Football Manager. It is a no brainer for me to recommend this game for any football fan. If you aren't so much of a football supporter, you'll probably want to skip this over, as you may not fully appreciate the content on show, but for me, this is a must play.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This not only has an affect on results but other players happiness because results aren't positive, creating a game that you dont want to play. Same thing happened in every club.\n\nPlayer prices, having to sell cheap and pay over the odds, again. This is nothing new with the game and i was under the impression it was fixed, clearly not.\n\nGoals.. Every other game my teams concede a goal within the first couple of minutes of a match, even when on counter/defensive or attacking etc when starting off\nThe amount of times ive conceded a goal immediately after scoring is ridiculour. This hasn't just happened a few times, it's continuous, one game ended 4-4, i scored 17, they scored 18th, i scored 23rd they scored 25th, i scored 53rd they also somehow scored 53rd minute, and the last goal was 4 minutes into injury time after i scored on the 89th. I nearly threw my PC out the window.\n\nThere are other bugs and parts of the game which aren't up to scratch, so overall dissappointed.\n\nTry the beta first if you an, make your own mind up, this could well be my last year playing FM.","November 17, 2015","false","329.2"," 117 of 166 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","117","166","12","4"

I've been a huge fan of Championship Manager since 1990's, and I bought every iteration of Football Manager.\n\nThis year, as always, SI delivers.\n\nLet's be honest - in the past we often received a flawed product, that was playable only after first big patch. This time - I don't see many bugs. Sure - I have a feeling that there might be slightly too many long injuries (my wingmen got injured for 4 and 6 months... then 2 of my attackers got injured for 2 months), but I do also take into account the fact, that I am leading a team with rather poor staff support.\n\nThis is the good, old Football Manager. No revolution this year, but as usual it feels like a more complete experience than the previous one.\n\nLong story short: if you love football, and management games - grab it. If you can live without some adjustments that FM16 brings - stay with FM15.\n\nPersonally - I am happy that I bought it, and I am playing it like crazy :).","October 28, 2015","true","548.1"," 117 of 178 people (66%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","66","117","178","138","3"

The simple way to describe it is it's too hard but not in a challenging way, in a totally unrealistic way. The irony this is supposed to be one of the most realistic simulation games you can get. I'm no newbie to FM so am familiar with the tactics and systems but in this game you are instructed by you assistant to change your style constantly through each match. In real life a team has a style of play, they may change it slightly for certain teams or certain periods of matches but no dramatically. In each game I would be told "retain possesion, play it short" then 5 mins later "hit long balls" it's so random you're not crafting your teams and implementing your style on them, you're just fluffing through each match hoping you win. I gave it two full seasons before quitting forever.\nI even downloaded other people's tactics to see if I was just rusty. They would be ok for 2 games them I back to the drawing board. In real life teams don't change styles every 5 games to stay fresh, they adapt and develop but don't have to redefine.\nNot only is the above with tactics true but there are other infuriating habits - I went ten games conceding in the last ten mins, normally in injury time. It happens in real life occasionally... twice in a row for a team is very bad luck, five in a row unbelievable, ten times in a row the game loses all credit. This happened even if restarting games and trying different tactics against the same teams. It had no effect.\nAnother example is penalties. I was awarded 10-12 and scored 2! That would have to be some sort of record. Yet I won 2 penalty shoot outs both against higher opposition when I had hardly any attackers left. It's backwards. The other way round though teams had no problems scoring against me.\nSame with red cards, I went from having the cleanest team in the league to the having the worst disciplinary record. Whenever I lost a man I would lose the game (aside from once but I did concede when down to ten men) but when the opposition had a man sent off I never once scored!\nAs I say it's not hard in a challenging way, it cannot logically be beaten using good tactical sense. It's just playing on luck. Totally unenjoyable.","November 23, 2015","false","52.1"," 77 of 112 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","77","112","4","6"

Another FM for all of us to dump endless hour into only to come back and rage about the injurys and how tactically you dropped the ball. But why? Why so many injurys? Why did my "perfect" tactic fail to work? Why why why?\nHonestly this seems like the first questions I always seem to ask myself playing the FM games, maybe in the first 10-20 hours. But once you drop that worlds smallest violin and stop feeling sorry for yourself and realize you wont be getting that perfect 100% record, you wont be getting a transfer coup on that awesome wonderkid, you wont always move to the next league every season. You wont do alot of stuff you want to in the first couple cycles of this game, and why should you? You are a bloody soccer coach, you are going to win and loose, get fired from the dream job just to pick up some crap job earing 35k a month vs the 5 million you gladly pocketed last season.\n\nNow the reason I recommend this game is because its not easy. This game wont really put you into the winning position from the get go. That to me is the whole game, like working through every single injury, working through player deals trying to not go broke, feeling the woes of a actual soccer coach is what this is all about. Try looking at one of the more streamlined soccer managers if you want something easier with less injuries, less players, and less realism. Or you could always jump back a few genrations of the game and get a feel for it with the older games.\n\nMy advice to anyone new to this game would be get a couple seasons under your belt with a decent team and focus on training out that tactical knowlege, and really get a feel for this game before commiting to a low tier team.

Because trust me, once you play this game, there is no going back. The only people interaction you will have in the real world is with the Pizza delivery person.\n\nPros:\n+ New Prozone match analysis is extremely useful especially for those who create their own tactics, and speaking of tactics; the tactics manager is refined and is easier to use than ever. With a completely redesigned set piece creator that makes the difference between building a winning tactic and a losing one much more distinct. It's easier to see where your tactics are going wrong / right, and because of this, if it's going wrong you're going to be able to figure it out much more easier than last year's iteration.\n+ Draft Mode is a winner, Who doesn't love fantasy football? Now you can have it inside your favourite football management sim.\n+ Injuries aren't as horrifically prominent as they were during the early builds of last year's game.\n+ Create-A-Club mode allows you to create your own team and lead your creation to glory. (Replaces a team in the league you choose)\n+ Realistic data for almost every player in the WORLD playing across tens of thousands of different leagues. That's just phenomenal!\n+ Refined matchday Engine with better 3d graphics.\n+ Still easily the best football management simulation in the world, and most likely it forever will be with the sheer amount of work put into this database. This game is a literal universe inside your PC, load it up and you'll be sucked into another dimension where suddenly YOU were actually good at football in the past, and have retired to lead Wigan Athletic to champions league glory.\n\nMeh:\n= Press interaction is slightly more varied this year, no more pressing random buttons and hoping you didn't say something to ♥♥♥♥ your star player off. The new conferences will keep you intrigued for at least the first 24 hours of gameplay. (Then it's back to your ol' Assistant Manager because you have nothing to say A la Jose Mourinho)\n= Customizing your own manager is neat, but it lacks options. There are only a few different choices for hair styles, colors, and outfits. It doesn't prove to be the immersive feature it is advertised as, because I couldn't copy my likeness.\n= The beta is not without it's fair share of bugs, from the silly, to the game crashing; and i'm sure the first versions of the full game are likely to have some too, but it's to be expected with the sheer size of this game. It will just get better over time though, as the devs are highly active and the final version of FM15 was almost bug free from my experience.\n\nCons:\n- Chelsea are actually good in this game.","November 7, 2015","true","148.7"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","80","32","40","27","4"

It's about time that happened as well as some aspects in the game were getting really quite dated, especially the match engine.\n\nOn the subject of the match engine: It really looks like they have tackled this in 2016, especially regarding the goalkeeper and defence, who now actually interact as players on the pitch instead of just going through the motions for the engine.\n\nTactics ACTUALLY seem to work for once, so asking for direct football will actually get you direct football with forceful wingers and killer balls attempted.  They had started to try and fix this in 2015, but still seemed like they were going through the motions to mask a pretty average match engine.\n\nI am really enjoying the new detailed staff page as well, you can now see exactly who is doing what at the club, and where your club ranks in the league at staff skills.  This was always an underdeveloped part of the game for me, as a club's backroom staff is just as important as the players on the pitch.\n\nI hear the prozone is good as well, but not something I have looked at in detail as of yet.\n\nThere are, however, still some issues:\n\nThe blighted over developed press conferences are still in the game.  MY GOD these are boring, and I don't think SI actually realise how dull they have made this, which is ironic as a lot of development time seem to have gone into making it 'intuitive'.  Let's make this clear though - intuitive means nothing if it isn't entertaining.  My solution is simple...drop all the press nonsense, that just kills playing time, and allow people to have a preset button which gives you avatar a way of dealing with the press - range it from 'conspiracy theorist' right through to 'upbeat and passive'.  You can then change you demeanor as and when you see fit - so if you are in a slump you can do the 'world is against us' mentality if you wish to, without having to spend 5 mins reading through very dull rhetorical journo questions! The whole 'get your assistant manager to do it' just doesn't wash for me either, as press management is an important part of creating a team mentality.\n\nThe interface still looks like it was developed by a sociopath, however I get SI not caring too much as Steklo will no doubt just create a great new indie Skin over the next couple of months anyway.\n","November 8, 2015","true","675.5"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","30","38","4","0"

Although I had fun for a while playing this latest addiction, it still hasnt bitten me like previous editions. The tweaks that have been implemented in 2016 are largely cosmetic and do little to actually improve the core gameplay ie football matches. Despite this one major gripe remains, THE MATCH ENGINE.\n\n- defenders seem incapable of tracking runs.\n\n- every goal comes from a cross, scoring and conceding.\n\n- goalkeepers are thick as mince.\n\n- get used to draws. Had TWELVE draws in a row in one save.\n\n- its either steamroller opponents or exrcruciating draws. Peppered with an insane ammount of stoppage time goals.\n\nThese things never really bothered me before, but they are almost identical complaints stretching back as far as I can remember. It feels jaded to me, and if you're new to the franchise I'd recomend getting 14 to see waht you think.

Let me explain:\n\nFirst, the 2016 version was the most expensive available on the launch date. But it seems clear is that the efforts and resources have been used to take a coach to the edge of the field and the game interface in general. The game engine has regressed.\n\nSeveral matches of the best leagues seem to be the lower divisions of European championships. Players do not have any reproach to fail, fail and fail. Not to mention that it's not uncommon to see your team concede almost all the goals in the same way: Crossing.  No matter what you try to do to change . And moreover, in a half season I conceded three goals of crossings that fall straight into the goal. Those unintentional. I was playing in Serie A (Italy).\n\nFinally, the game is heavier than ever. A simple alt + tab to access the internet while the game is simulated is enough to make any video or site becomes very slow.\n\nI could speak a lot about other issues like interface, injuries, lack of more complex choices about tactics or finance, but what really bothered me was the poverty of the game engine.\n\nIf in previous versions - some exceptions - you could feel in the skin of a football coach in a top league, in FM 2016 you look like a coach of a farm team speaking a language no one understands.","November 19, 2015","false","896.8"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","26","35","3","0"

Foremost because there are no competitors. Well, besides the newly released Soccer Manager 2016 which pretty much summons up how little pressure there is on Sigames. Every year is pretty much a polished release of the previous version with a database update, sold at full price. We could have bought that as a DLC for $2 if we're all going to be completely honest. Most games call such updates a patch, not a new game.\n\nWhat I personally miss is better tooltips to what tactical, training, man-management and media handling is considered the "correct" way in this game. Because you could copy a winning tactic from your real life favorite manager down to a dime, and it would still be completely rubbish in this game. This isn't real life although I know many of you want to believe if you're successful in this game, it's because you're some kind of football genious. You're not, you've just figured out something that works in this game. They can consider themselves extremely lucky there isn't any serious competitor on the market. Because you could do better with much less.\n\nIt's limited down to what Sigames considers "best". And unless they give us some clear hints to what their perception of what the "best" managing style in this game is, you're pretty much left with a guessing game until you figure it out. Either that, or you simply find a tactic that breaks the game and win because of a bug. It doesn't feel very rewarding at all.\n\nIf you're stuck with some mediocre tactic and let's say you're not even the slightest interested in all the man-management / media handling stuff, this game is a game of dice at best. It's totally random what outcome you get from each match. You're as far from clear favorites to win as you are to losing when you can play the same match 10 times over again, and get results ranging from 6-0 to 0-6 with the same squad, same tactic, same team talk, same everything. Too much RNG and that's where I think they've failed the most. Too much random numbers doesn't make this game enjoyable. It makes it extremely frustrating and very little rewarding.

There lacks the refinement of a new game, it looks and feels old, and just feels a little more complicated than FM2014, things that could have been improved are interaction with players, more coaching options, more tactical options, quicker transfers, easier transfer dealings....this list could go on, seriously, there is nothing good about this game and I'm upset in saying that, and because the game is so bad, I have decided to write this review. I'm going to revert back to FM2014, if you like FM2015, then I would recommend sticking with it. To the developers, I really hope you listen to these reviews, because I know there are plenty of people who agree with me. Now how do I go about getting a refund for this game","November 7, 2015","false","17.3"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","41","64","2","6"

I'm the first to admit that some of the latest games have been subpar, or had too many issues.\n\nHowever, Football Manager 2016 felt stable since the early access Beta, which was very surprising given how usually it took SI at least a month or two before a patch made the game actually playable. I also feel that this Match Engine, contrary to what other people are saying here, feels much more realistic than the previous one. I only had two or three very unusual results, but people forget that these happen in football in real life.\n\nI can't comment on the 3D graphics (which admittedly, still have a long way before they could be considered "acceptable" for this era), as I've always played the series in 2D mode for a more tactical approach. But graphics are most certainly the least of the matters considering a managerial game.\n\nThe new game mode (Fantasy Draft) is awesome, and playing it with friends is a blast too, especially if you're a fan of playing fantasy football. My only complaint, relative to all Network modes, is that the game still feels a bit "wonky" while playing online, with people reporting latency issues when issuing commands, but this could be optimized with future patches.\n\nOverall, I would suggest to buy this year's Football Manager, especially if you've been holding off last year, as this has one of the most realistic Match Engines of the series. The interface has been polished as well, with particular care to the Tactics section, which is now more "graphic", and the new set pieces tab is a very nice touch. Speaking of Touch, the game mode offers three new skins for the interface that are optimized for touchscreen displays, though it's not the most intuitive option to activate, and they could have done a little more on that part.\n\nTL;DR: This year's version is the one you should buy. Do not listen to the negative reviews: the game has been stable and realistic since the Beta.","November 26, 2015","true","154.1"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","34","53","0","5"

It has reached a point for me, a most loyal fan of this series, where I begin to question if this is in fact the game itself or some counterfeit. The tactical screen has been butchered and appears as if designed by minds no elder than the age of three years old. The rate at which injuries takes places is an utter disaster and though it is apparently similar to that in reality, within the framework of this game it is a total failure. Then there's the worst part, this business of manager avatars. In the 3.7 billion years that this world has existed, there has never been anything so pathetically panderous to the lowest common denominator. I am not, and have never been a twelve year old girl. And to some extent, that's regrettable because a twelve year old girl would not have spent any of her not earned money on this game. I weep, nay, flood tears of weighted blood from my eyes at the sheer sight of its disastrous layout. It is aggregious, utterly flat in its failing attempts to be appealing. Playing Football Manager has felt this strained and that upsets me dearly. I have never before complained about this game, rather I have tried desperately to have friends or colleagues join me in the trappings of its ever flawed brilliance. But this version just doesn't have the charm. The graphics have never been good, but somehow that never mattered before. I didn't need it to look real; it was, in its way, real to me. The difficulties and stresses that one incurred in their endless search for glory were never so...disconnected from the user. It feels like everything about it that once exhilarated me so has just been swept under the carpet of the fruitless search for realism. This was once the game I sought after most, the game that inspired me most, that excited me most, that drew me most into its world. Now? Now, it's an algorithm.

Scroll down for the TL;DR version.\n\nFM16 is a good example of the idiom, "one step forward, two steps back". The FM series has been going downhill for a couple of years now, and perhaps some would argue that it's been heading that way since even longer. The game itself is a good one; it has great depth, detail, and feels and acts like a football simulator should do. While it made some improvements over its predecessor, it manages to feel inferior in other ways. The next stride backwards came in the form of a disappointing response from the developers this year.\n\nUpon releasing the 16.3 patch (the final update the game receives) in early March this year, the developers decided NOT TO fix the issues that many players on the forum were experiencing. The chief complaints being the inflated amount of chances created from wide play (crosses in particular), and the lack of variety of goals. In their response they said that while they acknowledge the aforementioned problems with the match engine, they would not fix them in the final update due to them having potentionally unforeseen effects that would negatively impact on the game. They had more than three months to fix these issues that many people on the forum took time to bring to their attention, upload, and write detailed information about what had possibly caused these issues to occur. When it came to the update (the release date of which is so vehemently guarded), it had been revealed that they had essentially just released a transfer update. That was all. Barely a change to the long-awaited 'improved' match engine.\n\nAnd this is it. This is the version you will have until the next iteration is hurredly pushed out to us, with yet another match engine that will not be balanced until March the following year. The developer releases three main updates, with other updates being serious issues that require a hotfix. The first of which is the release of the main game from beta sometime in November, the second being an update in December, and the final one being rolled out in March as previously mentioned. This is, quite frankly, an archaic business model. Basically, it means they have just three chances to get it right. And this year, on their third attempt they failed, gave up, and still had the audacity to ask for feedback. Why is it that on a platform such as Steam you can only release three updates? The development team will argue that the match engine is a complicated program where one change will have potentially unwanted effects. This is undoubtedly true, but isn't this true of many other games that have been developed? And surely the three months could've been spent more efficiently to at least reduce the severity of the issues involved.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI said above that the game is good. And it is. And I should say that apparently some people haven't encountered the two glaring problems in the match engine that I've outlined in this review. However, that's not the issue. The issue is that the developers have refused to address such problems, either due to laziness stemming from a lack of competition on the market or because the same people will continue to buy the same game with little improvement year-in year-out. With all the debacle that came from this year's game, my anticipation for the next iteration has been deflated to the point where I will keep my wallet shut... in the same way that the developers have shut the door on any potential fixes this year. For that reason, I can't recommend it to those who are thinking about picking up FM16 in March or beyond.","March 6","false","170.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

It used to be like a religion to me. FM16 has successfully deprogrammed me.\n\nThe pointless tactical choices that bear NO relation to anything that happens in the game? ("Retain possession, you say? Guess that means I have to hoof it into nowhere when there are players in good positions every. single. time.")\n\nThe boring, boring, BORING and repetitive press conferences have been - oh joy - made even longer this time. Same questions though. Just more of them. Much, much more...\n\nThe shuddery camwork in the match. FM15 played fine. I have a pretty powerful iMac with a 1GB Nvidia card, but this shudders like a granny.\n\nI used to say to myself "just one more game...just one more game", putting off bedtime and cursing myself in the morning as I walked bleary-eyed to work. This was true even with FM15. Now...one game...end up laughing at how stupid the match engine is....and lose interest before even my first match is over.\n\nI guess this is sad. Hopefully some thought is put into the next instalment and they take a little time with it like they used to, instead of pumping them out every year. But maybe it's just time for me to get some sunlight.\n\nFor now...bye SI. Thank you for the memories.

Tactics that you have embedded into your team will NEVER work, players never seem to want to pass the ball, instead just standing in one spot trying to flick and turn against an opposition player, whilst having a man in acres of space who can build to a better attacking position left out in the cold. Players will needlessley head the ball on when they have 10 minutes to bring it down and control it. Your players will make desicions that range from daft to downright bonkers. Goalkeepers who aren't sweeper keepers will charge out to gather the ball whilst ignoring the 8 other opponents that have somehow managed to get inside the box with ease. As your pacey winger is darting downfield, a defender with a pace rating of 7 will manage to overtake and claim the ball. It feels as though everything designed in game is made to benifit the opposition AI as they will always score goals that seem ludicrous, whilst your players constantly shoot wide and high 2 feet from goal.\n\nI watch alot of FM players online and constantly wonder if I am playing the same bloody game, now I'm certainly not the best FM player, but I have certainly felt the highs and lows the games are usually known for, with FM12 being the personal preferance as that game seemed to have a good balance with it's mechanics and AI, you really could go on an amazing run of games only to have a surprise upset on the cards.\n\nI can't say the same magic is felt here though, it is all downhill, from the first game in charge, if you lose, there will be no way to pick yourself up, teams that you should easily beat, will EASILY beat you, and your players will never perform at a level that is ever acceptable.\n\nBut it is Football Manager, so of course I'm hooked.

After doing a load of seasons on a real team i go into the FM editor and create a team Like Jersey FC (Jersey Channel Islands UK football team) which isnt on the game and start in Vanarama Conference South and work my way up the leagues so this new feature was something i was really looking forward to and it works really well.\nThe always yearly changing interface isnt something i like this year, it just seems that on most occasions theres way too much information being thrown into your face but this isn't really a problem as there are many interfaces created by people on the steam workshop and its pretty easy to find one that suits you best.\nThe match engine is showing its age slightly now and before you think I'm going to say it should look like FIFA graphics i dont think it should but more importantly there are no issues with it that i can find this year and watching the matches in 2D or 3D is enjoyable once again.\n\nAs a fanboy of the FM series and played every FM since 2005 (over 1000 hours on FM12 O_0) I would say this is the best FM since FM12.

Yes, it worse than "top class player misses 9 of 10 one-on-ones", worse than "4-5 woodworks every match", worse than "pandemy of injuries" etc. It's just BORING as hell, like two kids playing FIFA: cross -> goal, repeat.

Dribbling and flair traits are so much clearer to see, along with pace, strength and more.

They are developing multiple game simultaneously, and 1 year is barely enough time to upgrade database, improve graphics and UI, and make a few adjustments; that's the extent of what they seem to do each year. SI usually spends 3 months patching the game so the development window is probably even shorter than a year.\n\nIn other words, you are being horribly ripped off every time you pay for their 'new' product which is more like a patch developed for some months with new graphics and animations. I bet they are using the same engine they've been using for a decade because many core problems never go away in FM series. As a rule of thumbs, you should never buy products released every year.\n\nReturning problems that plague FM every single year are still here because devs refuse to spend time to improve the game.\n\nI took a team predicted to finish at 24th in English 6th football division. In 4 years, I won 4 leagues, promoted the team 4 times, won 8 cups, and the team's wealth was increased 50 folds. Meanwhile, my weekly wage increased from 1000 euro to 1200 euro because the board constantly tries to knock down your wage after each successful season. When I took that team to the premier league my status in the club was 'favourite'; not a legend, not even an icon.\n\nI had two player with the exact same abilities and potential abilities. One had 1 ambition, the other had 20 ambition. The latter doesn't have an agent and the former always requests 3 times more wages and complain about not playing in a bigger club.\n\nInterviews and commentaries are SAME word to word with FM 2006. You are forced to answer mind numbingly boring questions over and over for the same response and news.\n\nCross is ridiculously OP as it was in earlier versions of 2015. Match stats are wildly different from real soccer. (top players in real soccer marks 90~95% pass success rate. In FM it's 80% at best. Neuer's save rate was 91% in 2015 season. In game it's less than 60%. etc). Goalkeeper AI is horrendous. They often pick up an imaginary ball while the attacker dribbles past him.\n\nTo be honest, FM isn't a bad game. It's probably the best sports simulation game available on the market. That doesn't excuse them from cash-milking gamers with the same product every year. If you are a new player interested, sure, go ahead and buy the game. Otherwise, stick to FM you have because new versions don't offer anything new or better. New FM game is microscopically better than its previous installment.\n\nThere are a lot more problems but I will just end with this note: FM series has NOT been evolving for almost half a decade. Don't give these people your money. Support developers who actually make a better game than their previous games.","February 18","false","185.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Some ridiculous player decisions - i've seen Ronaldo clean through on goal then turn around and hoof the ball back to my keeper, which was intercepted by the opposition who then scored - several other bizzare things like that.

Been playing the games since FM08 and usually log several hundred hours per game. My negative review has zero to do with an inability to win or a bias about a team I support not being good. I usually play with teams I can build into champions and avoid the "ready made" teams with big budgets.\n\nTechnical Issues:\nFirst off the game crashes if you try and multitask or have anything running in the background. I did every update, ddu uninstall/reinstall & I still blue screen of death. A temp fix was putting the game in bordered mode but that stopped after the winter update.\nSo prepare not to do anything else while the game is running. My laptop is brand new, fully updated and top of the line. It can handle playing The Division at full specs while running spotify and writing this review, yet I can't run a football manager in the background without a driver power state failure blue screen happening. Done everything suggested to remedy this issue yet none have worked.\n\nCONS:\n- No randomization. Everything happens repeatedly (though varies between 3-4 different results). Same teams will get relegated/promoted, same teams will sign same players, same teams will win same cups/leagues.\n\n- Wildly inaccurate player information. Player wages, positions and ratings are so awful. They've gone the FIFA route of overrating players that they've heard of. English players are atrociously overrated and overpaid (just look at Jordon Ibe's contract & stats in the game for example). Many players who play in multiple positions in real life, don't or can't in game. Germany have zero wingers because all of their players are listed as CAMs with "capable" roles at wing positions, which limits them to 75% or less performance capabilities. Also the fact that FM still doesn't make wide midfielders capable of playing wing positions is hilarious. A LM can play LW. A RM can play RW. They are practically the same position, just different roles.\n\n- Success tends to be based on 14/15 season + club reputation/wealth. For some odd reason Arsenal are basically unstoppable if they just sign Lacazette. Even in the first season they can win the league with ease without making a signing. The computer has a slim chance of doing well if they are a midtable team but no chance if they're recently promoted. But teams like Leicester, West Ham or Chelsea will never have seasons like they are having in real life.\n\n- Goalkeepers. For a game that advertised renovating the intelligence of goalkeepers, I think these are arguably the dumbest keepers in FM history. Strikers tend to act a lot dumber as well, I've noticed a drastic increase in missing open goals & golden opportunities.\n\n- Owners & Managers are idiots. Will sack a manager under outrageous circumstances usually in a short time frame (3-4 months). Managers will also leave on a whim if another club comes knocking. Klopp leaves for Arsenal if they don't win the league and Liverpool doesn't finish top 4 haha. Managers also make atrocious transfer decisions. They'll sign 4-5 players for 20m+ all for the same position, most of the time a position that isn't weak, and then not play them. Tactically atrocious as well but I'll expand on that later.\n\n- Transfer are god awful. Don't expect to pay less than 20m for a player with a decent PA unless they're transfer listed. Then you can sign a ton a outrageously good players for next to nothing. But usually if a player has a -8 PA or higher, they will usually cost over 50m in the first season (unless they're 16 y/o which then they're about 4-10m & demand high wages).\nSelling players for their labeled valuation or higher is an impossible task if they aren't your star player. If a big club comes after one of your star players, you're pretty much screwed unless you offer them a new outrageous contract. If not they'll demand to leave & you'll get nowhere near their value. It's also pretty much impossible to sell players you don't use unless you play them enough to generate interest. For example the only way I could sell one of my unwanted players who had a 4.6m valuation, was if I sold him for 450k. He rejected the move cause the club couldn't afford his wages. This is so stupid, specially for EPL players. Someone, somewhere will want them off their reputation alone. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n- Outside of Europe doesn't exist. Actually it's more like outside of England/France/Germany/Spain doesn't exist. You have to load the countries with all of their leagues as playable to have players from leagues around the world be even remotely involved in the game. You won't get real players from any country unless they have a high reputation & PA or their league is loaded as playable. Even Monaco's Mbappe, who has a -85 PA & plays regularly, doens't load in the game unless you make Ligue 1 playable. And why doesn't China, Saudi Arabia or the MLS ever get involved? They clearly buy high profile players all the time, and usually for outrageous money. The only clubs you'll get involved with outside of Europe is when some regen with a -9 PA at some nobody club gets found by a scout. Then you get to deal with the nightmare of trying to sign a player from Zimbabwe without a work permit or a club to send him on loan to.\n\n- Horrible tactics system doesn't work. You will win more games using a formation that's flat and negative with multiple players out of position - than you will using actual tactics. For some strange reason the flat dm 4-1-4-1 formation is pretty much unbeatable. I feel like I'm cheating when I use it cause it wins so often.\n\n- Rotation/Backup players expect to play full 90min at least every other match. If you take over at a club & a player is upset because of a fallout with a previous manager, he will remain upset and demand you play him immidiately. Taking over at a club should be a clean slate between the manager and players.\n\n- Hot prospects/Reserves - If a player is sent out on loan when you start the game or goes out on loan in the first season, they will probably go out on loan until they are sold - never getting a chance at the club they are at. Origi does this for Liverpool in the first two seasons as an example. Loans don't benefit or grow the players at all, if anything it regresses their development. Keeping them in the reserves does the same but you can have them "mentored" by senior players which oddly works like a full season of first team football (if it's a good pairing). Very rarely does a player do well on loan, grow & goes back to their original club to play first team football.\n\n- Injured players expect to be put straight back into starting XI after 3 months out because logic.\n\n- Editor won't allow you to deduct league points or set up managers to join clubs (i.e. Pep to City or Conte to Chelsea). I use to deduct points from teams in the first season so that they could correlate with real life league standings. Now you can't do that without buying FMRTE.\n\nIn summary, FM have had several of these issues for years now but this year they've become unbearable. I've gone from having 20-30 year games to now barely getting 4-5 seasons. SI really needs to address the issues that have been in the game for years as well as their recently created issues. They game looks gorgeous. Stop messing with the aesthetics. Focus on the performance & accuracy of your game.","March 23","false","105.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","4"

Expect the proper review in 8 to 11 days.\n\nEdited to note a moment of astonishing realism. I'm managing York City, in the fourth tier of English football, who have a striker called Verdaine Oliver. In real life, he scored last weekend with an overhead kick. In the game, I got told by my coach that Oliver's game would improve if he was encouraged to stop trying overhead kicks. Knowing this little detail of a lower-league player's game is remarkable.\n\nThen again, Spurs are currently top of the Premier League, with Newcastle in fourth, so they haven't got everything right...","October 31, 2015","true","72.3"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","59","17","29","24","2"

When I spent some first hours with the new Football Manager 2016 some time ago I discovered a lot of big and small improvements and new features from which I was happy. This article is not a typical review, it’s list of my most favorite new features which can be very helpful for every player.\n\nInterface\n\nThe first thing I want to mention is „Side Bar Icon Only“. This feature is very welcome by me because I chose this in every custom skin in last year version. So I’m very glad that IS implented this to the default skin. You can turn it on in Prefferences. There are many new features in your News. I very like the option to view match higlights stright from your mailbox. The higlights of every matches in concrete round, not only your match. Just click on the TV icon and higlights will load and show after a couple of seconds. The Home screen also looks better because there are more panels and you can see the stadium picture next to information about your next match (if you use some of stadium pictures pack of course). Great addition is in Squad Status panel where you can open the list of injured players or wanted players if there are more. That’s fantastic new feature because you don’t need to go to the squad screen a check who is injured.\n\nThe Player Profile Screen was revamped as well and I’m big fan of it. There is more information in one screen and if you have a big resolution you can see all the important info about your players.\n\nStaff\n\nSame as the Player Profile Screen was improved the Staff Profile Screen is better in FM16 with bigger amount of information. More important new feature about Staff is there is newly Staff Shortlist with same function as Player Shortlist. You can now add some coaches, managers or other Staff to the shortlist and you can have information about them in one screen. You do not need to search them again every time you need to know something about them.\n\nThere is new screen with Staff Overview where you have graphical representation how many Staff you have and you can see Staff comparison with other teams in league you currently play. You can go stright from this screen to other screens like „Coaches Allowed“ or you can arrange meeting with Board and talk about Coach Wages and more. It’s much faster and it saves your time.\n\nYour Staff also can give you a better feedback about your players or tactics and they can recommend you some changes in tactics when you go to Staff Advice meeting.\n\nTactics\n\nThe new Tactics screen was (and will be) very duscussed by all users around the blogs, forums and social media. I was a little surprised when I saw the „squares“ for the first time but the most important thing is if it works well. And after some time with the new look I have no problem with these squares. You can quickly change some information in tactic pitch and the new Suitbaility for role and duty icon and overal physical condition/match sharpness icon is very useful for me.\n\nOther\n\nOne of the very important new feature is revamped Set Pieces creator in which you can save up to three routines for corners or free kicks. You can share these routines as tactics. That could be very popular within the FM Community. Another very good feature for me is some information in your mailbox. The information about training camp squad is better same as the news about International call up where you can see which player is missing (and why) or which player was nominated to the national team for the first time.\n\nWhen you start a new save you can choose when the game will start. You can choose from Early Pre-Season, Start of the Season or First matches of Champions League/Europa League.\n\nThere is a new feature about your profile in the game. You can now set up your Avatar which you can see during the match in the dugout. It’s a nice try but this is not much important for me so I don’t want to say if it’s good or bad idea.\n\nI probably forgot something, but I believe I wrote the most important things. I love the small new features in general so I think I will discover some other during next weeks and months. Enjoy FM16.\n\nYou can read more on my blog https://mrkeysirensie.wordpress.com/","November 17, 2015","true","450.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","17","29","2","0"

The match engine now looks like FIFA 2008 unlike FM2015 which looked like FIFA 2003 at best. While the animations are now better, it still has the visual issues that FM always had, like the 'inch perfect' tackles always look like fouls, moonwalking into a volley, and the fact that dribbling and technique is invisible and it looks like the defender just doesn't want to tackle. The physics seem to have changed also, the ball floats a bit more and bounces a bit more. Lower league players (conference etc) still literally have autism rather than just being bad players. Players who are prone to injury are still injured for 90% of the time at your club. Aggressive and temperamental players still get sent off every other match. Old players still become literal snails at any point past 30. Apart from that it's a nice visual upgrade, and if anything makes FM2016 worth the upgrade, it's the match engine.\n\nThe interface changes are effectively a reskin. It takes a while to get used to, and I guess it's nice, but I wouldn't consider a reskin a selling point. They upgraded the set piece creator too, so now you can create several routines and share them among tactics.\n\nThey added some detail to the already annoying interviews so you have to answer a few more questions to avoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off.\n\nThey changed around a few words like 'match fitness' is now 'match sharpness'.\n\nThat's literally it.\n\nNo, it's definitely not worth 35 ♥♥♥♥ing pounds but I bought it on ♥♥♥ so it was only 13 pounds. I don't know if it was even worth that.\n\nBut I like football manager as a whole, so if you don't already own an FM game and want to try it out, I suppose you can get this one.","June 4","true","30.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

This year Football Manager packs the same experience, but with a lot of small but amazing improvements.  Here are my experiences with this game.\n\nPRO:\n\n- Perfect game for wasting time while work, couch-time (or my personal favourite) college lessons\n- Amazingly large database\n- Rendering seems a lot more fluid then previous versions\n- You don't need an expensive graphics card to enjoy this game\n- Winter-update fixed a lot of bugs and made the player ratings more realistic\n\nCON:\n\n- Players have unrealistic salary expectations, allowing small teams to keep big players for way too long\n- Preferences seem to reset quite often (maybe a personal issue)\n- Limited photo collection of local players and youth\n- Sometimes the results are still way to unrealistic.  Allowing me to win the premier league with Liverpool and win the Europa League with a Belgian first division team KRC Genk.  This also packs a lot of inconstency.  Winning with large numbers against big teams, and losing to a 3th division team playing the same 11 and better morale/condition has turned into a habit.\n\nI do in any way advise you to buy this game.  I have been 'wasting' my time on this game, raging and frowning at results, but i couldn't say it felt like i've had the smallest amount of regret buying this game. It's the small things that make a day, like beating a big team or finally grabbing that cup against that small team that tends to play like Bayern Munchen in the cup finals. Overall this game is still amazing.  The positives of the game are definitly worth the small amount of flaws it packs.\nCarreer mode is still as addictive as it ever was and challenges got even better.  Online competitions are awesome as you can laugh at your friends as they manage to ♥♥♥♥ up against small teams. If you are in doubt of buying this game, i can assure you, it will be a lot of fun and you just need to buy it. Cheers !\n\nTIP !\n\nDownload a logo pack ! Badges and kits can easily be loaded into the game, making the interfaces look a lot better.","April 28","true","115.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Improvements are mainly to UI and match/performance analysis.\n\nIn my experience the match engine has some hiccups (way too many scores from crosses) but I have noticed a significant improvement since launch.\n\nTo respond to negative reviews (mostly about match engine):\n\nWill you sometimes get a match where you get 10:1 shots and lose? Yes. Will you get an unlucky season (i.e. too many key injuries) and get sacked? Sometimes. I won't say it's all perfect, but I enjoy some randomness.\n\nI have not experienced consistent injustices in the match engine, but for those who are complaining about it: I hope you tried all sorts of different tactical adjustments and considered things like player consistency/chemistry/tactical fluidity before coming here to review the game.","January 3","true","852.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

The game was clean, efficient, and while there were a few match engine issues, most importantly, I found the game enjoyable to play.\n\nI thought the features brought into FM 15 would develop into an even better game for FM 16, however, to my dismay, the game was underwhelming to say the least. I've felt while playing this game, the Sports Interactive team have unnecessarily tinkered features that didn't need to be in this years version, and their added features are just not relavent to a football management game and have had no significant impact on the overall game play. Like the new feature of designing the appearance of my manager. Whilst it is a good idea, what is the point? Really. The only difference it has made is now my manager has a really sketchy generated face. Another example is the faces of regens. They were fine the way they were! Don't fix something that isn't broken! What was the point in changing something so petty like that. Surely more focus could be put into other areas of the game like the match engine.\n\nI also have some complaints about the overall interface. On FM 15 the interface was smooth, well designed and was efficient. On FM 16 I have felt the interface is chunky. The new player screens are rubbish; they've tried to fit too much onto one screen, the tactics screen is a disaster, no matter how many times they say it isn't. Whilst there are some good revamps of the interface such as the finances screen, again, the interface was just another feature that didn't need to be adjusted.\n\nMost importantly out of all my complaints is the general happiness I get out of playing this game. I find myself getting more frustrated than not playing this game. The amount of work I have to put in to set up one bloody tactic, or to maintain team morality, or to scout for the best players for my club is just exhausting and it’s not something I should feel when playing a computer game. And what do I get in return? I get indecent results, even when dominating the whole match, poor player performance, and an ungrateful board. My penalty taker who has a 19/20 rating has a conversion rate of under 25% whereas all opposition penalties are converted. My players never follow tactical instructions. Even a draw can deflate my whole team after a good stretch of results and then a winless streak commences but then a win has no effect on the team’s morale. I'm generally left angry and bemused after playing FM 16 which is not what I should be feeling all the time when playing a computer game, which in previous editions, has given me overall happiness.\n\nSports Interactive really need to wake up and start adding features that are worthwhile for the game. Not create-a-club mode or a fantasy draft mode. I don't play this game always to experience the life of a professional manager, I play this game for enjoyment where I can make my own tactics, sign players and win trophies without the game becoming a chore. If Sports Interactive keep this in mind for their FM 17 edition, this game will be as good as it once was But honestly, if they continue the way they have, I can easily see myself giving up on this franchise altogether.\n","February 26","false","087.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The old 'kick the ball at a team-mate which ricochets 30 yards to an opposition striker' still remains, as does the static defending. The forwards still constantly make the wrong decisions in key areas, ignoring team-mates who have an open goal to try and score from ridiculous angles. I hear defenders of the game argue its a strategy game, and not designed to have life-like matches taking place and I agree. But if the players actions dont reflect the instructions, then having the function is pointless. They might as well remove it. I'd rather have stick men who's actions and decisions are life-like, than superb 3D graphics of something that is frankly, embarrasing to watch.\n\nIt isnt unplayable, but the other major disappointment is the lack of new features. It is hardly any different from FM 2015. As such, I wouldn't recommend anyone buys the game and had I played a demo, I'd have saved £35 and just looked for an update patch for FM 2015.\n\nStill early days and it may yet surprise me, but all I see is an extension of the extremely tedious media side of the game, which is just as repetitive as it was in FM 2015 and the available responses too black or white.\n\nTo me, its £35 for the emperors new clothes.","February 23","false","155.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Suicide soon!!!!\n\n\nThis game is unrealistic, because my good friend #9 peanutbutterpolaroids is in Blackburn season 3, almost relegation, and then can buys Paulo Dybala from Champions League club Juventus, and it´s ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.

At least for a while.\n\nI'm no veteran - FM12 was my first FM, and it did not take long to learn the ropes. I applied my skills and knowledge of football and it seemed to work. FM13 was the same. I was more than happy to spend my money buying each new edition. However, that all changed in FM14 - the first truly horrendous game I encountered. The same knowledge and skills I had used no longer worked. FM15 was an improvement, mainly due to the interface. Everything still felt like a roll of the dice.\n\n16 however, is the tip of the iceberg. There is a fine line between entertainment and realism, and to blend both together is tough, but something I think SI achieved in FM12 and 13. But for the past three editions, the balance has been tipped too far towards realism, so much so that FM is now a chore to play.\n\nWhether it be sensitive prima donna players complaining at every opportunity, the AI's deceptive ability to 'adapt' to your tactics after a matter of weeks, match engine errors or the fact that instructions off field are rarely carried out on it, Football Manager is beginning to lose its buzz.\n\nI'm not one to complain just because I'm losing, and there are lots of people who can't get enough of the game. But 16 was a step backwards for this franchise, and after the signs of hope in 15, that is a disappointment. I would not recommend Football Manager 2016 for a newcomer or a regular player of the game. You're better off sticking to 15 or waiting and hoping that 17 is better.\n\nMyself, I am switching to FIFA. At least I know when things go wrong for me in that game, it will be:\n\na) my own fault, more or less\nb) a problem that can be identified and solved. Easily.

It's a small detail but I think it helps the enjoyment of the match engine.\nI would say budgets for teams are fairly realistic so you can run the club making the signings you would expect the team to make in real life, and the odd coup to make everyone happy.\nOther teams interest in your transfer listed players is much better this year. Now it is easier to get other teams interested  in buying them although it still isn't a certainty they will be interested. But last year you couldn't shift nobody.\nTeams pay a more realistic price for your big name players ie: Man Utd will pay £50 million for Harry Kane rather than £500k and expect it to be accepted.\nI feel players respond to your instructions better during the match than last year.\n\nNegatives\nFinding tactics that work for top teams on the game is proving to be like a military opertation for me, good luck!\nThe match engine at times is very scripted making you lose and go on bad runs. ie: you lose matches with shot ratios of 30:1 and possession stats 70%:30% and at times this can just go on and on and on.\nWhen your players are having a bad day, they are having a BAD DAY their attempts to look anything like a legitimate football team are laughable\nThe same teams always buy the top players (Man Utd).\nThere is some kind of bug where if you sign a player who you intend to use as a back up on a free transfer the fans become outraged saying it was a ridiculous waste of money when, their free???\n\nOk, so after more game play time, (about another 2 weeks) it is clear that there is no tactic which the game allows you to use successfully with top teams or lower league teams and I honestly I have exhausted every one, including several wierd tactics through desperation which did nothing. It's not that your team isn't competitive in the match, they 100% are but despite this the game always scripts you to lose. And this isn't me in an upset spat my dummy out tantrum, its very true. I think this is backed up by the lack of successful tactics being posted on forums, there just aren't any. It's a shame that two thirds of the game becomes unplayable because of this. The championship is the only league I have found where a good tactic is actually accepted by the game and it allows you moderate success but it's a huge shame to be so restricted. Ive found I can keep in the top 3 of the Chinese super league with Guangzhou Evergrande. WOW. Some may understand how terrible that is considering their resources and the competition. But Ive tested teams like PSG Barcelona and Tottenham to name examples, and couldn't even defeat amateur teams and therefore as you can imagine I couldnt beat better teams. I was having some success with Watford, until game suddenly decided that without a drop in player performance my tactic would now send me on a twenty match losing streak and therefore the sack. I still had the same shot, possession and corner stats as I did when I was winning by the way. So when the game starts scripting, you just can't fight it.","November 27, 2015","false","541.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am an avid FM player and have played 100's of hours over the older games (fm2011,2012,2014 I thouroughly enjoyed) but this years version is just truely screwed.\n\nTactics have gone completly out the window as your players fail to replicate anything set in tactical instructions on the pitch. You can play aston villa(for ex.) 10 times reloading the save  and trying different tactics and personal/player roles to counter their threats or maximise your threat to them and it won't matter. The only thing that matters is what the game decides, it just mercilessly scews you over time after time, no previous games where like this, there was always tacical solutions to problems on the pitch but this year instructions seem to take no effect and your team will struggle to beat the shitest of teams in the league whilst waltzing of Arsenal, Chelsea etc. Its all just pre-programmed nonsense.\n\nOne more thing, whoever at the office said " we should have more press questions in the tunnel before the game kicks off" should be fired immediatly. Honestly who the flying f*** likes press conferences?? Everyone i know can't stand them yet the genious' at SI somehow contrive to think that we want to have to answer another 2/3 Banel, stupid and downright repitive nonsense questions 60 more times a season than we already had to??

Your team just doesn't listen to you. I mean, they listen a bit, but not much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sundarworld/recommended/378120/","sundarworld","Sundar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sundarworld/","233 products in account","The theme of this year's installment is definitely one of refinement. The interface is cleaner and more intuitive, yeilding more at-a-glance information than ever before . The player can now spend less time digging through it's various layers to to glean the knowledge needed to improve their team's performance and more time taking action. With a plethora of small but meaningful improvements, the game feels smoother, easier to navigate and less muddied.\n\nThe tactics overhaul is perhaps the finest yet and my personal experience suggests that choices made here are more easily realised on the pitch. Set-piece routines are closer to real life than before and multiple routines can be planned and deployed. Feedback on your choices and changes is quick and clear, both on the pitch and from your assistant.\nThe steady march towards an ever more realistic and immersive experience is resumed in Football Manager 2016. With match engine upgrades, pesky agents, tantrum inducing press, competition overviews that rival the slickest of today's broadcasters and more highlights to watch than the top cable provider package.\n\nThe match engine can still look a bit ropey at times, but graphical upgrades along with thousands of new, motion captured, animations, better stadiums and easy(er) on the eye crowds, the progress is really begining to show in this regard.\n\nContract negotiations are more realistic than ever with seemingly endless ways for agents to embezzle your hard earned cash, but also unrivaled opportunities to tempt that dubious wonderkid to your club.\nThe inclusion of Prozone match statistics and analysis is incredible and will make a huge difference to how your philosophies and strategies evolve along with many lesser additions like the basic manager/character creation suite, create-a-club and Fantasy Draft modes.\n\nAll in all, Football Manager 2016 is a more than worthy entry in this esteemed series. It doesn't re-invent the wheel, but it does come with a whole bunch of new and better ways to use it, all the while in a cleaner, slicker interface.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3znFHiatsQ","November 26, 2015","true","65.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Short answer - No, it's a buggy mess!\n\nLong answer...\n\nI just picked up the game yesterday.\n\nDownloaded, installed, started a new game with my favorite Inter and 30 minutes later hit ALT + F4 due to the annoying bugs.\n\nFirst off, I tried selling a player but for some reason I can no longer just double click on the value to select it all and write what I want. No, I have to fiddle with it! And since Euro values in the drop-down menu are ONCE AGAIN set moronically (11.25m? Seriously?), negotiations are a nightmare for all the wrong reasons.\n\nNext, after we sell players we have to re-invest in the squad. So I send my scouts to get me a report card on a few players for the problem right winger area. And what do they tell  me? They assure me that the right wingers I sent them to scout have potential to be right wingers. Not decent or leading right wingers. Just right wingers. What a revelation!\n\nAnd finally the straw that broke the camel's back - I send an offer for one of the right wingers with potential to be right wingers, it gets accepted and disappears. None of my staff offer contract, I don't get to do it either and the offer completely vanishes from the transfer center. The cherry on top? When I try to submit the same offer it gets flat out rejected.\n\nWhat the hell, SI?! It's been months since release! MONTHS! How can ♥♥♥♥ like this still be an issue?!\n\nI'll give the upcoming update a chance but If there's ♥♥♥♥ like this I'll be giving that nifty new refund option a chance instead!\n\nIf anyone here is thinking of buying, hold off until the update hits and we know for certain SI have got their act together.

I'll set my players individual, and strict team tactics to always pass the ball short, i wait months for this new tactic to be fully trained by the team, then i'll watch the match and off they go trying to play lovely long ball.\n\nThey say the definition of madness is trying the exact the same thing and expecting different results.

Also the Ai in replays are a lot worse than last years due to the stupid backpasses from defenders for no reason or they get ball and stand still for 10 seconds while the opposition get to the ball, tackle him and then score. The way the replay system works, it would be better without one, nearly every goal seems to be a howler which is either what happens or the replay doesn't depict what happened in the actual game. An example would be my player just scored a goal by sliding it in but on the replay it shows my player standing there and tapping it in.\n\nYou get sacked for no reason even if you have good results and the reason I am writing this review now is because I have just had 4 games in 5 days which I can't begin to stress how unrealistic this is or to have no option of contesting it like real life.\n\nAlso just to add the new layout is just in your face, like so many bits of information is one one screen now its hard to find what your looking for and there is writing everywhere!!

I can not get enough of this years offering.  The create-a-club was fun for its first year in development.

I also like that I need more than one way to score... but for me I just change the type of cross/tempo/midfield instructions rather than the actual players.....   FM14 you could play 30 years with only one tactic and have your youth team produce specialists in your system.... I feel like I am punished for not showing the other teams different attacks this year and I am thankful for that\n\nBUT MOSTLY!!!!  This game creates the stink of desperation that English Championship teams must feel to get into the Premier League.... the best players cost vast and ridiculous sums of money... and the good players cost a lot more than servicable squad members....

If you're not familiar, this is not a game where you actually control the players on the field. Rather, you really are just the manager: You create tactics, manage the funds, roster, and all sorts of other ridiculous minutiae. This is a game where you really can bomb out of first division soccer as one of the best teams in the world. You have to know your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay: I like the gameplay of Football Manager. Despite the fact that all my friends make fun of me ("Menu Simulator looks really fun but if it doesn't come with a spreadsheet I'm not playing") it's got something that hooks me and will keep me playing for absurdly long stretches all at once. There is no one tactic you can use to cheese every team, and you actually have to put a good amount of thought into running your team if you want to succeed. 8.5/10\n\nGraphics/Visual Experience: The game's layout seems dense to begin with but I picked it up pretty fast. The games themselves are not at the peak of modern graphics but for a game like this to have facescans for every player in the game would be absurd (just wait until you see the number of players in the game). My only complaints in this department are the licensing issues for a lot of teams and divisions. Some of the leagues you'll want to play won't have official logos. This is easily remedied because the mod community is INSANE and they make it very easy to swap in the correct logos for your Sunday league, Butt♥♥♥♥, VA soccer team. 8/10\n\nSound: Not much to speak of. There is literally no soundtrack and all they've added are basic stadium sounds (which are ABSURDLY loud, by the way) Because of this, I don't think it's fair to give this section a rating out of ten: It's unfair to give such a simple sound setup a reduced score because it's unambitious but well executed.\n\nReplayability: Fairly high. My concern with these games is always that they'll feel dated quickly. This isn't really the case with FM16 because the depth provided means no 2 playthroughs are the same (I say playthroughs, but you can literally play for thousands of years if you wanted) 9/10\n\nHow it Runs: The graphics won't be a problem. The biggest strain this game will put on your computer will be processing time between turns, and this is entirely up to you. Every time you start a game you can select how big you want the database to be, and it shows a little prediction about how well your computer should be able to run with the selected database. There should be no concerns here.","May 2","true","127.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

I think it is time SI started treating each new iteration as DLC rather than a new title, I do recommend this version, but hesitantly.\n\nThat out of the way, is it a good update? Yes. (and no?)\n\nBad thing first: The new create your own club function is silly and needs TONS of work, you'd think that if they introduce this sort of functionality they'd make sure it was user friendly even as part of DLC. It isn't, all it is is a means to do an editor botch job on an existing club, take their place in the league, change the name, place and colours to your heart's content and finally get really frustrated trying to work out which players you want to add to the club whilst not having anything other than a player-name filter. So that striker you remember plays for Scunthorpe but you don't know his name? Don't imagine you can find him, you can't.\n\nGood things: The U/I has been cleaned up successfully, not just interface wise but also interaction wise, you don't have to do silly repetitive interviews each game any more for example. The game looks clean and fresh, even the 3D engine is now sort of worth using. Another good thing is that the opposing managers/teams now respond to your tactical foibles better, when I added a striker after going 1-0 down the opposing manager didn't wait and switched to a counter-attacking formation straight away, when we equalised anyway he dropped further back but put on a lighting fast striker instead of his targetman. I have never experienced that before in FM20** it used to be more like playing against a scripted bot.\n\nBest thing: The match-engine has had significant work to make it more realistic. I am only a season in so far, but I am very impressed with not just the impact my decisions have on the flow of the game, but also the fact that players seem more creative in their interpretation of my instructions, adapting to the flow of the game if they are more experienced, flapping around the field aimlessly after a mistake if they are youngsters and compounding the problems. Compared to 2015 the tactical side of the game has improved beyond cosmetics, which is what the game should be all about.\n\n","December 18, 2015","true","435.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

As a fan of the series, and a loyal buyer; I am mesmerised at the utter redundancy of the inefficiency of the tactics you play or the individual intructions you give to a player. Now, for example, Ignazio Abate will be charging down the right wing. He will beat his man, get to the byline and you will be watching on thinking, "Great! Cut it back for a tap in!!" However, Ignazio will not cut it back as instructed individually by telling him "shoot less often", "cross more often" and "cross from byline". After this has happened throughout an entire season, and after you have seen other players do similar, if not identical, actions then you begin to wonder: what is the point?\n\nAnd that is exactly where I am at presently. What is the point? Your decisions cannot effect the game accurately. You are a prisoner to the match engines preferences, and if you do not play within the confines of its desires then you might as well play a 2-4-4 and get smashed 20-0 each game.","December 4, 2015","false","67.7"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","1"

I'm more a user of the ditor no, creating custom issue leagues for friends but the main game still holds a little interest. I couldn't get into FM15 despite it apparently fixing some of the major bugbears of games gone before and I hung back on this one until the "Winter Update".\n\nWhat an unholy mess. I'd say what a mess the engine is, criticise the inury system, those game breaker things that happen with every supposed update we get. You know, the things that people cricise Activision for regarding CoD or EA over BF etc. Nah, this one, I couldn't play the game. You know that moment when you get an email in the real world?

It could be a great game, the new tactics I have in mind might work but who knows, I might as well have been dangling my testes in dog mess.\n\nOh yeah, I edited this to exclude words that might upset others.

I decided to buy the 2016 version after skipping a couple of years and I certainly regret it. It's the worst purchase on steam I ever made.\nFirst of all, the game crashes every single time I play a match for the first time. At some point of the match, the game simply close. Maybe it is related to the version for mac, but I don't have this problem with any other application or game.\nThe game itself in the management part seems pretty realistic and they added a bounch of good stuff, but the matches are totally buggy and unbalanced. Just to mention the major issues:\n1) I get on average 4-5 yellow cards and a red card every match, regardless the instruction that I give to the team for tackling.\n2) Unnatural movements of defenders (run away from the opponent with the ball, run in random diractions) lead to totally unrealistic plays. This was actually present in previous editions, and it strikes me they didn't manage to fix it after so many years.\n3) When the ball hits a player bounches of several tents of meters in a totally unnatural way.\n4) Seems like the ball posession is totally unrelated to the quality of midfielders and their quantity, but is strongly linked to the tatic.. If your opponent plays with the 4 line, he's likely to have the possession, no matter if you have iniesta and xavi in the middle.\n5) Also seems, but I may be biased in this, that is far more easy for the opponent to score many goals when he plays better, that for you when you have the edge.\nIn 10-15 games I either won for 1 goal more or lost by 3-4.\nSure there are some improvements, like more realistic tackling, but these issues make the game really frustrating to play.\nThes issues have nothing to do with ability or tactic, they seem to be totally arbitrary.\nDon't buy this game, it's an expensive and frustrating waste of your time.\n\n","February 20","false","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm more a user of the ditor no, creating custom issue leagues for friends but the main game still holds a little interest. I couldn't get into FM15 despite it apparently fixing some of the major bugbears of games gone before and I hung back on this one until the "Winter Update".\n\nWhat an unholy mess. I'd say what a mess the engine is, criticise the inury system, those game breaker things that happen with every supposed update we get. You know, the things that people cricise Activision for regarding CoD or EA over BF etc. Nah, this one, I couldn't play the game. You know that moment when you get an email in the real world? You Alt Tab out to check and then switch back? Not in FM16. Whole PC hangs, not just in Windows 10 either, on my Linux machine too. This is not a ♥♥♥♥ rig, my DK2 Oculus doesn't ♥♥♥♥ things up, Crysis 3, you know that hardware breaker? Nah, you can switch yourself rigid but this, christ, it's as if the Weeping Angels have taken over.\n\nI've never left a review before, mostly because I'm not the complaining type, at least not online, I like to do it in person, to a shop manager's face. Requested a refund, just to see what Steam might do. Trust me, this review is just an abridged version of that. It says I played 8 hours. Played is more than just over egging something that was made up of rebooting and attempting to clear a shed load of temp files the crash dump decided to create.\n\nYou know that time when you created a whole new batch of swear words when you couldn't beat your mate on Goldeneye? This abomination needs me to revisit those times. It could be a great game, the new tactics I have in mind might work but who knows, I might as well have been dangling my testes in dog mess.\n\nOh yeah, I edited this to exclude words that might upset others.

They still use the wrong basis for the rule. SI... A player is offside when he is byond the last defender, at the exact moment the pass to him is given. NOT when the ball ends up at his feet.\n\nSI uses the latter as a point on which to determen weather or not anyone is Offside. Which is absolutely WRONG. Then the game says, "The whisle had already gone.." NO it did not.. it just WENT. at the WRONG moment !!!...\n\nAlso.. when a player of my team shoots on goal. and the goalkeeper of the other team parries the ball.. and one of my players has walked or ran up in the mean time... to tap in the rebound... you can only give him offside, at the moment the shot is made from the first player. NOT when the ball comes back from the Goalkeeper.... or the moment the second player taps in the rebound... No player can be offside at that point. Since the ball came back from a player of the oposite team... If you didnt rule him offside at the exact moment of the first shot.. you cant give him offside at any later time.\n\nSI.. If you want to make a football game.. at least get the rules right.. I have been telling you this for years already.\n\nSigh...\n\nAlso, saying Holland while you mean The Netherlands... is wrong..  North and south Holland are only 2 provinces of The Netherlands. While The Netherlands is made up out of 12 Provices... so its not Holland.. but The Netherlands... while you look to correct the rules you got wrong..... also get your facts right while you are at it.\n\nThe game stil adresses a female manager with HIM or HIS, at several points... i mean, if you after at least 7 years of FM still make these glaring errors, then that says enough about the level of interest the programmers have in making a great game...... and it is no wonder this game is anything but great. it used to be... but no more.\n\nThen, the warping all over the field by the entire team at set plays is still there. its bloody anoying and completely imercive breaking...  its sad.. such competent programmers should be able to avoid these things.\n\nInjuries are also still a problem... not as much as in previuous installments, but still. Injuring two of your best players, or your best striker "in training" which you cant even see,.. two days before an important game is really getting old. SI..\n\nSTOP this.. it realy puts me off playing..  there is no way you can win any important game that way.\n\n\nNow the new feature:\n\nI tried making "My own" team... which is a bit of a disapointment tbh. You pick any team in a league...change its name...and the name of the stadium..  then you can add 2 players.. and then change the colors of the shirts of that team.. and the design. Dont know if i missed that first time aroud or if they put it in with release.. but now you can change the design.\n\nBut once done..  Then... you are still only the manager of that team.. and  "Your team" takes the place in the league of the team you picked.. that team is gone. So basically nothing really changed.. except for two players, a name and some colours..  That isnt what i thought it would be, or maybe hoped it would be... and creating only 2 players isnt creating a team.. SI. Could you please lean to count ?...  ffs.\n\nAnd a few games into the season my two created players lost half their attributes.. thats when i stopped playing "My own team" Because thats a dealbreaker for me... Its a promising start for a new feature.. but not worth buying the game for... yet.\n\nThen....\n\nI thought that i was rid of the feature that the club owner can sell your players without your knowlegde or consent, without even so much as asking or explaining why.. But that stupid feature made a comeback... i am sad to report.\n\nI AM THE BLOODY MANAGER.... I was hired to MANAGE the team.. I was hired to decide who plays... who gets bought and who gets sold... IF YOU, the owner...  know that better.. then what the hell im I doing here ?...\n\nI bloody hate this feature.. it undermines everything that you work for... you buy a wonderkid.. spend months, if not longer, to coach him to a great payer that wins you games... Along comes bleeming Man U to make a bid on him...  NO WAY. I am NOT selling this player... Then the club idiot/owner says:  "This offer is to good to be true.. i am authorising the sale..."  ARE YOU BLOODY SERIOUS MAN ?...  NO WAY.. Not while i am around... Oh Yeah.. you can protest.. which i did.. i even told them that if he goes.. i go...\n\nNow my rep was pretty good... but i can imagine scenario's where that isnt the case. And then what ?.. game ruined... possibly you fired.. or left to find another club.. where this stupid feature could happen all over again. and if thats the case, whats the use of even beginning ?...  ITS A BLOODY DEALBREAKER..\n\nAs a Manager, i cant even decide anymore which players are sold and which are not... When a bid come in for a player of my team... it used to be that you could set a rule,. like "Reject all offers..'   or... When he should be sold, and at what price... NOW it says. "A staffmember will respond.." Eh ?...  Which staff member ?.. and why him ?.. i am the bloody Manager... I should be deciding that.\n\nWhat's gotten in your heads SI ?... What made you sit around, and think that this was a good idea ?..... Are you lot insane ?... Bloody hell...\n\nThe new "Create your own team" Featue is a farce... and the fun of playing is not in that.\n\nDoes SI even read these things ?... if not.. they should... they could learn something.\n\nSorry SI.. i can not recommend this game at this time...\n\n\nAnd a few big advIces to Sports International;\n\n\n1- STOP WITH MOST OF THE MANDATORY ♥♥♥♥♥ THAT MAKES NO SENCE AT ALL.... !!\n\n2- STOP WITH SELLING MY PLAYERS WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.\n\n3- STOP INJURING MY PLAYERS RIGHT BEFORE IMPORTANT GAMES, SO THAT THE OTHER TEAM CAN WIN...\n\n4- STOP USING THE OFF SIDE FEATURE AS A BALANCING TOOL... WHILE GETTING THE OFFSIDE RULE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.\n\n\nAnd maybe,. just maybe.. ill buy the next installment....\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYes.. i still play.. but.. only with a trainer behind it... that alows me to correct the wrongs that are in the game... No trainer... no Football manager... as simple as that.","November 5, 2015","false","206.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this year SI has made a game with lots of cons and pros compared to previous years' total frustration which adds a bit more positive. Especially as of FM 2014.\n\nPros\n-Transfer System is much better and realistic.\n-Interface is more time-saver. Takes a bit to get used to but when you do, its becoming a must-have improvement.\n-Match engine -by the looks/graphics only- is improved.\n-New manager avatar mode seems a tiny addition and for many people it is useless. But it helps for regen faces to become more realistic if you ask me.\n\nCons\n-ME must be fixed as soon as possible. I'm not saying anything about difficulty. I always back up difficulty and AI reactions. But conceding/scoring the same goals over and over from crosses becomes too boring and frustrating after you play a significant amount of time. Defenders not tackling/closing down as they should. Strikers always fail on one-on-one situations. I hope they will be fixed soon.\n-Counter-attacking was always a set-back in previous iterations but in this version they buffed counters out of control. Every player can pass the ball across 40-60m like they are Messi, Beckham or Ronaldinho.\n-Player whinings are too contagious within team. They act like 8 year old spoiled girls who their dolls has been taken away.\n\nWhats my result of review?\nBuy this game after January transfer window patch is released if you do not want to get angry as the game it is at the moment. More bug and frustration free will it be by then.","January 25","true","332.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So often, someone managed to figure out a be all tactic that was a plug and play win all trophies. But now with FM16, that is definitely not the case. Now, you truly have to adapt your tactics based upon your players skills and attributes. What works for me at Portsmouth FC may not work for another person as they have bought different players.\n\nThe ability of the modding community for Football Manager means that no matter how small the country might be, you can play the leagues for that nation to a certain level. There are people that have made the English Leagues to level 23( the game only ships to level 6) and others doing similar to the Italian or Spanish leagues.\n\nI get great joy in the pure challenging nature of making this game your own with bizarre rules. The number of people that I know are starting game where they cannot buy any players and only use the products from their youth academy.

Better UI, improved match engine, more realistic transfers, more transfers and removed exploits from previous versions. These things generally make the game feel 'better' and more immersive, however the match engine changes and tactics options does make the game feel somewhat unfamiliar. More so than in previous games, this one will take some getting used to again before you can go out and destroy all the competition from the get go.

I've played every single version of FM (and a couple of CM games) and for me, there's not much new here. Most of the changes are completely artificial and don't improve the gameplay at all. FM15 was the worst and most frustrating version ever, and only time will tell if this is a genuine improvement and will prevent me from ending up in hospital (again) with a self-inflicted fractured skull.\n\nI probably should wait for the proper version to be released before reviewing as the match engine in the BETA version is clearly messed up (I replayed the same fixture 3 times with the same 2 players getting sent off each time, despite making tactical changes) and there are a few glitches which should be fixed by the release date.\n\nI'm recommending this if you're lucky enough to be new to the series as you'll find so many wonderful things to enjoy. Others that have played each version religiously might be more excited about it than I am so far, but first impressions are not promising for me. However that doesn't mean I won't be slumped in a catatonic state in front of my laptop for 13 consecutive hours wondering where my next win will come from.....","November 10, 2015","true","296.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

You could use your saves from the beta on the full game which was good and a nice touch by SI. This meant I was able to destroy teams with MUFC further.\n\nTactics are not as easy as previous years with a open mind I look on the workshop for advice and not many people could give advice. I found that tactics only work for about 6 games and then fail. Although since the winter update I have found my Control OP tactic works a treat with my Portsmouth save.\n\nTransfer were not improved as I would of liked. Overpriced players are still riddled within the game and more frustrating then ever.

The match engine is never perfect, or takes several patches to get to an enjoyable state. Year after year, features are lack luster, or it feels like the devs are holding back good ideas for future years. After buying FM year after year, I decided to hold off on new FM's until there was some real ground breaking stuff, and milk FM 2014 for every penny I could. I played the 2015 demo, and deemed it unworthy. I played the 2016 demo at first, and also found it lacking.\n\nBut after reading forums and posts by respected FM community members, I got the sense that 2016 was in a really good place as of the last patch. Many reviews i've read said that FM 16 was the most enjoyable the franchise has been in recent years... so when it finally went on sale 25% off, I decided to bite.\n\nAnd I've never enjoyed FM as much as I have in the last 30+ hours of playing. The 16.2 match engine feels great... the graphics are respectable... and the UI (after downloading my favorite FLUT skin) is beautiful. I definitely think skipping 2015 was the right move, because 2016 feels packed with features that 2014 didn't have. Like it's almost a completely different game.\n\nIf you're a veteran of FM games, and are on the fence about buying 2016. I say do it, especially if it's on sale...\n\nIf you're new to the franchise, this is probably one of the most accessible versions of the game to get in to. To get the full FM experience, I would strongly reccomend doing some research on graphics add-ons (like facepacks, logos, UI improvements, kits (jerserys), and other 3D enhancements) from fan/3rd party sites. After spending the day updating all of my graphics and images... FM 2016 is far and away my favorite iteration of the game.\n\n\ntl;dr:\n\nBuy 2016 (on sale), skip 2017 (unless it's revolutionary). Make sure to heavily customize the graphics. Profit.","January 5","true","688.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

We can make faces of our own coaches and watch it shout on the sideline. And I even found it provide a friendlier experience for first-timers. Overall, maybe you think it is the best manager game in the world, however, I pesonally think it will be,but not now,the FM 15 is now the best.\nThe problems of the beta is obvious. You can win the game with a big score,,you can score a lot, but hardly can you get a clean sheet.\nAnd I'd like to say something as a R.Madrid fan, In this game, you can see CR7's acceleration is 12,Bale's is also 12, can u believe it? Both of them are the fastest palyers in this world. Without mentioning lewandowski's 16, I can hardly believe Modric's acceleration is 17 which lets him faster than Karim.Benzema,the fastest of R.Madrid, I am really confused.","October 31, 2015","true","260.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Prior to playing read reviews and tons of complaints about The Reds being practically a "hospital" team with injuries happening more often than one could imagine. Rushed into the game with a desire to explore a little bit before starting it again in a serious way. Spent 60hrs in it, mostly at the bottom of the table, and occasionally having only 3 subs due to everyone else in 25-player first team squad being injured!?!! Additionally, players (those luckily healthy and fit) were making beginner mistakes during matches, tactics would not work no matter what, half of the team was unhappy, the board dissatisfied. The things went south. So, it was either the game was a complete fail, or I was doing something wrong, and after decades of playing football manager games (amongst others) my proficiency went terribly bad.\n\nI love this game series a lot, have loved it since the very beginning. It was really hard to believe this FM 16 was so bad. I decided to try with the most serious approach I can have, and think about every micro detail this game has to offer.\n\nStarted for the second time. Made only a few, minor adjustments with staff management. Dedicated MUCH more time and attention to training, both team and individual. Following that, explored tactics before and during matches. Sold two players, bought three young ones, used them on rotation, so nothing special with transfers. The Reds are now in the middle of the first season after about additional 60hrs into the game. There are no more two-left-feet shows during matches. Injuries are hardly noticeable, just to remind they are part of the game. Squad harmony is at the highest level. The club is still in all major competitions, and in the Premier League just about 10 points behind the leading Arsenal. The board offered a new contract after only six months. Basically, I was the one who screwed up big time when trying the game out for the first time. Or I just got really, really lucky now in the second try, the game is bugged and glitches, so it just looks as it plays well?\n\nLong story short, in my opinion, the game looks good and polished comparing the previous versions. Everything seems more than fine when playing it in a professional way, after all, it’s a manager game. And the matches look better than ever. So far, the only con I might agree with (not saying that I agree with that angle) would be, per some people the arguably high price for a yearly edition, because, we all know, in about year of real life, there will be FM 17 to come out. I’ll leave that to others to debate and enjoy the game as much as I can. I wish that to others as well, while giving thumbs up for this release.\n","November 26, 2015","true","325.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Better graphics, better organised, quicker to get to the nitty gritty. Generally excellent. Issues? Some really stupid goals,especially in the top levels. Matchday graphics really good but can also be really stupid. Players running past the ball, not controlling and at times looking like a pub team rather than The Premiership Elite. A few updates and tweeks though for the next upgrade and the potential is there. It really looks like a game of football. I will say I dont like the transfer search but that maybe due to not being use too it. In general a vast improvement and with the development of the online side of things really exciting.

After really bad reviews of FM 2015 I decided to skip this one so I have comparision to FM2014.\n\nPros vs FM14:\n1. I really do think that game engine and your players AI was significantly increased. After playing about 20 matches I can tell for sure that watching them is far more interesting.\n2. In FM14 you couldn't tell the difference between well skilled player and semi pro player from Southern Football League Premier Division. Ale the goals were scored  pretty much the same way. In FM16 you can really see the difference between technical and non-technical player. Variety of plays and ways goals are being scored.\n3. In FM14 defenders AI was absolutely terrible. I know that players from lower leagues can be bad but come one. Many times my GK or defenders were just standing there an looking at a loose ball and do nothing. Just nothing. In my opninion in FM16 there is less amount of stupid and annoing defensive mistakes - it seems more realistic.\n4. Way better animations. Players seem to have much more skills.\n\nCons vs FM14:\n1. Just a terrible, sickening, huge amout of yellow cards. When I step up  an aggressive tackling I ended up wiht a red card  in almost every single game. This must be some kind of glitch because it's just impossible.\nUPDATE: I've changed tackling to normal and I still get a red card (2 times yellow) in every third, fourth match.\n\n\nAfterall as a huge fan of whole series I'm really satisfied. FM16 really is an improvement to FM14.","November 5, 2015","true","251.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unlike games where you actually control the players (PES, FIFA etc) in FM you can't, this isnt a problem, in fact it actually makes your players seem real and you can really get attached to them, playing a match in FM really makes me care about my players.\nAside from the long waiting times, iffy graphics, pretty dire match physics, the possibility of a player doing something incredibly dumb for no reason and protentially losing the match because of it and the random and far too ofter crashes or "Not Responding" BS, FM is a really good Football simulator that will keep you more than entertained, and even if you get bored you can easily ♥♥♥♥ your players off by yelling at them for doing a bad job even though they beat a better team 5-0. The possibilites are endless in FM, just dont think you can cruise to the BPL like you may be able to in other games, because you cant.","January 13","true","109.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(being new to the franchice)\n\nMany frustrating hours, many attemps many restarts this game is not very newbie friendly...\n\nSo I decided to pick a 2nd League German team, expectation top half finish... won 3 games then unhappyness started to breed, soon after I got fired...\n\nDid this with a couple of restarts, one time I forgot to include one player in the midseason training camp, the end.\n\nSo I finaly managed to surive a season, barely avoided relegation though, made a couple of additions to the squad, started getting rediculessly good bids for my players, job offers and so on, the game was fun, I was doing good, sold the wrong guy... Unhappyness... fired...\n\nThis game is extremly unforgiving, one wrong click and your out... wanted to praise a player for his conduct, by accident hit praise game, desaster... Usualy the results aren't completly without merrit but to seem a bit harsh...\nThe game engine is however a bit funky same players making the right clicks I finished 2nd in the Cup (!) and made the promotion playoffs... and won(!)\n\nIn my opinion that is a bit too much range in the power of morale and happyness having done the scenario twice with the same set of plays once losing every game untill I got fired the other time winning allmost everything and beating the crap out of champions league teams...\n\nIn order to try to fix unhappyness I once tried to arange a friendly against a very small reputation team... 39-2 shots, 17-1 on target 0-1 the result..\n\nThe game is challenging, and as long as you pay attention to what you do its fun, but the happyness morale factor weighs too heavy in both directions...\n\nnow to chose one of these thumbs thingies...\n\nYes I recommend the game, it may be tough, but not completly random and unreasonable. When you have time and patience to work your way through its very deep and rewarding and gives you lots of stuff to do.\n\nNo I do not recommend the game to newbies, except if you have a lot of nerve and are willing to restart several times because the game is so very punishing. And also spend some time reading guides... you're lost without.","April 11","true","876.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

From more of a first immpressions point of view having tried the fantasy draft as well as the new features in customising how your manager looks is a really nice touch and adds more dimensions to an already quite complex and thoughtful game. Menus are still great this year apart from a few tabs which hold some really handy imformation such as information on the league, players etc. which I found myself having to go through a few different tabs, overall being quite hard to find.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view, apart from a few goalkeeping mistakes which have been quite frustrating to deal with, the game continues to allow you to create your own identity, to find a system within the players you have which can lead you to success. If you want to play a Sam Allaydyce route one system, Barcelona Tiki-Taka or the Pochettino press, all is avaible to you and takes times and tinkering to find the right plan for you.\n\nOverall, I am again pleased with this years game and look forward to playing it into the future.","December 15, 2015","true","83.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think the gameplay is harder than previous games but that makes it a lot more fun. There's no more unbeaten seasons where your lead striker scores 3 goals every game. You actually need to adapt to the team you're playing against. Players feel more real and the menus and charts are gorgeous. It won't feel that much different from FM 2015 but it is and why change if 2015 was almost perfect?! No true FM fan will need this review but I'm leaving it for those who are hesitant to go for it. I did have some minor graphic issues that I quickly solved by going to Sports Interactive's forum. There's an error that the producers didn't change wich is the lack of study I'm doing and my future in shambles.

Marking, ... infact, defending seemed to be a thing of the past. I play as Arsenal as I support them so find great longevity in managing them. However, no one marks, no one makes tackles or tracks anyone. I beat a 2.5* Australian team 6-5... Back and forth, it was hideous.\n\nRC1 came out and the first game seemed better, made more sense, but then I lost 5-1 away to southampton, from a lot of goals where defenders were almost running away or tackling the ball to an uncoming striker for him to score 1 on 1.\n\nNow the full game is out this has been less noticable and I haven't lost a game down to a bad match engine since, just diego costa running rampant. Anyway, as always with a new FM, there are kinks to straighten out, but I believe the transfers are so much more realistic and I love how i can keep on Wenger as a director of football. All in all, great game, interface will take getting used to, but same thing happened when I went from 14 to 15 etc... play the demo, give it a go, I'm sure over the next few months patches will be introduced which fixes bugs.","November 16, 2015","true","548.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As soon as I got FM15 I got right into the game. Yet, with FM16, I struggled to get a save I liked. It wasn't that the game was bad, or that I got relegated. I simply could not find a reason to play this game after I had done so much last year. Yet, I found the cure. FM16, in my opinion, is much more random and difficult than FM15.  In FM15, in 6 7 years I brought Accrington in into the BPL. 3 years later, I won the league. 1 year later, I won the Treble. I have some amazing saves on FM15. However, in FM16, in the 5 years I managed Accrington, I managed nothing and got sacked. The "1 tactic fits all" tactic I had in FM15 did nothing this year. But, having to learn the game all over again was what me get into FM16. Thats what I like between the 2, what changes them. The diffuculty, the different strategies between the games have changed so much. I love the FM series, and for all the hate about a new each year, for "veterans" who have played the previous years it is defiently worth it. :)","February 14","true","467.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From more of a first immpressions point of view having tried the fantasy draft as well as the new features in customising how your manager looks is a really nice touch and adds more dimensions to an already quite complex and thoughtful game. Menus are still great this year apart from a few tabs which hold some really handy imformation such as information on the league, players etc. which I found myself having to go through a few different tabs, overall being quite hard to find.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view, apart from a few goalkeeping mistakes which have been quite frustrating to deal with, the game continues to allow you to create your own identity, to find a system within the players you have which can lead you to success. If you want to play a Sam Allaydyce route one system, Barcelona Tiki-Taka or the Pochettino press, all is avaible to you and takes times and tinkering to find the right plan for you.\n\nOverall, I am again pleased with this years game and look forward to playing it into the future.","December 15, 2015","true","83.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think the gameplay is harder than previous games but that makes it a lot more fun. There's no more unbeaten seasons where your lead striker scores 3 goals every game. You actually need to adapt to the team you're playing against. Players feel more real and the menus and charts are gorgeous. It won't feel that much different from FM 2015 but it is and why change if 2015 was almost perfect?! No true FM fan will need this review but I'm leaving it for those who are hesitant to go for it. I did have some minor graphic issues that I quickly solved by going to Sports Interactive's forum. There's an error that the producers didn't change wich is the lack of study I'm doing and my future in shambles.

For me the biggest difference is that know it now shows you which attributes are important for which coaching abilites. I'm sure a lot of you had to google them and probably save a copy on your desktop to look at from time to time, I know I did. The biggest issue I have had with this game until now was finding good staff members which usually takes me an hour or two at the start of every game. Now with this small added feature it takes me at most 30 minutes which I don't mind at all.\n\nNow with that out of the way, for newcomers this game is addicting as hell. If you are into football and management style then this is an incredible game. Manage your favourite team and take them to new heights. That's the mentallity I have whenever I play this game. Be prepared though, it's not easy. It is realistic enough to excite you as well as fustrate you. You DON'T get to play the matches. Don't compare this to FIFA or PES. This is purely a management game so the graphics aren't exactly top priority. There are so many different indepth options that you will spend ages learning them. Again I recommend this for football fans. If you are not into football then this game could get boring very fast. You have to micro-manage every single player and staff member if you want to have the best team in the world. I am currently in my 3rd season with Roma. The first two season went well with 2nd place finishes in Seria A and a Domestic Trophy. This season everything is going to ♥♥♥♥ and I don't know why but I can't stop playing. I feel like Jose Mourinho. If you don't know who he is then don't buy this game.\n\n100/10 Would do everything again","April 1","true","264.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Marking, ... infact, defending seemed to be a thing of the past. I play as Arsenal as I support them so find great longevity in managing them. However, no one marks, no one makes tackles or tracks anyone. I beat a 2.5* Australian team 6-5... Back and forth, it was hideous.\n\nRC1 came out and the first game seemed better, made more sense, but then I lost 5-1 away to southampton, from a lot of goals where defenders were almost running away or tackling the ball to an uncoming striker for him to score 1 on 1.\n\nNow the full game is out this has been less noticable and I haven't lost a game down to a bad match engine since, just diego costa running rampant. Anyway, as always with a new FM, there are kinks to straighten out, but I believe the transfers are so much more realistic and I love how i can keep on Wenger as a director of football. All in all, great game, interface will take getting used to, but same thing happened when I went from 14 to 15 etc... play the demo, give it a go, I'm sure over the next few months patches will be introduced which fixes bugs.","November 16, 2015","true","548.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But, the big problem is, this 2016 version is THE MOST ANNOYING EVER. I play fm since 2012 and i never had the struggle i have on this one. All the tactics I try go bad, always getting sacked, and there is always a player on my team that by now reason strats fuming with me in the beggining, then he plays bad, and gives bad harmony to the team. It's really annoying.\n\nIf you're not as unlucky as me with injuries and happiness things, I think with a good tactic and a team you like you're good to go. But, this year's edition to me has as many bull**** as FIFA and PES.\n\nIf you could aswell help me to solve this problem, i would really appreciatee that. I have already uninstalled it, but i might install it again if i get a solution.","February 12","true","204.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

FM still ranks as one of my favorite games year after year. The match engine is solid and the AI seem better at adjusting to your tactics, so you can't just Mourinho your way through a season with the same tactic and players every game.\n\nMy one gripe with the game is the press conferences are still a bit bland and could probably use an overhaul. It doesn't really detract from the gameplay that much, though.\n\nOverall, very challenging and very rewarding. I highly recommend for any fan of the sport and/or anyone who enjoys statistics and analytics.

AWESOME!!!\n\nWell, I recommend that you ALWAYS START UNEMPLOYED. Because to be honest its to easy to start with Real Madrid, Arsenal or any big club with lots of money and already big name players. But seriously where is the fun in that??? Plus you will play 3 or 4 seasons then proberly get the sack because you will have one bad season and not meeting the boards expectations. Then you will quit and start a new game. Pointless in my view.\n\nSTARTING UNEMPLOYED is the way. Yes you will end up getting a rubblish club with no money, crap players and more than likely limited staff.\n\nI started off with Lowestoft, no money, no scouts and crap players, but I had fun trying sign some decent players that i couldnt scout. And I did, though I started unemployed, I never got a job till mid October so the season was well on its way and Lowestoft were rock bottom in the Vanarama North. I signed a couple of good players and still I struggled to get them out the religation zone. In fact I got the sack with 6 games to go (a bit harsh I thought as I was only 2 points from safety) but hey ho, thats football management for you.\n\nAnyway back unemployed searching and applying for jobs I managed to get a job with Chester right at the end of the season and they had been religated already to the Vanarama North.\n\nSo that was my first season, not great but i found it a joy to play. Fantastic!!\n\nBeing that Chester were religated my bonus was that I had some decent players already. Tom Peers and John Rooney are proberly the best in the team. And I had a much better season as I did win the league and I never sold any players and only bought in 2 players. I'm now in my second season with Chester (my third incl Lowestoft) and had released and sold a few players and got a few more decent ones in and still loving it and doing well.\n\nSo starting unemployed is so much harder, so much more interesting than starting with the big clubs.\n\nIf start at the top - the only way is down.\nIf you start at the bottom - the only way is up.\n\n11/10","February 11","true","89.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For example if you change a player it now marks the ones fit for that  position in green.\nThe team instruction windows is now devided into 4: System, defence, buildup and attack. This makes it much more clear as to how your tactical choices will influence the game.\n\nThe most fun part about all football managers however is experimenting with your own dreams about football:\n- Make Jesus Navas your royal right back.\n- Gets 10 MoM and 23 assist and sell him to Barcelona.\n- Realise you made a mistake by selling him.\n- Buy a 19year old attacking left midfield  wonderkid with the money and turn him into your new royal attacking right back.\n\nAmazing game.\n\nThe only thing that currently needs improving (in my opinion) is the first team players complaining about lack of playing time too much.\nI know your own stats can make it less likely for them to complain, but in my opinion their complaining is usually based on nothing. And you can't really give them that as a possible answer. If you have 3 games/week. and you only play them in 2/3, They will still complain.\nAlso the injuries is an every year discussion. I had 8 first team players (Touré, Silva, Aguero, Otamendi) on long term injuries at once. That was probably a bit too much of bad luck. But they will probably patch that later like every year.\n\n","December 28, 2015","true","255.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Had to resign from Cambridge, having got them promoted to League One, before I got sacked. Got the Middlesbrough job next (how, I hear you cry?!) and got them promoted. lasted a year in the Premier League, then resigned in November of year 2 after a humiliating 5-1 defeat to Newcastle. in hindsight, I wished I hadn't. I'm now conquering all before me (domestically) as Dinamo in Croatia. Getting thoroughly embarrassed int he CL group stages, mind.\nIs it realistic? Yes, insofar as it frustrates the hell out of me, like football in real life. Can my strikers score? Not very often. Do I want to throw things? Yes. Will I keep playing? You can bet your life on it.

As soon as I got FM15 I got right into the game. Yet, with FM16, I struggled to get a save I liked. It wasn't that the game was bad, or that I got relegated. I simply could not find a reason to play this game after I had done so much last year. Yet, I found the cure. FM16, in my opinion, is much more random and difficult than FM15.  In FM15, in 6 7 years I brought Accrington in into the BPL. 3 years later, I won the league. 1 year later, I won the Treble. I have some amazing saves on FM15. However, in FM16, in the 5 years I managed Accrington, I managed nothing and got sacked. The "1 tactic fits all" tactic I had in FM15 did nothing this year. But, having to learn the game all over again was what me get into FM16. Thats what I like between the 2, what changes them. The diffuculty, the different strategies between the games have changed so much.

As you can see from my play time, i have been absolutely addicted to Football Manager 2016 since buying it just after New Year, and i cant see myself stop playing anytime soon.\n\nGameplay:\nThe actual game is absolutely fantastic. FM16 was actually my first Football Manager game, and i can tell you now it wont be my last. The intstructions in-match actually make a difference to the game, which was a nice suprise for a long time FIFA player. I would recommend this to you if you are confident in your tactical skills in football, it will be a nice test for any football fan.\n\nSaving:\nMy issues with game saves were fixed in the recent update. I now have no problems and am loving this game even more.\n\nRealism:\nCompared to FIFA Career Mode (which i have been playing for the past 6 years or so) the realism is on another level. In career mode, it is easy to sign top players or any player for that matter, but in FM it gives you much more control in transfers, and the budgets are similar to what i would give to each club, based on their financial state.\n\n\nThanks for reading guys, definetely buy this game","March 31","true","780.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

AWESOME!!!\n\nWell, I recommend that you ALWAYS START UNEMPLOYED. Because to be honest its to easy to start with Real Madrid, Arsenal or any big club with lots of money and already big name players. But seriously where is the fun in that??? Plus you will play 3 or 4 seasons then proberly get the sack because you will have one bad season and not meeting the boards expectations. Then you will quit and start a new game. Pointless in my view.\n\nSTARTING UNEMPLOYED is the way. Yes you will end up getting a rubblish club with no money, crap players and more than likely limited staff.\n\nI started off with Lowestoft, no money, no scouts and crap players, but I had fun trying sign some decent players that i couldnt scout. And I did, though I started unemployed, I never got a job till mid October so the season was well on its way and Lowestoft were rock bottom in the Vanarama North. I signed a couple of good players and still I struggled to get them out the religation zone. In fact I got the sack with 6 games to go (a bit harsh I thought as I was only 2 points from safety) but hey ho, thats football management for you.\n\nAnyway back unemployed searching and applying for jobs I managed to get a job with Chester right at the end of the season and they had been religated already to the Vanarama North.\n\nSo that was my first season, not great but i found it a joy to play. Fantastic!!\n\nBeing that Chester were religated my bonus was that I had some decent players already. Tom Peers and John Rooney are proberly the best in the team. And I had a much better season as I did win the league and I never sold any players and only bought in 2 players. I'm now in my second season with Chester (my third incl Lowestoft) and had released and sold a few players and got a few more decent ones in and still loving it and doing well.\n\nSo starting unemployed is so much harder, so much more interesting than starting with the big clubs.\n\nIf start at the top - the only way is down.\nIf you start at the bottom - the only way is up.\n\n11/10","February 11","true","89.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was impressed by the excellent UI that is fairly (not completely but fairly) intuitive. Secondly, the incredible polish of most of the new features such as Create-A-Club, which is astonishingly well made and complex and Fantasy Draft, an excellent multiplayer idea that is great fun. It also has seen a nice improvement in the match engine as the animations are better, there are more animations and generally the highlights feel a bit less scripted and unpredictable.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some blinding flaws with the game. First of all, the fact that defenders are just a bit inconsistent is a problem that needs patching as soon as possible. At times they can block shots brilliantly and defend almost perfectly but at other times I have seen one cb boot the ball off another cb into the net for a truly spectacular own goal. This happens whether it is Bayern Munich or FC United so making so that buying a new cb for £30 million is actually worth it. In addition, the new manager creator is a really poor feature that needs sorting out in the next installment. It is very limited and the manager you create ends up looking like a playdough model of a manager with a potato instead of a head.\n\nOverall, I would say that if you love FM and just want the new FM buy it now but if you played FM15 and didn't really like it then I would consider waiting till next year for a more polished game.\n\nRating: 7.75/10","January 5","true","161.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However I've been on the Football Manager gravy train since that first iteration in 2004 and have been playing them to death ever since.\n\nFootball Manager 2015 is the first time I was genuinley disappointed in the series, although my hours had waned on FM in accordance with a rise in work commitments I was still managing to plug away and get plenty of hours in. FM 2015 for some reason never grabbed me, no matter who I played as or what I tried I always seemed to have issues, be it transfers, tactics, injuries. Not to mention that I found the new look interface to be awkward.\n\nAs a result I was extremely dubious about picking up 2016, for the first time in years I didn't buy an FM game at launch and after looking at many of the early reviews on Steam I felt my decision was justified. January rolled round and I decided to give in, surely it couldn't be that bad...?\n\nTurns out it isn't, in fact it's the best FM game in a few years, I'm absolutely addicted once again.

I fell in love with 15 very quickly and wanted to get 16 as soon as it came out. But in came all the bad reviews and I was hesitant.\n\nA few months later I picked it up on a steam sale, And I haven't regretted it one bit. The addition of staff shortlists is very nice. And contrary to many reviews THEY FIXED INJURYS YAY! This was my biggest issue with 15, and they sure fixed it. I've only have 2-3 seasons over my whole time playing that I was plagued with injury. Which is realistic, some times teams have those kinds of season, but never four players injured in a single match/etc.\n\nI can't tell you how it compares to past FM games, but as a newbie to the series I quite enjoy it. It's slightly improved from 15, so if you're on a budget, just buy 15, or wait for it to go on sale.","May 10","true","367.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of the rare series that would see you spend a few hundred hours at least on each edition regardless of how rubbish the game is.\n\nThis year's edition is decent. The match engine works quite well now I have to say.\n\nTransfers are STILL too expensive, though understandable considering how the transfer market has changed since my first ever FM (2011)\n\nThe UI is a lot better than 15's. A lot more refined and with more stats you care about.\n\nMy only gripe? Leicester got relegated in 2017 in my save, therefore very unrealistic right now.\n\nAll jokes aside, if you never played an FM game before you might want to pick this one up (Or wait until 17 comes out and be inevitably unplayable until next March). If you already played FM 2015 and haven't picked this up, I reckon you should wait until there are major changes because this game really feels like FM 2015 came out of open beta. It also has to be noted that you cannot transfer your savegames from 15 to 16.\n\nRecommended only if you want a better version of 15.\n\n(And has anyone tried to win the league with Leicester after recent events? I know I did. I failed.)","May 28","true","223.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also the injuries bug is annoying as well, the injury toll keeps building up.\n\nThis is the first FM game with this issue, I don't know what has changed in the sim engine but it's pretty bad.\n\nUPDATE\nI've now received my refund even though I've played more than 2 hours.

Wether we love it or hate it we cant deny that for football fans this holds our attention.\nThere are aspects to this game that have bugged fans for years and whilst they may differ it doesnt stop us playing. From too many injuries to losing one game then losing the following 10 these things frustrate us yet we are still drawn to it.\n\nThis latest installement is no different injuries are still plaguing teams, losing out in cups to a team 60 places below you 3-0  all while the developers say "the game engine throw these up to add realistic pressure to the player" whilst i can help but admire this attitude this sounds a little to much like the word "FIXED". On this note i would say without saving before matches and exploring every option and player under the sun (we have all done it once in a while) your destined to have the league goto the final game of the season every season (mine has for every edition of the FM series) or a cup match goto extra time and penalties to really tire your players out and injure them so your assault on the league is properly "realistically pressurised".\n\nWhilst there are these problems and frustrations i still play this and have hours of fun, agreed there is no perfect game and this is still in the BETA. these faults wont stop people buying or playing it. Maybe in the future they would consider a realistic slider in the options to allow better experiences for those players who simply love the simulation and a game that has a sensible world of soccer feel about it or toning down the injuries. I feel this would dampen alot of the frustration felt by the community on issues that have now become a legacy for the franchise, such as Ballotelli being one of the most influencial attackers in the game yet nobody wants to buy him.\n\nA quality game where i like to challenge myself to producing an Premier league team with full English talent and win the Champions cup. Thoroughly reccomend this game and would advise any fan to buy it, so long as you can hold your temper when your facing 7 first team player out injured and your on a losing streak of 7 games, if the answer is no dont buy it, value your laptop or computer.","November 10, 2015","true","151.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though I haven't clocked that much YET in this game, I've already clocked thousands of hours into FM 10,11, and 14. This year's version boasts a couple of changes that bring a new face to the game.\n\nPROS:\n-Management roughly every team in the whole known football league\n-Mods and updates from community can keep the game alive\n-Football\n-New tactic interface looks sweet\n\nNeutral:\n-The new UI interface is a bit weird for me as I've been used to older aliterations, but that's a minor thing.\n-Injuries are quite annoying. I've gotten around 6 injuries before the start of the season, though I am playing a lower league team in the non-league football, so I guess it is justified.\n-Japan and German don't have real players in the national team due to licencing issues, but can be fixed with a mod.\n\nThere's not that much cons from my point of view, but I haven't gotten that far yet to notice. So all in all I would recommend this game. You might be confused at the beginning, but once you understand it, you will not let go. I once stayed on one save for 20 years of management with Vauxhall as the best team in the world. Now if you would excuse me, I have a team to bring to the Premier League.","November 14, 2015","true","360.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

All the reviews said that the changes are very minor and it's not worth buying the game. The reviews said the same for FM15, so that's why I didn't buy it last year. Actually, my major reason for buying the 2016 version was to get the new "start your own club" mode.\n\nAfter playing 27 hours, I must say that I'm surprised that the reviews were not more positive. The match AI is significantly improved. Players behave a lot more like people and a lot less like clueless robots. Stats for players in low level clubs (like my own home club Piteå IF) are still completely wrong and far from reality. Since I volunteered to correct it, and just got a reply "we've got a guy already on that", I'm quite disappointed that they lied to me about this. But the game is still a lot better than the 2014 version so I think it's worth the money to move up in versions.\n\nThe one thing I was looking forward to most, create your club mode... No... it's severely limited, and the UI is locked to some simpleton mode where I can't get full information about players etc. So it doesn't work at all like I had hoped, and I will not be playing it. I will be much happier about playing the league management though, because of the AI upgrades.","November 15, 2015","true","83.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's alot for you to do here.\n\nApart from being lucky enough to do it as a profession, this is certainly the closest you'll get to it!\nPlayed the FM franchise for years and I'm still lovin' it.\n\nMy only personal grip is that I'm an Arsenal fan (i.e. English Premiership); and its slightly annoying that you dont get their badges or kits due to 'licensing'.

Everything is very simple and easy to find, which I found to be kind of a problem in previous games.\n\nThe simulations are SO much better in this game vs. in older games where my players would stop moving look around and someone from the opposite team would sneak up and steal it and no one would notice. No. This game eliminates most of these annoyances and players actually seem to have some form of intelligence.\nNot to mention the simulations and games look a lot better, graphically speaking.\nI was actually watching a video of someone playing a match on YouTube, and a friend of mine legitimately thought I was watching a real soccer game.\n\nThere is a new feature where you can make your own character and give them a look and all that... I actually really didn't like it. My character looks like a burn victim who is halfway through a sneeze.\n\nAnother feature allows you to create your own club, which I haven't tried yet, but am really looking forward to spending time with it.\n\nOverall, I love this game and it's my favorite FM in the series.\n\n10/10","December 31, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I understand that they dislike the lower divisions, or less atractive leagues (like Serbian SuperLeague for example), but, if you'r doing more than decent with your club, they shuld consider atleast the offer. In the real life, Indian league, Chineese league etc. are getting some world class footballers only 'cause they have money... So, why wouldn't it be like that in less attractive leagues? I had an issue of getting Stevan Jovetic to FK Partizan Belgrade, even when he's out of contract, also the goalie Buffon... Even Ronaldinho... No club, no contract, no interested clubs... And i'm in the knock-out phase of the ECL...\nThat's my oppinion...\nAnd, i had some issues on the achievements... I played challenges, i also made my board build a new stadium (for example), yet, i didn't get the achievement...","March 4","true","189.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It became a vital part of my life, yet my friends advised me to stop playing this game because it has 'no meaning of life' particularly 'sad life'.  I ignored, am keen to keep playing and tried to become the best manager in my save-game.\n\nAlthough there are some negatives which can be improved, there are lots of positives and I assure you that each year it gets better.  Yes, each year you might be facing minor improvements, but MINOR can make the differences!  For me, I'm grateful to buy this game, and, although I can be frustrated occassionally when the game could have done better to improve, I am satisfied.\n\nRemember, there are other games that may have football manager, but they DO NOT have ALL the aspects of this game that has.  This game is the most realistic, actual sports simulation game where you would face many vary ways of playing the game.  You manage, you control the finance, you sell the players, you use the tactic to suit the players, you use your backroom staff advice, you improve the players, you use the youth facility to improve the youth players, you watch the game, you see how your team plays, you see what your team needs to improve, you change the tactic, and so, so on.... I could list on, even if that would take millions of years to list on.\n\nAdmittedly, this game is over-priced.  No comment.\n\n8/10 - looking forward to many years yet to come","December 23, 2015","true","126.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Do you want to know what it's like to manage a club? Then this is the game for you. Football Manager is a game that revolves around you being the manager of your favourite club. It puts you at the heart of the club and lets you decide its future. With a wide database of players it gives great oppurtunities for fantastic transfer deals as well as having a wide variety of different routes you can go down in terms of training and personal decisions. This game is a huge improvment from last years game and it is incredibly detailed right down to the title page. All in all if you're not a fan of football games where you play for the team yourself, then this is the perfect game for you. Its detail and databases are unrivalled making this, in my opinion the best football game out there.
