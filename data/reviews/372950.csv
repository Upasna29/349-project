I'd say, the age bracket for this game is before they actually start learning chemistly, at least, from my memory of the course. I'll put it at about grade 5-6.\n\nLet's see what other games in the series there will be.\n\nAlso, would really love to see more languages supported.","October 16, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It was by far the best of the show and my kids spent a good deal of time there. To my surprise they managed to port the game on PC and it can now work with just any webcam.\n\nThis is not exactly a game, but a toy which is best played by kids together with their parents. This cooperativity begins early, as you and your kid will have to prepare the set of cards youself. This requires a printer, scissors, and a pair of small hands to manipulate them. We also applied some glue and cardboard. Great! Now it was ready to launch.\n\nImmediately after running the game we noticed that our desktop is so much smaller than the large table available at the exhibition :). Also it turned out that in winter afternoons it quickly gets too dark for our webcam to recognize the card patterns efffectively. Last but not least, the game is a bit "too fair" and incorrect combinations get recognized as easy as correct ones, which can get frustrating for little chemists. These are all but minor technical issues. The only real problem is the scoring system. The very idea of substracting points for mistakes in a game for kids relying and showing experimentation is horribly wrong. It would be much better if the mistakes were officialy allowed and resulted in funny comments, reactions, even explosions :) since this is why we do chemistry on PC, not in father's garage or mother's kitchen, don't we.\n\nSo it's not a type of game which you can leave your kids with and go away... which is, actually, good again, for those of us who miss time spent with their kids. The play itself gives kids a good laugh and a big boost of chemistry knowledge (and why you should keep your working area clean and tidy :)). If you have curious kids, would like to spend time with them but they prefer the computer, you should give this game a try; it is - as far as I know - unlike any other here on Steam.\n\nEspecially if you have a large table in front of your web camera :)","January 4","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While the game accomplishes this the UI is very clunky and there are some annoying animations that hold you up. The UI doesn't work that well whilst trying to place materials together and sometimes penalises you for moving things to early. This is especially bad when the game moves things by itself and stuffs up your own tabletop arrangement.\n\nKeep in mind that I've only played with the mouse, but let's face it, not many people are going to go to the hassle of printing out the cards that can be used with a webcam instead of a mouse, unless they're perhaps teaching children.\n\nPerhaps the most annoying thing is the trivial animations shown before each experiment. Sure, this was probably for kids, but I'm sure most kids would get sick of this too, eventually.\n\nOther things include the fact that most achievements don't work, and there are no animations for blowing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up for not following the steps properly (admittedly a reason I bought the game in the first place). :^)","October 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"
