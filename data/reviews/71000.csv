You can do what you want to do if you have some imagination!\n\nA large mapped out universe with safe systems.. Not so safe systems.. And just down right Angry systems!\n\nEven more systems that arn't mapped out... Not sure how many so far, I have only found a few of them and their hard to find which is a good thing! Remember Space is a big place so it shouldn't be to easy to find everything!\n\nYou can Generate space stations in locations you chose that arn't to close to other stations.. Gives you a tactical advantige or a trading benifit, howerver you wish to use it! Thats kinda up to you to figure out!\n\nYou can Mine, Trade, Do Missions from a mission board, or just Pirate cargo from NPC ships to make credit's\n\nGuessing 30 plus spacecraft frames to chose from..Or upgrade to with in game credits if you can find a station that has them!\n\nUpgradeable engins, cargo bays, wings, fuel tanks and Sheilds if you can afford them!\n\nA really Neat wepons lab where you can craft your own version of the perfect Beam or Partical wepons!\n\nA hanger in most stations where you can store a frame for later use..... For a price of course!\n\nGood flight model with inerta or thrust driven modes and even an in atmosphere mode.\n\nCustimazable enough controlls without being just way to much and confusing!\n\nCan land on planets and planet base Locations.\n\nCan fly inside some very large astroids and find some lootable stuff!\n\nCan get a Mech Walker and walk planetside or even fight planetside if you can find something to fight!\n\nGood bit of tech to buy in the stations and with limited space it make's you think and make desisions on how you want your ship to performe, Not enough room for everything so you have to decide whats important for the way you want to play.. The largest ships in the game cant carry everything even!  and thats a good thing, makes you think!\n\nI have read some reviews about a hard learning curve.... This is my first space sim since Tie Fighter and it took a while to learn but it wasn't bad and that was part of the fun in my opinion!\n\nTheirs more good stuff but just cant remember it all!\n\nThe Bad!\nMaking credits is to easy once you figure out where to buy low and sell high... Some players think you have to find the lost city but you can make credits really easy just paying attition to prices... On my second Pilot I made 50 Million in just a few hours of game play because I had figured it out on my first pilot.. Needs to be a bit harder to make credits so you can't just get the best gear so quick!\n\nTO HARD TO FIND OTHER REAL PLAYERS TO PLAY WITH.... I have managed to log onto a multiplayer server but I was the only player on it  :(  Would be nice if you could find others to play with! Seems like not to many people play multiplayer sadly..It might be fun!\n\nNot enough Places to store loot in the hangers...Yes you can use multiable hangers in multible Space Ports but Dang their expensive and a pain being so spread out... Would like to see them let you chose a hanger locaion or build a Space Port to use as your home base and let you store multable ships and alot of looted and Pillaged goodies!\n\nCan't figure out how to create my own Guild?  Would be neat if you could start your own guild then search out an uncharted galaxy... then build it up with Ports and stuff and have your own guild Galaxy, If you could name it that would be even cooler but some peeps would do some real silly names I relize sadly!\n\nIf you lack Imagination... You will probably get bored after a while... Persionally I keep trying to find new stuff and tinkering around to see what i can do.... I'm still learning the deepth of the game!\n\nAnyway all in all it has been fun even if I havent got to play multiplayer yet!  But maybe someone will see this review and we can find a server and start building a universe!\n\nSleepy","July 2, 2015","true","318.5"," 161 of 166 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","161","166","7","4"

It provides you with all the tools you need to live the life of an intrepid space explorer as you blast around an (almost) infinite galaxy filled with collossal space stations, glittering nebula, astroid belts, and planets.\n\nHow you choose to use this sandbox is very much up to you. Want to be a fighter pilot? No problem. Want to mine and trade precious minerals? You got it. Feel the need to build a fleet and have your own armada? Ok. Wanna explore the farthest reaches of the universe either by jumpgate or just pointing your ships nose at a distant star and pushing on the throttle? Oh yes! Fancy visiting the surface of that giant blue planet over there? Yep. Maybe cruise across mountains and dock at the local trade city for repairs and fuel? Sure.\n\nWhatever you want to do EM has you covered.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that it is probably obvious by now that I am impressed with this game it is only fair that I point out a few low points and niggles.\n\nFirstly, the graphics. They are pretty dated. Still, what is here is all done pretty well. Distant stars flare light across your cockpit, nebula and gas clouds sparkle and shimmer as electrical storms rage, and giant space transporters lumber across the sky. On the downside the textures are all pretty bland up close. This is not so bad in space but it is on the planet surfaces that this really lowers the immersion. The actual concept of being able to fly from outer space, into the planet's atmosphere, and right down to the tree line is brilliant and the mechanics of it work really well. Unfortunately when you get there you see that the surface is just barren and featureless. A few sparodic trees and one or two cities is not enough to save this part of the game. A real shame as the actual descending to, and launching back up from, the planets is a lovely experience. Its just annoying that there is nothing to do when you get there.\n\nSecondly, this is no hand holder. You will need to use the forums and wiki's to get to grips with this game. My six and a half hours playtime probably equates to about half of that as actual 'game' time. Still, nothing worth having is easy and  i found the learning quite fun.\n\nLastly, the quests are pretty generic. You will make more money in ten mins of mining than by doing a dozen starter quests. Also there is a very limited amount of detail at times as so far as the living, breathing galaxy goes. There are lots of other ships, constant radio chatter, and dozens of busy space ports, but i'm yet to see anything along the lines of real faction interactions. Still, not been playing long so we'll see\n\nDon't let these points put you off, there are a few mods available for graphical tweaks and the community is still pretty active and helpful for the learning side of things.\n\nEM is a wonderful opportunity to just grab a spaceship and jet off to the stars. You'll be glad that you did.","October 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 103 of 106 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","103","106","3","0"

Great graphics (especially with the mods, which are worth looking into) and sound. Singleplayer and Multiplayer (basically the Singleplayer world but with other players on servers).\n\nNo real loading screens except for like, 20 seconds when you first start playing.  The game install itself is less than 200 MBs or so but if you don't like even the starting loading screen, setting the 'Procedural' generation to 'Pre-Generated' adds 2+ GBs and makes it so it doesn't have to reload everything every time.  Very useful.\n\nYou can go from space right into planets and land on a major trade city or maybe walk around the surface in a terrain walker mech (but don't go too fast in atmo unless you want to burn up), manage your fuel levels, take some contracts or follow the storyline (not necessary unless you want to follow it) or be even more enterprising and find a way to maximize profit by buying low, selling high, mining hydrogen or water or metals and turning that into something which you might turn into a warp drive that you can sell for much more.\n\nHire crewmembers to make your ship perform better (but keep paying so that they don't jump ship next time you dock).\n\nThe combat has a learning curve (the game has proper Newtonian physics but also a setting that uses your engines to try to keep your ship still for the most part when you throttle down) but once you get into it, it's very exciting and strategic.\n\nThe universe is massive and you can pretty much fly in any direction and you'll find unmapped sectors with planets.  Or you might have a run-in with pirates or the mysterious Vonari alien race.  The playerbase is still finding new things in the universe regularly.\n\nThe game really understands space travel.  Not everything is on the same x-axis or y-axis and you might warp somewhere to find out that the station is actually above you a ways.  Little touches like that add to the whole feel of actually being in space.\n\nYou wanna build a station for repairing your ship or constructing things and hide it out in the unmapped sectors of space?  Go do that.\n\nI'd suggest the game to people that enjoy open sandbox games, space as a setting, sci-fi, and games like Elite.  The game doesn't care if you're a miner, a racer (yeah, there are space races, which are very interesting with the newtonian physics), a fighter pilot, a bandit that uses a cargo scanner to pick targets and blast 'em, a trader that's playing the markets, or maybe you just want to shuttle people from one station to another.  It's all up to you and this game really excels at that.","July 27, 2014","true","30.7"," 96 of 99 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","96","99","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOSFAL/recommended/71000/","BOSFAL","Qwib-Qwib","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOSFAL/","309 products in account","I would have preferred a better reviewing system that would allow me to moderate my point, but this will have to do. If I had to give an honest opinion of whether or not you should get the game, I would say that it depends of what you're looking for, as well as how patient you are. This game actually came pretty close to a good recommendation for me : you're relatively free to do what you want, you can customize your ship on several aspects, you have multiplayer, if you're into that stuff... It doesn't look half bad either, the menus are clear and precise, the gameplay is pretty good, and the combat in particular is quite involving.\n\nThe game does suffer from a few flaws, though, one of them being fatal in my eyes. The first one is that even though you can customize you ship, the different modules you get are nothing more than upgraded versions of what you already have. What I mean is that you don't have the choice between a shield that's very strong and one that's less strong, but recharges quickly, that sort of thing. You just have "small shield that's not great but will fit on small frames", and it gets bigger from that.\n\nAnother flaw, this one more important : ennemies aren't all that smart, and seem to have access to an unlimited supply of missiles, or at least that's the impression I get. Combat isn't bad in itself, but make one mistake and you're likely to get blown up, so it encourages a sort of "jousting" pattern that can get repetitive. Your fights will be pretty much the same every time.\n\nLast problem I have with this game, and this one is what made me give it a negative recommendation : the reputation system is absolute garbage. So, you have several factions in this game, and doing contracts for them or destroying their ships will impact it. Okay. But your reputation in a sector won't carry over to another, it's just for THAT sector. That means that you can (WILL, if you're following the plot) stumble on sectors where the Navy don't like you. At all. They don't know you, they don't know where you're from, or what you want, but boy do they know they want you dead. And we're not talking about pirates, we're talking about the NAVY. So pretty much every ship you'll come across here are hostiles. You'll want to bribe them, but they won't answer your trade requests. And here comes the REALLY dumb part : you'll want to do a few contracts for them, but for that, you'll have to dock in the station while everyone is trying to kill you, then pay a fee to even be able to bring up the contracts menu, then leave the station without getting shot down on the way out, then reach the mission waypoint. And do you think they'll stop shooting you just because you accepted to do their work ? ♥♥♥♥ no, don't be insane. Good luck trying to do your mission while having to fend off unlimited waves of hostiles and their flood of missiles. And good luck trying to get a good rep with those guys if you have to blow their ships up while doing THEIR job that THEY gave you. Not that you really CAN, since you won't last long against 15 bad guys and their unlimited reinforcements...\n\nI really wanted to like that game, it had so much potential... But as you can see, despite the apparent choice you have to decide what you'll want to be, you'll get shoehorned into investing in weapons and strong shields to even have a chance. That, or ignore the sectors where everyone and their mother will try to kill you for no reason, but that's just really, really dumb...","January 4, 2015","false","49.3"," 136 of 157 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","136","157","13","9"

It's mostly a sandbox that gives you an option to follow a storyline of missions that will lead you in the general direction of a reward. The learning curve isn't too steep and you'll likely learn something new about the game throughout the time you play it.\n\nThe closest to a "ground game" you can get is to buy a terrestrial walker so you can walk around on the surface of planets after seamlessly entering the atmosphere from space and descending down to the surface, of course. Aside from that, you can't actually leave your ship. Better hope your cockpit doubles as a restroom!","September 27, 2013","true","50.9"," 69 of 75 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","69","75","2","1"

Long story short - EM has really struck a chord with me and I'd happily reccommend to others hungry for some immersive, expansive, open-universe space fun.\n\nI'm only just getting started into this game; only 50-odd hours so far - but already I am REALLY liking the experience, and can envision this consuming MANY hours in the future.  This game seems to give me what I've been looking for in a space sim game for a long time.  The atmosphere, the feel, the freedom and sense of scale - really succeeds in giving the feel of a lone wolf mercenary with the vastness of space just outside his cockpit.\n\nI started slow; some mining, some trading, some exploring, some simple contracts - and have only in the last session or two had a taste of combat.  That's part of what's great about this game: you do what you want to do.  And even after just scratching the surface I can see there is a LOT to do in this big chunk of space.  Love the mood (or moods) of the game; relaxing one moment frantic the next depending on what you want; where you go, what you do.\n\nI'll admit to being personally shallow enough that I needed to get a cockpit and UI mod before really being able to get immersed - made a huge difference and there's tons to choose from.  Don't let the first few seconds of the game throw you.  There is a LOT of beauty in this game (I've taken a ton of screenshots already), and the feel is top notch.\n\nI've only played singleplayer so far, but the multiplayer sounds great - enough to convince a die-hard singleplayer to be very tempted to dip in.. soon.  The community seems active and friendly, and the dev (yes, a single individual is behind this!) deeply involved and interested and responsive.  And it would seem he is currently working hard on the next iteration - which seems like it will only make this very good thing even better, much better.  Can't wait.. but in the meantime I've a huge chunk of space to explore, so back to it..!\n\n** EDIT: Surprise! Evochron Legacy has now been released on Steam!

Don't blow this off as some clone or half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt; this will give everyone who enjoys space combat sims plenty of entertainment. It may not be as polished or in-depth as games like Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen; but it is complete, and works 100%.\n\nThe star system is vast, mostly contained within our own Milkyway galaxy. I don't think any person has enough time to completely explore the whole area; as it would take thousands and thousands of hours to do so. There are many unexplored areas that are left for the player to find on their own; but there are plenty of "inhabited" planets and sectors in between to keep you busy.\n\nThere are planets with terrain, atmosphere, bases, vegetation, and resources that you will also need to explore, either by ship or on foot. You can customize your vessel almost however you want; from re-arranging the chassis and different sections, to customizing weapon platforms and even your character/crew.\n\nThe only "cons" that I have is the small (but active) community, and slow (but consistant) progress to perfection. However, these are easily forgivable since they are mostly my opinion, and theres still 1000x more to this game than just multiplayer and eye-candy.\n\nThere's really too much to write about, and I have barely scratched the surface.

I found transposing the arrow key binds with the WASD ones really helped, and there is a training mode to help you get accustomed to the controls and general gameplay.  You can map most of the important controls onto a standard USB PS1 controller.\n\nI'll also mention that space station contracts are where the meat of single player objectives are, and space gates allows travel to different galaxies.\n\n\nCombat feels like a refined version of Wing Commander, and there are times I feel like I'm playing a sandboxed version of that, which is a good thing IMO.\n\n\nGet this game if you like space.

Known for a very steep learning curve, especially with the flight model within a newtonian physics engine. Amazing but challenging.\n\nWorks well with mouse + keyboard, gamepad (360 USB) and Joysticks (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro and CH Fighterstick). Doesn't need the newest system to run maxed and looks pretty damn amazing in most situations.\n\nVice (the creator) is an amazing individual. I've purchased the last two titles as well, playing the hell out of them learning as I go. The Evochron series has been a solid space sim series for those that want the pilot experience. So much has been accomplished with Mercenary, just been amazing to be a part of.\n\nI play this and Elite Dangerous (currently Gamma 1.05) a lot, and if you're good in one, you'll do well in the other. Evochron has a lot to offer the person that doesn't need led by a carrot on a stick, especially if you go online (seamless online/offline experience btw, along with seamless world and seamless planetary landings) as there is plenty of fellow pilots looking to help you become a skilled ace.\n\nOnce you spend enough time to become a decent pilot in EvoMerc, and things start to click, trades become a fast income, combat stays intense but is amazing when you can beat several foes and have a couple of hired wingmen to back you up. Upgrading and designing your ship is awesome, the community is among the best without an elitist attitude towards newcomers, very welcoming.\n\nIf you want an amazing space sim that doesn't break the bank or your PC, but offers one of the best piloting experiences period, you cannot look past Evochron Mercenary. As I said before often overlooked, but appreciated by most that give it a chance. Anyone that has enjoyed space sims in the past, arcade or realistic, easy or challenging, will find something to like here.\n\nBuy it!

I visited their forums to ask some questions and instantly got a reply from the developer, who implemented a new mechanic to the game based on my questions and feedback.

You can also fly to planets, land on their cities or land anywhere and hop into a mech-explorer, then back to space seamslessly.\n\nThere's an economy going on and lot's of combat to get into.\nYou can also modify your ship to make it most efficient for the role you want (Trader, Miner, Multi-Purpose, etc) or even get a Military Ship that's best fitted for combat.\n\nThe flaw of this game is exactly on its strongest point: there's a lot of random things to do, but nothing is really persistent or makes sense in the long run. All existing ships are random, the stations you build are not yours (you own a license that gives you discounts, among other things), you cannot command ships bigger than a fighter and you can't (properly) own and command a fleet. The universe is big and has no boundaries, but the game's scope is actually very limited.\n\nIf you ever played the X series (X: Beyond the Frontier, X2: The Threat, X3 Reunion etc), the lack of decent combat, freedom, proper flying model and seamless universe that X has, is fulfilled by Evochron Mercenary.\nHowever, the lack of persistence, fleet control and ownership, consistent and non-random economy and capital ship control is found on X.\n\nTherefore, Evochron Mercenary satisfies those who want a good space fighter simulator with a basic sandbox thrown in, but for large scale economy and anything more persistent, consistent and less random, you should look somewhere else.\n\nStill, as said before, if you're into space games, you MUST try Evochron!\nIt's a must-have for those who want proper space-flight experience.","April 22, 2014","true","12.0"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

The realistic newtonian physics model and controls are so much better than the status quo "airplane physics in space" in practically every other similar game, and you really can seamlessly fly down onto a planet's surface! And you really can fly anywhere between solar systems without jump gates, though it would take 100s of jumps without a "special" hard to find type of jump drive. All of this is done very well.\n\nThe main drawback of the game is that lots of areas feel kind of lacking in depth. For example, you can craft things and customize your ship but there isn't that much variety. You can land on planets and stations looking for missions or things to buy, but there are no characters with scripted conversations to talk to. Capital ships aren't very detailed or specialized, and are more like scaled-up very slow versions of fighters with lots of hit points. Basically there are lots of things you can do that you can't do in other games, but not that much intracacy in any particular part of the game.\n\nStll, I think most people who are interested in this sort of game will want to spend at least 10s if not 100s of hours playing it. So it's worth buying at full price, especially with multiplayer support (which honestly I haven't tried yet.)","February 12, 2014","true","117.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Combatcasualty/recommended/71000/","Combatcasualty","CombatCasualty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Combatcasualty/","187 products in account","This game took me a while to get comfortable with but after getting there I can confidently say there is no other space combat game out there that has been as exciting and realistic for me to play. Once you get the systems down and learn navigation (There are a multitude of youtube instructional video's I highly recommend you watch as you begin playing) you are given free range of a vast universe with a multitude of locations and enemies. One of the most interesting concepts for me initially was being able to fly down to the surface of planets from space. The planets vary in type and in atmosphere some even have hostile weather systems or visibility conditions that make atmospheric flight very difficult which I found really cool. The main draw for me also being the realistic physics involved in flight. You cannot just drop through an atmosphere without burning up so you have to approach at the correct speeds and angles and flight controls shift from atmospheric to space seamlessly. Also in space you can fly using true newtonian flight or switch on the fly to an adaptive system that mimics atmospheric flight by compensating for the intended forward direction. Being able to continue on a trajectory at enormous speeds and rotate on any axis without impacting your trajectory has always been the draw of space combat for me but is rarely implemented in space games. Flipping over at speed and accelerating in the opposite direction or setting a trajectory and flipping on your side to strafe a capital ship at incredible speeds is amazing and it's made manageable by being able to switch back to a directional flight mode when you just want to point and fly. The gauges need to be researched a little bit (also on the video's) if you are unfamiliar but provide spectacular feedback that not only brings realism but adds depth and enables more control with a clear idea of the forces at work from and on your ship.\n\nI play a ton of games but there is something special about this one that keeps me coming back. There is a great community of people willing to help out and some incredible mods available. I have some for my HUD that uses the HUD from the ship on the movie Oblivion that's really well done and mods that make the nebulae and space in general look absolutely phenomenal. There isn't a ton of story or progression, there are a lot of different ships, weapons, components, etc. and you are given the ability to edit your own ship designs by choosing components and altering their size and placement on your ship allowing every ship to be completely different even if using identical components. I have spent hours creating and saving ship designs alone with the different components and different levels of components. There are also ship mods made by the community that use models from popular franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek. You can trade although trading is limited since cargo is extremely limited even at the highest levels but quantity is not what I assume was the goal. There are many alert style missions where a commodity is needed at a particular station or planet that appears with a timer and you need to acquire and deliver it to get the reward which is usually substantial. There are many different levels of missions with varying goals of taking out single ships to entire fleets or mining asteroids for particular minerals and even cleaning giant solar arrays with tractor beams where you remove the dirt from the panels with your ship.\n\nThe solar systems are VAST and can contain many planets and stations that require jump drives to navigate and gates connect the systems although the gates are placed in different areas in each system but do not act as doors at the barriers between rooms, you can fly past the gates and on into space if you so choose.  Many gates are actually located in the center of the systems so it's not a N,S,E,W square setup. It's vary natural and organic. The stations offer vendors, supplies, components, fuel, commodities, repairs, missions and a few other things. You fly in to the stations and dock with them to interact and you are protected within until you undock and exit the force field. There are also varying levels of difficulty in the different systems with some containing very few hostile ships, some with many and although I haven't made it out there yet some are active war zones and incredibly hostile. There are also different factions that inhabit the systems with who you can build up your standings by running missions for or against their enemies. The faction standings are system specific and do not carry over throughout the universe which i found adds a lot more gameplay in that your standings affect your ability to use different stations and the prices of things like fuel and other commodities. You may also purchase licences that allow you to hunt the enemies of that faction for rewards.\n\nThis game is the closest I have ever felt to actually having a ship in space with the freedom to fly anywhere and do anything. The realism is incredible and comes through in scope of environment, optional objectives and the feel of opening up a universe for you to inhabit as you so choose. I've actually just flown around as I imagine I would to relax and enjoy the majesty and solitude of space and no other game has inspired that kind of feeling for me. That says a lot.\n\nDisclaimer: I live in and run a home for homeless and disabled Veterans where we have multiple computers and Steam accounts so hours played does not always reflect my actual experience with the game being reviewed other than showing the minimum amount of time I have personally played as this is my personal account.","January 27, 2014","true","43.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","3"

The map is massive but divided into indivdual systems to make it easier to handle, each system tracks your reputation and has every odd job to military contract you could want. You can customize your ship and change out and upgrade equipment to tailor your ship to the jobs you want to have. The game is meduim paced from starting out, I upgraded my ship's size about 5 hours in for the first time.

Having access to both an inertial dampening flight system and pure newtonian physics mode adds an entirely new dimension to space travel and combat. Dogfighting becomes more like a well calculated jousting match and mastering your sliding techniques allows you to overcome enemies with much larger firepower. This is a game that rewards patience and experience.\n\nWhile some of the art looks fantastic (planets from a distance), low resolution textures on space stations, backgrounds and ships hinders the experience slightly. Mods are available to help slightly rectify this problem.\n\nGreat news is this games support for Surround/Eyefinity AND gamepad/joystick setups is phenomenal.\nMost other titles require the use of a third party application/driver that merges multiple joysticks together, however Evochron allows you to map each separately. This is fantastic for people with separated HOTAS systems (ie T.16000M Joystick + Saitek Throttle)\n\n\nWarning to New Pilots: When the game begins it will seem very daunting. After the tutorial section, play with the various tools at your disposal and you will catch on very quickly.

So it sat in my library until I forgot about it. Recently I got Elite Dangerous and had alot of fun for aobut a day, then started to feel like every planet, mission and contract was the same. Elite is basically 4 stations with a handful of lame ships, and some generic random objectives inside a smaller version of space simulator. Now it had its fun moments and looks great. That said it gets old quick. Then the devs at elite decided to make a feature that was promised before the game came out, into dlc. Not just dc but a "season" of dlc, which is a practice I find despicable. To make things worse, that season costs more than the original game, and if youre a newcomer you can buy that and get base elite dangerous for free.\n\nOutrages, I uninstalled the game. Then I started playing this, and within 6 hours got 100x more quality experience from this game. I built a ship with total freedom, meaning I was able to decide what parts went where, how big they were and the style of my ship, so the starter ship in the game could look millions of ways, depending on how you configure it. Theres a main story, an economy, Factions fighting for control of sectors. Its got everything Elite claims to have, and more. Theres crafting, base building, i can even land on any planet, something the devs at Elite feel is worth $60.\n\nThe only thing elite does better than this game is graphics, which odsent matter a whole lot when you're in space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waybryson/recommended/71000/","waybryson","Roark's Hammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waybryson/","246 products in account","Probably the best space sim I will ever play.  Evochron Mercenary is an amazing achievement because it excels at its primary purpose: putting you in the cockpit of a wide-open universe.  And I do mean wide open.  While there are a jump-gates, jump-drives and other, more-exotic means of travel, the universe is a continuous whole.  You could drift from one side to the other given enough time. . . though I am not sure if there are sides or just an infinite extension of the void.  There are also hundreds of systems -- yes, HUNDREDS -- in the game many of which have yet to be discovered.  Also you can land on planets (or burn up in their atmospheres).\n\nIn addition to providing such a vast expanse to explore, Evochron's other principle virtue is its flight system: the game operates on Newtonian mechanics.  This is more than a clever gimmick because it radically changes the nature of combat: weapons systems can be rotated to face any direction regardless of the ship's vector; without drag and friction, momentum also cannot be carried into another vector.  As a result, the game demands a unique brand of piloting, and your first encounters with racing and combat will see you spinning out of control.  This necessarily adds to the joy when you get it right.  The game does ease the burden through the well-implemented use of assisted flight mode (IDS), which the player can toggle on and off.  When on, the computer automatically fires thrusters to orient the ship onto its current heading.  The Newtonian physics nonetheless remain in this mode and (especially at high speeds) your ship will continue moving under its own momentum until your thrusters are capable of compensating. For example, if you were to spin your ship around 180 degrees you would nonetheless fly "backwards" until your engines were capable of canceling out that momentum (if the IDS were off, you would just keep traveling on that heading regardless of orientation).  Incidentally, if you were just thinking of Babylon 5, you might as well stop reading and add this to your cart.\n\nWhile I stand by that glowing endorsement, Evochron is not for everyone.  Those who are looking for the massive empire building found in something like X may very well find this game underwhelming (I personally despise X for its unforgivably bad AI, obtuse interface, and ho-hum combat).  Trading and building elements are in Evochron but not to anything approaching the degree that they are in X.  The game was also made by one man -- which is mind-bendingly awesome -- and this does show in some of the production values.  Simply put, you won't find as much variety in textures and geometric detail in ship design as you will in most games.  Having said that, the game oozes atmosphere; it just nails the big picture thing.  In this respect, I think it is comparable to Skyrim: up close not terribly spectacular, but the vistas are breathtaking.  As a sandbox game, you must also find your own motivation.  That the game was built by one man also reflects that it is largely a labor of love; complementing its roughness and quirks are design choices that would never survive a profit-motivated studio, e.g. Newtonian physics that scare off casual gamers and a hands-on navigation system that has more in common with a sextant or Ti86 than with gMaps.\n\nEvochron also has a pretty steep learning curve, though my experience is that this curve mostly reflects actual complexity in piloting the ship and learning where to buy/sell in order to make money rather than a stupidly convoluted interface (Yes, that was a cheap shot.  And no, I will not apologize to X3 nor to Windows 8).  Nonetheless, there are some aspects of the game -- especially when starting out -- that will have you bringing up the steam overlay to google: "How do I _____ in Evochron."  With the exception of the navigation system, the interface is however pretty smooth and intuitive.\n\nIn sum, this is the game for you if you want to get in touch with your inner Malcolm Reynolds or Han Solo.  For that matter, it is also the game to for you if you want to get in touch with your inner Starbuck or Freddie Prince Jr. from that really bad 90s movie.  And you need not take my word for it: the developer provides a free demo on his official website.","December 25, 2013","true","85.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Atmospheric, beautiful. i recommend a few mods to tweak to your liking. Imagination can be a factor, use it or be bored. I spent a lot of time in the shipyard making custom ships of all sizes in an oddly different but versatile creation kit. However, in the end every ship felt very much the same.

I wrote this on Feb 16, 2012.\n\n"I spent many many hours of game play time on X3 before things started moving along.\nIt took lots of reading and learning and many slow hours of going from gate to gates just to get a map of the place. Mercenary is a lot faster to get things moving.

Having a good multi player universe gives this game a lot of extra life. Player dogfights and battles can be amazingly good fun and the community online is one of the friendliest I have ever seen.\n\nThe graphics are not the best by today's standards but they have nice artistic feel to them and frame rates are smooth even on my low/mid spec system.\nThere are lots of user mods available to improve the look and being easy to mod it has even inspired me to make my own  Cockpit/HUD and sound mods.\n\nBasically, to me it is an old school type space game sim with newer-ish graphics and a decent multi-play component.\nIt all adds up to loads of fun and many hours of play time that make the price worth ever cent."","June 25, 2014","true","12.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

For an open-world game set in space, there is surprisingly very little to do, and the learning curve is so steep that it isn't really a curve at all. And unlike other games with harsh barriers to entry, there isn't enough of a userbase for new players to be able to rely on generous veterans showing them the ropes.\n\nIn all honesty, I might even be able to deal with all that if it weren't for the in-game economy being completely broken. That is by far my biggest complaint: that the player is forced to spend 90% of their time worrying about making enough money for fuel, and because of that, barely gets to experience any of the actually entertaining and worthwhile aspects of the game. The jobs available to pilots simply don't pay nearly well enough to sustain fuel usage and other mundane expenses, all too often leaving players stranded in the void of outer space. And no, there's no space tow truck; if you get stuck, you can only pray that some nearby player is compassionate enough to risk their own ship to save you (which, while realistic, is pretty unlikely to happen considering how expensive it would be for them to do this, and how few players there are to begin with).\n\nAdditionally, apart from avoiding becoming stranded and possibly losing their character, there really isn't much positive incentive for players to make money at all. In stark contrast to comparable space-simulator-MMOs such as Eve, there is an incredibly small selection of upgrades, most of which aren't even much better than the starting equipment when you think about how much work it is to acquire them.\n\nSure, it's probably one of the most depressingly realistic space simulators out there, and captures wonderfully the all-too-real feelings of futility one might conceivably experience as an actual space pilot attempting to tackle the cosmic abyss all by himself. But there's a point where realism just isn't fun, and this game has clearly passed it. All things considered, while it is a beautiful game and would've been excellent if it were released about 10 years ago, it's just not exciting enough to warrant its pricetag.\n\nMoney aside, I really wouldn't have half as much to complain about if it weren't for the fact that it was advertised as more of an MMORPG than it actually is. Evochron Mercenary is basically 100% simulator, so whether it was intentional or not, the way it was presented was misleading for many buyers, including myself.\n\ntl;dr: If you're absolutely in love with retro space sims and are ready to tackle one of the most grisly learning curves you've ever experienced in your days as a gamer, then by all means, get this game; you'll love it. But if you're anyone else, give it a miss--or at least do a little research into the gameplay before deciding to buy it.","August 31, 2014","false","7.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's not an "arcade" space game. Distances are great and controls are detailed ... also very little storyline.

Poor myself a glass of whisky, get some snacks and put on my own music. A new player will have to take a crash course in controls and such, so be in the mood for some learning the first time.\n\nOnce you know the buttons, it's time to head out into space and get a job. Because if you want to travel faster and further you need better parts for your ship.\nAt first, the jobs are cleaning and pick-up/delivery. Once you think you're good enough you can race and fight other AI ships. I never got good enough to stand a chance, though.\n\nSo, I just fly around in space, check out planets, pick up some things here and there to sell and chill.

Then turn your ship towards the planet's surface, and shoot down through the atmosphere, through the cloud layer, and now you're skimming over the surface like an airplane. You can mine resources while you're at it, because all of this is burning up expensive fuel that has to be replaced (mine oxygen from the atmosphere, and then resources if you can skim low enough over the surface). Then land at the city and trade!\nHere are the things I haven't done yet in this game: found a gas giant and skimmed over it, mining gas; seen a sunset or sunrise from a planet's surface; messed around in black holes; searched for lost ship wrecks/cargo/whatever; seen ANY combat (I'm still in the first/safe area); bought a Terrain Walker and walked over the surface of an alien world; been through a wormhole; messed about inside a nebula; designed/bought a new ship ...\n\nNo stupid "gates" like in the X series - in this game, you can fly anywhere, anytime.

After half an hour of playing, I realized I'd bitten off way more than I'd ever wanted to chew, so I put the game away for months. I came back at it with the intent of finally mastering the thing. After spending an hour and a half beating my head against the control options, I finally learned how to toggle inertial flying and began to work my way through the first few frankly boring missions and got to the race against the AI ship. After half a dozen frustrating goes of bouncing helplessly around and then out of the course "rings", I had my fill of the Evo after 4 hours of playing.\n\nI really wanted to give this game a positive recommendation, I really did, but it all comes down to the game trying too hard to be too much. Yes, the hardcore space simulator enthusiast looking for perfect immersion will LOVINGLY CARESS this game all night long (so if that's you, I TOTALLY recommend this game), but if you are a more casual gamer looking for a fun sandbox space combat game you can jump into and start kicking around in immediately? This is the exact opposite of that.\n\nThe controls are designed for a high level of investment in both time and energy in learning how to play. Ultimately, to get the best experience, a full function joystick and throttle are NOT OPTIONAL. Don't even buy the game unless you have a very robust controller. You'll have to devote yourself to memorizing dozens of key commands and unfortunately the opposite of intuitive control options, which is the only serious knock I have against the game from a critical standpoint. The control options desperately need better laying out (IE: movement controls need to be separate from head swivel controls need to be separate from combat controls, etc.)\n\nCompared to other space themed games (ie: Wing Commander, X-Wing, Freelancer, Colony Wars, etc.), Evo is orders of magnitude more difficult to play, being marketted as a "game" (which it is technically), but it's more accurate to call it a space simulator with game elements bootstrapped on. So I simply can't recommend this game to anyone that isn't a hardcore space simulator enthusiast.\n\nUnfortunately, my search for a nice middle ground space combat sim continues.","December 21, 2015","false","4.0"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","31","55","2","1"

I can't believe there are so few reviews for this game. For me, this game is a gem! A diamond in the rough! Being a huge fan of space combat/sim games I have been patiently waiting for the genre to rebirth itself. I knew that with all of the new technology that is available that the space combat/sim genre would come back after a huge drop off that occured as soon as the FPS genre took off in the early 2000's. It was only a matter of time that all of the Wing Commander fans (and there are a lot of us) would beg for a new space sim. The time has finally come. Elite Dangerous and the long awaited Star Citizen are probably the two biggest space sims out there right now. Personally I am anticipating the full release of Star Citizen. I have already purchased the Star Citizen basic package and am calmly waiting for the full release. The only thing daunting about Star Citizen is that it is a "rich mans" game as you can purchase (for a hefty price) all different kinds of off the charts upgrades and package deals from the get go so you may have a huge advantage over the poor old fella like me. It seems that I am gonna have to grind it out like I have never ginded before to be a decent contender in Star Citizen... Which I will ho-heartedly and willingly do. Although Star Citizen seems to be a looong way from being completed... I have Evochron Mercenary to fufill my space sim appetite!\n\nFrom the very beginning since I came across this "diamond in the rough", I was extremely excited to find that a game as in-debth as this for only $25! As I read all of the reviews I began to salivate as this game was exactly what I was looking for! Flying through space, doing what I want when I want! Hey look... There is a nice looking planet! I think I will go explore it and see what I can find. Simply point your ship at the planet, forward thrust and whoosh... you are entering the atmosphere... SEEMLESSLY! No docking a mother ship, no load times... You just fly on in, land, explore, trade, rest and then you leave just as easy as you landed. If mining is your thing... Just pull up to an asteroid and mine it! It is that easy! I have only just finished the training module and I know that this game is a for sure gig. The graphics my be a little dated. But if you gotta a decent rig all yoa gotta do is bump everything up to ultra and your set. The game is so rewarding that the graphics do not really matter. For what the game is and what it costs I thing that the graphics are quite pleasing. Where was I the last year or so and how come I have never heard of this game? Oh... I know. I was to busy reading about Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous to even think that there was another space sim out there. Thank God for Steam in pointing me in the right direction. Sometimes Steams suggestions are all wrong, but they got this one right on the button! Because of Evochron, I now have an awesome space sim to play while I am waiting for Star Citizen (and saving up some cash... Star Citizen is gonna be expensive as I think the FPS dlc is gonna run me a pretty penny). Seriously... If you are a space sim genre fan and are waiting for Star Citizen like I am and need something to hold you over... GET THIS GAME! Well honestly... If you are a space sim fan, you prabobly already own this game. Unfortunately I have been in the dark as this game has been around for awhile. I wish I would have known about this game sooner. Enough of the chit-chat. I am through with training and I want to go mine a couple of asteroids, and skim a few planets!

Unfortunately, it's nigh unplayable. After poking around for a bit, doing some mining and contracts, I've realized that I really don't want to play, any more. Flying around an open world universe in your own pile of space scrap is a good feeling, one that deserves an interface worthy of its task. Unfortunately, it's just abysmal. Your starting ship starts out with one cargo hold. Sounds ok, right? You can only put one type of item in each hold, even though it'll hold 25 of that item. When mining, each asteroid gives three ore, which means you're missing out on two-thirds of the ore, since they're not compatible with each other.\n\nOk, you can upgrade your ship to five cargo holds. Fine, but the miner stacks to the lowest cargo hold that isn't full, so if you have 1 platinum ore each in holds 2 through 5, it'll still put any new platinum in hold 1, meaning that if you actually wanted to get some diamond ore from the same asteroid, you'll have to trash one of the platinums to make room for it, instead of (logically) moving it to one of the holds that already has that same item in it.\n\nOne time, I got a contract to mine 25 platinum. As it works out, I ended up with about 32. Unfortunately, about half was in hold 2, and the other half was in hold 3. When I got back to the station, it said "contract failed". O.o My best guess is that the game is too dumb to figure out that 16 + 16 = 32, which is more than enough for the contract. Another mining contract flew me right into a planet as soon as I jumped to the waypoint it gave me. Yet another didn't give me a waypoint at all, so I flew to an asteroid field and saw, yet again, "contract failed". I failed a mining contract by flying to an asteroid field?!?\n\nOk, that's most of my experience. I also happened to run into a hostile ship. He decided to engage me, and I gladly took the challenge. Unfortunately, the starter ship couldn't even dent his shields... Guess I won't be roaming around, looking for fights to get into. There are a lot of other problems, mostly with the interface. Variety is also sorely lacking. Sure, there's a few ships you can buy, but no one ship or weapon is particularly different from any other. Their stats aren't all that different, either.\n\nMeh, 4/10.

The interface is poorly constructed and counter intuitive. The trade system is unbalanced and easily manipulated. (I had 250 million credits in 5 hours of play) This takes all the excitement out of playing. With 250 million credits, I could afford everything in the game. The combat controls are terrible. I'm a person who favors game mechanics and story content over beautiful graphics so I would not, normally, mention the graphics quality. Unfortunately, this game excel in none of these areas and the graphics would have been aweful in 2001. The potential of this game is there. With a team of programmers and six months of overhual, it could really be something. At this time I have to advice people not to waste their money.

You have the freedom to decide how you make your fortune, wich solar system you want to do it in depending on the market wich is constantly changing. The game helps you open your mind to how you could do things and while it does that...you get to fly in space...win win and more win.\n\nThe game engine is clever with the way it follows newtonian law and it's very smooth too. There's no loading screens....you go into a station, you go out of a station. You fly into the planet's atmosphere, go and mine the sea, the soil, go to a station on the ground and trade and get contracts...then fly by out....again, no loading screen.\n\nTo top it off, the game is beautiful, some of the veiws your eyes will be widening at are truly spectacular. you'll find yourself flying around and enjoying the scenery...yup, the scenery of space...you'll see when you get to it. Not all of it is wonderful, some systems feel ran down, a red dwarf making the system look drab, evil, dirty. In other places, you might just want to stay there and make a few thousand credits, just to take in more of the scenery...aaahhh.\n\nAll in all, it's a good sandbox game that gives you the full dish of freedom. The game can either be relaxed and casual as you mine and trade as a merchant, or it can be chaotic, living life on the edge, destructive and dangerous as you fight in war zones and even just fly into systems where law means little to nothing.

If not, just go somewhere else, why are you even reading this... If you're on the fence, it's probably still not for you, it's not an easy game to like. If you love em, go ahead and give this a try. When it's on sale.\n\nThere's a fair bit to the game - some nice looking worlds, a fair number of ships and some parts to strap to them. Some missions to do. For the most part it's all there, just not enough of 'it' for my tastes. Lets take ships for a start:\nThere's a couple of dozen hulls, but the hull you pick just gives you more (or less) ability to strap a better engine to it, or better shields. There's not much in the way of trade-off, one engine isn't super fast and another super agile. Some shields aren't better at one sort of weapon or worse at another, it's all just a ladder to climb.\n\nThat means money. Missions are fine but you wont see much profit out of them: fuel is pricy, repairs can be too, and new missles aren't found in the bargin bin. That means you'll probably go mining a lot. It's good money but it's a massive time-sink - no danger involved, just... time. You're going to get sick of the music pretty fast when you're listening to it this much. The fastest way to make money is trading goods between system, but it's still no more exciting.\n\nReputation is another thing you'll be spending a lot of time working on and it's no different than a grind in any other game, it gets old a little too fast. Missions become overly repetitive under the strain of getting someone to like you and the fun evaporates.\n\nNone of what it has is bad, but the sandbox world leaves you soon feeling too directionless and the available content isn't enough to really populate the void of space. While it's fun to start, I think the majority of people would tire of it quickly - not that it should scare anyone off giving it a try, just wait for a sale to pick it up.","March 10, 2014","true","18.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"Man, that's not what I expected, what did I pay for?" - something like that. Then, I got into it, and things turned to the better.\n\nThat is hard to deny that the game has drawbacks. There's an uber great idea behind it, but it was not absolutely properly realized. On the other hand, revealing its full potential would have required years of development and dozens of developers.\n\nI don't really like its graphics, for instance. It looks outdated, and the game is unable to switch between screen resolutions - so, I have to change it manually before running the app. After starting a new game, you feel a bit lost - not knowing what exactly to do, how to travel to long distances, why is the map so small, why are contracts the same again and again... Earning money becomes too easy when you find out that a bunch of cheap metal alloys can easily be turned into some expensive spacecraft equipment... The list can be continued.\n\nStill, the game has its appeal. After some exploration you will find out how to make fun of it. Its combat system is rather fine, for example; developers also paid a lot of attention to controlling options, making it possible to control every small aspect of managing and dispatching your ship - like manual tuning of energy balance between shields and weapons to boost either of them. (I remember one reviewer saying that it's one of the few games where you can actually feel like being inside of a real spacecraft; that's quite true.)\n\nThere's some endless space you can wander, and some beautiful planets that make you want to save a screenshot. If you want to, you can land on literally any spot on any planet (except gas giants, of course), and as soon as you've earned some million dollars to buy a terrain walker, you can even leave your ship and take a walk on the surface.\n\nIt may be calm and relaxing as well as swift and exciting. And, it is generally good, though it could be even better.","January 16, 2013","true","59.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Clearly the game doesn't sell a lot.\n\nIt "is" complicated and there's a very steep learning curve. I'm guessing about a month before you figure most of it out.\n\nComplicating this is that there isn't much information if you Google for it because there weren't enough players for it. There "is" some useful info, there are some good Youtube vids, but not enough for you to learn what many other things do.\n\nVery poor ship customization. Cargo bays are limited to 5, although with the Oasis to Pearl run (semi-cheat) that's really all you need to make all the money you need. And then what?\n\nI still have a long way to go so I gave the game a thumbs up but I don't know what else I'll find. I've easily spent 10x the amount of time I've played watching vids and searching Google for info. I have about 100,000,000 credits from that trade run between Oasis station in Pearl and Pearl's hidden planet (location easily Googled).\n\nThe Nav map is so hard to read with all the letters cluttered. Surely this can be fixed.\n\nGame is about 4 years old and no signs of fixing/adding small conveniences.\n\nWay too expensive for a game no one plays anymore.\n\nAuto docking would make this game much more tolerable, and a lower price (say $7 to attract more players).\n\nThe game "is" fun, but you really have to work for that fun.\n\nAgain, still too early for me to tell how tolerable the game really is.","August 2, 2015","true","24.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game will offer you a series of starting roles that will give you a ship that you can use to explore. The options of starting roles include anything from a miner to a combat pilot. I chose the miner because of the tools and reputation you get with the ship you pilot. The game will also give you a chance to customise your ship to what you want it to look like from a selected range of wings, engines, shields, fule tank and the body frame.\nThe game map is pre-made and you will get the same map as everone else has, but it will throw a lot of diffrent things in our path from a black hole in one sector, to a planet made of water with an atmosphere made of diamond in the next sector.\nThe game also has a reputation system that will chance on what contracts you take in the diffrent quadrents. If you complete  enough contracts for a cetain group, you reputation will increase with them and down with another.\nOverall the games elements of exploration, freedom and customisation makes you in control of the game with no rules to follow.\nI really recommend this game to anyone who would like to have a good time exporing the universe!\n","April 20, 2014","true","81.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a bit better, but still feels a bit slow, the quests and storyline don't feel very compelling to me, and although there is a dynamic ability to create your own space station and other facilties, it still feels bland and lackluster.\n\nIt's combat is better then eve, i'll give it that much, not that i played a ton of eve, but eve has always been more of a text based game with some visual laser shows for big fights. I guess it does what it's suppose to do: well, and it tries to make the world more emmersive by having voices when you dock at a station adding a good effect. An effect that i wish there was more of. I never felt attached to anything, faction or cause. Just me floating in space fighting enertia, my only true enemy. The "main story" i guess you could say, just walks you through each type of quest they have avilable to you, not giving anything new or interactive besides revealing random ♥♥♥ cache's for "mercenaries only".\n\nThis is more of a simulator, as such it takes a very long time to do anything. Maybe multiplayer is more fun, but i did not bother with it.\n\nMaybe build a giant Space station network or something. There's apperently npc ships you can command later on but i did not get there due to me having to battle it out solo with a capital ship.\n\nbeing sent to fight fighters i can understand, but fighting a capital ship solo? are they nuts? it can be done of course, but i feel like it's something a group of fighters would do, maybe with support, rather then a single lone mercenary, trying to soak up the endless missles it launches while 4 fighters attack you.\n\nAlso, missles are a pain in the ♥♥♥, and you seem to run out of countermeasures very quickly due to the shere amount of them fired at you. Also station items seem to be really buggy when you reload after dying, they don't replinish and it's like you just bought them out, you can also save and reload or exit the quadrent and return to it to get a new set of items. This does not feel right to me for a "simulator".\n\n"Contracts" or quests as i like to call them, get very stale very fast. Kill 4 fighters, then kill 4 more, after that you can kill 4 fighters again, all of them randomly scattered about in some random portion of space for no conceivable reason. This is one of the better quests you'll find, as most of it's fetch quests, mining, cleaning a solor array, "racing": which is more like "Battle your greatest foe! ENERTIA!"\n\nJumpdrive is still bugged however, causing you to run into stuff or randomly explode upon exiting a jump. They fixed it with stations at least, I remember hammering into the side of stations uncontrollably, now you just seem to bump off them harmlessly instead of smashing into them, they also have better guiding for your ship when entering a station, minimizing further ship crashing.\n\nOverall, this is not what i'm personally looking for.

At the same time, the overall experience seemed to be a bit obtuse, with navigation especially feeling a bit uncertain (as I remember). Also, the lack of a memorable and central narrative eventually had me shrugging my shoulders and moving on to other things.\n\n"Free form" play is a neat idea, but if you have to imagine the entirety of your own story - without real external cues - it can all end up being too emotionally "flat." (If there's nothing to care about beyond the next ship upgrade or profit-making venture, what's the point of being a swashbuckling star pilot? I ask you.)","January 8, 2015","true","15.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

But its made by one guy, so that's forgivable.\nBut its kind of ugly, it has quite a learning curve and does a poor job of explaining things.\nThe UI is AWFUL, and doesn't do all that great a job of letting you know what's going on. BUT with persistence, you can get a good grip on it.\n\nThere really isn't much to do once you get in there. Sure you can trade, but there isn't enough interesting things to do once you have a boatload of cash. You can build stations and other items, that give you discounts on items, but building them is a pain. Once you have them, though, there isn't really a point as you already have what you need.\n\nThe atmospheric flight is neat, its handled in a interesting way. You can't just slam down into the atmosphere and survive. You have to take a long, shallow entry or you'll explode. But once you get down to surface level, there really isn't much to do, that you can't already do in space. So it eventually becomes pointless.\n\nThe ship building/upgrading is interesting, but not nearly fleshed out enough. It feels like the developer tried to do LOTS of things just well enough for them to work, but non of them are all that good or worth doing unless its your first time, or absolutely necessary, like ship upgrading.\n\nIn saying all that. If you stick with it, you make the control layout work for you, rather then fight you all the time. You find a nice, active MP server and play. It becomes more interesting. But on a whole, I could only get a few days in before I lost interest.\n\nBut for one guys work, its impressive.\n\nI wish the developer would hire a few more people. It has some really cool stuff, that could be made into something REALLY cool.","June 17, 2014","true","16.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I'm TRYING HARD to like this game.  I love the idea of it, but I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do:\n\n1) The second quest mission out of the gate is a race that I simply can't do.  I've shredded millions of credits on different ship ideas and the like, but occasionally no matter what I do, inertia pulls me out of the rings and I lose the race.  Period.  Big ships, small ships, wings, engines - doesn't matter.  I can't win that race.  Maybe there's a way to cheat it or something I can find on the forums, but this is FRUSTRATING.\n\n2) Mining is mining, and it's fine, but there's not much to it.  There's an outpost with an asteroid about 700 out from gate 4.  Pretty sweet spot to pile up credits.  On a lark, I tried warping over to the hostile space next door.  Got killed a lot, but eventually jumped away to a much riskier asteroid field.  What did I find, mining in this new hotbed?  Same stuff as the asteroid right outside the gate.\n\nMaybe I just need to start a new pilot and try a different career, but at this point I'm worried I'll hit the same sort of dead end.","September 15, 2014","false","11.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I like the idea that this game gives us so many options for modifying our ship, but we have so little info at the start of the game I don't know if I should upgrade and if I do upgrade what do I upgrade to?\n\nThere are so many options and commands in this game it is utterly confusing.

I just don't have the time to spend.\n\nAlthough if you have time and you like games like this, there appears to be plenty of people who like the game.  I bought it because I saw potential.

The economy is static.  There is no flavor between any of the factions, heck other than a different label, theres no difference between the factions.   There's not much of a difference between your starting ship and the best ship you can buy.  And because of the way energy works in this game, the starting weapon is one of the best.   When you put everything together, this universe is simply... dead.\n\nSure, you can build a station to buy stuff you don't need, or build a construction yard to turn space junk you don't need into spaceship components you don't need, or you can mine an asteroid for money you don't need (see static economy) - but it all amounts to nothing.\n\nThis game is one of the few that I whole-heartedly give 2 thumbs down.","February 11, 2014","false","39.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","2"

And let me tel lyou the long history this game has had so you can discover for yourselves where this game originated from...\n\nI bought a game by the company 3000ad, which is now a dirty word in my language, never to be trusted again, who released a game called Battlecruiser ???? (some number), the game, while it may have had good intentions, was utterly flawed, and buggy, and options had to be selected with particular care, when setting up at the start of a game, if you inadvertently, selected the incompatible options, it would crash to desktop, but there was no error checking routines in place to say if you chose this option and have that option selected, will cause problems, instead, it gave you the freedom to choose whatever options you want regardless of outcome.\n\nThe documentation included an instruction manual for the game that would put our Defense Department's aircraft manual's to shame.  After installing the game, nearly 70 additional "how to" files will be spammed into your start menu, and if not handled properly during installation may even spam your entire desktop.\n\nI don't care about the cheesy graphic's as I'd rather have a low end game that works, than a high end game full of bugs, but even so, despite the cartoony graphic's, was full of bugs and crash to desktops, with an eternity worth of documentation you'll never keep in your head, let alone remember when it comes time to actually play the game.\n\nLater on, they released a sequel called Battlecruiser Millenium, which was the same game, same bugs, no noticable difference, other than the fact that they got another paycheck at our expense, for a flashier intro screen.\n\nFollowing their failure with that sequel, was about the same time Microsoft released their best functional game called Microsoft Freelancer, which was an incredible game that I adored, and wish they would have made a sequel to, but never did.  3000ad felt they had to collect on some of that fan base $$$, so they repackaged their garbage to compete with Freelancer, and they called that same garbage Universal Combat...   Same game as Battlecruiser, different title, different box, same garbage game, full of bugs and crash to desktops.\n\nNow they've repackaged the game AGAIN, under a new name called Evochron Mercenary, same game as their original garbage Battlecruiser, with same crash to desktops... The only reason I bought the game was because the box reminded me of Freelancer, and I didn't notice in very small print 3000ad, had I seen their company's logo, I would have not wasted my money on it.  So I got ripped off 4 times by that company, like buying the same game 4 times, only thing different was the names.\n\nThis game doesn't even have a rating, its THAT low!\n\n","September 24, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","8","1","12","3","4"

It even breaks X-Wing Alliance off.\nIt's flying in space with the same kind of physical realism you know from sims like MS Flight Sim and other heavily realism-oriented games.\nYou can do whatever you want. Start a war with a entire system. Make yourself rích by mining. Find luxurious trade-routes. Live by your guns - yes, you name it.\nYou can soar over the surface of any planet you encounter, and even land in cities on them. You have an entire quadrant of space ahead of you, some systems are hostile, some aren't. Some have riches, others have rebels hiding behind every asteroid you try to mine. Your options are what you make them to be in this game.\n\nIt's a truely amazing space sim.\n\nJust remember to make your graphics card apply anti aliasing and ansitropic filtering to the game's .exe file - or it looks like som kind of 90's game. But it IS quite beautiful if these measures are met. And a good solid joystick wouldn't hurt either...","February 10, 2012","true","224.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seamless space-to-planetary flight transitions, the game allows you to excel at mining/trading, combat mercinary, timed and competitive races, and piracy. The game does not cater to any one in particular, but allows the player to truely do whatever they like in this deceptively enormous galaxy with hundreds of thousands of sectors, each sector spanning an area of hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers.  Planets are realistically sized so as you're flying across the planet surface, you cover several distinct biomes as you cross oceans, polar regions, deserts, and mountainous regions.  Space flight is what space flight should be. Expending fuel with your afterburners will exponentially increase your speed, and interial correction systems need to burn fuel to keep you travelling in the right direction and at the right speed, or turning them off allows you to simply coast toward your destination.\n\nOverall a fantastic space sim for any fan of the genre.","January 29, 2012","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game has so much content that I never did get a chance to totally finish everything but I spent all of my time playing coop with someone and I couldnt have had more fun if I tried so even though this game has a solo player mode I would recommend the coop mode without a doubt just because after trying both it didnt change anything and was just more enjoyable with a friend.\n\nWould recommend this game if you enjoy games like EVE online but dont want the drama with a bunch of people on a server trying to kill you. Not to mention you only buy this game once and you are good which is a huge plus over EVE. The missions at times were a challenge so it never left you feeling like the game was too easy.","July 14, 2013","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has you managing all the mundane parts of your ship.Take bad hit in a fight? You can divert power from weapons to shields. You can switch between non-newtonian "magic" flight and normal newtonian flight with the tap of the space bar - allowing you to rapidly change your trajectory in combat.  The combat in game completely revolves around mastering this trick and is very satisfying to pull off.  Multiplayer is enjoyable but the community is small.  A fun game if a little repetitive.","February 21, 2012","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
