Jolly rover reminds me a lot of the monkey island series. The graphics are retro styled and work well with the whole layout of the ganeplay itself. It is narrated throughout which is great as the voices add to the fun of playng, Its not a huge world based game. It has a few locations and three main islands with many explorable parts, not a huge amount of interacable characters but this to me stops it getting boring and clustered. The story is good and the puzzles are fun and not too hard. It is a light ha=earted game but worthy of a 9/10 I would recommend to anyone who wants a casual easy flowing game. If you enjoy click and points give it a try and for the price you cannot lose.","February 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Liked the voice acting and the animation a lot. Had a few adultish jokes in there that I was happy to see to keep the game from getting too kiddy on me.  Ended up a little short but that made for a fun adventure that didn't overstay it's welcome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetrodude/recommended/58200/","TheRetrodude","TheRetrodude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetrodude/","597 products in account","At first glance this game will look like some sort of Monkey Island ripoff. And in a way, that might be the way to describe it. Personally, I think it's more of a love letter to adventure games of yesteryear, combining the atmosphere and humor typical of major adventure games of the 90s with a few modern twists, including quests to find hidden pieces of eight and crackers, and a clever hint system should you choose to use it. If there's one thing that I dislike about many modern adventure games, it's that they give hints much too easily. Making the puzzles difficult to solve and not forcing hints down your throat is better for an adventuring experience.\nThe developer commentary is quite fun and at times hilarious to listen to, ranging from anecdotes on the game's development to outtakes from the voice artists. (Be on the lookout for Janes singing "Party In The USA!") The addition of unlockable character profiles and artwork does feel like an attempt to put in some artificial replay value, but that's really my only major complaint with the game.\nOverall, if you want a short but sweet ride through a colorful world created as an homage to 90s adventures, I recommend giving this game a shot.","July 6, 2011","true","10.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Since then, it's been waiting to be finished.\n\nWell, I did. Three years after.\n\nJolly Rover is a story about a dog that is a sailor and become a pirate because of an evil governor. Here's Gaius James Rover becoming Jolly Rover, specialized in freeing people, in using Voodoo spells and... in juggling.\n\nThe plot is nice, that's sure, though you're still asking yourself how Gaius became a sailor when he wanted to be a clown. Anyway, you have the traditional story family, the voodoo, the cannibals, the lady pirates...\n\nThe graphics are aimed to a young audience: it's colorful, in style with old cartoons that could have been broadcasted during my childhood and they're well done. Everything is easy to understand (well, if you're an English native speaker or skilled in the language, else, you may have an hard time to find what to do).\n\nThe dialogues are also good, with humor or naivity. Even the voice acting is quite good.\n\nThe gameplay is a traditional adventure game: discussing is giving you clues, observing objects can be rewarding, well, it's a good trip to memories with old titles of the same genre.\n\nNo, really, Jolly Rover is well-polished, well-balanced and adapted to a young audience. Recommending it with all my heart.","November 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

You play as James Rover, a dog who wants to be a clown but ends up becoming a pirate (yaaaar!). if you are familiar with this genre, then you probably know exactly what to expect - the game isn't breaking any huge molds. But what it does, it does well. None of the puzzles are too hard - if anything, most are too easy - but I thought the difficulty balance was OK (there is even a hint system available if you do get stuck). The game is also very short (5 hours or so). But if you are a fan of this genre, I think you should give it a go. The graphics are nice (though the lack of a hi-res option is lamentable), and the dialogue and voice work are good. The game is pretty funny as well. But it's definitely not for everyone. I wholly recommend it to anyone, like me, who cut their teeth on classic Sierra and Lucasarts adventure games. For anyone else, it might not be up your alley... but I do think it's worth checking out.","September 18, 2011","true","5.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Jolly Rover begins with Gaius James "Jolly" Rover making a booze delivery to Governor DeSilver on Groggy Island. But, pirates happen, and Jolly's taken prisoner. You guide his escape and subsequent adventures, which, according to my in-game playtime, will take about five hours to complete.\n\nIt's a point and click adventure game, so expect a lot of that, however they've also thrown in some spacebar pressing to mix it up a bit. Pressing space will highlight clickable things on the map, and text color tells you what you've investigated and what you haven't (white - seen it, blue - haven't seen it). But the best thing about this game, gameplay-wise, is that in the options menu, there's a walk speed slider, which I recommend slapping against the right side as soon as you boot the game up.\n\nYou can rate the difficulty of puzzles in this game from "derp" to "how in God's name would I have figured that out without a guide (or Juan)?" and I'll admit eventually I just used  the really handy guide by LimiT in the Community Guides.\n\nGraphically the only complaint is that the game's made to be viewed in 800x600, and if you fullscreen the game, what you're going to get is a stretched out 800x600 with black bars on the side to keep the game at a 4:3. It's not that big of a deal and doesn’t actually ruin things, but people with big monitors might find it bothersome. Aside from that, though, this is a pretty game. The characters and story both fit the cartoony art style perfectly, and the voice acting makes a lot of not-indie games look really bad.\n\nBut is it worth playing? Definitely. It’s a well put together game in which I encountered no bugs, no glitches, no sudden day ruining crashes. My only real complaint is how ridiculous some of the puzzles can be (I mean really, if I didn’t have a guide, I never would have known what to do with the damn corn). Is it worth $9.99? Nope. Put this on your wishlist and wait for a Steam sale unless adventure games are your thing.","February 4, 2015","true","16.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It recalls fond memories of The Secret of Monkey Island, one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nPuzzles were mostly simple, though I'll admit I had to feed Juan the parrot a few crackers for hints on occasion. A few nice ideas streamlined the experience. First of all, holding down the Space Bar would highlight objects around the room that you could interact with. Also, the color of text hovering over objects changes color only if a new reaction will result.\n\nThe game has a fun sense of humor, and for some unknown reason I feel that pirates and dogs make a great combination.\n\nI highly recommended Jolly Rover to classic point and click adventure game fans, especially those fond of the Monkey Island series.","March 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fun story and characters.  I loved playing it.\n\nScale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved\n\nGame design: 4/5 The game is really tight and everything works well.  However, there are some extra things needed for 100% that you really have to guess at to accomplish.  You need to click everything in every scene twice before you move on to a new area of story because you can't go back, and that doesn't guarantee that you'll find everything because there's no reason for a lot of it.  It adds a little replayability because it's a short game, but that's a cheap tactic.\n\nTone: 5/5 Fun.  Cartoony.  Pirates.  Great things working great together.\n\nPersonal skew: 4/5 This is a pretty easy and short game.  If you are a hardcore point & click gamer who wants a challenge and for some reason you paid full price for this game, you'll probably feel pretty ripped off.  But for me this game was great fun.","July 22, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you liked games like Monkey Island, sure you will reasonably enjoy it.  Replay value is very limited unless you missed some of the achievements.  The voice acting was good, the puzzles were simple.  Its a game you play when you have played all the greats already.  Honestly I bought this game on sale, Its filler something you play between waiting for the return of the golden age of classic point of clicks. Which sadly is never going to come back again.

The game was also only about 4 hours long start to finish.\nJolly Rover is a Point 'n Click Adventure game which is similar to the Monkey Island series except every characters are dogs and puppies.\nThe puzzles are clever and not confusing at all. Most of them could be figured out without having to look up for guides as they are not random as other bad PnC Adventure games (e.g. Strong Bad).\nThe dialogues are humurous and are the best part of the game, but also the weakest part.

A good adventure game for beginners in this genre. The story is well written, graphics and details are suitible. Mainly casual, may take some thinking to figure out the puzzles, or can always use the parrot for hints (or answers if you're really stumped).  If you take the first hint w/o giving him any crackers, it won't disqualify you from the "Adventure Gamer" achievement. You have to find the collectibles on your own though, most are easier to find. Some are hidden in places that weren't there before.\n\nGreat, funny game for all to enjoy.\n\nI don't recommend kids play this game however.

The game is full of strange and bizarre characters; all of them are well voice acted and memorable. The game doesn’t cut corners when it comes to visual art either, the style feels unified and not out of place. The puzzle selections are diverse but sadly the game demands a too specific way to win. There are no branching storyline in this game. The developers clearly intended for that to happen because they included a talking parrot to guide the players in the event they are stuck. The game flows perfectly and the witty storyline fits in very well with the puzzles. Overall pretty average game, not nearly as good as Myst but not nearly as ♥♥♥♥ as the other indie puzzle clicker games.

I don't think this is a bad thing, it keeps the story focussed, without too many sidequests and distractions.\nThere's also plenty of hidden goodies to find, but if you're a good adventure player you'll already click on everything, so it shouldn't be too hard to find at least most of them.

There is voodoo magic that you learn throughout the game by mixing various symbols together, and is used pretty well as a puzzle mechanic without ever becoming overly complex.\n\nI enjoyed this mostly for the story and animation.

However, it still holds itself well in the adventure gaming market, with lots of impressive visual detail in its backgrounds and character animations.\n\nItem interactions and puzzles are very often straight-forward and obvious, though a few are actually truly clever. There is voodoo magic that you learn throughout the game by mixing various symbols together, and is used pretty well as a puzzle mechanic without ever becoming overly complex.\n\nI enjoyed this mostly for the story and animation.

First and foremost, is that you change the ♥♥♥♥ing speed at which your main character walks. Secondly, there's a really good hint system at work ranging from vague to explicit instructions and really helped alleviate the frustration which inevitably comes upon you when you can't work out what to do.\n\nA pretty cool collectible system which rewards you with concept art and music and a developer's commentary which I've yet to listen to when you finish the game.\n\nI think I got this for $5 when it was on special.

The "organic, intuitive" hint system is arbitrary at best, providing least help for difficult puzzles and excessive help for easy ones. It's also incapable of telling how much you have already solved.\n\nMuch worse than that is the terrible handling of an extremely interesting plot. Aside from terrible pacing and difficulty knowing where to go next at times for story progression, the most important and crucial revelations are revealed through sudden, unexpected dialogue options or unintuitive question choices. Solemn and important scenes are switched into humor or blase gameplay so quickly that you have no time to process the emotional signifigance. Certain questions arise about the main plot - huge questions - that are either answered in the bonus content or not at all.\n\nPuzzle answers are just obvious enough to frustrate the player when their solution fails to work and then are told by the hint system to do exactly what they've done. Some very interesting puzzles are handled so poorly that instead of admiring the system you curse whoever wrote it.\n\nScenes provide enormous eyecandy that you cannot interact with, and then numerous repeated items that you CAN click but have no point. Achieving 100% completeion takes either several playthroughs or use of a guide (I can confidently say I would never have finished without a guide due to the unintuitiveness of some puzzles), without content changing a bit. The bonus content is decent but not a selling point.\n\nAll told, this game is at best a sub-par, disappointing waste of great potential. Not terrible, but could just be so much better.","January 2, 2013","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Puzzles are mostly straightforward and the game is excessively generous with its hint system.  The game starts out a little underwhelming but once you get past the first zone it becomes quite a bit better.  Voice acting is passable, and the main character is a bit charming after awhile.  The biggest downfall of the game is probably that it isn't exceptionally amazing for a modern core gamer who expect a big wow factor, from graphics or production or epic story.  This isn't anything against it, it seems like a modest indie title and honestly it does nothing wrong.  It just means its not likely to get any amount of exposure.\n\nI found the game charming and had a good time with it, and again its quite family-friendly so take that as you will.  Lasts about 4 hours or so, with no performance issues or bugs.  A more scalable resolution would have been nice too.

(though each one is voiced not just text, so for some I suppose it could become annoying, however a simple click skips his speech).\nIf you like a bit of an adventure, collecting items and putting them together for a purpose, a bit of voodoo lol, or just the fact the game is based on pirates, I recommend this game to you!","June 23, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/58200/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","More or less a fairly wholesome and family friendly point and click game, with a pirate-dog theme.\n\nThere is no non-cartoon violence, only the mildest of sexual references, and one modest incident of swearing in the whole game.  Puzzles are mostly straightforward and the game is excessively generous with its hint system.  The game starts out a little underwhelming but once you get past the first zone it becomes quite a bit better.  Voice acting is passable, and the main character is a bit charming after awhile.  The biggest downfall of the game is probably that it isn't exceptionally amazing for a modern core gamer who expect a big wow factor, from graphics or production or epic story.  This isn't anything against it, it seems like a modest indie title and honestly it does nothing wrong.  It just means its not likely to get any amount of exposure.\n\nI found the game charming and had a good time with it, and again its quite family-friendly so take that as you will.  Lasts about 4 hours or so, with no performance issues or bugs.  A more scalable resolution would have been nice too.  Probably would have been something I played as a kid.","December 14, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You'll see some very inspired design visually and mechanically, you'll see some less inspired in the same category. Same with the writing / the humor. The voice acting for some characters is surprisingly great. It's quite short (playing time was @ 3 hours when I'd finished it first on Steam - I HAVE finished it before once, years and years ago, but retained almost no memory of the gameplay... apart from some vague memories about the voodoo mechanic, which might've knocked several minutes off the game time now I guess - but you won't mind. Unlocking the commentary might give an excuse to OCD-ish / completist players to do it all over again, especially since you'll likely miss (or, hopefully less likely, use) some of the crackers and the coins - which otherwise unlock music, art and character bios as you collect them. I'm not 100% sure I'd have done it if I hadn't missed the second to last coin in the game, but hey...\n\nAnyway, it's a fun little game, recommended to fans of the genre... and people who dig the idea of dog pirates and find it cute. :)","April 19","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
