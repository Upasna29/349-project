"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/404270/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Developer Realore’s claims that All My Gods is “a casual game like no other” are pretty much the biggest lie ever. There are dozens of other titles like this out there. It’s by no means a bad game, but there a number of quirks that bog the experience down and may make you want to think twice about purchasing it.\n\nThe plot here is based around the Roman pantheon of gods. You see, Saturn has decided to retire and his son is taking over. All of the gods — except for Mars — agree to help him out as he starts to build his own civilization. There’s a society to manage, fellow gods to appease, and a UFO to study. For some inexplicable reason, Mars really doesn’t like the young godling, but this conflict provides a number of dramatic moments in the narrative.\n\nAll My Gods is a fairly basic city-building sim that will feel instantly familiar to anyone who ever played titles like Sim City. You’re provided with an ongoing set of goals to accomplish as the game progresses, usually in the form of collecting certain resources, researching specific science type, or clearing out areas of territory to expand your civilization into. It’s all pretty standard stuff, but the technology progression trees are pretty solid, the controls are easy to learn, and the game is fun enough that it’ll keep you hooked for a few hours. However, it should be noted that the gameplay is incredibly slow and the hand-holding quest assignments start to get old after a while.\n\nAside from different types of food and building materials, your civilization accumulates mana that you use to perform miracles. This sounds way more impressive than it is, honestly. Miracles largely consist of you using a “god hand” tool to quickly harvest extra raw materials in exchange for mana. Miracles are useful when you need to snag extra resources within a certain amount of time, but there’s not really much of a point to them otherwise.\n\nPerforming miracles is actually one of the most surreal parts of the game. Every time you do something divine, nearby worshippers make a lot of comments to show their appreciation of your heavenly greatness. It’s just bizarre to know that you’re playing a Roman god and see statements like “Mana from Heaven!” and “Hosanna!” appear all over the place.\n\nInstead of a top-down view like with so many other city-building games, you’re treated to an isometric perspective. However you’re stuck with only one angle, since the camera can’t seem to be rotated. This is really frustrating after a while, because it’s next to impossible to select plots of land that are behind your buildings. It’s too bad that the camera is so limited, because the game’s graphics are actually really lovely: Environments look hand-painted, while characters are all nicely designed and well-animated.\n\nAll My Gods is fine but — aside from some lovely graphics and some fun plot points— it doesn’t really stand out from the crowd of other sim games. It’s a little too slow and simple to really hold dedicated genre fans’ attention, but it does feel like this could be a really great title for younger gamers thanks to its easy-to-learn controls and minimal difficulty. If any of this sounds like it might be fun, definitely check out the game.","February 15","true","16.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/recommended/404270/","Terracorex","Terracorex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/","4078 products in account","Quaint city builder where you are trying to win the approval of all the Roman gods in order to become a god yourself.  I completed the game in about 5 hours.  The game gives you quests that first act as a tutorial and then as general guidance.  As part of the story, you keep courting Venus, which pisses Mars off and gets his mommy Hera involved.  This has the effect of making the game become a bit tedious towards the end.  You have to keep putting out fires from Mars tantrums and repair buildings from Hera's thunder fits.\n\nThe problem is that you end up having a lot of buildings all crammed together since space is somewhat precious, especially in the beginning.   Trying to spot which building needs to have a fire put out or be repaired gets to be a somewhat trying after a few hours of Mars and Hera attacks.  The sooner you can get the Trojan horse at the East most point of the map, the better, since that finally quiets Mars down.  Then Hera can be calmed down with a large enough bribe.\n\nThis means you need to have at least the trading post and lot of the production buildings going so you can have a constant export of trade.  Once you have this in place, and later get the port, you have pretty much an endless source of gold.  I highly recommend to build as many shrines and temples, fully upgraded, as soon as you can.  Nothing beats being able to scoop whatever resources you happen to need whenever you want.  Having enough little devoted followers means your divine mana replenishes very quickly.   Towards the end I was pretty much spamming the divine hand whenever I need it.  This was very unlike the beginning where you have to be very conservative with how you use it since initially it takes forever to refill.\n\nOverall, this game was fairly enjoyable.  It doesn't really have any replay value once you finish it, since it really doesn't have much depth in terms of strategy.  Once you understand what you need to do, there really isn't much of a challenge.  The fun aspect to playing this game in this discovery of what each of the buildings do, and then the final challenge in building each of the seven wonders.","November 7, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I kept waiting for the tutorial to be over but it turned out to be one big tutorial you can't lose.\n\nIt probably takes about 3 hours to complete (I was regularly away from my PC while it was still running thus 6 hours displayed).\n\nIt has achievements you unlock through the menu, yet they don't have them through Steam nobody can see I 100% completed this "game".\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game at any price, I only finished it because I knew I was halfway through by the time I realised the tutorial was the entire game. It didn't help that the last 20 minutes was just grinding out points to buy temples.\n\ntldr; don't buy this, if it's already too late when you see this, click the hand of God quickly. You can get multiple returns that register as one click.","February 21","false","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Standard, settlers/civ-ish game with resources, buildings, and researched technologies.  Things I didn't like, though: (1) no challenge, you can walk away from the game at any time, come back, and there'll be nothing that could go wrong, (2) some of the tasks, like "find the striking worker" or "find the damaged building," were repetitive, required no administrative thinking, and happened all too often, (3) an entire civ-esque game, and there's only one map?  And it's the small map in the tutorial mission?  If those three things were fixed, I'd pay a lot more than $3 for it.","November 8, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No one ever dies and you cannot lose. You build a city and complete quests. You godly power helps a bit. It feels like a cheat at first, but it's rather annother ressource which slowly refills then used. The game starts with a tutorial, and immediately after the tutorial the game is at its weakest moments. You have to wait quite a lot for stuff to finish. That gets a lot better, because later in the games there are a lot of corners where you can do something. I'm a big fan of casual games, and All My Gods is the best I have been playing this year. The story is not very deep, but the building of the city is really fun. Most casual games I've tried this year prevent fun by implementing a slow process and introducting coins/gems/whatever to speeden up things. That only helps temporarily. All My Gods is ok with buying it once and then actually playing and liking the game.  I love All My Gods and I will replay it from time to time.","December 13, 2015","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before I got it, I was afraid it was time based (seeing the bar at the top), that you only had so much time to complete thing. Fortunately it's not, so you go at your own pace.\n\nThe tutorial is good, it teaches you the basics and the rest you get to figure out, partial on your own, partially thru quests.\n\nYou play a aspiring god, your goal is to win the approval of the other gods. basically it's mostly construction and not whole lot of waiting. I tend to get bored with games when there's just too much waiting, fortunately this one doesn't suffer from that.\n\nAs the story goes, everytime you gain more favor with Venus, Mars gets more upset and causes fires, which you have to put out. And then Hera also causes destruction. You get to a point with this that Mars wants 2k and Hera wants 5k every 5 minutes which is impossible. However after you get past this point, you start earning more money then you can possible spend where as most of the game you're struggling to make money.\n\nOn the downside, you can't rotate your buildings, so you often spend time rearraging your building for the best possible fit. Nor did I see the option to grow new trees, eventually you run out of trees to chop and have to use mana get wood. Regardless of how many lumberjack houses you build, you'll only get +5 wood. Other thing I didn't like is you can't stop production on any buildings so you are force to sell excess stocks.\n\nFound a bug where you're tasked with repairing a damaged build, however you can't find it or there's no building to repair. There was no floating icon indicating the building needs to be repaired. Spent an hour looking for it until I gave up and it really didn't seem to impact me any.\n\nWhen you're in the middle of casting a spell, a popup tends to ovelay and you can't cancel the spell so you end up wasting mana on a act you don't want to do: once you click you to acknowledge you also cast at the same time.\n\nYour economy tends to fluctuate alot for unknown reasons. All of a sudden food production dips into the negatives no matter how many of that building you build, then later on it just magically goes into to the positive without building any buildings.\n\nI don't really don't see any replay value in the game once you go thru it. Took me about 5 hours to complete. But i stil lenjoyed it.  I have to say though I don't find many games that deserve a positive review.","January 19","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
