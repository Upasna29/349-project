Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","3.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This was one of my favorite games for the computer at the time, up there with Insaniquarium and Snail Mail. Solid gameplay, easy to play, difficult to master, much like most Pop Cap games. It is a crime how overlooked this game is. Buy it now.","February 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has aged, but not exactly gracefully. It's not horrible either. But it just isn't really good either.\n\nFor 5€, it's too little. I bought it in the Popcap Bundle, so it was alright, I guess?\n\nStill, for demanding 5€ and then giving you relatively monotonous gameplay... it's too much money. It's just too much for so little actually happening. That's why I wouldn't recommend buying this game.\n\nOh, and just for the sake of completion: You play as one of four heroes to save the Iggles, a race of furry little creatures color-coded and caught in bubbles by some kind of evil force. Yeah. That's the sum of it. You move through a little labyrinth, collect the Iggles, avoid the baddies, and send the Iggles home with the approrpiate home fields.\n\nAnd... that's it. For 101 levels in Adventure mode. Yay.","March 4, 2015","false","9.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"
