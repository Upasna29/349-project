It was difficult, unforgiving, and unfair for the entire game. It was very glitchy, had a crash or two, and was full of aimless wandering. But it was all worth it in the end. As with most psychological thrillers, the game liked to toy with you in every way, by forcing you to endure absolute horror, figure out impossible puzzles, and continue living knowing that everything around is both a lie and is out to get you. CoC DCotE was grandly successful in using Lovecraft's style of horror, by making you wonder whether or not what you are seeing is real. Did a Deep One just kill that guy? Or did the protaginist kill that guy and only imagined the Deep One? With how often you are alone and surrounded by myths and crazy people, how can you be sure that what you're seeing is really what is happening? You face Fishmen, Deep Ones, a Shoggoth, Flying Polyps, Dagon, Hydra, Servants of Cthulhu, and other such creatures found in Lovecraft's tales as you play through a fantastic reimagining of Shadow Over Innsmouth.\n\nBecause of how this game tortured me with constant insanity, endless questions, aimless wandering, failure, difficulty, bugs, and doubt, I probably won't play through this again for a long time. It was a terrifying journey but it was worth it just to finish the game and experience the atmosphere that is Call of Cthulhu.\n\nI go now, for the images that haunt my dreams are too much torture to handle. Everything this game had forced me through was too much. The questions, the wonders, the idea that there may in the future be a sequel, I just cannot handle the stress. So after I have cataloged my experience, I will throw myself to the streets below this home, before the creatures can find me and pressure me into attempting to aquire an A rank through the game. I hear them now. Buy this game, see what I have seen, and you will finally understand. They're at the door now! Scratching! Pounding! I just want it to end! The window! The window!","July 4, 2015","true","28.8"," 211 of 215 people (98%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","98","211","215","66","6"

Crashes, blackscreens, the famous cliffbug, oh man. Win XP was the only OS able to properly play this game. Many bugs appeared for Win 7 users, especially the famous cliffbug. Halfway through the game, you get to play a really nice atmospheric creepy boat scene, one of the objectives is to shoot down the fishmen sorcerers on the cliffs with the front cannon. Sadly you can´t see any of these sorcerers and you are not able to shoot them. There is a program to fix this problem though. I will post the link to it down at the bottom of my review. So, it´s a bugfest mkay, why am I still recommending this game to you? If not the steam version, or if it is the steam version why am I still recommending it? Because it´s a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic game if you have patience, a sense for atmosphere and if you are able to use that brain of yours. Because you might need it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nYou play as Jack Walters, private detective. One day you get called to help out in a serious nutcase shootout. You enter the building and you find the nutcases talking to you like they know you. You find something very dark and menacing deep down the house in the basement and you turn insane. You are now in an asylum, you get cured and can continue your work as a detective. You still look for answers what happened back there down in the basement, but of course you still have to continue your work as a private detective. Making a living. You get a new case, a boy named Brian Burnham is gone missing in a dark creepy fishermans town called Innsmouth.The story is told very well, it´s very immersive and the characters are good. It does a good job telling an actual adventure and letting you feel like you went through an adventure at the end of the game, just like the metro games. Really, really great. I intentionally shortened the prologue. I personally dislike getting too much info even if it´s just the prologue by reading reviews.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game is unique... and if I say unqiue, I mean unique. The health system is based upon real time healing. Meaning: If you get shot at the leg, you have to go to your inventory and pick the spot you got shot at and leave the inventory. Walters will bandage himself then for couple of seconds. You have to be careful and manage to get as little damage as possible or else you run out of medical supplies or you have to bandage yourself and pursuers are going to hunt you down quickly. This also means real life effects and insanity effects. White and black screen as soon as you run out of blood (blood loss). Or you get shot with a shotgun in the legs, meaning you walk like a cripple until you fixed it. You have an inventory but it´s not annoying unlike Fallout 4 or such crap, you don´t have any inventory management at all really. You have your tiles but there are always enough as each tile is for one thing. The inventory is for applying medicine and checking ammo and such or taking certain things and use them for progress. It´s kept simple and useful.\nToo much psychic stuff makes you wanna do suicide if you are unlucky. You need to maintain your sanity at some scenes and you are a slow walker, meaning you can´t run in this game.... for the sake of the few script sequences and tension. It doesn´t affect immersion that much. Even though walters running animation is slow as ♥♥♥♥ it´s fast enough to be able to make it past all the faster sequences.\nGUNS! Well, the guns recoil tends more into the realistic category, you have no HUD, it´s a purist game. Arm sway, weapon sway, etc.. No HUD, no ammo counter, no health indicator. You know you have 31 rounds left? Better count your shots, cause realism is often meant to be taken seriously in this game. Lots of arm sway and delay during aiming, the aiming with mouse is still smooth and accurate though. You have to play carefully. To understand what I mean, it´s like in Red Orchestra. Everyone who played Red Orchestra, knows what I mean with arm sway. Spongy controls. Or like in The Darkness I. Games who take a more realistic approach in gameplay have this. Mirrors Edge, Red Orchestra, etc. The game paces very nicely, it´s overall a mix out of stealth parts, which not always work, and shootouts. There are many riddles to be solved in order to advance. In one mission you have to get a car working and while "he" fixes it, "you" get your ♥♥♥ moving trying to get that "special item" for him from the police stations safe. You have to combine many things or use things you acquired earlier in the game in order to progress. The game was complicated in the ending riddles and it gave you some options, either you sneak or you go in guns blazing, either you rescue her or you let her die. These decisions have no impact on the story though. The game really wants to force the detective out of you and uses many mean tricks in order to make you go batshit crazy. It really is hard sometimes. The game is not for casuals at all! It´s very challenging and overly complicated at some points and you need to have patience. There´s one scene in this game I want to mention though: "the marsh refinery end sequence". In this sequence you have after easily 30 min progress, no checkpoints or saves. Mark my words and make sure you look it up before playing any further. Right after you burned the entity and you can finally go to the secret shrine, look at a playthrough and remember the place you need to place the pillar with the gem on it in order to open the door before the time runs out. You will know what I mean as soon as you experienced that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ scene once. ^^´\n\n\nGame Length:\n\nThis game is so immersive, and has such a extreme intense atmosphere, time flies by so fast that you might wanna know how long it takes. Average 12 hrs. Depending on your playstyle and the time you need to get through.... slow pace... lots of idle internet research, bug fixing.... 18 hrs even maybe? 12 hrs for sure though.\n\n\nCRASHES, BUGS:\n\nThe crash after the manhunt savepoint, the cliffbug and the anti aliasing problem, the ladder crash.\nThe game crashes randomly at one save point and a ladder in the beginning of the game: It´s due to resolution and anti alising. Try through every possible setting, turn off the anti aliasing. Try a 4:3 resolution without any AA, it should work then. You can turn back the settings to 16:9 and AA as soon as you got past it.\n\nThe cliffbug can be fixed by using a program you find here:\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/tv29p48b54ul2j4/CoCDCotE+BugFixer.zip\n\nIt´s my personal file I kept on my "Cheats & Fixes Folder for older games." I uploaded it for you since I couldn´t find the original source anymore.\nIt skips the three waves and automatically kills the sorcerers and has many other features.\nNOTE: I´m not sure about the compatibility of the bugfixer. It works with the latest official patch though, which steam has.\n\nUNOFFICIAL PATCH GUIDE:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113168887&tscn=1422625062","October 4, 2014","true","14.7"," 174 of 191 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","174","191","4","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/22340/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","For the obvious, Call of Cthulhu is a game inspired by Lovecraft. It's called Call of Cthulhu, but that's more of a marketing thing, as Cthulhu actually plays a very little role in the title. The game is more about a few of Lovecraft's other novels, the most notable one being Shadow Over Innsmouth. However, if you don't know the difference between a Cthulhu and a Dagan or a Xa'ligha, that's okay as the game doesn't expect you to know these things, as you play as a character who knows nothing about these things either.\n\nCall of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person horror-adventure game. It has elements of a first-person shooter, an adventure game, and a survival-horror game. It's also a really tough cookie, it's not an easy game, and there is a legitimate survival element, as well as a few tough puzzles, and some pretty fantastic atmosphere and scares.\n\nYou play as a man named Jack Walters, who's a detective. The game starts with a prologue section when Jack helps a local police force he's acquainted with break into a house run by a group of cultists. They're shooting-up the police... However, when Jack infiltrates, the cultists don't seem to be hostile towards him, but rather actually welcome him with open arms, as they commit a mass-suicide ritual. And when he enters the basement, he witnesses something strange, and everything becomes a blur. He becomes conscious six years later, when he finds out he spent the last six years in a mental asylum. He has no memory of this time, and to him he was just at the cultists house. He of course is really curious about this time, but tries to resume his detective agency. He receives a letter and takes on the requested case to investigate a missing persons report of a Brian Burnham, a man who tried to start a grocery store chain in a nearby coastal town of Innsmouth. He goes to investigate.\n\nGameplay has a lot of variety, and fantastic pacing for the most part if you can accept it moves at a bit of a slower pace, a more slow-burn type of game (which benefits it rather than hurts it, I feel). The game has sections of exploration and interaction with townspeople. You actually have a big portion of the game at the beginning when you're defenseless, and have to master skills of stealth, evasion, and survival with taking advantage of the environment and lowly tools you have that are hardly murder weapons. There's puzzles, both in the on-the-fly gameplay sort and the 'need to solve this puzzle to continue' variety. And the game isn't full of scripted scenarios either (though a few do exist), so a lot of the survival has to be taken from your own wits and cleverness.\n\nSurvival is important. Gun bullets don't graze you, they can seriously damage you. The game has a mechanic where you bleed when shot, as well as where you are shot effects your damage reaction to being shot. You heal it with limited healing items you get, some to stop bleeding or mend wounded appendages, others to recover blood and health. You also need to be careful as some weapons can inflict poisoning on you to recover from. Eventually you do get a gun though, but the game hardly becomes a run-and-gun, you have to be really strategic and know when to let-go of being undetected to fire, and which enemies are really worth taking out. You have limited ammo, and the enemies can seriously kick your ♥♥♥ if you're not careful.\n\nBut the game isn't all about combat and stealth. There also are areas and levels with almost no enemies at all, and some fantastic horror scenes, strange sanity moments, and just some atmosphere and sequences that go in very different directions. The character also has a sanity feature, which makes it so the more he's around unpleasent things, the more weird things may become for him. Certain areas, imagery, and the like help his sanity, while others break it.\n\nThe game also has some memorizing music, graphics are obviously a bit outdated but do the job, and as the game continues, situations open up a lot more to how you can approach them. And the game continues adding new elements, additions, and set-piece like moments all the way through to the end to prevent it from becoming too much of the same, and leaving you to continually wonder what might be coming next. It's pacing can be argued is slow, but I think works very well for the title and what its trying to achieve.\n\nI also can mention that this game I would label as a scary game, it is absolutely tense a lot of the time, and some segments legitimately scared the crap out of me. But part of the way it pulls this off is that they're not over-abundant or consistent, and don't rely on the same few tricks or overly on cheap scares.\n\nThere is some jank here though, with some bugs, sometimes you may be detected by enemies when they really shouldn't of detected you, and there's a few frustrating parts of the game that are kind of trial-and-error, where basically you need to do what the game wants you to do or you'll die. There are some fan patches to address some of these issues, however. On a similar note, the game has some bugs for Windows 7 users, as the game was designed around Windows XP. I suggest doing some homework before you play the game to find some fan patches that fix a number of issues on newer machines, make some trial-and-error parts of the game easier, and make the game look better graphically.\n\nIt's not perfect, but I do think it's a good horror title, and worth checking out if you either have interest in horror games or Lovecraft mythos (as its mine and many others personal favorite Lovecraftian-inspired game). It does require some patience though, but there is an excellent experience here if you enjoy this sort of thing.","April 18, 2014","true","16.6"," 127 of 135 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","127","135","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CannonFodder52/recommended/22340/","CannonFodder52","CannonFodder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CannonFodder52/","533 products in account","Pretty good game if you like the FpsSurvivalHorror (Amnesia/penumbra) type genre. The game kinda falls apart near the end since the developer went under mid development, but it actually manages to still make it worth slugging through the publisher/dev mess to see some of the most frightening moments in any video game to date.\n\nTo get more in depth, as previously stated this game is legitimately scary and that is honestly something that is hard to achieve in a video game. There is one specific instance where you are frantically trying to escape and barricade the path behind you as you flee from the Gilman Hotel. This specific moment is a recreation of an exact event from the short story "The Shadow Over Insmouth" by HP lovecraft. The game is set in his universe and most of it takes place in the town of that story Innsmouth, a New England port town.\nIf you are looking for a shooter or a Triple A game look elsewhere now.\nThis game really excels in the first few hours before you obtain a weapon to defend yourself. Jack(you) struggles to find out what is going on in this very desolate port town, talking to some of the more sane residents etc.\nNow I am no game historian but its possible this game may have had the first sanity meter (mechanic now used in Amnesia for example). Either way the first thing you will notice when you launch this game up is the lack of a hud, everything is dealt with in a debatably more engaging way. Your character starts to visibly freak out if you stare at a rotting corpse, the screen might start turning a shade of grey if you are bleeding out. All of these work to immerse the player into the game's world.\n\nThe gameplay is a combination of puzzles and action, I cant really say the puzzles stand out but I mean they didn't in Amnesia either and people love that game to death. The gun play on the other hand is pretty awful, the hit registration feels very floaty sort of similar to the first metro 2033. The enemies die in a seemingly random number of bullets also registered hits feel sloppy and like there is weight behind them. While a person looking at this game is probably not interested in how good the gun play is, I have to warn you the second half of the game really does force it upon you.\nOn the topic of sloppiness, this game is buggy as all hell. It was to my knowledge finished in some devs basement after the studio went under. Bethesda did end up publishing it, although they didn't really update it after launch.\n\nThe town you explore around, the frantic set piece moments and the hp lovecraft world make this game from disaster into a buggy gem that deserves way more recognition that it ever got. Oddly enough PC Gamer did manage to sneak it onto their top 100 PC games of all time list at #87, so maybe people wont forget this game after all.\n\nTo wrap this up. If you are a fan of the first person perspective horror game genre, HP lovecraft or you like a gamble pick this game up. For others you might want to watch some gameplay videos and judge for your self.","November 1, 2013","true","29.2"," 96 of 102 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","96","102","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG00se/recommended/22340/","RadioG00se","RadioG00se","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG00se/","498 products in account","The plot is essentially the H.P. Lovecraft novel "Shadows over Innsmouth", which means that the story is genuinely very good. The graphics are fairly dated, as it is nearly 10 years old by now, but this doesn't stop the game from having its scary moments.\n\nA lot of what this game does right is that it does not show you what the danger is, all it really tells you is that there is a danger. The way it achieves this is by having your character suffer from odd visions where you can see through the eyes of your enemies. This can vary from having a vision of guards walking in an area up ahead, to a vision of something quickly gaining on you. I found this mechanic worked extremely well and was probably my favourite part of this game. There are other horror mechanics in this game that work well too, such as the implementation of a sanity system. If you stare at a body or a horrific scene for too long your character starts to freak out a little, with your vision blurring or with your character rambling about something out to get him.\n\nAt the halfway mark the horror elements start to disappear, which is fine as you are armed to the teeth. The game switches from a survival-horror game to an action-horror game at this point, leaning more towards action than horror.\n\nThe enemies in this game vary from angry towns folk to crazed flying wind demons, so it has a decent enemy variety. It also has 4 or 5 boss fights, which can be quite challenging. There's also a large variety of weapons, about 10 I believe.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one major issue with this game: Bugs.\nSo many bugs.\nMost of them are not game breaking, and they can vary from peoples sentences cutting out half way through, to opening your inventory only to have your game crash. There are a few game breaking bugs I came across, fortunately there is a fan made patch to resolve a few. One bug I experienced I could not find a solution for, and whats even worse is that it happened at the final boss too. I tried to beat the boss about 8 times but kept experiencing the bug so I was forced to give up and watch the ending on youtube.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great game that is unfortunately plagued by bugs. I'd give it a 9/10 but the bugs bring it down to about a 7/10.","September 4, 2015","true","15.2"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","57","59","3","0"

What a pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt took me 8 years to beat this damn game. I had it when it came out in 2007, the game crashed so many times, I never got to level 7.\n\nAfter years of being on Steam unplayed, I gave it another shot. There has since been an unofficial patch which fixed many issues.\n\nThe game had something about it that I kept wanting to play. It's very immersive, there is no HUD or reticle. You have a simple inventory system with virtually no management to it. Gunplay isn't too bad, you can use iron sights or hip-fire. Your accuracy decreases if you hold out your gun too long aiming.\n\nThe game has a sanity system which is not a hinderance whatsoever. If you see a crazy scene like weird creatures or a dead body, if you literally look at it too long, your vision goes a little blurry and you start going nuts. Your character talks to himself such as "What am I doing here?"\n\nOnce, my guy shot himself looking at a crazy scene because I had my gun out staring at the body too long. It happened once years back. It doesn't continue to happen over and over causing frustration but adds a bit of stress and anxiety.\n\nI do recommend it but with the assumption you're okay with some buggy games. Personally, STALKER was way more glitchy on a newer rig than Call of Cthulhu.\n\nReally makes me want to try Amnesia.\n\nFun game, some parts are a pain in the ♥♥♥ because there are so many places to go in certain areas, it's almost trial and error. Once I got past this area I wasn't supposed to get past, but I didn't die so it worked. I could have skipped an hour in the end but I'm sure it would have crashed.\n\nIf you use the patch and you decide to use cheats (guns at the beginning of levels) just know that if you kill anyone when you aren't supposed to have a weapon, when you go to the new area the game straight up crashes. Things like that.\n\nWITH THE PATCH, IT WAS COMPLETELY PLAYABLE.\n\nWow, 8 years to beat this yet I am still recommending it.","June 22, 2015","true","23.4"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","51","55","5","0"

From numerous random game crashes and falling through the game world several times, to an unfinishable ending sequence (on modern hardware) without editing game files; this is easily the most buggy and glitch-ridden game I have ever played [Note: While the community has released numerous patches that reduce the amount of glitches that occur, this is still not enough to warrant not giving this aspect of the game a negative score.]\n- The gun gameplay is mediocre at best, with indications of the damage you inflict on enemies and take yourself being vague to say the least.\n\n\nVerdict\n“Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a unique experience.

However, the biggest issue is that this Steam version is terrible.\n\nI played the game when it first came out and loved it, never had issues with it. Then I bought this Steam version to experience it again. But things are broken in that the game crashes at just about every corner, lags without FPS drop (and it lags WITH an FPS drop--two different symptoms) despite being such an old game, and drops sound occasionally.\n\nI've tried patching the game but to no avail. So, I'm incredibly irritated at the moment, as I'm currently only like 1.5 hours into the game really (despite having played for like 4) and currently my game keeps crashing and exiting when I'm trying to finish a level. Each time I walk through a doorway, the executable crashes.\n\nThe game itself is good in that it is atmospheric. There's no HUD (and to my memory, it was one of the earlier games of this type to ditch the HUD) and tries to really draw you in. And you don't really get weapons for a good while, so you're mostly meant to sneak and be afraid. Your character can go insane too, so it makes things even more difficult but also fun. Plus, I like Lovecraft.\n\nAnyway, the game is good but dated. If you're going to give it a try, however, do not get this version.

The camera and audio effects tied to "sanity", the many scripted in-engine cutaways for notable scenes and events, its being in the classic Cthulhu setting and time period along with varied gameplay (obviously firstperson ranged and melee combat but also environment and inventory puzzles, platforming and also mandatory and othertimes optional stealth) revolving around a developed narrative with elaborative backstory material strewn about in the form of journals, letters, books and miscellania.  All well presented visually and audibly in an adequate (for it's time and still decent) engine.\n\nI'd have loved to experience the fullness of the creators vision, it's a shame this is reputed to be truncated.\n\nIt could have used some more polish and some of the small deficiencies include   difficulty (this can be changed in Options however)\nthe game can only be saved at save points (and they are sometimes sparsely placed)\nammo scarcity (although this is likely by design catering to the horror genre)\nsome of the puzzle solving requires copious running back and forth (agonizing sometimes if trying to stealth!)\nthe stealth system gives you little feedback as to whether you are close to being detected other than trial and (lots of) error (although in time I got the hang of it)\nthe terrain sometimes allows you to traverse vertically and when something other than a ladder is the visual cue this is not always apparent\nsome of the puzzle points and objects are not easy to locate or identify (but this is generally true of all games with puzzle components)\n\nPersonally I really enjoyed it but can understand the frustrations of those hung up by bugs.  *Spoilers ahead.*\nI had to use the unofficial patch to get past the ocean faring level (the chanters) and then at the end the patch didn't work for the escape but setting the cpu affinity to one core allowed me to finish.\nIf you don't understand what I just refered to and don't have the patience to research it if you run into bugs then you should think twice before purchasing this title. But if you think you can overcome the technical hurdles and aren't dissuaded by last-gen visuals you will get to experience a very immersive mystery/horror/adventure game that isn't afraid to try things that other games haven't done already.\n\nAs to what the game does well, it was able to ellicit some authentic dread at times and that is a rarity for myself.   The ambiance contributes to this from the very beginning and creates a feeling of isolation, unwelcome, and heightened suspicion amongst strangers that is very apropos.  You encounter this from the initial embarkment but things continue to ramp up; the pace of exposure to negative mental stimuli was very measured and carefully crafted throughout the whole.   The sound scape contributes a lot to this and is excellent thoughout (ambient sounds, footsteps, combat sounds, enemy sounds, environment sounds, etc).  A nice touch are the sounds (and dialog) that greets you as you exit the game to the menu (and this varies).  Some bit characters are merely adequately voiced but the voice acting is on balance very good, particularily with the recurring cast.  The level maps are unique thoughout and a lot of care and detail was given to each due to the many scripted events and having the map reflect progressions in the plot.  It takes sometime before you move beyond the general local of the beginning of the game but once you do it changes much more frequently, however the duration in the first locale is plot dependent and makes the change of location a median acheivement of the game as a whole.  The second half is difficult to describe without spoilers, let's just say it's quite a journey.   Visually I would call it adequate to good, the character models and textures are generally last-gen looking but are decent.  There are definately some crazy moments in the game and the visual do not get in the way from creating the desired effects in the player (imo).\n\nFor those who know how to do so this game can benefit from an ENB and/or SweetFX profile/s.  I can attest both can work.\n\nOverall it is a unique game that despite some drawbacks offers a singular experience.  I highly recommend it!","October 15, 2014","true","15.7"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","2"

Rendering isn't perfect, this game has a few bags(sometimes they are very annoying, like a bug in the 7 chapter with invisible targets or an error, which doesn’t allow you to finish the game), but a story is exciting, interesting: unexpected events impress me, i should keep an eye on an every dialogue.\nCOC comprises puzzles, which arent very difficult, but they can take 5-10 min.\nAn atmosphere in the COC soaked with dusk, macabre sounds and fear.\nThis game contains action and stealth. In a few missions you have to use your weapon and your serpentine tricks.\nI ought to mention that system of health is realistic: you took damage in a leg then you slower, you took a hit in a hand then you shoot slower. Sanity is valuable:for example, if you are scared you can not move or rotate with  normal speed. There you can even fail a mission: mass sanity failure.\nAn idea of the seaside city and of the taint in him was realized. There a lot of facts, which specify on a lovecraft’s innsmouth(persons, buildings). But a story line in a game and in a lovecraft’s work are quite different.\nA genre of this game ranges between detective, horror and shooter(not like cod or cs).\nI can conclude that COC should be rewarded with applause and the highest rank.

It's primarily based off of The Shadow over Innsmouth, but it also mixes in elements from other Lovecraft stories. The first three or four hours of it are where most of the game's best moments are, spending plenty of time building atmosphere and leaving you defenseless, and once you get guns the game somewhat loses its horror aspect (though it does maintain the atmosphere pretty well), but if you use DCoTE Patch and check the option to unlock all difficulties from the start, playing on the hardest difficulty can be a lot of fun in that it makes both you and the enemies fairly fragile and encourages you to rely on stealth and resource conservation.\n\nUnfortunately, age hasn't done this game any favors, and in my latest playthrough it was even more broken than the last time I played it. You'll almost certainly need to use DCoTE Patch to skip the game-breaking bugs, and you may encounter a few more crashes here and there, particularly when you minimize the game. You can get DCoTE Patch here http://dcotetools.sucklead.com/p/dcotepatch.html , but you might want to read up on the guide in the Steam Community section for the game to get instructions on getting it all worked out since it doesn't work with the default Steam version of the game's exe.

(Unless you're going to hunt for other people's saved games, to beat the game.)\n\nThere are lots of technical issues, caused by hastily done porting from Xbox: sound cutting off; frequent crashes on high resolutions, which force to switch to lower ones (in particular, 800x600 with 4x anti-aliasing); eyes get very tired from 20-30 minutes of gameplay as everything is so blurry and because of certain graphical effects; sometimes crashes or gets stuck in the same situations every time but thankfully there are workarounds and solutions for most of the problems. Somewhere around 3/4 from the game, the game can't be beaten because of a graphical glitch, and it has no solution other than loading someone else's saved game.\n\nIn overall, the game is quite intense and terrifying at the beginning, but as soon as you get a pistol, it turns into a Call of Duty: Dark Corners of the Earth, mixed with a little bit of stealth and survival, which is added just to be there.\n\nAll the frightening and exciting moments you can count by fingers on one hand, the rest is irritation from bugs, trying to figure out what to do next, typical shooter gameplay and, well, raging the hell out every time you die and have to retry again.","December 7, 2013","false","16.6"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","28","49","2","0"

I started off hating it mostly because of the bugs and glitches. I will say the game is really enjoyable and is a true horror game throughout. For the time even, the graphics are not top-notch but it does not take away from the experience. I feel like if it was remade or the graphics were updated, I would enjoy it even more. I feel like the sounds and environment certainly do add to the horror theme and adds suspense or fear when needed. I think the things I can complain about, besides the bugs, is the insane thought process behind the puzzles. Who the hell would think to do this or that but nope, that is the right thing to do. So, I found myself constantly looking at a walkthrough because I got stuck a lot. I think the puzzles are the most difficult part of the game and I think the difficulty of the combat spikes a couple times. There is a couple bosses and a few instances that are unfair because of what weapons you have and the bosses can just be a problem like not knowing how to kill them. Other than that and the bugs, I would recommend this game, it is definitely worth playing through once. It is a great horror game that is not that well known and I think true horror fans should give it a chance.

CoC (that abbrv...sorry kids) is pretty cool when it comes to the story. The characters are nice enough and the story is compelling enough where I spent a great all-nighter enthralled in the fruits of this adventure game meant to be played in the dark...only to find when the sun rose outside the game wasn't as scary. Still the fact that I stayed up THAT late playing this game made it lovely enough for my books!\n\nHowever, I think this game is OK to pass up if you're looking for a horror game to $h1t your pants. There are a lot of moments where I couldn't take CoC seriously as a horror game. Sometimes I didn't really know WHAT kind of game I was playing, and a lot of story elements made me question whether it was actually possible for ANYONE to get scared by these things.\n\nThis was also a 2006 game with probable 2001 quality.\n\nIf you get this game from a humble bundle, or a Steam sale pack, give it a go! It's not a totally crap game, and despite the bugs, and gut-wrenching unpolished nature of the game, I DID want to play this the second I got home from work. It was compelling enough!!!! Although the story isn't AMAZING, and although gameplay is a little shoddy, there are some gems I think opimistic gamers can appreciate with this game, there is certainly a soul this game has that not a lot of others have.\n\nBy the game-breaking bugs/crashes alone, and annoying unpolished nature...I would say to PASS it up. But besides that, I don't think it's completely crap, so if you happen to find this in your library (and can ignore a few flaws), give it a go! You will have a nice 10+ hours...if you don't go insane!","June 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game features you running through very similar locations that are in Lovecraft's own works doing a variety of things such as shooting spawns of Dagon and Fishmen to using stealth to avoid detection altogether (you are very weak and rightfully so) to even solving some basic puzzles. So how is the game if your not a fan of Lovecraft or just have little knowledge on the subject, but think it sounds interesting and cool? Well...it kinda is and still holds up in that regard as well because it still makes for a very underrated action/adventure/stealth type of game.\n\nIt is worth noting that you will probably experience some issues while starting up this game, but checking on the steam forum under this game and you will find your solution rather easy. It IS a Bethesda game after all, so you should expect lots of bugs by now :P","December 10, 2013","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naithzor/recommended/22340/","naithzor","Gooby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naithzor/","218 products in account","Call of Cthulhu is an astonishing game, unlike anything you have every played before. It's a psycho-horror game from 2006, and what it lacks in graphics is tens of times weighted up by the gameplay. This game creates a thrill on the same level as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and some of the levels are even more intense and makes you even more scared. You dont have any weapons half of the game, or bullets scattered around to help you. This is why I find Call of Cthulhu so much more enjoyable than games like Dead Space and F.E.A.R. Those are all "jumpscares", and in these games, when you first have spotted the enemy, you can fill them up with bullets. This is not the case in Call of Cthulhu. In this game you have to sneak around, and if you're spotted - you're ♥♥♥♥ed. The only option left is to run as fast as you can, and to barricade the doors behind you. And oh! Did I mention that if you get hit in your legs by the enemy, the ability to walk is restricted? If you dont heal up, you will bleed to death - unless the enemies gets you first. As if that is not enough, this game makes you think you're actually in the game. The heartbeats of our hero, they are like your own. The breathing of the hero when he's scared? They are like your own too. This creates a tension unlike anything I have ever played before - I forgot I was sitting in my room at night. ♥♥♥♥, this game makes you believe you're there.\n\nAs stated before, the big plus in this game is the gameplay. However, the storyline is abit odd, based on the literature of H.P Lovecraft. You play as a private detective in the 1920's, looking for a kid in a town where everything seems abit "odd". As you talk with the people to get clues where to go next, everyone are calling you "stranger", and they seem rather suspicious to you. As you walk around to discover the city, you realise that you're, mildly said: ♥♥♥♥'d. You're looking down a basement in the house nexdoor to the inn where you're staying, and you realise theres a dead guy lying down there. Before you're able to react, theres this "huge" shadow dragging the dead person away from your sight. A few moments later, when you're thinking what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with this city, theres a guy walking out of the front door. Isn't that the innkeeper? ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis is what makes this game absolutely perfect. It creates a cosmic horror of the unknown. You never know what comes next. You get clue upon clue that this place wants you dead, and you cant do ♥♥♥♥ to prevent it. Even better, the sanity of our "hero" is mentally broken down. He tends to hallucinate, and what you think he sees are "only" a dream. Or is it? You dont know. Sometimes its just an hallucination, and sometimes its "real". Only one thing is certain: you're ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nHowever, there is one feeling you get in this game which makes you scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and makes you coldsweating. The feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. You're isolated, and your victories are only temporarily, and they often come with a great price. This makes you think: was it all worth it? Did I do anything wrong?\n\nTo sum it up: this game kicks major ♥♥♥. The psycho-horror thrill this game creates is unbelievable. If you play it alone at night, you forget its just a game. This game makes you think it's real. It creates an hostile environment who expands around you. You never know what comes next, but you know its going to be bad. Thus, it makes it one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played in the horror-genre.\n\nPlay this game.

This game is the novel adaptation of The Shadow over Innsmouth by Lovecraft: The novel is awesome and the game recreate it perfectly in my opinion. I strongly recommend it if you're a Lovecraft fan, or just keen on horror games :) The gameplay is really cool and I loved the fact that you have to be careful about your mental health as much as your physical health. You can get suicidal and kill yourself with your own weapon if you don't be careful about it, it's pretty rare but it happened to me at some point! ^^\n\nThe thing is, that steam version is bugged as hell. So bugged I couldn't finish the game. The game crashes at some points so you have to use unofficial patches to go through it. Some bugs can be fixed with the patch as well. As for me, I got stuck during an autosave. The loading screen got stuck and it was the end of the game for me. I tried to use some saves that I found on the Internet but it didn't work. The first time I played the game (and it wasn't a steam version), I only had one bug, which is well known by the community (the blue lights bug), but I used a save and I could finish the game.\n\nSo yeah, really really awesome game, I totally recommend it.\nThe Steam version will drive you nuts though, sooo maybe get it somewhere else, if you get what I mean. (I did get the game somewhere else since that autosave got me stuck, and that other version worked perfectly. You can pm me if you need more informations.)","April 21","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It standed out for it's great horror element, tough puzzles and the outstanding incorporation of the Lovecraft universe. For a huge Lovecraft fan, like myself, the latter was the reason to pick up this title once more, after ten years.\n\nNow, there are a some cons to point out:\n\n- The game hasn't aged well when compared to other games of 2005 like Call Of Duty 2, Battlefield 2, Doom 3, GTA: San Andreas, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. On 1920x1200 display the graphics gets pixelated and the low-resolution textures start to hurt the eye.\n\n- The AI is crazy stupid. If you're far enough, enemies won't react to you shooting at them. If you shoot enemies from close distance, they rather react to the sound of the gun than taking damage. At times enemies would fail to shoot at you because there's some obstacle in their way, blocking the gun.\n\n- The depth of field is so low that enemies will see you before you see them\n\n- Dark Corners Of The Earth was designed to be a stealth game. You've got the 'crouch' option, the 'sneak' option and the game also tells you to hide in the shadows, to avoid detection. The reality is much more simple: if the enemy is turned towards you, he will see you and if he's turned the other way, he won't. Being in sneak mode or in shadows won't affect detection at all. The only differece is between walking or crouching, as one makes more sound than the other and that's the only part of 'stealthiness' that they did get to work.\n\n- Lengthy unskippable cutscenes right before some of the toughest places of the game, which you then have to endure over and over every time you die.\n\nHaving said that, the pros are still there as well:\n\n+ The atmosphere is still damn gloomy with absolutely superb looking Innsmouth and it's degenrate citizens.\n\n+ The way you go from being a sneaky mouse to having the upper hand with considerable firepower carries the idea of remarkable character evolvement.\n\n+ The horrors are revealed to you piece by piece, delivering the expected theatrical effect.\n\n+ The story is typical Lovecraft - you stumble upon something unpleasant and get pulled into unimaginable horrors. Then it's your duty to struggle to stay alive while not going completely mad from everything that's being exposed to you.\n\n+ Voice acting was one thing that echoed in my mind through all these years. I don't think I'm overstating when I say that the voice acting was perfect. The way the 'affected ones' struggle to sound articulate and finally fail to do so as the game advances is an experience of itself. 'Halt stranger!' will be something that will ring in your ears for a long time, shouted in a robust, disturbing voice.\n\n+ Dark Corners Of The Earth is not an easy game, you have to struggle even with the lowest difficulty, getting shot or falling from a height will hurt a lot and health packages/save points are scarce. Fortunately you're packed with considerable firepower, so you've got the teeth to bite back.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThroughout the years Dark Corners Of The Earth has stayed one of the most memorable and bright horror survival games. They've nailed it with atmosphere and it definitely deserves the attention.","September 2, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Lovecraft as it is a very good representation of his little creepy universe.\n\nThe game is somewhat linear, but does offer up some "choices". Set before WWII, don't expect a hectic shooter with machine guns and tactical gear. In this game, you play as a private detective, and your main mission is to figure out what is going on. Especially with your own head!\n\nIf you go in, expecting a game similar to resident evil or silent hill, you're going to be disappointed. It's an FPS game with controls very similar to, say, half-life. The game has dialogue and narrative on par with some of the best RPG's out there and the setting is truly excellent.\n\nWhile it's definately an FPS on first glance, the truth behind Call of Cthulhu is that it's more like an FPR (first person runner). You find that you're constantly outmatched by your enemies. Crawling around in the dark, armed perhaps with nothing, or maybe with nothing more than a handgun and a few bullets and maybe a knife, you pray you won't have to fight again.\n\nThe health system is quite advanced, and I reckon it's probably an attempt at mirroring the pen&paper roleplaying game that it's based on, though I wouldn't know as I've actually never played it. I can say that the game perfectly captures the essence of the original H. P. Lovecraft books.","September 29, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is all true, but the game's most major problem is poor design, pure and simple. The game commits numerous cardinal sins of game design that make the whole experience a frustrating mess for the player.\n\nWhen the game works, as it does occasionally, it is extremely eerie and atmospheric. In particular, the hotel escape is an excellent recreation of a sequence from Lovecraft's writing. Some of the gameplay choices, such as the sanity system, are also quite daring. Unfortunately, the game's moments of brilliance are all too few and do not make up for its horrendous failings.\n\nAdditionally once you acquire weapons the game attempts to become Half-Life, but without Valve's finesse. The shooting destroys the game's tension and the dialogue and design also seem to go downhill from this point. That parallel is not accidental by the way - if you know Half-Life, you will see some *very* similar areas and puzzles in COC.\n\nHere are some of the major flaws with this game that will make you tear your hair out:\n\n> Poor level design: A non-intuitive mess that will leave you wandering around levels aimlessly for hours. For instance, doors that you have previously tried and were locked will suddenly become open-able after you complete a seemingly unrelated task (e.g. turning the gas on in the next room).\n\n> Poor game design: Jumps that can only be completed from a precise angle. Objects that take five clicks to be picked up and added to your inventory. Traps that require in-human micro-second timing to avoid and are instantly fatal.\n\n> Poor puzzle design: Puzzles frequently require items to solve them. That sounds simple, but the game doesn't tell you what items you need, or even that what you are looking at is a puzzle at all. For instance, you might come across a heavy grate. If you have missed the crowbar earlier in the level (easily done thanks to poor level design and muddy textures) then you cannot open the grate. You will simply think this route is a dead-end and have no idea you need to find a crowbar, unless you read an FAQ. It's even possible to progress to a point where you cannot backtrack to get an item you need, making the puzzle unsolvable!\n\nTo illustrate just how appalling these design problems are, here's an example of a typical COC experience. At one point in the game I spent about two hours trying to move past a street with several enemies in it. I tried sneaking. I tried fighting. Nothing worked. The reason? One of the enemies was invulnerable. Deliberately. This was how the designers chose to stop the player progressing in that direction. Instead of blocking off the street, they created an invulnerable enemy that looked like any other. As a result, many players will literally be throwing themselves against a brick wall. It turned out that I needed to pick up a certain object earlier in the level and then progress through a different area - but there was nothing to tell me this - no hint that I needed the item and no sign that the other route was the correct one. Welcome to COC!\n\nAdd to these issues a waypoint saving feature that forces you to replay large sections when you die, unexpected game crashes and plenty of unavoidable "instant death" moments and you have a recipe for pain and frustration that will test your sanity more than your character's.\n\nAll this leaves you facing two major irritations. One is that you will simply become lost, not knowing where to go or what to do next, and wander aimlessly until you stumble on the way forward by chance. The second is that you will know what you need to do, but the game's poor control systems will not allow you to do it. For example, you may need to crawl under a broken fan with split-second timing that takes 7-8 attempts - and each attempt requires you to reload and replay through the entire previous area.\n\nBottom line: COC is not a diamond in the rough. It is a diamond in the septic tank, and I wish anyone who wants to try it the best of luck digging it out. If you are eager for the plot, watch a play-through on YouTube. Avoid this game at all costs.","July 9, 2014","false","0.7"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","2"

Now you must NOT try to push this bookcase while standing or you'll also crash the game. Fine, that's a small detail, let's move on! But soon the inventory begins to load sloooooowly, freezing the game for 20 seconds every time you must use it. And you use it all the time, to access items or heal yourself. There's a fix! Call the Steam overlay over and over and it will unfreeze, then you select an item, it will freeze again, so you call the overlay again. And so it goes, EVERYTIME you must use a key or heal your leg or something. But yeah, fine. Let's soldier on, I need my Cthulhu fix because all my friends won't touch the tabletop Chaosium game!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/recommended/22340/","YourCompanionCube","Sturmgeist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/","103 products in account","Basically, it's a lovecraft-themed first person survival horror game with Fish-men, the Occult, Sanity (or, insanity), Cannibalism, Necromancy, and overwhelming odds. It is the Dark Souls of first person horror games. You have no HUD (sorry, FPS gamers), almost no ammo, and will eventually have no sanity.\n\nYes, before Amnesia, this game implemented a Sanity feature. As you are... *exposed* to certain things "man was not meant to know" your sanity depletes. This has some rather interesting effects on gameplay that shall not be named.\n\nThe game is pretty linear, if you were expecting multiple paths, you will not get them. However, if you were expecting suspense, horror, and a fun gaming experience, you will receive. The game is neither combat nor stealth-based. Although there are times where the player lacks weapons and must resort to stealth, or cannot avoid enemies and must fight, for the most part, there is always the option.\n\nThe combat system is in parts very realistic, and non-realistic, for reasons you might not even think. As I explained before, there is no HUD, no ammo counting, no crosshair, no health meter. You can aim your weapons down their sights, but sustained aiming tires your arms and unsteadies you. You will fight enemies that really will only die by headshots (Mutated Fish People, or the Part Fish/Part Man people that you encounter early on). Sure, on "Boy Scout" difficulty you might be able to kill a cultist with five shots to the chest, but ammunition is scarce, largely due to the fact that, unfortunately, and unrealistically, enemies do not drop ammunition or weapons. The only reward for eliminating an enemy is the satisfaction of removing an unholy terror from the earth.\n\nHealth is determined by the current state of your player. You can get injured, and much like Snake Eater, you will have to resort to surgery. Thankfully, you won't have to worry about complex military surgery on yourself, it is simply application of bandages to light wounds, splints for broken bones, surture for deep wounds, and antibiotics for poisons (Don't worry, this happens rarely... unless you aren't careful). Instead, you will probably be worrying much more about the mental health of your character. Those overwhelming odds can drive a man insane. So can the adrenaline from killing so many people in so little time. So can peeking down into a window and seeing a swarm of rats drag a rotting carcass into a room. So can... (you get the idea). What's more is that your decreases in sanity can cause hallucinations, schizophrenia, and even the strong desire to commit suicide.\n\nYou will play as a private detective who has had his mind ♥♥♥♥♥ by a Yithian. I suggest you read up on Lovecraft if you want to understand what any of these things are, otherwise, you will probably think I have been smoking something. You find out about the Esoteric Order of Dagon, who you seem to ♥♥♥♥ off while to try to find a runaway store manager. Basically, they want to kill you. (Read "The Shadow Over Innsmouth") So you have to escape. Upon escaping, the Government decides the people they have been watching kill hundreds of non-converts and worship Elder Gods for the last decade, are a threat to America, so they make you do all the work, since they have never read any Lovecraft, much like the Call of Duty, FEAR, and Resident Evil fans complainng how hard this game is.\n\nAlthough, even if you are Lovecraft fan, this still may not be the game you are fhtagn about. It is flawed, even to a diehard fan's standards. It has bugs and problems. Bugs can be overlooked by anyone, but this game is also extremely difficult, even on the lowest difficulty setting. If you are unsure of what you are doing and don't take the game seriously, you will fail. Although it has difficulty, it lacks the replay value of a game like Dark Souls does. You may enjoy replaying this game on higher or lower difficulties, and there are collectibles, in the form of mythos relics and stories, to discover. You will definitely enjoy some of the relics that provide backstory to the game and information on the mythos. It isn't going to provide hours of entertainment for bookworms like Skyrim or Oblivion do, but it is a fun aspect of the game.\n\nAll in all, the game is a very good, if not excellent survival horror game. It is fun, albeit difficult, with a compelling story and gameplay. If you are seeking a scary game, this game delivers. Although there are jumpscares, it uses those sparingly, instead relying on atmosphere and suspense build-up. There are some pretty disturbing scenes and images in this game, not quite Outlast-type stuff that this generation may be used to, but certainly enough to horrify. There are moments, that if you have your eyes open, much like in FEAR, will be visible, and you may take time exploring the area to find them. I myself find the game to be one of the better survival horror games, but it is too hard to compare to the majority of horror games. It is a different experience. It is not for everybody, and not everyone will like this game, but definitely worth the price, and above the price.\n\n9/10.","August 15, 2014","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I clicked yes, only to find out these codecs are no longer available, that's just wonderful. So then I cancelled the error and a window popped up saying "Windows Media Player 9 codecs were successfully installed."... okay that's good right?? I have WMP 11 anyways so that sh*t must be obsolete.\n\nNo idea what this game is about, but the intro credits showed that Bethesda Studios published this game, which is a good sign because I LOVE Bethesda! Even if they didn't develop the game they usually release some good f*cking sh*t!\n\nThe intructions tell you that Cthulhu will manipulate your gameplay (graphics, music, performance, etc.) which sounds really f*cking creepy, and excited to play it!\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that the intro cutscene showed you in Arkham Asylum, nice Batman reference/rip-off there. Also the rain looks like upside down diamonds. Those are some sharp looking rain drops.\nOh and don't minimize this game, I did when writing my review, it can't handle it and crashes.\nThe music is f*cking creepy and the voices are very scary.\n\nThe game starts showing you're a Private Detective from the 1920-30's looking at a cult house.\nYou see some f*cked up f*cking sh*t and go bat sh*t insane sending you to Batman's Arkham Asylum! You're later freed and continue your job 6 years later.\nThen sent to a strange a*s community where another Cult/Order is and corrupting the\npeople, who all look terrifying and messed up.\nYou try to find answers for a man who went missing after his store was robbed but anyone who helps you is targetted by the Order.\n\nEveryone eventually hunts you turning this game into cat and mouse much like ManHunt, although very difficult as you have to sneak around them. Once you FINALLY pick up guns, it becomes much easier. All the ammo you've collected since the beginning makes you able to kill almost everyone in your path preventing the slow stealth option.\nBy this time the game picks up, and is very fun and enjoyable, and god damn, J. Edgar Hoover is a f*cking a**hole!!!!\n\nIn the end, this is a f*cking tedious slow building game. There's really no interesting story, it tries to be but the gameplay just f*cking sucks. I NEVER noticed any Cthulhu's, and they're part of the f*cking name! Maybe it's just for demons/cults, I don't know, and I tried to care, but I just don't care anymore.\n\nIf you like sh*tty games like Theif, you will probably enjoy this. But wow there's literally NO action.\n\n6/10","September 10, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Aside from some gameplay issues here and there the game actually "plays" fine and the atmosphere is absoluetly amazing, I loved wondering the town and seeing the crazier sights later in the game. I also appreciated that this game does not hold your hand, you have to use common sense to figure out puzzles (even though some of them are admittedly obtuse) However you wont beat it. There are tons of bugs and some are so bad they actually stop you from being able to progress. I had to download a user made patch off the internet just to get into the final area of the game....after spending about an hour trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I researched it and found it was a common problem that just stops you from being able to continue. But after several hours I finally perservered and was able to patch the issue allowing me to basically just skip the bugged out section....then came the final sequence. I tried for over an hour to finish the final sequence of the game but no matter what routes I used (including ones I looked up online that worked) I was unable to finish the last 10 minutes of the game...it just kills me no matter what I do. And thats where my experience ends, 10 minutes from the final credits after dealing with bugs galore and game halting glitches. Talk about a total kick in the balls. The game is such a great concept and it really has promise but the issues it has are just to severe to recommend this game.

Just as I had hoped, the game is dark and gritty and thrusts you into the shoes of a struggling powerless investigator in a scary dangerous world filled with bad people and terrible unimaginable evil.\n\nThat said... this game has been a huge disappointment, consisting mostly of poorly implemented stealth and shallow gun-play.  I loved stealthing through the Hitman series, but staying hidden in COC just feels like a chore.  Fortunately, the enemy's aim / AI is so poor that blasting through most levels is fairly easy.  But again... so many other games offer better gunplay with smarter AI so why bother?\n\nMore importantly... bugs abound.  In order to get the game to work at all on Windows 8 required installation of unofficial patches / mods.  Even after their installation, the game will crash every time I push an object if I don't look away from doors/windows.  Moreover, several times I have passed through walls, onto roofs, or otherwise broken through the game allowing me to skip large portions of that chapter.  Although it was funny the first time, it breaks the tension and ruins any horror effect there should have been.\n\nThe gritty mystery makes me want to like the game, but I cannot recommend.","July 15, 2015","false","2.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","0"

The horror and the atmosphere is there, especially in the first half of the game. The are some ideas that were quite a novelty back in 2005, like the sanity, no hud, lack of weapons and general fragility of your character.\n\nUnfotunately, the game is broken in many ways. First of all, it didn't age well. Unless you're playing on XP, It's impossible to finish without unofficial patch that can be found on the forums. It does not support widescreen properly, and since it is a port from the first xbox, the graphics are so-so even by 2005 standards. Being a hastily port, it has many bugs. There are bugs that force you to reload from the last save game, and bugs that manifest themselves *when* you reload from the previous save. And a bunch of minor bugs, that are simply annoying.\n\nBut it's not only technical issues that spoil the fun. Many parts simply don't work as the creators intended. You may call it 'hard' but I call it 'badly designed':\n- Some of the stealth sequences are next to impossible to pass unnoticed and are much easier if you simply 'run for it'.\n- Some puzzles give absolutely no clue what to do next, and you wander aimlessly around the level searching for that one object that can be picked up, or interacted with.\n- Some levels are trial-by-death type. You'll die at least several times untill you finally find out where exactly you have to go or what to do next. Given that save points are rare and can be missed entirely, plus many scripted secquences are unskippable, this quickly gets frustrating.\n\nThe combat, when you finally get some weapons, is difficult, but that's fine. Your character is not a Rambo (even though he can carry eight weapons, several books, medkits and a diary at the same time).\n\nTo sum up, only play this game if you are deep into Cthulhu mythos or you're out of horror games.  Otherwise, there are many better ways to spend 10 hours of your life.","April 25, 2014","false","16.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecareless/recommended/22340/","thecareless","Careless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecareless/","41 products in account","I wanted to like this game but unimaginable horrors awaited me every time I turned the game on... Horrors of poor programming to be specific. All of these crashes took place on a Fallout-4 Grade PC.\n\nThe game crashed on me every hour of gameplay, generally right as I was about to reach a save point. It left me with a new compulsive twitch and a feeling of dread every time I realized that I'd been playing for longer than 15 minutes and hadn't saved. It forced me into a sense of urgency which the game itself doesn't give (evidenced by the lack of a "run" button).\n\nDespite a great story and premise set by Lovecraft, expanded on by a team that set off with good intentions, the writing was a sub-par. The voice acting was a mix of delightful talent paired with detestably unimaginative writing. Alas, I could not even experience all of this as a glitch (which no amount of patching could counteract) cut off half the dialogue mid sentence! I swear at one point they said "We need to get to ---" (silence)\n\nThe varying volume level of the voices is easily overpowered by music or sound effects rather frequently too, basically forcing you to use subtitles anyway. HOWEVER they forgot to subtitle large segments of the game involving more than 2 sentences of exposition. The game also crashed on almost every cinema (thankfully after the auto-save) and frequently froze. Alas, but if I could have only either READ or HEARD the plot-points while playing the game, as opposed to looking up what I missed online, would I have liked it more?\n\nNo.\n\nThe game's detailed story is poorly executed in all dialogues though its 'journal entries' are enjoyable, and even still it somehow robs you of a real ending or sense of accomplishment. This abomination leaves you feeling entirely unresolved. It's like a sinister detached voice told the game's writers "explain the plot of the entire game in 5 minutes... Okay, that's the ending, roll credits... Oh, and don't give players the explanatory ending unless they win with 100% completion within a certain time limit; otherwise just skip to the credits after playing the intro video again."\n\nThe gameplay seemed vastly enjoyable at first, introducing exciting gameplay mechanics like insanity and drug addiction, neither of which ever seemed to truly come into play. "hallucinations, panic attacks, vertigo, paranoia, and more!" it reads on the box... Well yes, now that you mention it, the game did give me vertigo, panic attacks, and paranoia with all of its glitches, and the countless times that the motion-blur effect got stuck. The game's creators go really far out of their way to tell you how tenuous your grip on reality will be, and how it will unhinge your sanity... Only to heedlessly ignore their own warnings in favor of throwing a blur-filter over your field of vision, or slightly swaying the screen from side to side when something disturbing happens. These effects also frequently get stuck in the "on" position until you inevitably turn off the game, die, or a critical error causes the game to fail. Dark Corners of the Earth could not be more linear, despite advertising investigative and exploration elements. Yet despite this there are a few ways to miss the 100% completion rate and be cheated of a "true" ending... Or (as in the case of various people I spoke to) you will like just get cheated of the "true" ending anyway because the game is a nightmarish abomination that seeks to unhinge the vestiges of your sanity. I suppose that much was advertised.\n\nThe glitches and bugs in this game are crippling. There's a moment where you need to use a scope to shoot at enemies... However, due to a VERY COMMON PC glitch (look it up), which is still unresolved/unpatched despite the game being out for a decade, the enemies you need to shoot are completely invisible and impossible to see or interact with unless you know exactly where they are. You literally have to look up this segment of th game to win. There are also numerous instances of poor level design AND poor lighting where a rational sane individual will not know what to do next without consulting a guide (like randomly jumping off a cliff to progress the story)... But I digress...\n\nOther glitches include being unable to walk, falling through the floor (literally falling far through the level and getting stuck in the space where great Cthulhu dwells: Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!), suddenly flying (and thus unable to open doors), having enemies aware of your presence because when you died and loaded the game they didn't reset their awareness of your presence. That one in particular is infuriating. Also having enemies glitch into the wrong locations or stopping their patrol patterns randomly and indefinitely due to glitching into something, making traveling past them impossible without detection. These are just a few of the many issues I can remember, and reloading your game will not fix half of them, so you're forced to save often, and create multiple save files.\n\nThere were many game mechanics that serve no true purpose. For instance, the STEALTH button doesn't actually do anything except fog up your screen... There's also a rail-grabbing mechanic that the game uses twice toward the end of the game that it never tells you about, and never uses again. One time it's absolutely vital to your survival (and they don't tell you about it), and the other time it's actually just a useless aesthetic choice you can ignore. The supposedly "intelligent" puzzle mechanics were enjoyable half the time and mindbogglingly infuriating in the instances where they were unclear. There was one puzzle in specific, involving identifying and interacting with glyph pieces... only the game's creators drew one of the glyphs incorrectly. That could almost be a sort of in-game parallel to what happened to the game's creators. They had some really cool ideas but ultimately deviated from their intent.\n\nTL;DR: AVOID THIS GAME. Great start, the first hour or two is very enjoyable. Everything after that is unforgivably glitchy, disjointed, and horrific in the bad way. You can not beat this game unless you wish to sacrifice your sanity and make use of at least one walkthrough/guide to navigate the 'invisible enemy' section. It's literally impossible to do.","April 13","false","13.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

That game was amazing! I love it and recommend buying it! Ia! Cthulhu ftagn!"\nI wanted to say that very badly, but I can't.\nWhy you ask?\nBecause the game is simply unplayable. I am a huge fan of H.P. Lovecraft's work and the Cthulhu mythos, and being the gamer that I am was delighted to find a Cthulhu themed game on steam. Sure at the time there were lots of people saying that this game was buggy and bad in the recommendations and people complaining about bugs in the community feed. But I tried my best to ignore those people and think "Oh, it probably won't happen to me, I'm sure this game is great!" Not too far into the game though it became very unclear about what the current objective was or how to go about it, usually making it something that no one would ever think about being helpful to the plot. But I kept thinking "Oh, I'm sure it will get better." It didn't. I had to look up a walk-through about every five minutes because of how unclear the objectives get. I normally don't resort to looking up walk-throughs unless I have been wandering around the same area for an hour straight. The game was buggy as hell, and I somehow convinced myself to make it all the way through the game... it took way more willpower than it should have. That's how unplayable it is! the movement is buggy and because of it I would often fall of a ledge and break my legs; aiming feels strange; and voice acting is amusingly bad.\nOn The bright side however the plot was interesting, I just wish that it could have been in a better game, the plot of the game doesn't deserve the horrible game play that this game has.\n\nIt pains me to say this, but I really cannot recommend buying this game","December 4, 2014","false","14.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I strongly advise you to resist the urge. This game is broken beyond repair. I reached a certain part in the game to where i have to push a crate from infront of a door and the game crashes whenever i push it. To make matters worse, the stealth system in the game is broken as well. The healing system in the game is not too bad but needs work. It also fails to capture interest which makes for a boring playthrough.\n\nThank you friends,\nThe Ruski","December 14, 2014","false","10.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

To be fair, it is a bit before its time. Some of its segments nail exactly the sort of "run and hide from the monsters" tension that later survival horror games like "Amnesia" ultimately perfected (COC even used the "insanity" game mechanic long before "Penumbra/Amnesia"). But for every effective sequence there are 2 or 3 that suck all tension out of the game and result in frustration. It wants to be all things at once: an adventure game, a stealth game, a first person shooter, and even a (terrible) platformer. But it only ever really nails the "adventure" aspect so when it tries to be anything else enjoyment stops dead in its tracks.\n\nWhich is unfortunate as ultimately the story is interesting (and you'll probably want to play this anyway if you are a Lovecraft fan). But mostly a missed opportunity.","August 18, 2012","false","18.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
