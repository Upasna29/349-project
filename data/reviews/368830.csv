Removing powerful relics from the hands of the kings they hid them in nearby tower. Anyone that was able to retrieve all relics would once and for all be known as ruler of the known world. Playing the roll of Wing you set out to take your chances at glory and perhaps peace across the lands.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNXD8QRCu6Y\nGameplay quite similar to Alex the Kidd, which isn't a bad thing. Progress is made by surviving through rooms which contain enemies, puzzles and traps. Not required to kill every enemy and they often respawn if you walk off the screen so technically you would be there for an eternity. Climb the tower further and fight bosses followed by eventually reaching segments that showed a minimap  dictating new zones. New areas held one of the sought after relics that rewarded a new skill or weapon along with changes in visual themes, music and increased overall difficulty.\n\nDecent chiptune soundtrack that could use a little more variation in the loops but it was certainly upbeat and fitting, soundfx took me straight back to yesteryear. Responsive controls though I would suggest a gamepad, will be doing a lot of button tapping using the characters flight skills. Something that tried to set it apart from others in the genre but I personally felt it just made the game easier as it could easily be exploited but likely by design.\n\nEnjoyed my time spent playing thus far and if you enjoy platformers, more-so of the retro variety it's worth checking out. Keep in mind it's not without it's flaws and as it stands @$10 would give it a solid recommend. Would suggest doing further research yourself as always. Cheer folks. :)\n\nLikes\nSimple Controls\nClean Colourful Pixel Art\nNo 'widescreen' support didn't bother me.\n\nDislikes:\nPointless Item Shop\nLooping Rooms (bugs)\nBit on the easy side for veterans\n\nNOTES:\nGametime isn't logged correctly since I play offline.\nDeveloper provided a steam code.

Once you get the dash attack ability (Has you dash in any 4 directions) the game gets an increase in enjoyment when it come to gameplay.\n\nThe Item shop, (after you buy the Health increase) is useless. For coins you can get a health refill (Enemies drop health, sooooooooo..... pointless?) an extra life(if you run out you just start back at the last check point you crossed, plus unlimited continues), and for feathers you can get a magic feather (that makes you invulnerable for 15 seconds.......... right after you leave the shop...... wait WHAT? o_O) and a magic potion that refills your hearts once they run out (AKA fairy in a bottle).\n\nSome enemies are programed in Unnecessary Bull ♥♥♥♥ that seeps at their very maw........ ok mostly just the flying enemies. The butterfly's do make it difficult in the beginning since the range of your sword is short, and they fly at you in a Boo like fashion from mario bros. Seriously screw butterfly's.\n\nUpdate: Or maybe I just suck, but you know what, I ABSOLUTELY HATE THOSE DAMN BAT'S THAT FLY FROM THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN IN THE LAST LEVEL. SCREW YOU! YOU F***ING BATS!!!\n\nAnd that's the only thing I hate from the final level - end anger enduced rant\n\nThere are also some area's that will leave you confused, since you have to remeber where you have been and if you go through the wrong door, the door behind you closes and you have to trek through that area all over again just to get back at the area that has multiple doors. Not too much of a problem for me, but for some that could get annoying.\n\nProgession is Great, as you keep going up the game will get progressivly harder, but it seems it's mostly at your pace. Once you learn to deal with some enemies naturally over time, you feel more confident then when it gets to the next area it adds another difficulty. This is pretty solid right here.\n\nOnce you get an item that has you charge up your sword....... it takes way to long it seems and just seems to leave you open and is only effective towards one enemy that can be easily avoided.\n\nUpdate - I was told by the developers that they fixed the sword charging problem, Great job guys. This made me want to use the charge up way more, and once fixed made combat enjoyable again........... except for the bats in the final level.\n\nUpdate: Bosses are cool looking but can sometimes seem exploitve. I was able to find parts of the bosses where you could find an area to just hang out and spam your attacks. But that could also be a necessity since sometimes the bosses attack paths seemed ridiculous to dodge. Like the Total Biscuit Butterfly Boss battle, that would spawn Little Biscuits to attack you...... I'm still wondering why Total Biscuit was a butterfly. Final Boss was definetly the best part of the boss battles, I won't spoil anything but he's a good fresh challenge.\n\nSo overall The game is good, but not something that you should go out of your way to get.\n\nUpdate: I do love the fact that the developers were able to hear out their audience and fix some problems, and I understand that they cannot go back and make the magic feather of invicibility a more useful item since that might entail changing code which could cause the game to glitch or crash. But thanks again Pixel Barrage for improving after release.\n\nMy recommendation:\n\nUpdate: I still stand by my original conclusion, though Pixel Barrage willing to hear the criticizm and improve upon the game from those remarks, definetly gets a plus in my book.\n\nIf you're looking for a new sidescroller, get it.\nIf you're interested but have some doubt's from the price, you can pass it and get it later.\n\nIt's really nothing you need now, but can be fun at times","July 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

If you're a fan of retro platformers, you'll probably like this game.  The problem is, though, that the genre is just oversaturated to the point where a retro platformer needs to really be execeptional or really unique to stand out.  Unfortunately, Adventure in the Tower of Flight doesn't really make itself stand out.\n\nHOWEVER, that isn't to say that it is not fun.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC4bBTIK1i8\n\nThe game is fun enough for what it is.  The two main differences here are 1, you can fly from the beginning and 2, you occasionally pick up upgrades as you go through the game.  It's almost like a metroidvania lite in that aspect, but you don't have an open world to explore like in a metroidvania.  Once you leave a room, the only way to go is forward.\n\nThere's also a shop, but it's kinda lame.  You save and you save and you don't get anything really interesting out of it.  Useful, sure, but not interesting.\n\nIt's not great but it's not bad, but I think it's better picked up on a sale.","December 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/millionuppercuts/recommended/368830/","millionuppercuts","millionuppercuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/millionuppercuts/","113 products in account","Adventure in the Tower of Flight review\n( Also on Supergamezeit.com )\n\nIn terms of video game releases, there’s usually a drought during the summer season, as publishers are prepping their triple-A titles for a fall/holiday release.\n\nOddly enough, that doesn’t seem to be case this year. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt eased us into the summer at the end of May; in June, The Elder Scrolls Online came to the PS4 and Xbox One, Final Fantasy XIV received its first major expansion with Heavensward, and finally, Batman: Arkham Knight headlined the month; nothing notable in July besides Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess, God of War III: Remastered, and N++; things pick up again in August with the pair of Sony exclusives Until Dawn and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.\n\nWith such a busy summer, it’s even stranger,  that I found myself playing Adventure in the Tower of Flight, a debut indie title from developer Pixel Barrage. But hey, just as my appetite for 2D action platformers was satiated with Shovel Knight, it’s been hollow ever since I completed it, and this looked as if it could fill the void.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nAdventure in the Tower of Flight is a retro-styled 2D action platformer. Assuming the role of Wing, you’re tasked with ascending a tower in search of five relics, with hopes of becoming “ruler of all known land”. Just as in the era of the games it emulates, the story here is bare bones and only serves as a means to get you into the action. Adventure in the Tower of Flight wears its inspirations on its sleeves, and it permeates every aspect of the game, from the visuals, sound, presentation, and most importantly gameplay.\n\nThe tower that you’re climbing is split up into different areas (essentially worlds), with their own thematic rooms. The level design is top-notch, as each room is impressively crafted, and makes use of all the screen real estate, both vertically and horizontally.\n\nThere are two types of currency (in the form of treasure) to collect throughout the game: gold, represented as coins and jewels, and magic feathers. Treasure may be found on the bodies of dead enemies or hidden behind destructible sections of the environment. The treasure can eventually be spent on a limited variety of items found in various shops scattered throughout the game, but unfortunately, these lack diversity, largely being made up of health refills, extra lives, instant revive bottles.\n\nHow does it play?\n\nI’m happy to say, the movement is extremely tight; no momentum on your run speed or slipperiness. As far as jump trajectory, here’s where the main gameplay mechanic comes into play. Just as your name implies, you have the ability to hover in the air for a certain period of time. This is measured by a meter in the upper left corner of the screen; the longer you hold jump, the faster it will deplete. If your timing is impeccable, you’ll be able to remain airborne for as long as you like. With what could’ve been a mere gimmick, it’s used extensively throughout the game, as you are constantly ascending up this tower. Plenty of situations, with tricky platforms and devious enemies, require you to have a mastery of the mechanics in order to proceed.\n\nHow’s the presentation?\n\nOut of all the retro-styled games I’ve played in the last few years, and there’s been a lot (far too many actually), Adventure in the Tower of Flight distinguishes itself from the competition, partially due to the restraint the developers show; it succeeds by not doing too much out of the ordinary, so if positioned alongside native NES titles, it wouldn’t look out of place. The models aren’t overdone, showing just the right amount of detail to provide personality and differentiate from each other. Similarly, a familiar palate of primary colors provides the backgrounds with the right blend of diversity and familiarity.\n\nJust as the visuals were carefully created, the sound design is another aspect that harbors the essence of the era. Naturally, being in the constraints of its inspiration, there’s only so much they can do here without overstepping the boundaries they’ve set for themselves. With that being said, the sound design is great. There’s just the right amount of crunchiness and distortion to certain sound effects, and the music is wonderful. The melodies become infectious and each theme has enough breakdowns to never become repetitive.\n\n\n\nWhat didn’t you like?\n\nAs my time with the Adventure in the Tower of Flight was thoroughly positive, when I did come across certain parts of the game that soured me, they were more prominent. My biggest issue with the game was the boss battles. For a game that’s so well designed, it was surprising that nearly every boss battle felt uninspired and brainless. Central to the problem was their lack of attack patterns; because of their predictability, they never posed a threat. The only enjoyable boss battle came at the end of the game; by constantly keeping you on the move without a moment of respite, the boss forced you to leverage all your moves in order to survive, resulting in a legitimately difficult and fun fight.\n\nI also had an issue when the game tried to get out of its comfort zone and offer a bit of exploration; it’s very minor, as it only occupies a small percentage of the game, but still worth noting. There’s a point where you come across a small village half-way up the tower, but in order to progress, you need to obtain a key. The problem is that the NPCs are very vague in offering you information on the steps that follow, and there’s no indication of when you actually obtained the item. Yes, I understand that this might be in the same vein as “NES hard” platformers, but it was unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nUnfortunately, retrieving keys to progress through locked doors comes up a few more times after this point, but it’s never as frustrating as it was in the village. When you encounter a locked door, several different rooms are available for you to search through for the key. My primary complaint is that there’s no easy way to determine which door leads to what room or where you’ll wind up exiting from. It seems like an idea that wasn’t fully realized, as if the developers wanted to offer some exploration, but decided against it to keep the game more action oriented. I would be all up for it, if they decided to go that route, but then a mini map would be a necessity.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you need that retro styled 2D action platformer itch to be scratched, I can’t recommend many other games over Adventure in the Tower of Flight. Solid level design, tight controls, wrapped up in a faithful aesthetic and infectious soundtrack go a long way to solidify it as one of the best games in its genre released this year. Just as the era of games it wants to fit in with, its short length (I completed it in about three hours) and four difficulty modes, provide tons of replay value. I must warn you though, at its current price point of $15.00, some might not find the game to worth its price of admission.\n\nScore\n3.5 out of 5","July 20, 2015","true","6.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

The ubiquitous jumping mechanic is replaced with flight:  a generous meter allows you to float almost freely about the lofty, linear stages as you suddenly strike out with a dash attack or charge up your blade for a power-swing.  The mostly deliberate speed of Wing's movements, together with the pacing of the levels themselves, gives the game a slightly foggy, meditative feeling -- as in a pleasant dream decorated with fleecy clouds and slowly billowing draperies that stretch up beyond the limit of sight.\n\nWhen I was an NES-addicted kid, I had lots of dreams about playing games that didn't exist, mostly games set in towering castles with slow, low-G action; I know I must not be the only one, since somebody made a game like this, drawing undoubtedly from the collective unconscious that all 2D gamers share.  Throughout my playthrough I felt a warm buzz of everyday mysticality, like an amplification of the little thrill you sometimes get when you walk away from a radio mid-song, only to hear the end of the same song sounding from a parked car a couple minutes later.  There's nothing truly magical about everybody getting the same broadcast, but it's easy (and fun) to let part of yourself believe that there is.\n\n(If you are a calloused veteran of old-school platformers, attain maximum enjoyment by cranking the difficulty up to MASTER -- but no higher!)","May 21","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a old school 2d platformer where your character's sole purpose is to climb/fly to the top of a tower. The flying is pretty cool, I have to admit. It's a basic game with basic sounds, basic graphics, and a basic goal. I'll be honest, I never really got into super mario, or those sort of platformers. I disliked the sounds this type of game had.\n\nThe blips and distorted music associated with retro games don't appeal to me. I think it's a good game for what it is. You have the collect frenzy with the coins, the respawning monsters and traps which add to the levels of stress, but with an option to save your progress which gives it an advantage over the earlier games, where you often had to start from the beginning if you died.

Brings back the 80's/90's nostalgia of solid platformers without the bugs/glitchiness that many of them had or the inherent issues of running games on those machines with such low memory. I think many people think that platformers or games, in general, have to rewrite history or remake the wheel to be great; no, they just have to be solid and fun. My only real complaint would be (and it's minor) that I wish certain enemies made sound. Like, if something is flapping its wings to fly around you, it should make little 8-bit "beep boops" lol. Is it worth $7.99 if you don't catch it on sale or in a bundle? Ehhhh... maybe... probably not. Sorry, it's probably a few dollars high. $4.99-5.99 would have been the sweet spot if I had bought it seperately, but $7.99 isn't downright horrible.","March 26","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/recommended/368830/","crushmaster","Crushmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/","23 products in account","With great pixel art and charming, 8 bit music, Adventure in the Tower of Flight hearkens back to the old school RPGs of yesteryear. Gameplay is decently challenging without becoming too annoying, the items and equipment are satisfying, and the story is enough to keep you interested. However, the story is my biggest criticism. There's not much there, and a bit more being added would make me like this a lot more. The ever-classic rescue of a damsel would have been a superb and fitting addition to this game, one which I would highly recommend adding in a patch to add more depth to the story. But, overall, it's a nostalgic, decently produced game that will take a few hours for a play through, definitely worth the sale price I paid for it, and a fair deal at the regular price, as well. Trading cards are also a huge plus. Recommended.","December 26, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The flight and fun gameplay especially is appealing to me. Something that is very easy to get the hang up within a minute or less, but has plenty of adventure and fun elements to keep me playing as a fan of adventure action games. The controls are responsive and if I goof up, it's my lack of game play skill that's to blame most of the time. The graphics are nicely drawn sprites, with sharp sound and music.\n\nOnly VERY minor complaint in the entire game would be that when your health is near 0, the warning health chimes keep beeping till you get more health. Problem with that, much as in Assassin's Creed 1, is you might go for a long while before getting a health up, so it becomes part of the music and is an unnecessary sound, acting as a constant warning that the player is already likely aware of; get more health! But it's not a deal breaker and once you get your health up, it thankfully disappears. I don't think there's an option to turn it off, but not a big deal consider the rest of the game is great fun.\n\nI wasn't sure how the game saves progress, but thankfully when you contact the winged spheres, once they fly up, you have saved your progress. There are Knights that give you tips if you need them also. To conclude, you gain new abilities and go through many castles and different underwater maps, facing all kinds of fun enemies from fish, butterflies to globs that spit, and more. If you're looking for a fun retro style adventure game, Tower of Flight is an excellent choice.  Really enjoying the game and do not regret my purchase.","January 5","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
