You are stuck using the arrow keys to navigate and the alt keys to select and go back. If these keys can be changed I would love to know how, because then I could change the controls on how to drive the cars. I don't have a gamepad or wheel (just a joystick) so I am left with using (for me atleast) strange driving controls to race which becomes a nuissance as time goes on.\nThe graphics are pretty good, but they are not well optimized. I can't hold that against them at all though because it is alpha.\nCurrently I can only find the default red racecraft car to use and I am not the biggest fan of its balancing (meaning its acceleration rate, top speed, downforce etc.) and am looking forward to increased customizability of the cars in the future.\n\nThe best part about this game and, to me at least, makes it stand out from other racing games is the track generation. The procederal engine works most of the time and creates tracks that have a similar flavor but have yet to seem repetetive.\n\nOverall I'd say this game has a lot of potential to become one of the greats and I would recomend keeping an eye on it as it develops.\n","March 4","true","2.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","1"

Been following the development of Racecraft since it started, and got in on the closed beta early on.\n\nPros:\n-Great track generation system, they may all look similar but the procedural nature keeps things fresh.\n-Graphics seem pretty clean and slick.\n-Download size is nice and small, which is a nice change for modern racing games.\n\nCons:\n-Performance is pretty poor. My system can handle most games on medium-high with 60fps. With Racecraft I get 25fps in the menus, 10-15fps when on track\n-Menu is absolute garbage. Reminds me of a console game ported to PC, circa 2005. Mouse is completely unusable and controls for navigating around are weird.\n-Lack of vehicle choice. Yes I get it's early access alpha, but despite the screenshots showing multiple cars, you can only drive one red one.\n-Painful car setup options. It's done whilst you're on track by pressing left alt, then tapping right alt to select the option, then holding right alt until your tweaks are just right. I've never seen such poorly implemented UI decisions.\n-AI cars are very floaty, they tend to drift over the track and never really have any feeling of being out there with\n\nTL;DR If you can buy it cheap, then get it, otherwise hold off on this one. It has a good concept but the execution at this stage of the early access is not enough to warrant a $19.99 price tag.","March 17","false","0.4"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","1"

There is an almost endless range of different tracks that can be played at this time also one of the driver against the artificial intelligence. Formula selection of cars is not like the one available at the moment.\n\nHowever, this is becoming a very promising and effective basic formula car game, a testimonial!\n\n\n\nFIN:\n\nKuten Victory: The Age of Racing peli, tämä on varsin hyvä ja toimiva kilpa-auto peli, jonka pääpaino on lähinnä moninpelissä.\n\nPeli on visuaalisesti kuten monet muutkin todella kaunis ja fysiikalta toimiva.\n\nPelissä on erinomainen ajettavuus ja paljon ajoa avustavia apuja myös aloitteleville pelaajille.\n\nKäyttöliittymä on selkeä mutta, hankala vielä käyttää, koska sitä ei voi käyttää hiirellä.\n\nToisin kuin Victory: The Age of Racing, tämä tarjoaa vihdoinkin myös jotakin yksin pelaajalle.

So far now, now that I got it finally working on my computer, it isn't half bad.\n\nHowever, one gripe I have with this game is optimization. I'm running it on my 3 year old potato laptop, and I had to put all settings on low at 720p. Maybe I just need to get my gaming rig completed.\n\nTrack randomization is not bad at all. There was the occasional expirience where the track didn't load right, and left holes in the map and walls on the track itself blocking me from completing a lap. I would like to see options and sliders for track randomization, like complexity, length, height changes, and other variables.\n\nCar handling is not that bad, altough it does need some touch-ups before launch.\n\nAll in all, not bad in Early Development, it just needs a bit more work done to it to make it able to play it for the consumer. And for the love of everyone around here, add AI racing. I've delt with Victory and not being able to play with other racers. Keep this game from becoming a ghost town with optional AI racing locally.\n\n7/10 Great concept, great layout, needs some polish.","April 19","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/346610/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is as of Early Access on March 4, 2016. I will modify and/or delete this review as the game updates and most likely delete it when the game fully launches to give it a fresh review.\n\n---------\n\nWe need to start this off with a warning. The developers of Racecraft, Vae Victus, have only done one other Steam game, Victory: The Age of Racing. They abandoned the game for two years, then made it free-to-play and have still yet to update it in any way. This studio's track record is small but horrible, so please bear that in mind.\n\nRacecraft is designed to be a procedurally-generated driving game, its gameplay being based in simulation with some arcade modifications to it. It was a formula that worked fairly well in Victory, and it's been refined here in Racecraft. Driving feels tight yet fluid enough so that it doesn't feel stiff, and the sense of speed is there. When it comes down to the core gameplay, Racecraft has got many of the checkboxes marked. My biggest concern with one of the previous versions in the closed Alpha was that there were a lot of symbols and signs on the track that I couldn't identify. My racing history is mostly in Need for Speed - I'm not a racing sim gamer - so it would have been helpful to have some explanation on what the track signs meant.\n\nOutside of gameplay, Racecraft falls short of being a stable game to play in. Again, keep in mind that this is still Early Access, so things are bound to be, well, Early Access. But there's a myriad of issues present in the current version. 1) The game just crashed on me while I was preparing to write this review. 2) The menus are extremely slow to respond, slow to animate, and do not have mouse control (as a game releasing on Steam in 2016, that last part shouldn't even be there). 3) The game's menus are locked behind the procedural track generator, so you'll be waiting a while before you can even change the game from fullscreen or turning off its effects or what have you. 4) Gameplay itself is incredibly sluggish, even when I turn off all effects, get out of fullscreen, and lower the resolution.\n\nThere also seems to be some sort of issue with controller support. Sometimes it recognizes my Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710, sometimes it doesn't. For the record, Racecraft will fully support wheels (if it doesn't already), so if you have one of those peripherals you're in luck here. It should also be stated that Racecraft requires DirectX 11 or newer, so if you're running DirectX 10 or older (which millions of Steam accounts still are), you won't be able to play Racecraft.\n\nBecause of the many issues with the game, I cannot recommend Racecraft in its current state. I look forward to future updates, and as I stated in my disclaimer I will update this review as such, but for now I advise staying away.","March 4","false","0.5"," 31 of 59 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","31","59","0","18"

Well the physics are not that great, so if you're 80% done with them, I don't see much improvement. Seriously, drifting in a F1 car? That and bots not being able to be hit along with no damage, takes away a lot of the racing aspect of racecraft. The track length is also a little on the short side, and a lot of the features are repetitive. I may look again once its out of early access.

You race at first against what I think is the best timed driver then after your first lap you have another ghost car that includes your previous lap. It has the same track thru the 6 day tourney. So now your racing against your ghost and the fastest ghost time. It does make the game a lot more interesting to play around with. So at least now their is a reason to drive fast around the track. I still am not a big fan of this racer yet. Their is still not enough meat on the bone so to speak for the price. The lap for the event can be completed in around a minute or so. So racing around the track for around 4 to 5 times to get a good lap time. Perhaps longer. However after thats done their isnt much to do with the game at this point.\n\n\n\nSo the game got an update. The game does a look a little better.\n\n\nSo its a very rough game at the moment. The car doesnt look all that great.  Its strange. The sound is sparse. You hear your car and thats about it.\n\nThe track generator is a mixed bag. The problem I have with it right now are the jumps that they include in the track. Now for a game that has F1 looking cars why include a jump?? I was leading the race playing against the 1 Ai that you cannot touch nor can he touch you. When blam I hit a cliff and it sends my car spinning end over end. Jumps do not belong in this game and I hope they take them out. Its crazy to have a jump with an F1 car. The track them selves are kind of boring. Nothing moves and their is no crowd. So its you racing against another car and generated tracks.\n\nAlso the game has strange warning markers? I do understand the markers now. 1 is an extreme turn and higher means a less extreme turn.\n\nThats about the whole entire game.  I think if someone expected a full racing experience they are going to be sadly disapointed. The game that is here is extremely thin. Race against one  AI driver or race a hotlap. I also think the asking price is way way to high at the moment. $16 dollars for a bare bones racer. Also just a slight annoyance in the preview its a lot misleading. I was racing against one ai racer and I did not find any options for other race cars to be on the track. The options were hot laps or race against the AI. To my way of thinking those pictures showing other cars (they showed 4 other cars on the track)  is make believe and very wrong. In the future yeah then  maybe other 3 or more cars on the track but for now its just one ai racer.\n\nAt the moment I cannot really recommend this game right now. Its way to much of a bare bones racer. To me the starting price should have been around $10 dollars. Then after they added features the price could have gone up by double. Your much better with Burnout Paradise or the trackmania game series. Same price but much more content.  If I am wrong on the amount of cars on the track then leave me a note stating how I can have more then just the one ai racer on the track.\n\nI realize the review is long however I wanted to give an accurate review. So in the future I may change my review to be more positive.  However its just so thin I would not recommend this game at this time. Like I said I may change my review later on as the game gets updates.","March 7","false","0.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","6"
