Starting the game I could already tell this was a master piece. The stunning visuals and superb sound quality left me absolutely awestruck. The downside to the unbelievable graphics is that I could only run this game at about 98-100fps on mega ultra settings.\n\nThe story is quite linear with several sidequests that interweave with the main storyline, similar to The Witcher 3: Wildhunt, but was executed far better in my opinion. The characters, unlike in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are not 1 dimensional and have interesting personalities and backstories. For me, the most memorable quest was finding the glasses in the hole, I can vividly remember recieving my first weapon as a reward: A scoped slingshot. It was easily the best weapon in the game, but since I had specced into intelligence it was practically useless. This makes the combat far harder, I remember the final battle against the ghost took me several tries to beat. This is not helped by the unweildy combat system that utilises QTES(Quick Time Events) which seem very out of place, considering this is kids game. In several areas of the huge open world map, there are big scary male fish that try to oppress you with musical instruments. You have the option to initiate combat with them, but it takes a lot of grinding in order to get to their level.\n\nThere is a high level of interaction within the environment, my favourite place is the movie theatre, with the right button combination you are able to play reruns of the hit tv show, The Fresh Prince of Belair. Other than the horrible combat system, another gripe i have this game is the economy, it is very clear that the octopus has a monopoly over the entire pulley market, as one pulley will often run you 5 sea urchins, which can be very difficult to come across, while exploring the gigantic open world. My last gripe is this game, is more of a personal one, after playing for a while I literally developed cancer, this game cost me so much money, that i was unabable to pay for my hospital bills. Since this is the only game I own I am just sitting in the hospital playing this game, waiting for the sweet, sweet release of death.\n\nBest game ever 10/10\n\nThis game sucks fish sticks\n","December 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","84","21","25","24","1"

If you're an adult and have never played this game, it's almost certainly not going to do anything for ya, and ya should probably pass on it.\n\n\nThis game and any other Humongous Entertainment game should only be bought for one of two reasons:\n\n1) You're getting it as a game for your young kids. That's how I was introduced to this game and it's stuck with me ever since. Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Spy Fox, Putt-Putt, they're all nostalgia mascots for my childhood and even playing this game now I still love these characters; as cheesy as they all may be now.\n\n2) You're like me and are reliving your childhood games. Trust me, even though this game is easy as hell and you can blast through it in under an hour, it's still fun to relive a game that you enjoyed as a kid.\n\nI spent a ton of the time I was on this game just screwin' around with the environmental stuff, which is half the fun of these old HE games. The story's stupid and would make Scooby Doo hang his head in shame of how laughable this "mystery" is, but it's still entertaining as hell to play through just so you can swim around the ocean, meet all of the Freddis' pals, and just see what you can do.","June 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/294530/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Freddi Fish 2 is one of the very first PC games I ever played. I played it off a CD I got in a cereal box on my dad's ancient Windows 95 computer, which I had for about 10 years.\n\nThis is a game I have this strange nostalgic fondness for despite fundamentally being a simple kids game. The plot centers on the two characters, Freddi and Luther, who have to discover the identity of a mysterious ghost who steals the toys of all of the other children. And they have to gather various objects inorder to build a trap to capture the ghost. Like I said it is fundamentally a children's game so the humor is a bit predictable, the puzzles are very simple and you're frequently told what to do and what to get. (IE: Freddi says you need scissors to cut some kelp, you need a wrench to remove a wheel, you need to ask a character for a combination to a lock. Etc.)\n\nSomething the game does have much like other Humungous games is random elements. When you start the game up, certain elements are removed wheras others appear. For instance, all of the trap items you need to locate are randomized during every playthrough. While this isn't that big of a difference it does make the second or third playthrough feel different. When I was a kid this blew me away at the time but nowadays it just feels like a way to pad out the game time. Since it is a very short game.\n\nGoing through it on the first try you can beat the game in maybe 30 minutes. This is a common aspect of Humungous games compared to other SCUMM games like the ones by Lucasarts. So it might not hold your attention as an adult, but it will return you back to a day when you were a kid, and every game was a treasure to behold.","May 30","true","0.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.\n\nI played the Haunted Schoolhouse right after finishing the Kelp Seed adventure and I remember not being okay with the whole “Haunted” part. Between the already scary sharks, and then some sort of paranormal activity in an elementary school, I remember that this game really frightened me at first. I think it was almost a year before I went back and actually really enjoyed it. It is by no means inappropriate, but I would recommend some supervision at first until you see how your child reacts to some of the opening scenes and concepts.","December 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is by far one of the best gaming experiences of our generation. The challenging mental puzzles will leave you breathless as you try comprehend their hidden meanings. The answers are always as they seem, though an experienced veteran of the cloak and dagger genre will find a way to prolong to mystery. I cannot state enough how impactful this game is to the gaming communtiy and I feel it is my oblogation to convey this simple message. Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is a refreshing take on the childrens click entertainment platformer series. It's endless innovations are awe inspiring. However, some users may find the graphics somewhat lackluster compaired to franchises such as Far Cry or the Elder Scrolls series. Let me make this abundantly clear... You wasting precious moments of your temporary existence by passing this game off as childs play. Freddi Fish2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse will enchant your senses with its gripping story telling and rich user interaction. I beg you buy this game, not just for me but treat yourself to something miraculous. Games like Freddi Fish2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse come around once, maybe twice in a decade. Don't become one of the mindless drones that drudges through the capitalist lifestyle. Submitting to a slave wage grind of an unfufilled life without living. Freddi Fish2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is the booming echo of revitalizing humanitarinisum.\n\n-Buy they game and change your life, before you have lost the will to live.","October 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

Like in Freddi Fish 1; we’re drawn into a struggle between several groups competing to solve the mystery, and deciding which of their imperfect post-spook philosophies to align with made me pause to consider how I wanted events to play out. Even the highly questionable Institute has a tempting reason to side with them, and turning away from them in my playthrough wasn’t as clear-cut a choice as I’d expected.

Wonderful for nostalgia's sake.\nOne of the absolute best things about this entrie series is nearly everything you see is clickable and does something.

This game was well worth it for me. I beat it in 1 hour, but it was still worth it. I recommend this game for everybody, escpecially little kids. If you are a teen or an adult, this might not be as fun, unless you have played it in the past. If you have played in the past I would suggest this for your daily dose of nastalgia.\n\n10/10","May 15","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
