I noticed that it was only published by AM and was actually developed by a different company, so perhaps that's why it falls so short for me.\n\nThe story is weird, uninteresting, and doesn't make a lot of sense. In some scenes the graphics are poorly rendered and the game mechanics are glitchy. The music is repetitive and doesn't suit the atmosphere well. The puzzles are extremely easy to the point of being boring (I like relatively easy puzzles because I like to relax when I play games, but the puzzles in this game are over the top). There are typos, misspellings, and awkward use of English (I understand these games are not made by native English speakers, so I am forgiving, but this hasn't really been an issue in other AM games). To top it all off, the game is quite short; I played through both the main and bonus stories (which by the way, the bonus story was a bit weird and had little to do with the main story) in about 3 hours.\n\nAll that being said... I still mildly enjoyed playing this. It's a decent way to pass the time and is really lovely to look at. If you're a fan of this type of game, give it a go if you can get it on sale. But if you're new to the genre, try a different AM game because I don't think this one will leave a very good impression.","December 5, 2014","false","3.2"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/recommended/330990/","adam1224","adam1224","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/","1546 products in account","TLDR Version: Play this game for the hidden object scenes as there are quite a few. If you want meaningful story, decent puzzles and animations, you're looking for it at a wrong place. The game has nothing worthwhile to offer besides the HOscenes.\nDon't even think about getting it at full price - 1-2€ is still way too much for it, as the quality Mundi games would cost about the same. Do yourself a favour and get this only in bundles, or just buy a different one.\n\n\nThe game's main problem that it's exceptionally boring. I'm used to the hidden object ways of going to and fro with items only to get more items and to backtrack even more, but as the game's puzzles are absolutely not challenging, it really feels to be just as much of a busywork as it sounds. Items and the way you need to use them on your surroundings are absolutely random - you need bars to climb up to the top of the shelves? No problem, it's on the table in one of the hidden object scenes, just they (4 pieces) are smaller than a pen.  Or when you install the fan to remove the toxic gas BY going through the toxic gas because they ventillation shaft is on the other side.  Or you knowing that a certain flower can be cut only with an enhanced dagger, yet when you later (!) find the note about it you're surprised because you never heard about the flower.  All the developers should have done to add " I need something sharp to cut these" as description, as if I remember correctly there are no other bladed weapon you get in the meanwhile.  And to add insult to the injury, as the character enters to a new section, she takes notes for herself about what she needs to do to progress. But only in her diary, you need to open it every single time because seemingly the character - played by you - doesn't knwos that she should do, so you need to check you OWN NOTES about it.  This game came out in 2014 december, Artifex Mundi was already going strong (they are only publishers here, not devs) and on bigfishgames the hidden object games were rampant already. Yet the developers of this game are repeatedly made design mistakes that were working fine since years - like the diary / popup about goals one, and they still mess it up. Add the terrible cutscene animations, the lackluster plot ( Mr I Didn't Killed The Professor guy disappers with a puff of f****n black smoke after you spoke to him, seriously? And after it I should be surprised that he's serving the demon?) . . .  I don't know what the developers were thinking when making this game. They took the concept of demonhunting (so demon enemy, get 'em tiger!), they made pretty good hidden object scenes and then topped the whole thing with the easiest puzzles they could figure out, then done some animations during the last few days of the development. At least this is how it looks like. Basically everything else than the hidden object scenes are present in the game for the sake of being present without any additional quality, because without them it couldn't be called a game.","March 16","false","10.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeheart/recommended/330990/","eeveeheart","Eevee <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeheart/","525 products in account","I'll admit I went into this game having mixed expectations, while the reviews made me think it might be bad,  having Artifex Mundi involved (they did not fully make this game) made me hopeful. So whil I expected the worse I was hoping for the best... It was some of the worst...\n\nFirst off the sound effects. Someone's job must have been to find the most soul wrenching sound clips ever. I use a high-def headset so some noises I find discomforting while on normal speakers or headphones it might be fine but I would say 9/10 sound effects in this game made my ears cringe a bit. Even transition noises between screens were bad.\n\nThe voice acting, well let's be hoest most hidden obbject games (HOGs) don't have the best voice acting. This one hits a new low. It sounds like lines just read off paper with an odd accent. I can see them wanting to make the main character having an accent but they still could have picked a better voice actor. To top that off the lines that are not in grammatically correct english are some of the lines of text that is displayed as your character speaking. The other voice actors do a slightly better job.\n\nPlot... Okay... Usually HOGs have bad plots or typical ones but at least they usually make sense! One moment you're in a house fighting a so called demon and the next you're under water fighting a kraken, the next im finding golden eyes for an elephant statue that looks Indian...? To make matters worse there is no plot progression, you try to get into a house you meet a guy who vanishes like a demon in a cloud of black smoke  (gee I wonder if he's actually a bad guy...) and then bam you're trying to distract a kraken in a whole underwater bit and then youput an amulet into a machine to shut down the stargate (serious it has the chevrons and everything turning!) and the only exposition to your character (which was proposed as a major plot point at the start of the game) is one book which should be called exposition 101! The premise was decent but the execution horrible. It would have been more interesting if it turned out that old lady at the start with the cat was the demon.\n\nHidden Object Scenes. Okay who in the world thought "Hey, you know what'd be cool to add to a hog scene Jim?" "What Larry?" "Let's add things that shift form and you can only click it when it's in the form listed on the object list!" "Wait Larry, wouldn't the shifting give away the items position anyway and just be annoying to wait for it to shift back to the correct item?" "Yea! Let's do it Jim! And make sure the shift time is at laest 5 seconds long just in case it's the last item the player is searching for it can be extra annoying!" That has got to be the most annoying feature ever thought of in for a HOG (aside from single pixel objects) Another problem with HOGs is that the items are hidden mainly with clutter and usually never anything clever.\n\nPuzzles. If you've ever played a HOG before, you've probably already solved most of these puzzles and they were probably better designed. Often times the back arrow is too sensative and you'll back out of a puzzle, othertimes the puzzle isn't fun it's just tedious (there's a maze one that ugh... it's one of those don't touch the sides or the walls thing but with a long linear maze...).\n\nLogic. While not always the best place for logic... HOGs USUALLY follow some logic but this game loves having you find random items in random places. I can see getting a screw driver from a tool shed... I can see getting dog food from a kitchen... I cannot see how most of these items are placed! You find a pickaxe in some case after solving a puzzle that was like a picture frame! Basically any item you need will be uncovered by solving a puzzle towards the end game, no matter how little sense it makes.\n\nOverall this game, while not a broken game (I didn't find any glitches) it's not really worth the money or time. The plot doesn't redeem the lack of good gameplay nor does the gameplay redeem the plot. It feels like whoever made this game asked Artifex Mundi for a plot premise and their animation team and scraps from their old games. So while it makes a playable game, it is by no means a good one. If you have to pick, skip over this game and get one fully made by Artifex Mundi. Don't let the pretty art fool you, there is little substance behind it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bue/recommended/330990/","Bue","Peake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bue/","106 products in account","I enjoyed this game, although it is one of the weaker titles in Artifex Mundi's Premium Adventure Collection, all of which I have played (although this is the first I've gotten through Steam).\n\nThe graphics were  nicely detailed and skillfully drawn, not too dark.  The hidden object scenes were not too easy, but not particularly challenging -- except for some of the item listings being misleading (due to translations, I suppose).  One listing, though, I found particularly annoying.  I try to complete the hidden object scenes without any misclicks if possible, and this one had 'Flask' listed in a laboratory HOS -- the table had many flasks!  Grr.  However, I particularly liked the morphing objects in the scenes.  I didn't experience any graphic glitches during my playthrough.\n\nVoiceovers were well done and the the music was fine.  However, I should point out that I'm happy with music as long as it doesn't distract or annoy me enough to turn it off.  This music fit well into the background for me.\n\nThe puzzles were of various difficulty, but all were somewhat on the easy side.\n\nTwo main cons I found with this game -- first, it is somewhat short, and the second is the story.  Besides the introduction, the occasional cutscene and a bit towards the end, there is very little story.  The premise was interesting, as I progressed through the different locations, I kept looking for things to find that would answer some questions about the main character's background or heighten the mystery about her mentor's death -- old films, pictures or letters, a tale from one of the characters interacted with ... something!   No real suspense or tension where I was eager to press on to find out what happens.   No real explanations really as to why certain, um, things were found at the residence.\n\nThere was certainly enough space to include more elements -- the locations had plenty of places where more content could have been added to great effect, and increase gameplay time.  In fact I was somewhat surprised at the relatively few things one had to do in each scene.\n\nSummary:\n\nI wanted to like this game -- it's obvious alot of work went into the development, and for a newer developer (Brave Giant Studio) it's a commendable effort.  However, in my opinion, the lacklustre story presentation offsets the technical and artistic strengths to the extent that I cannot bring myself to recommend this game.   If they come out with a sequel, I'll certainly look at it -- but only if I could try a demo first and see if the story will draw me in before I made a purchase.\n\nFeatures not listed in the game description here:\n- Two levels of difficulty: Casual and Expert.\n- Different types of collectibles\n- Morphing objects in the hidden object scenes.\n- Travel Map\n- Bonuses - Bonus Game, wallpapers, music, replayable cutscenes, hidden object scenes, and puzzles.\n\n","December 20, 2014","false","6.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

However, despite some shaky plot (or lack thereof), it has all the HO and minigame love that fans of the genre will appreciate.\n\nSound and music is done well enough.  Nothing that stands out and nothing that's terrible.  Graphics look nice enough for the game type.  Animation is minimal but decent, especially the final scenes.  HO scenes are detailed but not challenging.  The game adds "morphing" objects that can only be clicked when the in correct form; this would be irritating except for the quite fast change time which means you won't have to wait more than a couple of seconds for it to flip back.  If you don't have the patience to wait five seconds, you may not like it.  I didn't mind.\n\nMy single grouch with the game is the lack of plot; there's some good setup, then a lot of not-much, until the very end when you get a chunk of information sort of tossed at your head.  But even that information is scanty, and not in a "you have to roll it around in your brain to make a conclusion" awesome way.  I'm hoping the bonus chapter has some more back story but it honestly should have been in the main game.\n\nThe game time isn't terribly long, so like most of these games, I recommend waiting for a sale.  It's running about two hours for the main game (I haven't done the bonus content yet).  With the short playtime and sketchy plot, I wouldn't get it full price.  But with a sale, I wouldn't hesitate to grab it.  It's a fun playthrough even with the plot issues.","October 4, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It’s far from the usual Artifex Mundi quality in many aspects, but it is still quite enjoyable– if you like casual level one-afternoon titles.\n\nLong version:Demon Hunter: Chronicles from Beyond is almost like a showcase Artifex Mundi game. It lacks an established theme, which, strangely, is used to its advantage. It revels in its blandness by using every type of clichéd scenery we have seen from this publisher: haunted mansion, lighthouse, underwater scenery, surrealistic nightmare world… everything is presented here.\n\nNaturally the lack of plot (and the terrible voice-acting) means you have little investment in playing it apart from curiosity about what kind of visuals will the next place offer. And the game knows this, as it quickly pushes you forward. There are many hidden object scenes, but only a handful of quick puzzles beyond that. Therefore, it clocks out around 2-3 hours, making it one of the shortest games from this publisher, but still a more memorable one than most other hidden object games sold on Steam.","July 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The voice acting is fairly decent, although there isn't a whole lot of it - and mostly it is your protagonist narrating events in cut scenes.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the point and click sections are all okay, if prone to fairly random events happening, the puzzles are all okay but very easy, and the hidden object scenes are fine apart from the weird morphing thing where objects you need to collect turn into something else you can't click on for a short while. This can attract your attention to the movement on screen (but 50% of the time to something you can't collect) or make you think you have checked an area when you have actually missed it, I am not sure this really adds anything, it just sort of randomizes how difficult scenes are a bit. The standard map with teleport and pointers to where you can do stuff is included, which is always a plus especially in games where you jump around between locations over and over as you do here.\n\nThe extra chapter in the collectors edition is pretty well done and atmospheric, although the puzzles are a bit repetitive (in the 7 or so rooms in it, you do the 7/5 capacity beaker thing you already did in the main game right at the end twice more for example), and given the amount of running back to the first room that happens later on it is annoying the map teleport is turned off for the bonus chapter.","December 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Just not good enough\n\nLong version So, another game I would have wished for a slightly more Neutral option.\nIt's not horrible, is playable, just not good and there are definitely better options in the genre.\n\nA good HO game has a few components so let's break it down:\n* Plot - No plot to mention here. The "plot" jumps around from X to Y, without much sense.\nYou are in the forest, then in the house, suddenly you dive under the sea. WTH?\nNot even a passable attempt at a plot.\n\n* HO scenes - I like it when the scenes make sense and you see items in their sensible location (As per\nwhere the scene is). Here? not bad. I did feel that the mouse clicking wasn't sensitive enough and sometimes\n(Esp. when rushing the clock) you had to re-click.\nAn extremely annoying feature is an item that changes, and you actually need to press it when the right one\nof two forms appear. The changes alone hint at the item, so why the heck is that a good feature??\n\n* Puzzles - Easy and lukewarm. A few were kind of familiar from other places.\n\n* Item collection - Again, if the point of the puzzle or HO is just to give an item, I get that. But there were so many\nitems with multiples that you had to collect that everything became so linear.\n\n* Graphics - So-so. Definitely seen better in the genre.\n\n* Voice acting and music - The music was OK then became so annoying i turned it off.\nVoice acting - Bad. Nothing else to say about it.\n\nSummary - when you combine it all, you get a reheated microwave meal that feels as if you've seen it before.\nNot horrible, easy and casual. If you like the genre, and have nothing much better, give it a go.\nIf you are a completer - Go for it. I played it for two evening at a business trip, in one of which I dozed off at some point.\nIt was a long day, but doesn't happen often :-)","May 18","false","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
