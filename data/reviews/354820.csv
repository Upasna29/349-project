I would give it a two out of five, the only things I knew how to do were build, order supplies, hire, and fire.","May 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","14","25","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpanzerj/recommended/354820/","jpanzerj","Vera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpanzerj/","871 products in account","Prison Tycoon Alcatraz is yet another corpse in the Prison Tycoon series that keeps on stinking up the morgue - which in this crap metaphor is Steam. The UI is awful, the graphics are atrocious, and the gameplay - once you've got your guards and prisoners and assigned jobs - consists of sitting around twiddling your thumbs. It's charmless and borderline unplayable if you have any concept of fun. If you want a decent prison game, might I suggest Prison Architect instead.","May 18","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
