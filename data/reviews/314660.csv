We got burned way too many times in the past by half-backed or lazy ports... but this is not the case with Oddworld New N Tasty.\nSince it’s not exactly a new game, the port quality is a very important factor so let's talk a bit about this.\n\nWe have full resolution support, but apparently no aspect ratio settings. I ran the game at 1080p and the experience was smooth and flawless for the most part. The cut-scenes are my one and only gripe with the game. They start off at 100+ FPS and drop down and lock at 40 fps for some reason... it just breaks the feeling. It's a small issue to have but I'm sure fans of the series would like to know this aspect.\nAs said the gameplay is 100% flawless, running on 1080p with 100+ frames with 0 drops, tears or any other non-sense.\nWe have full mouse and keyboard support, you can fully rebind your keys and use the mouse to aim, plus an option that console players asked for and that is "button to run". This will solve those awkward situations when falling off cliffs or steeping into bombs and so on and so forth.\nBoth mouse+keyboard and controller can be used on the fly to control the menus, but you do have to choose your input option for gameplay as this will not switch on the fly, so assign it before you start playing. So overall the port is solid...on to the actual game.\n\nThis is a full build from the ground up, not just a lazy up-scaling.\nMy experience was pleasant, I enjoy the puzzles, the grim-dark sense of humor and the silly back-story.\nThis may not be for everyone thou...some may find this humor type offensive... I for one did not.\nIn New N Tasty you have to think how you will solve the puzzles and how to trick your opponents into death traps. You can’t really fight, so you must have patience and use your wits to get the job done.\n\nThere are many users that have reported that the puzzles (at least in essence) have been carried over from the original smash success Abe's Odyssey, launched back in 1997. This may be a plus or a minus for you, for me it's neither since I did not play the original.\nThe graphics are very good for a platformer, you can clearly see that a lot of time and effort went into making the environment and every detail of it.\nThe soundtrack, voices and effects go together perfectly with Oddworld’s unique feeling and universe. I never felt annoyed by the goofy voices even after hearing the same lines over 100 times and the soundtrack does a fantastic job of setting the mood while not being "in your face".\n\nTo be honest, I am not a Oddworld fan like most of you reading this. Why? Well I always wanted to try it, having received many recommendations for this series, but I just never had the time.\nNew N tasty was my first real experience with the Oddworld franchise and it was a good one. This is a game that I can recommend to just about anyone...as long as you can stomach the humor.\nIf you are a fan of the puzzle-platformer genre and this is not in your collection then you are missing out on a unique experience, so do yourself a favor and get this game!\nBut...because there is always a but... If you want super speed levels and like the kind of game you can get in somebody's face and do some damage then this is not for you. New N tasty plays like a stealth & strategy platformer, which may or may not be what you are looking for.\n\nAnd that's about it, for a clearer view on the actual game you can watch my first impressions video on it (1080p 60fps).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZDPQHg86S4&index=2&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","February 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 210 of 252 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","210","252","14","5"

That game was ♥♥♥♥ing weird and terrifying and brutal and it looked like absolutely nothing else, like a hallucination inspired from the pages of the Codex Seraphinianus. The original is a classic for a younger age, but it's almost impossible to go back to because it looks so damn ugly in low resolution. But thank Christ for Oddworld: New N' Tasty, because it's a really wonderful reimagining of the classic.\n\nFor the purists: New 'n Tasty is a reimagining of the original, and it's about 90% as good. The technology used by the original developers is pretty much out of reach with the budget that Oddworld Industries used to have (they used to be funded by GT Interactive, they are their own boss now), so everything's been reconstructed in an entirely different engine, which takes away a bunch of the charm of the original. A bunch of the hallmarks that the original had are gone (R.I.P., Original Scrab Scream), and sometimes the audio triggers don't work all that well... it's not a perfect game, but by God, it's Abe's Oddysee in the flesh, occasionally stumbling over a mark or hitting a flat note, but it's still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good game. The analog controls take getting used to, especially for devoted fans of the original who will need to retrain in order to successfully re-navigate deadly traps (or, if you're lazy and impatient like me, just press the quicksave key and go at that ♥♥♥♥ Hotline Miami style).\n\nAll of what I just said is minor infractions in the face of the actual game - it's a very smart, frustrating puzzler, and believe it or not, it's done entirely in Unity. A lot of the apsects of the game compared to the original are massively improved - all the areas flow seamlessly together, and the game feels like it moves at a quicker pace. Moving around and interacting with things is a lot less sluggish since the tank controls got replaced! And a lot of the puzzles and environments have been redone for modern times computers! It's the best possible version of Abe's Oddysey and it brings a classic back from the dead.\n\nFor non-purists: Look at it. Just look at it. You play as a green nightmare who teases yellow banana things on robot legs. Then later you run away from monsters that look like hands that have grown legs. If you can't get into that ♥♥♥♥ I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. Maybe go back to your G.I.

Oh, and you can now call groups of Mudokons like you did back in Exoddus, so no more backtracking! Yay!\nThe controls aren't what they used to be, you now have 2 types of controls which you can change according to your liking. You still might do some undesirable actions and die, but that's only in the beginning. Give it time and you'll get used to it!\nThe cutscenes are pretty much all the same, apart from a selected few that got a few changes, and some new ones!\nThe soundtrack is great, it takes the old players back with the amazing themes from 1997, but this time with improved audio quality.\n\nTo new players:\nIf you're new 'n' about to taste(y) a slice of this game, get ready to enjoy one of the best remakes of all time.\nNew 'n' Tasty is a 2,5D side scroller filled with puzzles and different kinds of enemies to deal with, while trying to escape the evil meat processing plant, RuptureFarms, and at the same time rescuing all your comrades, the Mudokons, who are slaves to this awful place. All of this with a taste of comedy in the middle to break the tension every now and then! :)\nWith amazing and colourful visuals, you have a lot to see and a lot of gorgeous locations to visit and be amazed, in Oddworld!\n\nTo all:\nThe framerate is very stable, my graphics card is pretty old but still managed to run the game without any issue whatsoever.\nI got no graphical glitches or artifacts, the game froze once but it was on startup and didn't harm the saved game.\nAlt+Tab no problem.\nRagdolls!\nA couple engine glitches, but nothing game breaking or serious. It was actually funny!\nSome issues when trying to go past the fast grinding meat machines.\nQuicksave/Quickload system very accessible!\nOnline leaderboards (Saved Mudokons and clearing speed).\nDLC's:\nAlf's Escape is a 1 hour (average time) campaign, where you must rescue Alf through a couple of sections. Great fun, good puzzles, worth the pricetag!\nScrub Abe Costume is basically a skin for Abe, not that special but it's up to you if you want it or not. It is there nonetheless.\nI now hope to see a remastered version for Exoddus, and if it's as good or better than this one, count me in!\n\nOverall, this is a very good title which didn't let me down, I loved the original and I love this one. You don't need to play the first one, but if you're a veteran I know you will, just as will I.","February 26, 2015","true","20.9"," 71 of 74 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","71","74","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/recommended/314660/","SavageBeastZero","SavageBeastZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/","609 products in account","Introduction\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty is the seventh game set in the Oddworld series that has spanned across 20 different platforms to date. The Oddworld universe and the beloved main character Abe's first appearance was on the Sony Playstation in 1997, which released to immense critical acclaim, winning multiple, much deserved game of the year awards and was instantly projected into the rarely achieved elite status as one of the best games ever created. Fast forward 18 years and the initial title Abe's Oddysee graphically speaking didn't age well whatsoever, yet the gameplay of course has still stood the test of time.\n\nWith that being said, can the newly developed Abe's Oddysee: New and Tasty ressurrect what was once considered a pinnacle of the industry and return the franchise to it's past glory? Can developers Just add water do this with grace, remaining faithful to fans as well as the series roots that built them? Let's take a deeper look into the Oddworld Universe once again and see if Abe's Oddysee is still as endearing as it was all those years ago....\n\n\nOverview\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty is a reimagining of the 1997 platform/puzzler classic Abe's Oddysee. Here you take the role of Abe, a pleasantly delightful award winning janitor, who discovers his glukkon overlord employers at Rupture Farms, have decided to attempt to increase their profit margins by using your species as the ingredients of their new food products.\n\nAs Abe, you attempt to escape, while freeing as many of your fellow mudokens as possible, you will encounter an assortment of challenging situations that are each more life threatening than the next. With locals, visually each more awe inspiring than the next, you'd be hard pressed to not be impressed with the care taken in recreating this beloved classic.\n\nDevelopers, Just Add Water have managed to not only recreate the experience many of us grew to love years ago, but have reimagined it by such great lengths that simply calling it a remake is doing it a great injustice. For fans of the original or simply fans of amazing gaming exoperiences, Abe's Oddysee: New and Tasty is one to remember!\n\n\nStory Experience\n\nMany as well as I, consider the tale of Abe and his oddysee to be heavily influenced by Stanley R. Greenburg's screenplay Soylent Green. Although there are substancial differences between the two, the general principle behind them both are quite similar.\n\nIn Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty, you'll establish a relationship with your lovable protagonist within mere minutes, as he walks across the screen happily buffing the floors of his workplace and as he continues down the halls, by chance, he discovers the shocking truth, in regards to, the gukkons plans for the frightening future they have in store for his mudoken race. As you continue your journey, you'll truly want to see Abe to his safety, so he can live to see another day and that is incredibly rare achievement.\n\n\nGameplay Quality\n\nDuring your journey, you will encounter a differing mix of platforming and puzzles both of which are excecuted to perfection. I simply can't find anything to gripe about in terms of gameplay and must commend Just Add Water for their skillful recreation.\n\nAbe's Oddysee: New and Tasty, like the many other platforming classics that have come before it, shows why this genre during the 80's and 90's was considered the measurement to which all other genres were judged. Precise movements, challenging scenarios and a multitude of other gamplay elements that bring it all together creating a seamless gaming experience. It's exactly these reasons why the platform/puzzler genre is one of the most difficult to successfully design. You must make each gameplay element mesh, unbeknownst to the player, without them ever feeling forced and Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty nails them all without blinking an eye.\n\n\nGraphics and Optimization Quality\n\nAbe's Oddysee is something to behold, especially so while being played at high resolutions. The 3D models, environments and well...everything was crafted with care and detail. There's simply not a thing in this universe that isn't a sigt to behold. The art style is ageless, as well as original still to this day. There aren't many worlds that resemble anything close to the Oddworld games and in this day and age of copy/paste to succeed, it's fantastic to know that artistic experiences like these can still exist.\n\nIn regards to optimization, Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty runs amazingly smooth and across the three workstations I've tested it on, each experience at their respective resolutions were simply magnificent. A fantastic port, filled with just enough graphics options to make the PC gamer happy. Directly below, in the screenshot, lists the available graphics options.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468039925\n\nResolutions can be selected up to 4K and can be achieved by systems of moderate hardware resources, all easily at 60fps. Yet even at lower resolutions of sub 1080p, Abe's Oddysee is still a breathtaking experience. So overall, if someone were to complain, they would simply be rustling up problems that don't exist in the games coding. They would lay within your system and not that developers lack the ability or excecution to bring you a successful product, because they did and a grade A experience at that, did they bring you.\n\n\nSound Quality\n\nThis is something that shouldn't be overlooked when judging the Oddworld games, specifically one's with Abe as the protagonist, due to the vocal nature of his gameplay. The sound in New and Tasty adds so much depth to the experience, it simply cannot be overstated. Without Abe's hello's, follow me's, whistles to name a fwe, the game just wouldn't have the same effect.\n\nAside from aiding the character development and gameplay elements, the other sounds in the game add quite a bit of atmosphere, making you feel that this world is genuine at every turn. From ambient environment sounds, to the sounds of enemy sligs firing away with their weapons as you evade their attacks, each and every element comes together to create a living breathing world.\n\n\nReplay Value & The Bottom Line\n\nAlthough, the Oddworld games aren't known for their replayability due to their linear nature, they are still very much so games that you would revisit from time to time over the years. With that being said Abe's Oddysee: New and Tasty is no different. A classic experience that, once purchased, you have the privilage of re-experiencing again and again throughout the years. Yet, this time I foresee Abe's Oddysee standing the test of time for a much longer duration than the original, due to the immense amount of effort given by Just Add Water. With that being said, it is without a doubt that I beg you to buy Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty for your own benefit, because this is a game that truly must be experienced by all.\n\n\nFinal Judgement:   Add to cart and buy it now at full price!\n\nAn instant classic, that deserves the full retail price no matter how high. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty is a classic amongst, classics. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty wasn't just a successful reimagining, it was a gaming triumph that has made history once again!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468039898","June 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 92 of 108 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","92","108","7","12"

This is without a doubt as close to a perfect remake of a game as you can get. They added a few things here and there I thought was a little 'odd', but then again, it's made for modern gamers with pure faith to the classics structure, after so much time into the game, you don't notice them and they do blend in with the creativity of the world.

AKA, *Whistle* *Whistle* *Fart* "Ok."\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Somehow manages to be better than the original.\n-Welcomes newcomers with a health system and slightly dumber Sligs while giving the old players some love with "Hard Mode" and achievements.\n-Old gamespeak works even better with new dialogue, it sure beats "Hello.", "Hello.", "Follow Me.", "Ok."\n-An "ALL 'O YA!" button! Man, it was a pain only calling one Mudokon at a time.\n-QUIK SAVE!\n-Still fun chanting and controlling Sligs...then killing them.\n-The game scrolls instead of cutting into "Scenes" see: Slideshow.\n-Graphics look "Next Gen", whatever that means.\n-A little bit of PC love with rebindable keys and graphics options!\n\nThe Meh:\n\n-Co-op mode is kinda silly...."Oh i died, here buddy, take my keyboard....oh you died, here, give it back."

Now with New 'N Tasty, newcomers can enjoy that old game but in a completely new(and tasty) way. If you have never played the original, no need, just play this, trust me, it'll save you some money in keyboard replacements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/314660/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","Stumbling upon the store page for Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty, I bought the game upon a whim. I’d remembered an “odd” series of Playstation platformers and thought to myself, another day, another HD remaster. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking that. For all their care and attention, games are at risk of repeating themselves to an audience whose familiarity with the very subject is the game’s own greatest weakness. It’s a wonderful thing, to see a game rendered so beautifully, and there are many HD remasters which have proven successful and proven that they provide an experience that is richer, deeper, and more satisfying than the original. But dragging the gameplay of yesteryear into the high definition of today begs the question – is that how we used to play? Are games really that different?\n\nOddworld has always been an outlier. Originally developed for PlayStation, Oddworld was both a revelation for its story, GameSpeak and its charming mix of beautiful CG and challenging 2D puzzle-platforming, but how it kept to a gameplay model which had been quickly discarded to create dazzling 3D worlds for gamers to run around in. A year since Super Mario 64 and the well of 2D platformers had just about dried up. Games were easier, and gamers demanded more stunning environments than ever before. The world of Oddworld is a mirror to our own; a satire on capitalism, environmentalism and the natural order. Driven by this theme and not the technology as so many other games were made it a far cry from its competition and a risky proposition for any publisher. If anything, its message, if it indeed has one, is all the more relevant than ever before.\n\nWhich brings us to the game we stand before today. New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground up recreation of Abe’s Oddysee, and like the very best of remakes, it changes and challenges what you know from the original game while giving you a new experience. Everything is new, from the character models, backgrounds and cinematics, nothing has been re-used from the original game. New ‘n’ Tasty is the rare treat in that the developers have used new tech to recreate and enhance the experience. Gone are the flip-screen backgrounds, they now scroll, and this is a major feature that adds greatly to the gameplay.\n\nThe story starts with Abe, a lowly slave toiling away in “the biggest meat-processing plant on Oddworld”, Rupture Farms. Stumbling upon the organisations plans to literally turn him and his fellow slaves into the next product, he decides to break free, and along the way, saves fellow workers and discovers his destiny. As a feeble and everyman character, Abe is unique in that he has no real powers, doesn’t wield weapons and uses the GameSpeak system in order to help his fellow slaves to safety.\n\nAs a creature, Abe is difficult to love. His very alien look fits well within the game, and he is emotive with large eyes and powerful body language, but it is the GameSpeak system that requires you to talk to fellow slaves, or possess enemies in order to progress that provides the most satisfaction. The storyline breeds hope that the Mudokons are not a forsaken race and that Abe is the “chosen one” that will lead them all back to their natural roots. The mudokons fit in well with a cast of characters each as bizarre and unique as the last, with paramites and scarabs trying to eat you while enemy sligs and their ravenous slogs are out to kill you. The gameworld is a brutal one for a powerless mudokon, but with GameSpeak, the power is literally in your hands to rise above.\n\nChallenging as it may be, the gameplay isn’t too difficult and most gamers should only find the rare frustration. The addition of checkpoints, and a quick save gives you more of a safety net than you probably truly need, and there is a good variety of difficulty settings. The difficulty curve ramps up hard towards the middle of the game, and gets quite difficult towards the end, but the challenge is mitigated with the satisfaction of success.\n\nAnd even two decades on, the levels and gameplay remains surprisingly engrossing and just as riveting. Abe’s travels through the bowels of Rupture Farms, the harsh security of the outer walls and into the natural wilderness from which the Mudokon belong is still a compelling journey. Deadly puzzles await you from various meat grinders to vigilant security guards, mines and perilous drops, and death always seems moments away. New ‘n’ Tasty remains a testament to the solid design of the original, and it has been recreated in excellent detail.\n\nStill, not everything old is new again, and some minor details have been trimmed to make a more cohesive package. Even so, New ‘n’ Tasty is a relatively lengthy challenge, it took me around 8 hours to complete, and upon completion I had only saved about 60% of the 300 Mudokons, with many remaining hidden.\n\nOverall, New n Tasty is a testament to how a remake should be done. It enhances the original game while also sticking to what works. New ‘n’ Tasty remains a honest-to-goodness platform puzzler with a story to tell and a world to embrace, and remains something unique in a world of “me-too” gaming. Well worth picking up.\n\n8.0/10","March 29, 2015","true","15.0"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","38","42","2","6"

Buy it or be ground into Paramite Pie!\nAlso buy the DLC "Alf's Escape" or be baked into Scrab Cake!\nNot convinced yet? They put in an "All o'ya!"-Command, so buy it already or be chopped into Mudokon Pops!\n\nFor people who don't know the franchise:\nThis is a rework of an old game from way back in 1997. It's a platformer and since you probably already watched the trailer, you know the setting. Back in the days, it had this unique mechanic with gamespeak, which you use to rescue your fellow Mudokons from the heinous Rupture Farms! The world is bizarre and the game has a very special kind of humor. Very often, when you get crushed by a boulder or miss a platform you don't cry out in pain but have a hearthy laugh instead, because it looks so silly! That's the kind of game this is, it's a happy time game! I played it on hard difficulty, and if you want to finish with 100%, then this game can have some challenging moments. Otherwise, it's pretty straight forward and of a rather short length. Plays nicely with an Xbox Controller, Keyboard does the trick just as well.\n\n10/10 Nostalgics can't wait for "Brew'n'Tasty!" !","October 11, 2015","true","13.7"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","37","41","13","0"

Not only does it capture the original game almost perfectly and brings it to the modern audience, it presents itself so well. This game is absolutely gorgeous. This is how a remake should be. Not just uping the resoultion and tweaking the graphics or textures. This game puts some "HD remakes" to shame honestley.\n\nIn terms of the PC release. Not much has changed. it's still the same game. It also has the Alf's Escape DLC as well as the Scrub Abe outfit DLC. However unlike some games which get ported from the console to the PC, Oddworld: New 'N' Tasty was not rushed. It was not lazily ported just to say "hey look, it's on PC now" no, Oddworld New 'N' Tasty is an excellent port. The devs worked hard getting it right. I was actually lucky enough to test the game as they wanted as much feedback as possible. This is how to do ports. OWI and JAW are some of my favorite devs in the world, They actually listen to their fans.\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay wise, It plays really well. The game works fine on both Mouse/Keyboard and on a Controller. You can switch between the two fine whilst ingame. The new mouse aiming feature is a nice addition and fully rebindable keys is great. I personally rebindined the controls for Keyboard to match the original Abe's Oddyses, as I played the original game on PC a lot in the past.\n\nSpeaking of which, The game itself plays just like the original Abe's Oddysee as expected. You can chant, run, walk, climb up platforms and speak to fellow Mudokons. They added a few Abe's Exoddus features like "All 'Ya!" and Quicksaving into Oddysee which is very nice indeed, especially how the original game had a poor saving system. The only criticism I have in terms of gameplay is that the game does have it's fair share of bugs and glitches. Most of them are only minor but other people have experiance game breaking problems before. Also, The new controls are a bit wonky. Sometimes you can hop and walk slightly to give away your position getting yourself killed. Something which is easily fixed by turning on both the "button to run" and "hopping" options. I HIGHLY recommend you do that, regardless if your playing with Keyboard or Controller. Other then that. Running then Rolling or turning is also not as responsive as the original.\n\nAnd whilst on the topic of gameplay, Some areas have been designed with the difficulty in mind. What i mean is, if you play some areas on Hard. It makes it a lot harder to beat the level. This is because on either Normal or Easy, Abe has hit points and can survive enemy fire. On Hard, you die in one hit.  Keep this in mind if you want to play on Hard mode. But I recommend doing that anyway, because if you beat the game on Hard, you've beat the game on Easy and Normal. (achievement wise)\n\nPerformance\n\nNew 'N' Tasty runs extremely well on most systems. It has a very low spec requirement so it's been optimized very well. I played it on a Nvidia GTX 660 ti without vsync and I had above 100fps. The game did not once crash or have any lag spikes whatsoever. One of the best ports I've seen in a long time. If you have a decent PC, crank this game up to max quailty settings and enjoy it's visuals and smooth frames!\n\nGraphics\n\nI mentioned how the game is absolutely gorgeous before. And it is. it looks bloody amazing. The lighting effects in particular are outstanding making some areas look breathtaking. (Free-Fire Zone and Scrabania are stunning) the game also has some excellent looking models, shadow effects, particle effects and physics (which can be a bit glitchy, but that's the best thing about ragdoll physics!)\n\nThe only minor thing I'd say which could of been better are that some of the textures look a bit low res.\n\nConclusion\n\nOddworld New 'N' tasty is an outstanding game with so much, love and dedication put into it. I can't help but just to repect the hard working devs over at Just Add Water and Oddworld Inhabitants. You guys if your reading this. Have done an amazing job and you should be so proud of yourselves!\n\nWithout a doubt, the best remake I've ever played and should be held as THE prime example of HOW REMAKES SHOULD BE.\n\n... That is until they make Abe's Exoddus HD of course. :P","February 25, 2015","true","28.5"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","45","64","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/recommended/314660/","hamakei","Hamakei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/","1098 products in account","I love the Oddworld series. I own all of the games in the series, and in fact have bought Abe's Oddyssee four times - once for Playstation, once for PC, once on GOG.com and again on Steam. Now I've effectively bought it a fifth time in the shape of New'n'Tasty.\n\nFirst of all, it looks absolutely stunning. JAW have managed to capture the look and style of the original game whilst bringing it bang up to date - the new character animations are gorgeous, background effects really add to the atmosphere, and the 3D effects work without being distracting.\n\nSound wise, it's a great improvement. Higher sample rate, more dynamic music, and yes! Lorne Lanning voices Abe again. In addition, there is a lot more dialogue so there's less repetition when talking to characters.\n\nJAW have also added many of the improvements that appeared in Exoddus - you can now Quicksave rather than relying on checkpoints, and an "Everybody" option has been added so you can move Mudokons en-masse.\n\nThe levels themselves are similar without being exactly the same - there are extra secret areas, and many sections of the game are longer with more screens thereby meaning that knowledge of the original Abe won't guarantee success here.\n\nSo... all in all, a great update of a modern classic!\n\nNo. Whoever designed the controls for this abomination deserves to be put through the nearest meat grinder. Abe is slow and unresponsive, with a lethargic, lazy feel to the character, where every action has an artificial delay put into it, which you have to account for when moving between dangerous objects or defusing mines. I find it next to impossible to manage complicated sequences of moves, as the game will suddenly decide that I'm not holding down "Run" after all, and Abe will start walking, inevitably resulting in his death at the hands of a Scrab.\n\nIn addition, the controls have become needlessly complicated. Rather than using UP+DOWN to move elevators, you now have to USE it first. Rather than UP to go through doors, you now have to USE them. You now have dozens of extra controls which were completely unessential in the original, such as the ability to check your health (huh?). Despite having over 14 hours of game time with Abe, I still get my fingers knotted together trying to manipulate the character into doing what I want him to do.\n\nAlso, the flip-screen mechanic has been replaced by a standard side-scroller. This would work for a new game, but unfortunately it's just too different for Abe. In the original, if a Slig was on the same screen as you, on the same level, and facing you, he could see you. In N'n'T, that isn't a guarantee. They have a certain distance they can see, represented by a red cone. This isn't exactly intuitive for people used to Abe, though perhaps it'd be acceptable to newcomers. The "Anti-chanting" drones also behave differently. In the original Abe, if there was one on the screen with you, you couldn't chant unless you destroyed it. Now, they switch on and off depending on the distance you are from them. So you can find yourself unable to possess a Slig because you're one-step too far to the left or right from where the game wants you.\n\nWorse of all, the game is no longer tile-based - they've gone for a traditional hitbox based collision system, which means that a lot of the old game mechanics no longer work. You can try bunny-hopping over three mines by holding down the space bar - the first two will work, and the third will fail because you're two pixels out. In the original Abe you could effectively "bank" motions by pressing the next button whilst Abe was between tiles - this was essential for many of the harder puzzles, to ensure there was no wasted time with him stood still - you could get him to jump up to a ledge by pressing space just after he leaves the previous tile. None of that works here - it feels like a completely different game.\n\nSo, unfortunately, no. Whilst it may look and sound like Abe, it doesn't in any way feel like Abe. What we have here is something like a fan-port done by somebody whose seen the original game but never played it. Which is ludicrous as apparently JAW had the original source code to work with! Five million dollars this apparently cost. I think at least four of that went on the graphics.\n\nI've finished this game on hard, but am seriously questioning whether I can be bothered to go back and get some of the missing achievements because I really don't want to deal with the god-awful control system they insist we use!\n\nJust buy the original - it's less than 1/6th the price of this and is actually fun.\n\nI was originally hoping that they'd remaster Exoddus as well. Now I'm not so sure.","March 6, 2015","false","28.2"," 95 of 152 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","95","152","5","10"

When I was a child, I played Oddworld morning, noon and night. Although I could never beat Scrabania back then, I have since grown up and was able to beat it eventually when I got my own PC and was able to play it again. When I heard that JAW would be remaking the original, I was HYPED. And for good reason.\n\nThe visuals. OH MAN THE VISUALS. The original had some stunning backgrounds and designs and concepts, but they just cannot hold a candle to New 'N' Tasty. This game is visually stunning. And no other word can describe it. Just when walking through RuptureFarms in the first level, my breath was taken away at how different everything looked, yet everything was still based on the first game enough so that I knew exactly where I was in comparison to the original. Dear God this game is pretty. The lighting and skyboxes are amazing, which matters more in a 2D game than in most other games, but at the same time, they didn't cut corners with the foreground environment, either. It is obvious from beginning to end that the environment design is something that has been meticulously slaved over, as a chef would slave over his special dish, from start to finish.\n\nThe sound and music in this game is based, again, heavily on the original. Gamespeak has been redesigned and improved, which is a huge mercy. One of the most annoying parts about the foriginal was having to shepard Mudukons one at a time to portals. Now, you can simply get all their attention with "All o' ya!" and run them to portals in one trip. Sligs and Mudukon slaves now chat idly while working, which is a refreshing touch and one that gives every character a little personality. If they'd maybe put in more lines for a bit of variety (since hearing "If only I had a bomb~" from ten different Sligs was got a bit tedious towards the end), then that would have been an amazing addition. The music is much crisper and better than the original, too.\n\nAs for gameplay, this is where the 1/10 is deducted. Abe, this time around, feels far less rigid and more alive than he did in the original. While sneaking, he'll check his surroundings, his movements are far more akin to an actual living creature; when standing still, he'll rock slightly. When running, he'll take a little time to build up speed. These things are things a dedicated fan will instantly notice, and it'll make them smile every time. The controls, however, were ever so slightly clunky in my experience. I had more than a few deaths with Abe moving too far forward or not breaking into a run quickly enough (The part where you have to lead the bees to Elum), and with Abe deciding to hoist up to the level I had just jumped down from, instead of hopping to the other side, which happened more than a few times. Though both of these are changable in the options makes this partly my fault, but I do think they could have pointed such things out; it would have made playing through the game significantly easier.\n\nOverall, this is a stellar game, and one that truly is worthy of the "Oddworld Inhabitants" seal. It doesn't just beat the original; it blows it out of the water, like a son inheriting his father's factory and then turning it into a Fortune 500. This game, Just Add Water, is that Fortune 500, and for anyone who played and liked the original "Abe's Oddysee" I say:\n\n"Why haven't you brought this yet?"","March 2, 2015","true","14.6"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

Having only completed the game once 18 years ago, it turns out I remember very little which makes this less nostalgia and more like an entirely new experience.\n\nThe developers have taken certain liberties with the gameplay. For example, there is now a selection of 3 difficulties with "hard" being pretty much the same as 1997 with Normal and Easy having varying levels of health. Other differences including a major overhaul of the controls. This is an especially welcome change from the original, which on PC is a keyboard only affair.\n\nA lot of the frustrations from the original title have also made the HD leap. You will die a lot. But the saving grace is the quicksave feature. This is especially appreciated by those of us who are time poor.\n\nI feel that some of the charm of the game has worn off on me now that I am bloody old. The intro sequence and dialog in general feels juvenile. And the precence of mild profanity and "comical" violence means that it misses it's mark in terms of target audience. I think this is important to mention because of the original game makers ultimate goals to offer environmental, social and political commentary.\n\nThe audio from the original is largely untouched but the voices have been completely redone with a substantial amount of new content. There doesn't appear to be any surround sound at play which I think is a missed opportunity.\n\nGraphically, this is the best HD remake I have seen to date. It is somewhat faithfull to the original but the level of detail is far and beyond anything that would have been possible in 1997. It runs extremely well. Animation of the characters is well done but just like the original, transitions between actions is sudden which detracts from any sense of realism. This I think is a caveat of having a responsive control system.\n\nGameplay and controls are great. The game plays wonderfully and the changes made to the game work really well with the updated graphics and still fit well within the spirit of the original title.\n\nAll in all, fantastically done and well worth the asking price. Just a warning though, Abe will scare small children.\n","March 1, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

But there were some things that kept it from being truly legendary. For example, I prefered the way the original abe movement was, in terms of speed and precision. But in the end, it was able to take most of the original Abe's Oddysee aspects and remake them in a much more amazing way.\n\nStarting with the good:\n-I found the graphics astonishing.\n-The adaptation from the fixed camera to side-scrolling was amazing. They way they adapted the gameplay worked really well.\n-Most of the essencial things about the original game were kept.\n-The dialog is more evolved and sometimes really fun if you pay attention.\n-Amazing cut-scenes.\n-The soundtrack kept the same feel, yet better.\n-Hard Mode was Hard.\n-It was able to create some great new concepts and new gameplay aspects that kept the game from being a complete new experience even to old fans.\n\nThe bad:\n- One of the things that I really enjoyed about the original game was the way it looked dark; it brought a special feeling of how real the situation was. I think this remake lost a little bit of this feeling by abusing on the noise and brightness. Like the screens being colored, or everything being shiny.\n- There were a few bugs, not really that problematic, but a little irritating.\n- It gets slow on some parts if your computer isn't all that fantastic, which afects the gameplay a lot. (edit: removing the "glow" and the "bloom" effect help a lot. Makes the game so more enjoyable.)\n- Abe takes too long to actually start running; the gameplay would be so much better IMO if it this changed...\n\nThe both bad and good:\n- The ragdolls of dead characters are sometimes weird, but so funny.","April 14, 2015","true","42.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Before you start you may want to watch the lovely trailer here if you haven't already.\nYou can also watch the trailer to Alf's Escape here if you want to since I will be talking a little bit about it. Thank you and enjoy!\n\n\nIntro\nOddworld: New 'n' Tasty is remaster of the original masterpiece Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee which was developed by Oddworld Inhabitants back in 1997 which you can buy here.\nOddworld: New 'n' Tasty has been brewing for quite a few years now but it's finally released on PC! But is it just as good as the original? You play as a character called Abe who has been working for a factory called Rupture Farms\nfor years but he soon finds out that the meat packing company is running out of money, so they decided to kill all the working Mudokons at Rupture Farms and turn them into meat.\nAbe freaks out and starts his big quest to save all 250 Mudokons and take down Rupture Farms before it's too late! Because New 'n' Tasty is a remaster I will be grading it on the improvements and what they\nworked on from the original. So let's get started!\n\n\nGood Points\nNew 'n' Tasty has lots of positive things to talk about because Oddworld Inhabitants worked and improved on almost everything from the original game and you can really tell. Just by playing the game you can\nsee how much time and effort the developers put in and how much they enjoyed making it. These are the main good points that show the most in New 'n' Tasty.\n\nThe graphics are visually amazing to look at! Throughout the game there is so much detail from the faded warm glow on mushrooms to the bright light beams from the sun, New 'n' Tasty looks great. The one game  that looks alike would\nbe the Trine series which has the same graphical style and originality to them. You can run the game at 1920x1080 60fps which will improve and enhance the experience which will make the game look even better and rich in detail.\n\nNew 'n' Tasty's storyline is unique in it's own way, you will be interested and wanting to know what happens throughout the game which works well. Since New 'n' Tasty is a remaster it will be the same story which it is but they added\nbrand new cut-scenes which works really well and fits in perfectly. Slight spoiler here  there are different endings in the game depending on how many Mudokons you save which really works since it end with your own actions on\nwhat you done. Its around 8 to 15 hours depending on how you play.\n\nControls in New 'n' Tasty are truly perfect since there are so many different things you will need to do such as speaking to other animals and Mudokons as well as everything else. All of this put into one controller and works well is\na big accomplishment. There is also an option to set the controls to the same as Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee which is great for the old fans. You can also change the keys on PC if you would like so there is no reason not to like the\ncontrols.\n\nThe music is truly amazing to listen to when playing. It creates a perfect atmosphere all the way though the game which is great! It so good that you can just listen to it alone since all the songs sound so great, I hope that they will add the\nsoundtrack to buy on the Steam page since I would recommend it that much. Because they remasterd all the tracks it sounds great and new which works very well in the game.\n\nReplay value is important in every game and since New 'n' Tasty is just story based there is still some thing you can do afterwards such as the Leader-boards, achievements, trading cards and even a hard difficulty. These together\ngive you enough replay value to play more and give you enough time for how much the game costs.\n\nOddworld done a good job with the PC port since most people will be able to run the game. As long as your computer isn't ancient then you should be fine. To max the game out you will need a fairly good computer but it's no where\nnear as bad as some other ports which make you have a £600 computer. Overall it's a smooth port that has been worked well on.\n\nThere are loads of different and unique things in New 'n' Tasty such as being able to control enemies by chanting and being able to talk to anyone or anything you see. This it what makes New 'n' Tasty so great and unique which\nare brilliant things to do in the game.\n\nI'm going to talk about the length a little more. The storyline is around 8 to 15 hours alone, but if you want to play and 100% you will have well over 30 hours since there is achievements and saving all 250 Mudokons. Your\ngetting a lot of hours since the game is £14.99 which I think is a fair price to pay. In my opinion I would play New 'n' Tasty on hard since thats how it was on Abe's Oddysee and you will be getting a better experience since thats\nhow it's meant to be played.\n\nThe DLC is good, I don't really like DLC in games but Oddworld done it right since you don't need to buy it. You can buy it if you would like more of the game, this is how DLC should be made in my opinion. If you like the game\nthen I would recommend you get the DLC since its not that much money for what you get.\n\n\nBad Points\nAs you can tell, Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty has lots of good things about it. Yes there is a lot of positive things but there are just a few little annoying things about New 'n' Tasty which I think are tiny but worth a mention sadly.\nThese are the few things that I don't like in Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty.\n\nThere is just a few tiny bad points which are so small that they shouldn't get you to re-think about getting the game. The sound is a bit weird in which sometimes there are sound effects, it's in the game but it's just not played\nsometimes. There are also a few bugs and the original Abe's Oddysee had a darker feel to it which New 'n' Tasty does not have which is bad for old fans like myself. They are the only things I found to be bad in New 'n' Tasty.\n\n\nOverall\n\nOverall I think that Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is an amazing game which everyone should play since it's so different and unique! I love almost every thing about it and I will be playing for a long time. This still proves that Oddworld have\nstill got it and I hope to see them in the near future. Overall I am going to rate Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty 9.5 out of 10. Amazing game that is an almost perfect game, just a few small things wrong. I would recommend the game to anybody\nsince its such a unique and fun game. *fart* Hehehe.","February 25, 2015","true","32.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

I'll try to clear up some important distinctions on why:\n\nThis game is NOT a 1:1 remake of the original Abe's Oddysee, it is more of a re-imagining. It takes the core ideas from the game, the aesthetic, the story, and packages them in a way that seems comfortingly familiar until you start to realize... this isn't the same game at all!\n\nPerhaps some fans were expecting that, just a remastered audio/visual upgrade, but please come in knowing that while it may look like the same fish, swim like the same fish, it's actually a whale (that's a mammal).\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the old-style game, thankfully with some of the innovations from the sequel thrown in like being able to address multiple mudokons at once. The game also plays in the same 2D Platformer left/right style despite being presented in full 3D\n\nThe graphical upgrade to full 3D is a lot more than it may seem, instead of having a fixed camera like in the original, the camera moves dynamically to scroll with you, this actually makes it impossible for certain "gamey" aspects the original had from being possible. Those hidden areas that were so conveniently hidden behind a barrel in the foreground, or the shadows you crept through no longer work in this new style, and have been replaced with new puzzles, steam vents, and an complete overhaul of the level design of many areas.\n\nThe level design seems familiar, that elevator is still where you expected, that platform with that slig above that mudokon is still there, and so is that bird portal where you expected it to be. However this isn't the level you grew up with. There are now 299 Mudokons to rescue (vs. 99 in the original game) and they are not always hidden the same way, or require the same puzzles to be solved.\n\nThis is still an Oddworld game though through and through, and has just as much charm as the original did. The same humor is there, the same atmosphere, the same story and interesting visuals are all there. The game is still challenging and is very much a puzzle platformer with great and memorable moments and characters.\n\nThe change in puzzles and level design is actually a huge plus for veterans of the series as they are basically getting to experience the game new again, since the bulk of the challenge is in solving puzzles, getting to solve tons of new puzzles is a lot of fun and makes the game worth playing for new players and veterans alike.\n\nGo in expecting an Oddworld game with familiar mechanics but a complete new redesign and you won't be disappointed, if you go in expecting the Abe's Oddysee from 1997 with just a new coat of paint well then you may be scratching your head a bit.","January 30","true","6.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

To me it's a perfect blend of nostalgia and novelty.  If you played the original at all, you will recognize the levels and all the iconic landmarks and creatures, but from a different perspective.  The way the camera moves along the level actually makes it an easier playthrough than the original, where you could only see one block of the level at a time.  That's probably the biggest difference.  That, and when you throw objects, it's much easier to aim.  Beyond that, it stays true to the original and I really enjoyed it.\n\nA couple minor gripes: the default controls for gamepad are not identical to the original, but you can change that in the game options.  Another thing is the game lets you quicksave with a controller, but not quickload.  You have to go into the menu and load your quicksave, which isn't very quick at all.  The keyboard, however, does have a quickload key.  But when you opt to use a controller, the keyboard controls are disabled, so you can't even tap the quickload key real quick and resume playing with your controller.  If you play solely with the keyboard, this won't be a problem.\n\nEven if you haven't played the original, definitely give this one a try.  It's a great puzzle platformer with a unique world and vibe that I haven't really seen replicated anywhere else.\n\n","May 15","true","10.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

In fact, just about the only thing New ‘n’ Tasty borrows from its predecessor is its story and locations, as everything else has either been re-worked or re-tooled in some manner, shape or form. Whether it be the luscious new 3D visuals or the jaw dropping cut-scenes or even the improved sound effects and voice acting, Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty certainly has a lot of new content to offer.\n\nStory\nBeing a remake of the 1997 classic, the story is naturally carried over from the original – only this time retold through completely brand, spanking new cut-scenes that do an incredible job of re-capturing the feel of the original game, whilst also significantly improving upon them as well. They are truly a sight to behold! It becomes abundantly clear, as soon as you boot up the game, that a great deal of love and care has been poured into this project and boy, does it show. The story is also just as captivating and engaging as it was back in 1997 and if you’ve not played this game before, you owe it to yourself to do so. I won't discuss story specifics here, as I do not wish to spoil anything for newcomers.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay also borrows a lot from the original, though with some noticeable changes and improvements. The most obvious being that the entire game is now rendered entirely in 3D, meaning Abe is no longer walking across static pre-rendered backdrops but is instead a part of a living, breathing, 3D environment. Abe also returns with all of his abilities from the original game, with the addition of being able to throw an unlimited amount of bottle caps that serve the purpose of distracting enemies and also killing those pesky bats that were frustratingly annoying in its predecessor. It’s also now considerably easier to speak to your fellow Mudokons, thanks to the addition of a new Game Speak command that allows you to talk to all of the Mudokons currently on screen at once, whereas in the original game you could only speak to Mudokons one at a time - making certain parts of the game needlessly repetitive and tedious as you had to constantly back track if there were multiple Mudokons in a single location. The stakes are also much higher this time around as there are now 299 Mudokon slaves to rescue as opposed to only 99 in the original game.\n\nThere have also been changes to Abe’s movement – specifically his walking/running which is no longer bound to separate keys and pressing the jump button no longer causes a forward hop but rather a more traditional jump upwards. This was a problem during the initial PlayStation 4 release last year however since then “old school controls” have been patched into the game and are available right from the get go for PC players. So if you’re a seasoned veteran you’ll be happy to know that the original control scheme can be restored at the press of a button.\n\nIf you found the original game too difficult, fear not as difficulty settings are now available. If you’re a seasoned veteran however you’ll want to pick ‘Hard’ mode right off the bat for the classic one-hit deaths and ruthless puzzles that are made more timid on easier difficulty settings. There’s also the inclusion of a “Co-Op” mode, though I use this term lightly as it’s more of a ‘pass the controller to your friend when you die’ mode.\n\nPerformance\nIn terms of performance the game runs incredibly well. I was able to run the game at its maximum settings, whilst maintaining a constant 60 frames per second, with no noticeable frame drops at any given point in the game. This of course will vary depending on your PC hardware.\n\nLength\nThe game is of decent length, with the average player taking around 10-15 hours to complete it, depending on if you’re trying to find all of the secrets and rescue all of the enslaved Mudokons. Being a PC port, the game also features full keyboard and mouse support with re-bindable keys however I found that a controller felt more natural, due to the amount of keys required for all of the in-game actions.\n\nPC-Port Specifics\nThe PC version also has a number of other improvements since the initial PlayStation 4 release, including support for up to 4K resolutions at 60fps, full keyboard, mouse and controller support, improved readability in the front-end menus, configurable graphic options, full screen/windowed mode, v-sync, various bug fixes and arguably improved lighting. I say arguably improved lighting as the biggest difference I’ve noticed, from the PS4 release, is the amount of bloom that’s present – which is particularly noticeable during the opening cut-scene. Unfortunately the bloom is a little too much in some cases and there is no option to disable or even lessen the amount of bloom used, which is a little frustrating. The options menu itself is also somewhat disappointing for a PC port, with graphic options being nothing more than generic sliders that don’t really tell you all that much – however I’m just nit-picking at this point.\n\nBugs\nDespite the improvements and fixes made since the initial PlayStation 4 release, there are still a number of bugs that may disrupt or even derail your gameplay experience. Audio and graphical glitches, whilst not impeding your progress, can detract from the overall experience however during my play through, these were few and far between and mostly audible rather than visual (with certain sound effects being too quiet or simply not playing at all). I also encountered a game breaking bug whereby a secret room couldn’t be completed, as well as level breaking glitch much later on in the game that forced me to replay an entire chapter - as simply restarting from the previous checkpoint wasn’t enough to correct the glitch. The biggest problem I encountered however was when my game wasn’t properly saved and thus I lost hours of progress that I just couldn’t bring myself to replay – though it’s hard to say whether or not the game itself or Steam is to blame. As such, my play time was cut short and I don't particularly want to redo hours of progress until I can be certain these issues have been resolved.\n\nEDIT: I disabled Steam's Cloud Saving feature and was able to continue playing the game without any further save issues. I've now completed the game and I'm pleased to say I didn't encounter any more serious bugs - there were still one or two audio glitches where some sound effects wouldn't play (as I mentioned happening before). As for the broken secret room, I re-played the chapter and was able to beat it, so it is possible - it's just a bit temperamental (for reference, it's the secret room in the Stockyards with the two Slogs right at the start).\n\nConclusion\nOddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is an exceptionally well-crafted game that both veterans and newcomers alike will enjoy. Just Add Water and Oddworld Inhabitants have done an exceptional job, whilst also setting the bar for other developers to follow. Take note other developers - this is how you do a remake!","February 25, 2015","true","16.3"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TallGermanGuy/recommended/314660/","TallGermanGuy","Vados","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TallGermanGuy/","402 products in account","Updated for June 2nd 2015\nAbsolutely Fantastic "Remaster" of a game, although it does have its small but fixable flaws.\nMy first ever games were Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exoddus. I was always fascinated by the storytelling and the amazingly deep visuals those games brought forth. The eerie, yet comedic feel these two offered were one of a kind, and have yet to be matched by any other game. New 'n' Tasty delivers in bringing back that frightening feeling while also providing amazing graphics and breathtaking sceneries within the game. It basically feels the same, but is different in every way. The limitations of old hardware have been taken away and the game is much easier to follow and understand visually.\nThis game wasn't repolished, touched up, or upgraded, but instead built from the ground up, and it sure feels that way when playing. While this is mostly a very good thing, some elements of the classic were unfortunately lost in the process. The game still offers and presents its hard work, but the dark and rotten feeling of the original is missing in most of the game. Mudokon slaves aren't as "depressed" as they used to be, lots of the original art style in the sense of texturing and realism went missing, the controls are a tad off and the most disappointing part of this game really is the sound. The Original Odysee had sounds such as the haunting whistling that would give me shivers because it felt as if they would happen right beside me and the music is a lot more "electric" and "bass-y" compared to the natural and creepy sounding classic. That really is all the bad stuff I could find though.\nNowadays I only enjoy mostly Mutliplayer/Coop games and have trouble sticking onto a game which doesn't provide that criteria, but New 'n' Tasty has me dropping my jaw in a story which i know inside out. Anybody who has played the classic version of Abe's Odysee will be in love with this game if they're willing to accept these few flaws, and anyone interested in trying it should most certainly do so, even if just interested to experience the changes. This is the reboot of the first game, and with enough support i hope to see Exoddus be the next item on their list.\nAt the end of the day, this is still Oddworld, a place lost and forgotten, even unknown by some. Old players should rejoice that someone was willing to take this massive project up to deliver to its fans. New players will find themselves in a world so alien and in depth while playing on a 1080p monitor with beautiful visuals and storytelling. While the game does have some flaws, the only way to satisfy both "wanting more Oddworld" and having the near perfect experience the classics offered is to give this game a shot and see for yourself. While the original Oddworld Abe's Odysee was one of the best games ever, New 'n' Tasty still survives as a fantastic game through its flaws.\nA lot of the game's improvements and flaws are visible before you get 2 hours into it, and if you don't like it, go ahead and refund it!\nI have been waiting so long, but now i understand why. It was worth the wait.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPlease understand that the pros are very generalized compared to the cons because there was such a lack of poorly executed work in this game. Read the full review!\n\nPros:\n-Almost completely new and modern feel\n-Fitting graphics and visuals\n-Easier to follow and understand than the first game\n-Excellent camera work considering the transition from "slide-by-slide play" to flowing transitions.\n\nCons:\n-Lighting and surroundings feel inviting; Rupture Farms is a rotten, dark place that should drive anyone normal away\n-3D environment drives away the realistic texture work of the classic; Rupture Farms almost looks clean\n-Poor Controls, especially for the "Hard" or rather classic mode\n-Music is electric and bass-heavy, unlike the natural sounding classic that provided more sharp and "drummy" sounds\n-Mudokons make jokes and snarky comments, they're rather angered than lost and miserable about being slaves\n-Few cinematics redone without considering the true meaning of them; Changes perspective of Abe","February 25, 2015","true","11.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

In fact, it’s been quite the popular trend dating back to the God of War HD collection for the PS3 in 2009. Since then there have been numerous and, one might say, too many remasters and remakes.  If you look at the end of the previous console generation and the beginning of the current, it’s abundantly clear that these have been relied upon far too much. [en.wikipedia.org] The criticism of “too many remakes, not enough new IP” is quite fair. That said, very few if any of the remasters/remakes out there show the level of care and reverence that Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty exhibits.\n\n\nMy first exposure to the Oddworld series dates back to 1997 and the release of Abe’s Oddysee. Now, while I never played the game I distinctly remember the ads in EGM and Game Pro. Along with Soul Reaver no other game during that time had such striking and wonderful ads. I saw a dingy and strange world that looked unlike anything I had seen before, and the prerendered backgrounds looked breathtakingly realistic. The first time I actually got my hands on an Oddworld game was the wonderful Stranger’s Wrath HD. The world-building and unique characters stuck out as something derived from a fever dream and the setting was unlike anything I had seen before. When New ‘n’ Tasty was announced I knew I had to jump back in to the franchise.\n\n\nPlaying New ‘n’ Tasty for the first time was quite a joy and I see why this franchise (especially the first two) are so beloved, it’s smart and inventive puzzle platforming. You play as Abe, the bungling unlikely hero, out to rescue all of your fellow Mudokon’s and overthrow the evil Rupture Farms. Oddworld is a dangerous place and Abe must use his brain, not his brawn, to solve puzzles. The levels are thoughtfully designed and provide a sense of accomplishment upon clearing a room. Enemies can kill you at the drop of a hat so patience is best used instead of trying to brute force a puzzle.  Luckily, you have the ability to quicksave anywhere in the game and reload just as fast which makes getting shot by a Slig much more tolerable.\n\n\nAs far as the quality of the remaster, many of the levels appear to be a faithful reimagining with some small tweaks here and there. The game itself looks quite stunning and I found myself pausing when presented with beautiful background vistas to enjoy the view. This is not a simple coat of paint but rather a complete rebuilding of the first game, quite an undertaking but one that seems to be well worth it. The excessive bloom and lens flare may distract some but I quite enjoyed the overall aesthetic of the game and it seemed to keep the grungy, lived-in feel of the original.\n\n\nAs a platformer and mechanics go, the fairs pretty well but is not without its faults. The jump button in particular seemed to be a hair off in some spots resulting in a frustrating death. This small bit of latency (although not always present) can undermine great level design and layout when I push a button and Abe doesn’t react accordingly. Luckily these control issues are not ever present and only rear their ugly head every so often.\n\n\nOddworld: New ‘n’ tasty is an excellent jumping off point for those looking to get into the series and what should be good nostalgia trip for fans of the originals. With the next game, Soulstorm, in the works it’s good to see that we will be getting more out of the Oddworld series as it truly is one of gaming’s most unique and bizarre settings.\n","May 7","true","7.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The game is very much like its original version. It has its pros and cons, for example few times I died without reason when Abe was hanging from a ledge(did happen only in rupturefarms and zulags and only when there were enemys nearby) and when he died he just hovered on stage and nothing you could do. Sometimes when I used a door Abe just went there and never came back aka changed the stage the game just froze and you couldnt push any button or do anything.\nOverall I think that the game was slightly easier than the original because you could quicksave and plan your route for Abe because there are many more boxes Abe could be on(If you get what I mean). But I think that the easiness is a good thing because if you would give somebody the original game to play he would quit in 10 minutes for the game being so sloppy and hard, the easiness helps newcomers to play the game.\nAnd how good the game was? Well, it is a true Oddworld experience even with the slight changes they made for example on the camera-screen. The game is totally worth playing.","December 17, 2015","true","24.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

So this review is of a game, I was really hyped for a ♥♥♥♥ lot of time. I also played all of the other Oddworld games, beginning when I was 6. I grew up with them and the stories played a mayor role for me in my childhood. The more I wanted this game to be the better and tastier than all others before.\n\nGameplay\nThe game features mostly the same mechanics as Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. For oldschool fans, it is hard to get used to the new default keyboard settings and I am not sure, if they are an improvement. The mechanics are otherwise, as in Abe's Oddysee, still well and slowly explained through the level-design and helpful notes, whenever you reach a new obstacle.\n\nGraphics\nGraphically, it has fancy next gen graphics and fluid animations. There is only one big problem. It seems not to very good support some graphics cards from Nvidia, which make the game run fluently only on tiny resolutions and with all the settings (especially shadows) set to very low. This may be fixed in near future, since it is was released the day, I wrote this review. The cutscenes however run fast even with all the settings set to max.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack has really improved since the original game. It is ambientic, and really puts you in the right emotions. Only a shame, they don't offer it as extra content to buy.\n\nStory\nThrowing you right into the action, the story is still the same awesome story of Abe, as he first flees from Rupture farms, freeing all his buddies, just to get godly powers to finally shut it down afterwards. It is very well told in great way, as it was in the original game too. The story has no twist. It is easy to understand, unique and yet still really thrilling.\n\nMy Rating\nThe game is a fantastic remake of a cult classic and I love it!\n\nGameplay: 9/10 (-Weird default controls)\nGraphics: 8/10 (-Still very buggy!!)\nSoundtrack: 10/10 (Would love to buy)\nStory: 10/10 (Classic, Awesomely told, Unique)\n\nOddworld: New 'n' Tasty!  9,25 / 10  Awesome game, that can only possibly improve through bugfixing.","February 25, 2015","true","46.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Now you don't have to rescue 99 Mudokons, but 299!\nNew cool things include:\n- Screen which scrolls along with you;\n- New, very comfortable control scheme;\n- Leaderboards;\n- New sound effects and voices;\n- A lot of other amazing things.\nThe graphics and models are extremely well made, and they look just like the old sprites, but in 3D and HQ. If you have a weak laptop/PC, you'll be able to adjust the quality of everything, so you can still play it (coming from a 1.8ghz, 4GB RAM Laptop)! And don't worry that the game will look ugly if you put everything on the lowest settings, because the game will still look pretty!\nNew 'N' Tasty recreates all levels very accuratelly, and they're a lot more fun to play now!\n\nFor this review, I just cannot find words for the game. This is the best game of 2015 to me so far. I loved every single moment of it, and I'm looking forward to 100% it and get all the achievements.\n\nIt's a MASTERPIECE!","March 1, 2015","true","30.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It boasts compatibility for keyboards or controllers, as well as fixing some stability issues that original game release had here on steam. The 2.5D platforming it originally boasted now feels fresher and easier to follow with the new graphics and improved camera. You still have to be very mindful of your surroundings, as they kept all the tricks and traps, and probably added more. Abe's tweaked movement system allows you to move a lot faster when need be, but it's quite easy to screw up and slam your face into a wall and get shot up/smashed/sliced/diced/etc...It's pretty much the original one brought into the new age. Farts, here boy and follow me included.\n\nIf you liked the original and want to experience it with a lovely fresh coat of paint, buy it.

I'll say straight off the bat that it's not as hard as the original - even in hard mode. It's very close but the generally rework of the puzzles and the quick saving made it much easier - probably because the original wasn't made with Quick Save in mind anyway.\nOverall though I really loved this game and I can't wait for whatever the company has next for us (It may be Oddworld: Abe's Exxodus which would be amazing).\n\n-/+ Finished in just under 7 hours (Maybe more I'm not entirely sure how they work out the time and I've played the original many many times from start to finish)\nFastest 100% Speedrun for Abe's Oddysee was 1h 15m, New 'n' Tasty is 2h 14m\n-/+ It sets up the room for more games (Engine and money)\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","March 7, 2015","true","13.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

If this isn't a love letter to not only the original developers, but to the dedicated ODD fans worldwide, I don't know what is. This reimagining is so beautiful it is astounding.\n\nI'll admit I had my doubts about all of the hype, growing up with the Oddworld franchise I really didn't expect an HD remodeling of the entire game to be so impressive. I ate my expectations with sriracha. I choked it down.\n\nNot only do they lovingly keep the original storyline, they added even more depth to it all. The characters, the atmosphere, the lore. All of it feels so rich and a wonder to explore. The levels are completely redone from the ground up and you can tell how much effort went into each reimagined design. Many of the original puzzles and set peices are kept, while others have multiple tweaks and additions.\n\nThe original '97 title gave you 99 Mudokons to save or kill.\nThis title gives you 300 Mudokons to save or kill.\nThat should give you a little idea on how much extra content JAW has put into this game.\n\nThey added difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard - being the closest to the original.\n\nThey added new mechanics such as throwing bottle caps and flint rocks for distraction/puzzle solving and changing the control scheme to fit the feel better - I.E., mainly changing your move button to the analog stick for a constant run. Oldschool Oddites need not worry, for you can still change the control scheme at any time to slow down and get to hoppin' like back in the day.\n\nI highly, highly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/314660/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4210 products in account","As one of the signature games for the original PlayStation, Abe’s Oddysee was a reason for many people to get the system.  Nearly 20 years later, the game is back with a graphical upgrade.  By changing how the game looks, it changes how the core game is like.\n\nThe most obvious difference between the original and remake is the graphics.  The original game would present the scene one screen at a time.  Each screen in the original game is mostly a static screen.  In order to see what is on the next screen, the player has to walk off the screen.  Besides limiting how far you can see, the transaction is jarring because of the blind switch and new position.  This game makes it easier by scrolling the scene along with the player.  As long as the scene is horizontal or vertical, the screen will move along with the player.  The only time that the game stops scrolling is when it is time for a directional change.  By moving the game along with the player, it feels more like a real world instead of simply a series of slides.\n\nWhile the new graphics does improve the style, it actually hurts it when it comes to gameplay.  Throughout the game, there are many secret areas where are other prisoners.  With the original game, it was a challenge simply to find them.  The problem with the remake is that many of these areas are exposed.  In one area, there is a pit of landmines that the player needs to jump over.  The static viewpoint in the original game tells you to avoid the pit at all costs.  As you approach this spot in this game, the camera will tilt to show that there is a hatch underneath.  This tells the player to find a way to get rid of the landmines.  By making it that the new view sometimes reveal secrets, it ended up taking away from experience.  This just goes to show that is sometimes better to keep things the way they originally meant to be.\n\nDespite that detail, the core gameplay has not changed.  The objective is to get yourself and the other prisoners out without getting killed by the guards, hazards, or creatures.  Most games would allow you to fight your way using your muscles or a weapon.  However, because your character is weak, fighting is not an option.  In order to get around, the player has to carefully navigate the area.  Since all the enemies and hazards are like parts of a machine, it requires thinking to know how to make them all work together.  This makes it that the game is less of an adventure game and more like a puzzler instead.  Once an area is cleared, it is a satisfying feeling knowing that it was all you and not just a happy accident.  The problem with this is that once the game is completed, there is not much reason to go back since you know what to do.\n\nFor those that played the original version, the new look alone might not be enough to justify replaying.  As for those new to the franchise, this is definitely worth the trip.  Even the original, pure 2D version shows why this is considered a classic.  With Abe’s Exoddus currently being remade as Soulstorm, the only thing to wonder is when will they finally make a truly new game.","May 31","true","17.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Not an upscaled version of its predecessor like most games subtitled "remastered". Unlike the majority of remasters, this one plays well and looks visually pleasing, just as we would expect. Although, I, as well as many others are disappointed at the lack of grittiness that the original Oddworld: Abes Oddysee has. The Sligs are much more complex this time around. You cannot simply kill multiple Sligs with your own, possessed one like you could in Oddysee and Exoddus. To avoid this, which I am also disappointed at, is to use the camera to your advantage. Once a Slig is out of your camera range, you can simply kill the others then march forward to kill the rest.\n\nMore challenging puzzles, well thought out secret areas. Beautiful (but out of place) scenery and more Abe.\nLove it.

The game is absolutley gorgeous and rebuilt from the ground up, I can absolutley say that it is worth the £14.99 asking price, you get more out of it than some AAA titles that cost £50+. Not only are the graphics beautiful, but the game is also suprisingly easy to run at 1080p (i can run it at 50Fps medium settings) considering it is built in a 3D environment.\n\nThe gameplay does not at all let you down, with a few control tweaks which are easily accessible in the settings menu, you can create quick and easy controls for fast action platforming. The gameplay is very fluid and exciting, you might think it is another silly kid's game that can be abandoned in a dark corner of Steam, but no, it is one of the most thrilling and exciting experiances you will have as a gamer. The story, gameplay, graphics, sounds and animations are some of the best I have ever seen in a platformer. You won't be disappointed.\n\nFinally, as a player of the original game, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (also available on Steam), I can say for definate that this game is a 100% improvement on it's original. If you want to experiance Abe's story, this is the way to do it.\n\nStory - 10/10\nGame design - 8/10\nGraphics - 9/10\nSound - 5/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nReplayability - 3/10 (Mainly for achievments only)\n\nOverall - 9.5/10\n\nWhat are you waiting for!?

This game has been built from the ground up using modern graphics and level design while still retaining a lot of what made the 90's game a classic.  With some very minor technical problems, the only negatives I could find while playing through this a few times were related to my adoration of the original, a game that I count as one of my top games of all time.\n\nYou play as Abe, a meat factory slave who discovers that his species are next on the menu.  You now to escape and discover you have a much larger part to play.  The game is littered with secret areas and Mudokens to save.  Of course you don't need to save anyone, but you will be rewarded with a darker ending and will also miss out on what makes the game challenging...saving every single Mudoken.  You have 300 to save and some are hidden away in the most unlikely places.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, perhaps too much bloom, but gorgeous nontheless.  Part of the charm of the original was just how detailed the backgrounds were and how gritty the world seemed once you stopped to take a look.  This has gone in the remake, but  you can see instantly that a lot of love and care went into the creation of this world for this remake.  However, the game has been changed in terms of how seamless each environment connects to the next.  It may sound like nitpicking, but I honestly prefer the originals single screen approach.  I took each screen as its own puzzle and New 'n'  Tasty makes puzzle solving more irritating than difficult.  You will wonder if that enemy can see you or if you are allowed to chant without taking a single step back.  It looks seamless, but it doesn't act it and this leads to some minor frustrations with certain puzzles.\n\nThe use of a quick save has made the game much easier, but for new players I think the game will be difficult anyway.  The game has been made a little easier in other ways; no deaths from high falls and of course an easy mode.  These are personal disappointing issues and I would still recommend this game to veterans of the series as well as newcomers.\n\nThe game can be played with a keyboard or a controller.  Personally I can only comment on the use of the keyboard as I never planned on using a controller for this.  The keyboard controls are solid for the most part and the keys are mapped in a way where you can play one-handed throughout most of the game, leaving your other hand to scratch yourself or read a guide if you are getting frustrated.  As for the controller, I cannot see how playing this type of game with an analogue stick is comfortable!  A d-pad or keyboard always seemed the best option, but that's just personal opinion.\n\nThe game itself retains some of the charm of the original, it is an admirable remake and, despite it not being as atmospheric, difficult and charming as the original, it is still an excellent puzzle platformer by todays standards.  Its existence does not diminish the original and it is still quite beautiful, quirky and slightly strange.  If you have never played the original before, or haven't played it in years, then I highly recommend you pick this up and spend a few hours in Oddworld.","March 27, 2015","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even on hard ("classic") mode, it's more forgiving than the original and it can be completed allot faster due to better gameplay progression. There are no new areas in the game, just a larger amount of Mudokens to save, The art style is sometimes too bright but the character of the world and significance of its message are not blinded in the least. The environments might have less grime, but they are more varied and interesting while still being equally dominating in scale.\nNew 'n' Tasty definitely isn't without it's own bugs and a few things can use some tweaking (like the hard mode meat-saws and most of Scrabania). But those are all fixable and don't ruin what is ultimately one of the best, most faithful remakes of a classic. I sincerely hope that the superior Abe's Exoddus is given the same treatment; just get rid of the steam-vents and bring back the heavy shadows, please.\n\n--EDIT--\nOh, and another nice thing about this game is that the developer is real good at talking to it's players.

Almost all enemies will one-shot you just like in old Oddworld. Also i have a feeling that Abe's rolling speed has been reduced so you have to do some training with that fast meatslicers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nirleibo/recommended/314660/","nirleibo","DeadNight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nirleibo/","81 products in account","New 'n' Tasety really captures the essence of Oddwold: Abe's Oddysee, but in 3D!\n\nThe gameplay is exactly the same 2d platformer, and everything is right where I expect to find it (even if it loks a bit different), but the areas aren't divided into small screens - each area is one continuous ...err... area.\nBut what about these Sligs, you ask ? well, good question. As far as I can tell, as long as you cannot see them, they cannot hear you, and you cannot take possesion over them. (well, actually it's OK if you can just barely see them).\nOne thing that I think was lost here is that Sligs can no longer run off screen when you chant before you take possession of them, which is a shame. (I did play the game on normal difficulty, so I may change that last bit after I finish hard difficulty).\n\nAnother new thing is difficulty levels. On normal difficulty you get 10 HP, so it's easier to escape Sligs that are sooting you in the back. I will certainly try out the hard difficulty soon.\n\nThere is one thing that I feel is a bit off, but I just cannot be sure - it feels like you have more freedome in Abe's position, and it feels like I sometimes die because my position was off a few pixels (opposed to Abe's old tile-based position). But again, it's just a feeling, so I may be wrong.\n\nAll in all this is a great game, and I recommend it to all Abe's Oddyssee fans and anyone who likes a good puzzle/action platformer.","June 25, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigaguy777/recommended/314660/","gigaguy777","Gigaguy777","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigaguy777/","572 products in account","“Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty” is a remake of “Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee” by a developer called Just Add Water, working under the original creators. The goal was to update the game with modern technology, a loft undertaking considering the original game came out in 1997. Touting updated graphics, improved controls and gameplay, and providing an overall smoother experience designed for modern systems, the devs have pulled out all the stops and making “New ‘n’ Tasty” a truly new experience.\n\nFirst up is the easiest difference to see between the games, and that’s the graphics. While some may prefer the older graphical style. It used a complex texture layering system that gave the artists a lot of control over how the scene looked, and stands up today despite the low resolution. However, the graphical upgrade looks fantastic. This is true both in terms of standing on its own with great texture quality and advanced lighting and shadow effects, as well as in comparison to other games released in recent memory. In a time where many games coming out lack high-quality textures across the board or feature static lighting, it’s easy to appreciate the work that went into updating this aspect of the game.\n\nUnlike the graphics, the story has stayed true to the original, which is important for a remake. Some minor cutscene changes have occurred but during my time with the game, it’s still the same storyline, and the same messages being passed on from the 1997 original. For those who haven’t given this game a try, I won’t spoil the story beyond saying that you should be keeping a close eye on what the game is trying to say. It has a clear message that’s worth hearing in a new setting. It also fits to mention the setting here as being a very interesting one; the entire world is filled with vibrant alien life, while still retaining elements familiar to people on Earth. Fluorescent lighting illuminates the buildings, grenades and guns have been created in this universe, and some other aspects will be familiar. However for the most part, the game is very alien, and just taking in the landscapes and various forms of fauna is an experience in itself.\n\nLastly is the gameplay, which is where the game separates itself from most other platformers. Unlike other games, Abe is neither incredibly agile, nor able to tank hits. His movements have a lot of weight to them, and they sure as hell better considering how easy it is to get horribly murdered in this game. Walking into an enemy Slig’s sight means death by bullet, while a missed jump is just as damning. It doesn’t take a detective to figure out what caused Abe’s demise but, it’ll be brutal however it happens. Thankfully, the game itself is very forgiving of mistakes, not only featuring checkpoints on a regular basis, which are logically placed, but also having a quick save ability. As long as the player saves often, they’re never be more than a couple seconds away from the previous attempt.\n\nThe weight of the movement and actions, as well as the challenge of saving fellow workers from the company makes each move important and something to consider beforehand. The endings change based on how many workers you save, which adds some weight and is a nice touch considering how easily some may simply skip saving the other workers. The point here is that the gameplay is compelling, weighty, and feeds back into the story. It also exposes the player to a wide range of settings within the game in the form of different times of day, which does vastly change how the game looks and in experiencing the various environments.\n\nIn closing, the graphics are fantastic both in their own right, and in comparison to other modern games being released. The gameplay is solid and compelling, and the story is interesting -- to see a game so brazenly say its message and permeate the game with it, yet refrain from using the hamfisted writing and contrivance of other games attempting to send a message is a beautiful thing. A solid purchase for fans of the old title, and new players hoping to get into a new series.\n\n4/5\n","June 1, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

New n Tasty is really well made, well ported and plays just like Abes Exodus. The puzzles are made a little bit easier than Abes Odessy because it uses the Gamespeak system of Abes Exosodus. They more than doubled the ammount of mudokens you can save, so far (90minutes in) that doesn't mean more puzzles, theres just more mudokens per puzzle. Overall it's excellent, and lives up to the expectations that I had in every way except one, the sound. This probably isn't an issue for most people but the sound in the original is so good and the sound in New n Tasty just isn't as good. All the sound effects are still recognizable and they sound "right" but just not as good.","February 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Prior to the first patch's release, the worst I had was the game crashing on me twice during a transition from one area to another, but I haven't experienced FMV hiccups nor any general play issues even with max settings. The sound has been acting a little odd (hurr) after the patch, though, often cutting out at certain points like when several mines explode at once. It's not big, but it's noticeable.\n\n- As someone who hasn't experienced the PS4 version and its possible issues, I've had little problem with the game compared to the original Oddysee... in more ways than one. Some may argue that the sterile, dark nature from the original is lost in the colors and bloom here, but I think there's still very nice environmental design that still highlights the industry vs. nature idea going on between the game's major settings. The new voice work can be rather goofy, though I think that falls under the more subjective argument against Oddworld's change in tone over time more than anything.\n\n- On its own merits, the game still remains as clever and charming as I can recall (yes, even considering the changes in tone). The keyboard controls have been great, save for some time to adjust to more precise movements in the beginning. The ability to call multiple Mudokons together is nice, but I think there are moments where it shows that they didn't intend for it to work that way, forcing me to stick to single Mudokon greetings. Quik-Save is perhaps too nice; instantaneously loading to a save point can really diminish some otherwise tense challenges. It also bothers me that chant suppressors and certain chant possession moments are harder to gauge due to the lack of screen transitions, but it hasn't emerged too much to be a consistent issue.\n\nIs this still a good game? Definitely. Does it outplace Oddysee? Not exactly, but I think it's a great complement. Is it worth $20? It depends. It's well worth a try to see Oddworld reimagined in HD, but the difficulty and tone are not going to be the same. I liked it enough to spend that much, but others might want to wait on a sale before stepping back in.","March 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looks stunning, the backgrounds are more alive, a greater challenge on hard mode and even more secrets to discover! The extra varied things Mudokons and Sligs say for instance cracks me up and adds an extra layer of top notch humour to this game. Controls are fluid and responsive, takes some getting used to as I'm more used to the original controls. A wonderful remake that reminds us just how great these platformers are and the amazing atmosphere from the originals is still retained here.\n\nCan't wait for the Abe's Exoddus remake, it needs to happen!","January 25","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It was fully done out of scratch with gorgeous high definition graphics, new instrumentalization and sonoplasty (but still loyal to the original tunes), new voices, new and improved cutscenes, with additional difficulty levels, new and sharp controls, super smooth framerate, renewed (again, still loyal) level design... I actually found glitches but they are very very few and don't harm your gameplay. As a bonus, there's a DLC (bought separately) with a completely new puzzle named Alf's Escape that is a great addition to the game, offering a good challenge to veteran Oddworld players and to the new ones aswell. If you never played Oddworld, this game is an excellent start. If you already played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee in the past, you're going to love to replay this in the New 'N' Tasty's engine. It is even more impressive to see that such a game of quality like this one is sold for a real bargain and with a real relationship of quality/price contrary to what the great majority of the game companies do. 100% recommended to every fan of platformers!","February 28, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This remastering in a fully new engine features the same singleplayer experience from back in the day with some great additions. You can now quicksave and -load wherever you are. After initial doubts that this would make the game too easy, that is not the case at all. If anything it makes this already great game much more enjoyable by taking away tediousness due to scarce checkpoints. It still holds its difficulty in executing a perfect sequence of actions to progress in the level. Other new features include a remastered soundtrack, global leaderboards with time challenges, Steam achievements and full controller support (allthough I did encounter a couple parts where the buttom prompts in tutorial messages were still keyboard buttons eventhough I switched the input mode to controller). I had no problem setting up a Xbox One controller for this, allthough rebinding buttons isn't an option unfortunately (maybe through configfiles). One small detail I really like is that even for controller input there is a button dedicated to quicksaving and -loading. More games should have this!\n\nAll in all, Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is a fantastic new version of a great game. If you've never played Abe's Escape, it's still very playable and enjoyable even in 2015 and still sits up there in the Trial&Error genre with others like Prince of Persia or Limbo.","February 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/314660/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","An amazing remake with some rather unfortunate issues.\n\nOn one paramite we have a very succesful attempt at making a very faithful remake of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee - a great puzzle/cinematic platformer game from 1997. It's so good and so close in level layout and design, that it pretty much makes it completely unnecessary to play the original anymore - something that only a truly good remake can do. Everything that was great already was left as is. Everything that required some updating and rebalancing was changed. Quicksave is a huge timesaver and works rather well with a gamepad. Some control changes were an absolute must, so some changes are here straight from Exoddus and some are completely new. Gone is the screen-by-screen level design in a surprisingly smooth transition to the more dynamic camera built levels, which still kept their original layouts almost as is. And the game, at it's best, looks better than the pre-rendered assets from 1997 (which, if not for the resolution, would've still looked good, though).\nSadly, in some things it feels like the devs just went overboard, and in some things it feels like they weren't experienced enough. So while the game does look better than the original at it's best, sometimes you notice very muddy texture work, weirdly boring lighting and not very high-poly models that simply don't look as good as the pre-rendered stuff of the original or just misses the mood of the original a bit. Notably, all the very dark areas that focused on just black shapes/shadows moving in contrast to a more light background, now look much lighter and with more "realistic" lighting, which makes them look less memorable. Also, the game manages to often feel surprisingly badly optimised and demanding more than it looks like it should. Given the lack of noticable loading screens and rather fast transitions, quicksaves and restarts, some thing can be understood and forgiven, but still.\nEspecially when some outright weird things get noticed. Like - apparently, this game is one of those rare games that doesn't have xinput controller support for the range of xinput-compatible hardware, but instead only for the 360 for windows controller. Even xbox one controller can create issues, from weird control behavior, to crashes. Those can be fixed, but are still simply weird to see in 2014-2015. And if the Alf's escape DLC is any indication of Just Add Water skills of making new gameplay content, then it's especially sad, because that DLC feels like a dump of all the gameplay elements without anything truly interesting and creative to it - something that the main game is full of. And while we are on topic of gameplay - there is a weird change in number of mudokons you have to save - there's 200 more of them now. Can't say that I feel that change justified, except for the sake of saying that 300 feels more like factory crew than 100, maybe?\nBut anyway, it's still a fun and fantastic game about running, jumping, farting, giggling "hello-follow-me"-ing and narrow escaping. As a huge fan of Exoddus (which I prefered over the original), I hope to see that one treated same or even better.","September 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I fell in love with the games wierdness straight away, I must of played that same demo at least 50 times! I never ended up playing the full game as I was at school and didn't have any money to buy it, I got games for Xmas but for some reason ended up forgetting about this one.\n\nI'm so glad I can replay this game again but with a fantastic update that has made it more atmospheric than ever! The beggining gives me nostlgia of playing that demo back in the 90's, even though it has been created again from the ground up it has perfectly recreated the same vibe that the original had.\n\nThe only flaw I have found with the game is that the controls (when using a 360 controller) are too sensitive, it appears there is no deadzone so the slightest nudge (or even if the stick doesn't fall perfectly back into place) will mean that Abe will continue in that direction... Very frustrating for this kind of game.\n\nthe developers are aware of this issue though and have promised an update soon to amend it.\n\n* EDIT *\n\nDeveloper has fixed the deadzone issue, Controller works a treat now.","February 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","1"

I sure do.\nBasically New 'n' Tasty is a remake of the old classic so many of us played nearly 20 years ago.  As you might allready have noticed, i've given this game my recommendation.\n\nIn this review i will first try to inform new players what this game is, and what it's all about, and then go more into detail on differences between the original and the remake.\n\nWhat is Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty?\nPlot:\nIn Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty you take the part as Abe, an enslaved Mudokon in RaptureFarms, or "Zulag" as it's called (Zulag is actually a refference to the Russian Gulags, or work camps). Your goal is to help all the other enslaved Mudokon's in RaptureFarms escape.  The plot section is kinda short since i don't want to spoil to much about the story\n\nGameplay:\nLike the original, this game is a platform sidescroller game, with focus on puzzle solving. As in many platformer games you can walk, run, duck, and jump. But in Oddworld, you can also interact with switches, other Mudokon, and even use your telepathic powers to take control of certain characters in the game. Spoiler:  The game has two endings, a "good" ending and a "bad" ending. I don't want to spoil what the criteria to achive either ending is (google it).\n\nWhat's new in the remake?\nAt first the developer wanted to just remaster the game (which consist of boosting the sound quality, enhance the images etc), but they decided to make a brand new game, using the original as a blueprint.\n\nThis resulted in a game that is 2.5D[en.wikipedia.org] and not 2D as the original. This game is also made with unity, and not unigine as the original was.\n\nSo, for the main differences in gameplay that i have found:\n\nIn the new game you have 299 Mudokons you're able to save, against the 99 in the original game\nThe next screen is now alive before you enter it. This means that for example a sleeping Slig (The armed guards of RaptureFarms) can hear you and wake up before entering the screen that they are sleeping in.\nBecause of the previous point, the Sligs have been changed a bit in terms of how long they can see, and hear you.\nThe floating "z" above a sleeping Slig appear to show much sooner, and when alerted, there is now a visual presentation showing you that the Slig can see you.\nIn the original there was dark zones that you could hide in. These are now replaced to areas with steam/smoke.\nSome of the puzzles are adjusted, and some completly remade.\nConclusion:\nWhile it's pretty much the same game as it was almost 20 years ago, it's still worth playing.  It feels like a new game, but it still has the nostalgia from the 90's\n\nI give it a solid 9/10.\n\nPS. It's super controller friendly. I had no problems using both the xbone and PS4 controller.\n\nThis was a rather short review of a game i've only played through twice. Therefore comments on things i might have gotten wrong or missed, are welcome. It's still a good game!","March 26","true","29.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Where earlier the impression that slaves who talk out would be beaten or shop now is gone, replaced by silly ne-liners about wiping the floor. The sligs who did little else but grumble and cough and gurgle among themselves now are quite chatty.\n\nThat is to say this remake is far less dark. I only recommend it to those of you who have already played the original, which is the superior work. That said, I enjoyed this different take. It is cartoony, and more silly than deadly. That is not inherently problematic. The framerate and the resolution and the FPS make this technically superior.\n\nIt's hard to fault JaW on trying a new take, but it neither goes far enough nor resembles the orignal's (superior) tone enough. It is not bad. But it is not really what fans would expect or enjoy from a remake.

The game itself is, odd keyboard controls aside, nothing really to complain about, and nothing to write home about; the game is decent and exactly what you expect going in..\n\n..save for that it crashes violently, overrides default processor settings, and generally refuses to work.\n\nI've installed and uninstalled the game twice now, and spent hours troubleshooting, and it continues to surprise me with new ways to crash. It's not a hardware issue. I've had three different kinds of errors and crashes now, ranging from the game overriding my processor settings to use the integrated chip (which obviously can't handle the game), to not communicating to the driver, to straight-up just instantly shutting my computer down. The one common thread has been that everytime it crashes, it crashes violently; my screen goes black, Windows completely shuts down and the computer literally stops functioning in any way until I force it down. I have to restart and boot-up from the safety screen everytime.\n\nIt seems like a decent game well worth your's and mine's time, but it simply isn't well polished enough. Give it a try if you like, seeing as this seems to be a rare issue, but be prepared for "odd" crashing behavior.","January 23","false","2.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","5"

I thought the "improvements" and changes would ruin the nostalgia and make it play worse in comparison to the original. Wrong! In fact, it plays better than ever before and still keeps the same atmosphere whilst retaining that same ol' nostalgia.\n\n"In fact, it plays better than ever before and still keeps the same atmosphere whilst retaining that same ol' nostalgia."\nThe new controls are certainly a massive improvement. Sections that use to be difficult in the original game are now relatively easy because of the new controls. This sounds like a bad thing? No, no. It's got rid of the frustrating timing issues that still exist in the original.\n\n"The new controls are certainly a massive improvement."\nThe graphics? They're beautiful, without a shadow of doubt. A lot of people keep going on how the original graphics are better but they're both very different artistic styles. The original used backdrops from pre-rendered scenes. The downside to this is that they were static so it couldn't add life to the surroundings. What you saw in the gameplay world was as much as you were going to get.\n\n"The graphics? They're beautiful, without a shadow of doubt."\nWith New 'n' Tasty there is so much more going on in the world of Oddworld. You see mudokons in the background cleaning on the floor, sligs patrolling sections that you cannot see and not to forget the creatures of Oddworld living in their environment.\n\n"With New 'n' Tasty there is so much more going on in the world of Oddworld."\nThe only thing I do feel that needs improvement is the audio. I like the new richer quality sounds but they seem a tad off from the original. But this is a new game? Not a remake! Yes, I know :/ The original audio such as the atmospheric sounds were a lot more appealing. I could just turn off the screen and listen to them for an hour and feel like I'm in the universe of Oddworld. With New 'n' Tasty? I'm not really getting that. The audio needs some work, including the balance. Some things appear to sound louder than others and you don't really know where you are at points.\n\n"The only thing I do feel that needs improvement is the audio."\nOverall the game is worth every penny and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. There isn't too much I feel that I can criticise about other than the audio. Everything about the game is everything I had hoped for it to be.\n\nScore: 9/10\n+ + +\nRuns flawlessly\nImproved controls\nImproved gameplay\nBeautiful graphics\nDynamic world\n\n- - -\nUnbalanced audio","February 27, 2015","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This on the other hands feels great, I will surely return to it.\nIt's a perfect edition for those that played the original game and for the others - a great new platformer.\n\nThe game revolves around perfect use of controlls, so a lot of jumping, some sneaking, right timing. Puzzles are mostly based on that too. If you like this kind of games, you should give the game a try, especially since it's on 40% sale now.\n\nI didn't believe that before, but after playing it, I think it deserves the full price anyway.\n\nJust a good game.","June 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RightousMan/recommended/314660/","RightousMan","Right0us_Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RightousMan/","133 products in account","This game is more than a HD remaster. It overhauls the entire game with a complete redo of the graphics and a lot of minor changes to every level and the cut scenes have all been redone aswell. The game looks amazing, the atmosphere of the original setting is fully intact, if not more so. The game doesn't exactly have a "lot" of "new" content.\n\nBy this I mean, if you are buying this game to experience a brand new story or a reboot of the original game with a completely new story, this is not it. This is basically just a modern version of this game. In a way it feels inde rather than AAA. The story is largely the same with maybe a few tweaks that I noticed, but those feel more like things that the original game never patched rather than add-ons to the story. Although I think all of the oddworld games existed before patching on consol was common place.\n\nThe levels are, as I remember pretty much the same in design, just minor tweaks, and branching paths that lead into new levels. All of which are VERY nicely designed and range from easy to "I'M going to throw my controller if that damn saw kills me one more time!!" in difficulty. The challenges feel SO VERY satisfactory, especially if you take the time to figure it out yourself making the next playthrough that much faster. The awards feel pretty good when you get them, though I wish there was more. I still feel like Abe deserves some kind of upgrade tier feature, so as he progresses further he gets more powerful, you do in a way, but only with the chanting power.\n\nWhen I got this game originally It wouldn't load, but support from the dev's and the community helped me resolve it in about a week or so of buying it. Playing in windowed mode seems to be preferrable on my machine, and the 360 gamepad works very nicely with the game.\n\nEither way, this game is worth any price below 15 dollars!\n\nNot really sure the add on Soul Brew story hook dlc ( Alfs Escape ) is worth more than a dollar and to be honest I really feel it should just be a part of the game as is rather than dlc. In a way seeing that as dlc for 2 dollars plus makes me wonder why the Dev thought it was worth charging people for. The levels in the dlc are good but its very short and absolutly not worth more than 1$. I hope that this isn't a sign of a trend that this series and its "remakes" wont be charging DLC for every single little thing that is just outside of the main story line. I get charging for Abe to where scrubs, but not the Alf Escape.\n\nOverall the game is a 7.5/10 for me.","August 15, 2015","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once again you play as Abe as he attempts to escape RuptureFarms while saving his buddies from being turned into next month's brand new meat product.\n\nNewcomers to the series will find a nice mix of action, adventure, platforming, puzzle solving and just enough nail-biting close shaves to keep you on edge all the way through, at just the right difficulty to make sure you're only pulling out some of your hair instead of all of it.\n\nReturning players may be tempted to proudly declare that they already know the ins, outs and secrets that the continent of Mudos has to offer. Oh how wrong we were to feel that way. New secret areas have been thrown into the mix and each level has been redesigned to throw us off guard, but still retains enough from the original designs to provide the nostalgia we wanted.\n\nAlong with other changes such as improved sounds and visuals, the "All o' ya!" gamespeak command has also been introduced. Previously unavailable in the original but added in Exoddus, this command allows you to get the attention of groups of Mudokons, making sections that were more difficult than they should have been a lot more manageable. Characters also have idle lines, and baiting Sligs is now more fun than ever thanks to the increased number of responses, such as being confused as to who just said hello to them or mentioning that they should lay off the Scrab Cakes.\n\nAll in all, New 'n' Tasty definitely lives up to the name. Nicely new, and absolutely tasty.","February 25, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

With all due respect to Lanning he obviously had to refamiliarise himself with the Abe voice, but it shows, a lot, I'd put this down  to him being so out of touch with the original game but I think it just ties in the direction of the dialogue in general and how it tries too hard to be comical and cutesy and just doesn't have the same passion poured into it. I miss the sound Abe made when he plummets to his doom, his chanting noise, the sligs and mudokons are even worse, constantly babbling silly lines to themselves, which makes the plight of the mudokon slaves less harrowing and the sligs a lot less menacing. The old Oddworld games really are a classic case of "less is more" in both audio and visual, and I don't think Just Add Water really got that when making this game.\n\nWhich leads me onto the visual elements. As pointed out in said youtube video, this game is a lot flashier, colourful and luminescent, especially in rupture farms, where there are flashing lights and expensive neon signs everywhere as well as a permanent luminscent smog everywhere of varying colours. The screen is full of bloom sources throughout, not hard to see why they opted for hiding in steam vents in this game as the brilliantly designed screens of pitch darkness and shadow in the original just don't exist in this game.\n\nThere is also the issue of the graphics capabilities, it's times like this when you realise just how overhyped next gen hd graphics really are. With films perhaps visual quality really can be reduced to pixel resolution and frame rate, but with video games you still get terrible shadow graphics, polygon issues, and things being simply a lot less crisp and perfect as a result of being moving and £d as opposed to pre-rendered artwork. As for frame rate, this game has a serious animation issue with anything that involves fast travelling, be it doorways or wells, Abe's animation just fast forwards everytime and it's just plain sloppy.\n\nThe controls and mechanics are a lot worse on this. There is no single button for jumping forward, so you end up walking into mines all the time unless you time the button combo perfectly, Abe is always hesitating on the edge of platforms which gets very annoying, and because they have hugely dumbed down the act of jumping up and climbing down you seem to only need to be within a yard of the precise spot. This seems like it would make things easier, but not if you need to crouch down for any reason, you have to practically move to the other side of the screen to prevent Abe from just dropping down a level instead.\n\nI quickly realised after giving this game a reasonable chance and appreciating the amount of effort put into reviving it for the modern HD generation, it only served to make me want to play the original, every level, every screen. Nothing comes close to the character and atmosphere of the original, it feels more like a generic child oriented platformer in many ways like Munch's Oddysee.\n\nMy advice to fans of the original: Don't bother, stick to the classics. My advice to newcomers: Just buy the originals anyway, they're dirt cheap to download on either steam or console and have aged brilliantly.","June 6, 2015","false","3.4"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

It was the main reason I bought my Playstation (original) back in 1997-1998ish. I have played it through so many times and it is fantastic. The controls are great, the story is great, the challenge is great.\n\nSo fast forward a couple decades and I hear they're "remaking" Oddworld. COOL! I bet it's the same game with better graphics and maybe an expanded story.\n\nWas I ever disappointed. They seem to have put so little thought into the controls of this game that it makes it unplayable. If you accidentally change your input device from keyboard to gamepad and you forget to bind any key, you're screwed because the keyboard just turns off and you're stuck.\n\nOh, and the controls are nothing like the original game. They've dumbed it down and remapped the controls into weird spots.\n\nI wish I could even say the graphics are better, but they just don't seem a whole lot better. I mean, I know the difference between Playstation and modern PCs is a lot, but it seems like they could have done them SO much better on this game than they did.\n\nI think if you don't have a strong background in the original game and you come at this fresh, it might be enjoyable. But if you're hoping for something that will do the original justice, you're going to be let down. It's hard for me to recommend or not based on that, so my "no" will reflect the latter.","March 10","false","0.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

The game would not start. I tried everything. I alerted the developrs by email and never received a response, I made a thread in the support forums on steam and they took over a month to respond to me and then stated that the issue was related to my setup. Randomly the game started working after an nVidia update 3 days ago....it only works if I run the game as administrator... in compatibility mode for windows xp service pack 3.... right...\n\nSo the game finally starts, but don't dare change windows (alt+tab) or else it will crash.

The controls no longer work off an intiger based system where 1 tap left moves 1 space left. The controls now feel floaty add to that the camera perspective and the platforming against meat grinders leave much to be desired. The graphics are improved of course but with todays ability to produce these environments is not overly impressive, if anything the old art style provided a much grittier and immersive experience with the painted back and fore grounds. Plus, WHY REMOVE THE WORK COMMAND!.

Purely as an entertainment product, this game plays and looks fine. However, as something which is trying to capture the experience of the original Abe's Oddysee, it is not as mechanically tight or as aesthetically true to the character of the first two Oddworld games.\n\nThis is sort of like the difference between the Majora's Mask remake and the original game. The remake in that game and this game's case are competently made and should be entertaining for anyone looking for a good game to pass the time. But they do not match the experience of the original game which they are trying to recreate.\n\nFor anyone looking for an entertaining puzzle platformer, I would say that New N Tasty is worth playing. My downvote comes from dissapointment that this game feels only like a fan imitation of the original game, when it supposedly set out to recreate it faithfully in higher definition and with better visuals.","May 18","false","6.0"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","1"

The entire atmosphere's gone, and there's nothing we can do to recover it as players.\n\nI completed the original a couple of times and loved it. The fact the remake included these voices is a loss, and I can't keep playing it, and in a puzzle with a few Sligs and Mudokons they're all complaining and joking enough I can't even think straight.\n\nWould become an excellent remake if there was an option to shut the voices off, or they simply weren't there to begin with (they shouldn't be).

The game itself looks great and offers me that same excitement ... or at least it would if the game worked with my controller.\n\nI have a Logitech F310 controller that works great with most games, and I assumed it would work with New n Tasty.

I played through most of the game on a mouse and keyboard, but found the game play more irritating than enjoyable. In my opinion, this game needs to be played with a controller. That's how it was originally designed when it was released in the 90's.\n\nWhen the patches came, my controller still didn't work. I sent an email to support to see if they would help me. No response. I waiting for the second patch that insisted that it fixed all controller issues. Still no improvement. Another patch came out that would let  gamers remap the controls if they could get into the game files and then write out the code.

However, it's really boring and has none of the fun that we are used to with Abe.\nWhaddya mean I can't possess stuff or blow them up with green farts? Wasn't that the whole point?\nThe controls (for pc) are clunky and slow - I realise Abe has gotten older as have we all, but he can't outrun anything and the 'cutesy' hesitation at the edge of anything/everything is only cute for the first 20 minutes - buddy - ya need to RUN now....\nSo, whilst it has been relatively faithful to the originals - we are not playing those now as being outdated - why replicate that with no improvements? It's pretty and some of the background comments from the mudokons and sligs are amusing.

The music, voice acting and immersion of the world are all worse in my opinion. There was also an annoying bug at the time that I played the game with the fast meat grinders, where they were so fast that there was about one frame of safety in which you could actually make the roll, which meant that you sometimes spent 5-10 minutes quicksaving and attempting each roll over and over.\n\nIt has one major quality of life upgrade which makes play a bit more enjoyable, which is the ability to have multiple Mudokans follow you at once (as you could do in Abe's Exoddus, but not in the original Abe's Oddysee). This was nice, but having just literally replayed the original Abe's Oddysee before playing New N Tasty, I don't really feel like this makes the new version an overall improvement.\n\nI don't regret buying the game, but I don't think it lived up to the original.","March 7, 2015","false","7.5"," 9 of 34 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","9","34","0","4"

I eagerly waited this to be released as it looked great! I have now played for about half an hour and the controls just do not feel right. It really doesn't feel as smooth as the original! The jump for example, it's pretty unresponsive. I don't like that a "use" button has been introduced and it just feels like it has been optimised for controller input, not keyboard.\n\nI will try playing for a little longer but after repeatedly finding, particularly my running jumps, failing, I quickly got fed up and quit.\n\nThe game LOOKS great, however the feel is just not right.

That's all the developers had to do.\n\nAs is, New n' Tasty is wracked with poor controls and haphazard button placement. (Throw grenades next to talk? Yes, I might want talk you and save your buns or turn you into gibs. A tough call we all face) The aiming is also equally wonky- to throw left you hit right shoulder. To throw right, you hit left shoulder. But there is also precise directional throwing- which could have been done with a single throw button to hold down, aim with the d pad/analog, and release to throw- you know, like in a ton of other games. Instead, throwing is divided and mapped to FOUR different buttons- each with a limited throw arc. Coupled with how throws are mapped, the simple task of throwing (compared to the original) is turned into a messy ordeal.\n\nTalking is also separated- “Normal” on the analog (Hello and Follow me) and everything else (six other commands- including the important “Wait” and “Look Out” Commands) mapped to different buttons. Again, the original (PS version) had an elegant solution- have them accessed by holding one of two buttons back buttons and press a face button for the command. Simple and fun.\n\nThe game also crashes when the pause button is hit. That may be fixed in the future- but it's a terrible way to start out.\n\nI feel sorry for new players who never got to play the original- because Oddworld- Abe's Oddysee is one of the greatest games released in the 90's. It had great in scope, play style, difficulty, and story. A digital download can be found on a few modern consoles and the original PC game can played with a bit of software. Steam also has the original, however it is also finicky, so it may not be an option. Its also on the PlayStation 1- if that happens to be option for you. (Hey, PS2s and PS3s can read PS1 discs)\n\nTo see one of the favorite games marred by unthoughtful control mapping disheartens me. Maybe it'll get patched. Maybe not. Not a dev, I'm not sure what they're thinking.\n\nBut hey, at least its pretty.","February 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 9 of 57 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","9","57","0","1"

I start with the long version.\nSo first off i want to say i really love the oddworld series. It was one of the first games i played and the more i played it the more i fell in love with it. The controlls where great the atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The dumb humor i loved every bit of it.\nI was really hyped for this remake i thought to myself " This is gonna be gud. The same game with new stuff better graphics this is gonna be amazing.\nA couple minutes in to the game i noticed that the controlls just dont work as they did in the original. The tile based movement was gone. Oddworld had a really good reason for this control scheme it worked with the game. The tile based movement was important to predict jumps or enemy movement in such a hard game. U allways knew how you will move. unfortanitly this is gone now. This remake shows perfectly why the original had to do this. It made a hard game fair.\nAnother thing was the screen based gameplay. If u havent played the original let me explain. In the original u mooved screen by screen it didnt scroll. Remember this is the PS1 it was well capable of sidescrolling. And the perspective was orthogonal for the most part. u could very clearly see when something in the background was right above u. In the remake i feel often that i cant really make out where the enemies in the background stand in relation to me. Are they behind me ? or is he directly above me. I endet up dying alot in the first two hours because i couldnt make out where he is or where i am.\nLets talk about button layout. Why cant i change anything ?. I really want to move with the d-pad this is a precision based 2D Platformer and the DPad just works better. We dont all use Xbox Controllers where the dpad is horrible i use a PS3 controller and i really want to use my dpad the stick feels unprecise and sloppy not to mention the deadzone issues the accidental up jumps and the way momentum works with it. It just feels wrong.\nIs this easily fixable ? Yes. Atleast in the control department. I dont know how possible it is but give us a classic controller option. This would help massively. And sidehoping should be turned on standart. Took me while til i saw that.\nOne last point is unity... Unity time and time again has shown to not be kapable of runing graphicly intense games. Not to say they cant look pretty but they shouldnt be taxing. In the Emu sections where u have to ride the beast and jump around the framerate becomes too inconsisten to make reliable jumps and with the new movement which again is not tile based jumping cliffs becomes a real hassle.\nand one last really personal thing. The game looks to bright for me the original seemed much more gritty and somewhat darker all in all. And bloom is a bit overdone\nOverall wait a bit til some of these things become not fixed they arent broken but changable.\n\nShort Version.\n\nThe old tile based movement is gone which leads to inprecise platforming. The perspective is sometimes really bad when it comes to judging where everyone is in relation to u. And u cant controll this precision based platformer with the dpad nor can u change the controll scheme or button layout. Turn sidehop on or punch youre monitor.\n\nAll in all i will give it another shot and i might start to like this remake. The dozens of frustrating deaths do to the new way of controlling the game. The overblooming "personal thing". The portions that are hard because i dont know where the enemy in the background is and the huge problems Unity brings and the way the camera moves somethimes\nare just to much for me to bother with it right now.","February 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 61 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","8","61","2","0"

I love the characters, the setting, I wanna support the devs and see new Oddworld games, I REALLY WANT TO LIKE THIS REMAKE but it’s just so meh I honestly regret dropping 20bux on it. Frankly, I could NEVER recommend this completely disappointing remake to anyone other than the die-hard fan who needs to experience it all and has 20bux to burn, so if that describes you then I hope you enjoy the few positive points the remake has to offer.\n\nI could reword all the things I've said about this into a more traditional review, but I'm lazy and want to get the point across simply, so here's copypasted chatlogs followed by more substantial reviewing\n\nPirateGuy: CAN'T EVEN\nPirateGuy: REBIND THESE BUSTED-♥♥♥ GAMEPAD CONTROLS\nPirateGuy: ♥♥♥♥S SAKE I LOVE ODDWORLD BUT THIS IS A MESS\nPirateGuy: I will say that\nPirateGuy: it is well optimized as ♥♥♥♥ tho\nPirateGuy: very smooth, and if the buttons were bound properly (or at least rebindable, why is this not an option it's 2015) I would say it controls about as well as the original\nPirateGuy: as far as remakes go\nPirateGuy: this is simultaneously\nPirateGuy: good and ♥♥♥♥\nPirateGuy: because while it’s not BAD as a game (because I mean it’s basically 1:1 of oddworld that’s a classic come on) it’s just mostly pointless as a remake\nPirateGuy: a remake should be everything the original is but bring it into the modern age on a new engine, right\nPirateGuy: but here while it g e n e r a l l y gets down the gameplay (♥♥♥♥ed up weird control issues aside) everything else is just off\n■■■■■■■: hum hum\nPirateGuy: this guy p. much says everything I was thinking\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkhDrngAQZ0\n(SERIOUSLY WATCH THIS VIDEO IT EXPLAINS THIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN WAYS I BARELY BEGIN TO TOUCH ON IN THIS "REVIEW")\n\n■■■■■■■: sounds like teh silent hill hd versions\nPirateGuy: yeah it’s like\nPirateGuy: they didn’t really ADD ANYTHING to make the remake that interesting, I might as well play the original\nPirateGuy: it might’ve been okay on it’s own were it a different game\nPirateGuy: but it’s NOT\nPirateGuy: it’s\nPirateGuy: a remake of oddworld\nPirateGuy: and if it can’t live up to the original’s design and aesthetic\nPirateGuy: then what’s the point?\nPirateGuy: the only advantage this remake has is slightly smoother gameplay since it’s designed for modern specs that can load more things in a quicker fashion\nPirateGuy: but the improvements are marginal at best\n---\nPirateGuy: frankly I’m disappointed with the remake so far\nPirateGuy: the intro is a pale shadow of the original\n■■■■■■■■■■: The 3D one?\nPirateGuy: ?\n■■■■■■■■■■: Oh.. That one!\n■■■■■■■■■■: What don’t you like?\nPirateGuy: the VA for Abe in the intro is\nPirateGuy: oddly paced and awkward (also the glukkon voices are ♥♥♥♥♥ for the most part)\nPirateGuy: and there’s almost\nPirateGuy: none of the original atmosphere\nPirateGuy: it’s like a team of people who didn’t understand the original game’s atmosphere or art direction just tried to make what they THOUGHT was a 1:1 copy and botched it\n\nall things considered, this engine is good (the scrolling screens make things nicely fluid imo and are one of the biggest positives about the remake), there’s a lot of potential here, but I feel this was all really a lot of wasted effort that would have been better used making an entirely new oddworld game with modern tech (of course, I would hope all the current issues wouldn’t have been present had that been the case; but if they can't do a proper remake, what hope is there for a new game?)\nI suppose at this point we’ll have to wait and see if we get the best qualities of the original and the remake in any potential future Oddworld games\n\nanyone can copy a game 1:1 given enough time (and I'm hesitant to say even that much was done well here), but it takes skill and care to successfully translate a game to a modern state without losing any of the original appeal\n\nthis is where I think new n tasty fails, as it is seriously lacking in so many smaller details that come together to create the oddworld experience\n\nSo to boil it down:\n\nPROS\n✔ Unity-based engine is fluid and well-optimized\n✔ Ads seen in console versions were removed\n✔ Scrolling camera is fluid and actually adds to the experience imo\nCONS\nX While basically true to the original as a remake is meant to be, has poor art direction and atmosphere, which is equally as important to what makes Oddworld what it is as the gameplay itself (this, as well as many other things, is fully explained in full detail in the embedded video. I STRONGLY recommend it)\nX To my knowledge, no ability to rebind gamepad controls\nX VA-work is off at some points, best seen in the pacing and overall awkwardness of the dialogue in the intro cinematic\nX Movement is forcefully bound to analog sticks on a gamepad.

Not too mch disaster after finishing the whole thing.\n\nThe controls and graphics are clunkcy at best. I still remember that day I play the original Abe's Oddworld for PSOne. Though the graphics are not as beasutiful as this one but ithe gameplay is far more aesthethics. In the olden days I still remember you can walk and run but this option has been removed for the WORST [Though the developer said it could be my system]\n\nThrowing action is laughable. I still remember that the you need to hold the square button to throw the bomb/rock. This one is just use the right analog stick. [Also, why they get trid of the press to run function???!!! Whoever came up with this idea should be fired!!!! The old one is good. Thanks for the  reply, you can actually hold to run though\n\nOne of the best thing about Oddworld in the olden days was the gamespeak mechanics. In Abe's Exodus. You can called up to 2 people to follow you when there are 5 person in a group. Here you cannot. You can either called only one or all at once. Resulting in frustration.\n\nAnother thing is the jump button. The jump button is so damn annoying. The olden game allows you to rapid jump, meaning that when you hold the jump button (Triangle button), you can jump past bomb very quickly, the jump button in this game means jump up. To jump forward, you need to hold forward and jump and when the fps drops below 30fps, it results in very very clumsy mistake (as Abe will not jump forward but take one step forward and thus stepping onto a mine). Thank god for quick save function though\n\nGame score 6/10\n\nOld time gamer should try it. It is not a shinning gem but it is polished game.","March 7, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

My friend and I have played through probably a dozen times, saving all 99, and were both extremely excited to play New n Tasy.\n\nI had my friend over last night, and we played for an hour. New n Tasty definitely didn't disappoint. It's the game we know and love with fantastic graphics, comical one-liners from working Mudokons, and some really great updates/fixes for little quirks from the original (much easier picking up grenades, pulling levers, etc.)\n\nA big game dynamic neither one of us were sure about was the fact that the camera follows you instead of going screen to screen, but it's well done and it took 20 minutes for me to pause and make note of the fact that I hadn't noticed it at all and it felt very natural.\n\nI *really* wish there was a way to change the controller bindings to the classic controls, but I understand the change and realize this likely isn't a problem for many people.\n\nWe know this game like the back of our hands, and other than struggling a bit with using the new controls, we were both extremely impressed and look forward to playing the rest of the game.

So I'm glad that Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is finally here!\n\nFor those of you who don't know what this games is, New 'n' Tasty is a puzzle platformer that follows the exploits of one slave called Abe as he escapes from a slaughterhouse . Along the way he helps free 299 of his fellow slaves. I could tell you more, but I'd rather not spoil the story for you.\n\nThe game has alternate endings. What ending you see depends on how many of your fellow slaves you free.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is difficult. VERY difficult! It does take a bit to get used to. Especially if you're like me, and are not experienced with platforms. Keybinding and controller support allows you to tailor the controls to your liking. The introduction of quick saves and difficulty options ensures the gameplay never feels cheap.\n\nThough those trip mines sure are annoying!\n\nAnd for those who like a challenge, the game comes with leaderboards and achievements.\n\nAtmopshere and Graphics\nThe Oddworld games are known for their rich atmosphere and character design. New 'n' Tasty is no different!\n\nThe game looks and sound great if you have a decent machine. But even if you don't (like myself) the game will run smoothly without lagging or crashes on the lower settings.\n\nMy only issues with the atmosphere is that Rupture Farms could've been more grimier. It feels to bright and clean for what should be a industrial house of horrors.\n\nAnother thing is that this game adds rag doll physics. These can be funny, but sometimes break immersion with their gravity-denying ways. The soundtrack is filled with tribal and natural sounds that fits the story.\n\n(Minor) Complaints\nThe following are some areas where I feel the game could improve on:\n\n• Animation for the Main Menu Screen seems jerky and too fast.\n• Graphic Controls Menu could be better designed.\n• Rupture Farms is too 'Science Fiction' and not enough 'Dickinson' in my onion.\n• NPC Dialogue becomes repetitive.\n• Trip Mines are difficult to turn off.\n• Default keyboard configuration is a bit wonky.\n• Certain audio sometimes fails to play.\n\nOverall\nIgnoring what I just wrote above, I would tell anyone to buy this game. Especially if you are a Oddworld fan!\n\nWe all wan't that Exodus remake don't we? :)","February 25, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game delivers the story, mostly in at least equal quality. Some cinematics are even better, while others slightly worse story wise. Overall they average to around the same awesomeness. Graphics are nice, animations are good with very minor exceptions (for example, bumping your head on a corridor you were supposed to crouch isn't any satisfying.) and sounds are on a mixed scale, I didn't like some, I loved some, but I do agree that they needed more variation regardless.\n\nThere's some things I didn't and still don't like though:\n\n-Controls can be a bit weird. (This might be due to being highly accustomed to the original. Having to change to the action button instead of up for using doors/vents wasn't easy to get used to.)\n\n-Saying "hello" a second time doesn't get a second mudokon to stand up, like it used in Abe's Exodus. You can either have one at a time or all of them. This makes some puzzles slightly longer than they would be possible to be done in Exodus, which was close to 2 decades ago.\n\n-Scrabs look ferocious in the cinematics, but they kind of fall flat in the actual game.(compared to the nightmare that were the 2D sprites ones) Hoping for an improvement there in the sequel.\n\n-Detection from enemies, especially sligs seems to be a lot more automated. Not a big deal, but it's harder to play with them, lure them, avoid shot up close, etc. It also makes me wonder how some rooms in the remake of Exodus will be done, because they relied exclusively on that aspect of the game. I have also up to this time have been completely unable to reproduce fooling Slogs by jumping at the same time with them.\n\nOverall a must buy for every hard fan of the originals and not only them. This game's story, after all, has been one of my first interactions with the concepts of the true nature of capitalism and mindless consumption, without even getting the slightest of preachy about it.\n\nAnd hey, at least they did a proper port from the console version!","February 25, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game, even though it has been built from the ground up, from scratch, plays just like the original. Even though it has drifted away from the multi-screen cinematic playstyle the original had, it still functions with the same mechanics, maybe even better than the original.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and fun, yet still keeps its difficulty and is now tweaked to have three different difficulties to choose from for those that are new to the Abe series, familiar with it or are looking to play the hardcore bare bones style of the original.\n\nThe edition of some of Abe's Exoddus features is a nice touch as well. One of the major gripes I had with the original was the checkpoint system, which is now much better, and even has the addition of the quicksave feature, allowing you to save at anytime, from Exoddus.\n\nThe soundtrack is also incredible, HD and remastered, but still retaining its exact original sound.

They have removed the tiled movement system that was in the original game. I have no idea why they thought this was a good idea. The original game felt very precise and I felt like when I screwed up it was down to me and not down to the games lack of precision. I died many times to meat grinders because I thought I was a safe distance but it turned out I wasn't. While the new control system didn't exactly ruin the game, it does really seem like a poor design choise. I hope they release an update with the option to turn the tiled movement on.\n\nThe less precision of the controls is really the ony complaint I have about this game. In every other respect, they've done a fantastic job of re-capturing the atmosphere that kept me gripped for hours when I was little. The game seems a little bit easier than I might have expected (apart from the controls). This is probably just down to the addition of quicksave though (thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou for adding that). Some puzzles play a bit differently to how they did in the original, which confused me a bit on the first secret room for example. I spent ages trying to play it the way I remembered it, before realising that solution (as far as I can tell) didn't work anymore. It was a bit confusing how the same puzzle now had a different solution, but that's not entirely a bad thing. It helped make the game feel new. I'm quite happy some of the puzzles are different, as I could have probably played the game with my eyes closed otherwise given how many times I've played the original.\n\nReally looking forward to Hand of Odd guys!

The only thing that bothers me are the changed animation/sprites of the chanting. I miss the blueish particles, whilst I find the aura highly annoying (especially in the cutscenes). It reminds me too strongly of protective spells from Neverwinter Nights. For some reason though #MINI-SPOILERS# the end cutscenes have the traditional sprites. Looks much better.\nThe controls are also not as intuitive/dynamic as in the original (entering doors, jumping into whatevers no longer use "Up", but "Use"). You can no longer directly jump into the wells from an elevated position and there is some lag between stopping in front of one (or a door) and using it (at least for me). That's mitigated by the longer charge-time for Scrabs, though. You get used to it. Especially if you change the controls do resemble the original one more closely (important: sideway jumping).\nApart from all that, though, the game is awesome. Never would have thought that Oddworld's landscape could be translated as beautifully into 3D. Kudos!","February 27, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world is so unique, full with twisted dark humor. Basically, this is puzzle platformer, but not your regular type - this is a game where you need to save your friends from slavery in the factory via unique Gamespeak system. That means you have couple of words that you can use to talk with your friends, and they listen and behave based on your input. Now for your usual RPG this is pretty standard stuff. But this is not RPG. I've not seen yet any platformer that incorporates this system beside Oddworld games.\n\nSecond thing that makes this game unusual is protagonists ability to posses enemies. This opens wide range of game play approaches, tactics, as well as some really awesome situations. Now, possessing enemy is really simple - just one simple press of the button. Situations for that? Well they are more complicated. And that's part of the charm. To figure when to do something and in what order - this is Oddworld. Also each enemy type behaves differently creating sort of unique ecosystem. For instance - one creature is territorial, one pact based. Based on their behaivor, you need to figure best approach to avoid them. Now, beside things above - this is the game that also requires quick reflexes. But the game is always fair and it trust that you will figure it out. In the sea of games that hold your hand, this old school approach is much appreciated.\n\nTrust me, new gamers - try this one. It's really unique even by today's standards.\n\nFOR GAMERS WHO HAVE PLAYED OLDER ODDWORLD GAMES:\n\nI can't stress enough, how long have i waited for a new Oddworld game. After Stranger's Wraith we finally got new Oddworld game and it's remake of the first one - the one which started whole insanity in this marvelous world.\n\nThis is not a port, not a remastered version. This is fully rebuilded game from ground up of the Oddworld: Abe Oddysee. And it's glorious. While playing it i constantly had that stupid kid like grin. I was all over in 90's again. I remembered special hidden zones, some scene design and some really awesome moments.\n\nI've been shot, eaten, cut, electrocuted, beaten, killed on various ways. And i wasn't angry at all. I missed that in Oddworld games. I loved it, loved the patience that it required. Loved the puzzles. Incorporating everything in one seamless image works amazingly well, graphic are nice and i've beaten whole game 4 times with a keyboard - didn't have problem at all. They really put their hearts into this, and you can tell. This is still same old Abe's Oddysee but visually upgraded for newer generations, and you know what - it doesn't need anything more (well except follow up in a way of Abe's Exoddus). This is the same game that i loved for 20 years almost.\n\nDLC - ALF ESCAPE\n\nJust short comment since this is really new thing in this Oddworld. It's awesome, great spin on well established gameplay. Insted of saving bajilion friends, in this DLC you need ti save only one. Easy? Weeell, not really. Various types od obstacles appear and you need to take care of yourself and Alf at the same time. I really wish there are more of this levels, since creativity is there - level design is awesome and Alf grows on you by the end of the mission. Loved this part.\n\nLorne Lanning - you did it again. Really hope for remake of Abe Exoddus. Wish you and your team all the best.\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nCinematics for Oddworld: Abes Exoddus were soooo good back in the day that the team manage to re-cut them in short movie version and even managed it to submit it as Oscar candidate. (!) Thus making it first ever game video submitted for an Oscar nomination. That's how far ahead these guys were ahead of their time.","February 28, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thanks for the  reply, you can actually hold to run though\n\nOne of the best thing about Oddworld in the olden days was the gamespeak mechanics. In Abe's Exodus. You can called up to 2 people to follow you when there are 5 person in a group. Here you cannot. You can either called only one or all at once. Resulting in frustration.\n\nAnother thing is the jump button. The jump button is so damn annoying. The olden game allows you to rapid jump, meaning that when you hold the jump button (Triangle button), you can jump past bomb very quickly, the jump button in this game means jump up. To jump forward, you need to hold forward and jump and when the fps drops below 30fps, it results in very very clumsy mistake (as Abe will not jump forward but take one step forward and thus stepping onto a mine). Thank god for quick save function though\n\nGame score 6/10\n\nOld time gamer should try it. It is not a shinning gem but it is polished game.","March 7, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

My friend and I have played through probably a dozen times, saving all 99, and were both extremely excited to play New n Tasy.\n\nI had my friend over last night, and we played for an hour. New n Tasty definitely didn't disappoint. It's the game we know and love with fantastic graphics, comical one-liners from working Mudokons, and some really great updates/fixes for little quirks from the original (much easier picking up grenades, pulling levers, etc.)\n\nA big game dynamic neither one of us were sure about was the fact that the camera follows you instead of going screen to screen, but it's well done and it took 20 minutes for me to pause and make note of the fact that I hadn't noticed it at all and it felt very natural.\n\nI *really* wish there was a way to change the controller bindings to the classic controls, but I understand the change and realize this likely isn't a problem for many people.\n\nWe know this game like the back of our hands, and other than struggling a bit with using the new controls, we were both extremely impressed and look forward to playing the rest of the game.

Both are games I like to look back on with a smile, because those were not only some of the first games i had for my PS1, they were also the most fascinating i played at the time.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and Oddworld New 'n' Tasty is everything i had hoped it would be. The Visuals are a huge improvement, while not wandering off too much, so they remind you a lot of the original title. The puzzles are still a lot of fun, and there are some funny one liners you hear from the slaves here and there.\n\nThe only thing i have to critique is the new camera and controls. The new Camera makes certain puzzles a lot easier, spotting enemies or other dangers as well. The controls however are a bigger problem tho. If you are used to the precision and predictability of the original titles, be prepared to sometimes get a bit frustrated here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/recommended/314660/","rabcor","Easter Bunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/","382 products in account","Awesome remake!\nGreat graphics and framerate, cross platform support (albeit so-so but playable  performance on LInux; tested on a 550-Ti; I blame Unity.) Although it is a very good remake, I felt that the game is not as "solid" as the original, rather than making a good/bad list let's just compare the game to the originals thoroughly.\n\nPlaythrough time comparison\nOriginal: 10 hours (saving almost all the 100 mudokons)\nNew 'n' Tasty: 8 hours (saving 159(52%) of the 300 mudokons; but it wasn't long since I finished the original again)\n\nExpect roughly 10 hours on your first run if you've never played the original, 8 hours if you recently did. You will want to play this game with a controller, if you didn't know. Any PS style or Xbox style controller should be fine. (Or maybe the steam controller?)\n-\nThe atmosphere is lighter than in the original Oddysee (think back to the atmosphere of Exoddus; it's more like the atmosphere in that game) besides the more brightly lit, warmer colored environments, the voice acting played a big role in this, the voice actors were trying to make comical voices whereas in the originals everyone sounded more depressed, especially the protagonist. As a fan of the originals I did not like the new slig voices, that's what stood out to me the most. As for the mudokons, most of them sounded the part. I hear that for teh lulz they had different voice actors for most of the mudokons in the game. For someone who never played the original (or played it ages ago) this may not really matter, but a lot of the original fans liked the game for the dark atmosphere.\n-\nChase camera (instead of stage camera) this was a sort of "get with the times" featuer, but the stage camera was a very important element in a lot of the puzzles but most noticably what bothered me I will mention next.\n-\nSligs can no longer outrun your chant, i.e. when you would try to possess sligs in the original games, sometimes they would run outside of the stage you were positioned in to escape your chant, in this game the equivalent would have been to run outside of your field of view, but sligs are unable to do that (and this sometimes looks incredibly awkward) the up (or down) side of this is that it makes the game significantly easier at some parts.\n-\nSligs don't instantly drop dead when shot anymore (slogs luckily still do though) this was all for a feature so that you could keep shooting them until they explode. They designed the levels so it wouldn't pose a problem (at most you're shooting 3 sligs at a time) but in Exoddus where there's more of them, this would be a bit bothersome for sure.\n-\nSome puzzles were changed or removed, new ones were also added here and there. Unless you knew the original like the back of your hand you will rarely notice this.\n-\nHealth system; since there is now health in the game you can survive some fall damage and shots from sligs this time around (it's an easier game) however there is a hard mode which brings this closer to the original, but I noticed one major flaw in this hard mode which is thatin the original, your health (which only affected bats and bees and similar minor threats) would regenerate to full in a couple of seconds after you have not been taking any damage (or transition between stages) and of course when you die. There was no visible health, it was just a "how many hits you can take from this thing before dying" sort of thing. For players that didn't play the original, play on normal and everything will be goody goody,  But for others you will probably only notice this annoyance if you play on hard when you are in the paramonian temple where you need to jump between some swinging rocks and bats will attack you once you make the jump (I was stuck for a long time) I'm gonna report this as a bug though, so hopefully they will change it.\n-\nControls are rather different now and there is no "legacy mode" for the controls as is. By default now your character will run instead of walk (unless you use an analogue stick to walk) this I didn't like at all, but luckily there was an option in the menus called "button to run". Similarly the jumping button in the originals would jump forward, in this game it jumps straight up unless you are running forward. There was also an option to fix this called "sideways hop" which brings us very close to the legacy control scheme with the exception of (of course) the speech which is now bound to the D-Pad insteaad of a complex mix of shoulder and main buttons, this I considered a non-issue though. My biggest complaint after setting the options right was that running was set to the lower left shoulder which on xbox style controllers is a trigger button, triggers are a pain in the neck to hold down for extended durations but I struggled through it (although i would have loved an option to switch it around so that sneaking and running would be on L1 and R1 and throwing and alt-speech would be on R2 and L2, it's more convenient and makes more sense to put throwing on a trigger button than a regular one.\n-\nQuicksave system; this was in the Exoddus games but not the original Oddysse game this one is based off which brings some minor implications. Overall I liked the quicksave system in exoddus so I liked the concept of having an quicksave system in this game, however it wasn't set up as elegantly as in exoddus, in exoddus you could quicksave, then next time you'd die you'd respawn where you quicksaved.  In this game you will always respawn at the last checkpoint when you die unless you specifically load the quicksave after you die either by accessing it from the menus or holding down the select button (which is also the quicksave button). In other words, quicksaving could have been better implemented, but at the very least it was implemented which is good enough.\n-\nRagdoll effects, in the original games you either blew up or turned into a steaming pile of meat when you died (yes it was funny) now instead of getting that "steaming pile of meat" effect we have ragdoll effects, but I really miss that sound we always got when we died in the original, the "steam" sound . It was totally silly but it was one of these things that was actually funny about the game. I guess it's mostly because this game is 3D and the original was 2D that they couldn't keep it in this one but the ragdoll effects are very generic and I didn't feel they added anything to the game in the end so I would have preferred something totally stupid like what I described over the ragdolls personally, but it's a minor thing.\n-\nSoundtrack timings are not as good as in the original (and I also could swear that there were some missing tracks, but it might just be that some tracks weren't always played when they should/would have in the originals) I also noticed that sometimes sound effects don't play (clearly that's a bug to be fixed though)\n-\nYou can't always carry items between stages whereas in the original you could.\n-\nUXB (Toggleable) Mines are more difficult (While they all follow the same pattern in this game; the time to press is different than in the originals in the way that you have to super precisely time it just a millisecond before the long green beep, in the originals you had to press it as soon as the beep sound is heard, rather than before it is actually heard)\n-\n\nThat's pretty much it for the comparison to the original. My only major complaint is that the slaves don't sound that tormented, and besides the times they're beaten on-screen, they don't look that bad-off (there isn't blood all over the floors and walls like in the original; as I said before, lighter atmosphere)\n\nStory; 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nDefinitely an epic game, and if you haven't played the original jump right in on normal difficulty and enjoy it! It's the most 3D side-scroller I have ever played for sure.\n\nI'd love to see an Exoddus remake as well!","March 28, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The world is so unique, full with twisted dark humor. Basically, this is puzzle platformer, but not your regular type - this is a game where you need to save your friends from slavery in the factory via unique Gamespeak system. That means you have couple of words that you can use to talk with your friends, and they listen and behave based on your input. Now for your usual RPG this is pretty standard stuff. But this is not RPG. I've not seen yet any platformer that incorporates this system beside Oddworld games.\n\nSecond thing that makes this game unusual is protagonists ability to posses enemies. This opens wide range of game play approaches, tactics, as well as some really awesome situations. Now, possessing enemy is really simple - just one simple press of the button. Situations for that? Well they are more complicated. And that's part of the charm. To figure when to do something and in what order - this is Oddworld. Also each enemy type behaves differently creating sort of unique ecosystem. For instance - one creature is territorial, one pact based. Based on their behaivor, you need to figure best approach to avoid them. Now, beside things above - this is the game that also requires quick reflexes. But the game is always fair and it trust that you will figure it out. In the sea of games that hold your hand, this old school approach is much appreciated.\n\nTrust me, new gamers - try this one. It's really unique even by today's standards.\n\nFOR GAMERS WHO HAVE PLAYED OLDER ODDWORLD GAMES:\n\nI can't stress enough, how long have i waited for a new Oddworld game. After Stranger's Wraith we finally got new Oddworld game and it's remake of the first one - the one which started whole insanity in this marvelous world.\n\nThis is not a port, not a remastered version. This is fully rebuilded game from ground up of the Oddworld: Abe Oddysee. And it's glorious. While playing it i constantly had that stupid kid like grin. I was all over in 90's again. I remembered special hidden zones, some scene design and some really awesome moments.\n\nI've been shot, eaten, cut, electrocuted, beaten, killed on various ways. And i wasn't angry at all. I missed that in Oddworld games. I loved it, loved the patience that it required. Loved the puzzles. Incorporating everything in one seamless image works amazingly well, graphic are nice and i've beaten whole game 4 times with a keyboard - didn't have problem at all. They really put their hearts into this, and you can tell. This is still same old Abe's Oddysee but visually upgraded for newer generations, and you know what - it doesn't need anything more (well except follow up in a way of Abe's Exoddus). This is the same game that i loved for 20 years almost.\n\nDLC - ALF ESCAPE\n\nJust short comment since this is really new thing in this Oddworld. It's awesome, great spin on well established gameplay. Insted of saving bajilion friends, in this DLC you need ti save only one. Easy? Weeell, not really. Various types od obstacles appear and you need to take care of yourself and Alf at the same time. I really wish there are more of this levels, since creativity is there - level design is awesome and Alf grows on you by the end of the mission. Loved this part.\n\nLorne Lanning - you did it again. Really hope for remake of Abe Exoddus. Wish you and your team all the best.\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nCinematics for Oddworld: Abes Exoddus were soooo good back in the day that the team manage to re-cut them in short movie version and even managed it to submit it as Oscar candidate. (!) Thus making it first ever game video submitted for an Oscar nomination. That's how far ahead these guys were ahead of their time.","February 28, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is beyond beautiful and created with such loving detail it stuns the mind. The new cutscenes are gorgeous and the voice acting is a nice touch.\n\nFor new players the game design might seem a bit esoteric, the first Oddworld wasn't the easiest game to get along with at times and it does pull a lot of tricks on you (Ring for Service anyone?) but the addition of more checkpoints, three difficulty levels and quiksave makes things a ton easier than the original.\n\nFor players of the original games it can take some time to get used to, oh and do yourself a favour and select the 'forward hop' option in the controls menu, it will make your life a lot easier. The new ragdoll physics are something that troubled me, there are no set tiles like in the original so it can be hard at times to judge the distance between your face and a meat grinder or live mine. Ledges can be trouble at times during the Elum jumping sections and there's an autostop when you get too close to the edge when standing.\nThe Shrykull uses confused me too, there are times when you're free to blow up everything on screen and times when you have the power but can't use it because you need a Slig to complete a puzzle.\nI haven't played Alf's Escape for long because the level design confused me that I didn't get very far with it at all.\nI was expecting an easy ride so I first played on hard but quickly had to switch down to normal, they've added enough that it really does feel more like a reimagining than a simple remake which I approve of a lot.\nI'm really anticipating an Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus re/make/boot/imagining and I'm excited to see if there's plans to make a new Oddworld game too.\n","March 19, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That game was brilliant too and I actually enjoyed it more than Oddworld. I loved how your live ammo was literally live ammo. The humour, the storyline, everything about it was fun. This made me wonder if it had been released again, like Oddworld. Was over the moon to find it had and is available on Steam. If you never played it and enjoy this game, it's definately worth getting too.\n\nWish they would release an updated Jet Set Radio Future. That's another timeless classic.

First, the platforming sometiems has to be a hair trigger of a difference to make it through and you need a lot of patience to execute some of your movements or you will die. I played with a controller and there were times when I wanted Abe to do a forward jump, only to have him put a single toe on a mine and blow up. The Quick Save feature is also flawed, as while it is handy, you will be using it over and over again for dificult parts so you don't have to go back to a check point; good idea, but there are no save slots, you just get the one quick save. Alright, just have to be smart with your saves then, right? Well, it isn't so easy; you will be quick loading time and time again, which means pausing and gonig to the load option; problem is between resume and load is the quick save button; accidently press that in a moment when you're not dead and bam, quick save messed up. Luckily, the only time you will need to load is after a death or you fudged up a rescue, jsut becareful not to accidently hit quick save in the menu unless you actaully mean to. The deaths in this game are amusing at first, but if you die a lot, sitting through them can be grating; falling down a pit is the worst because you have to wait for Abe to hit the buttom before your checkpoint loads or just load a quicksave while you're waiting, but its still annoying.\n\nThe charm of Oddworld and the puzzle/platforming are still quite exccelent, making you think in new ways to figure out how to deal with a situation or even finding your own way to with enough creativity; it does allow deviations from the set method of problem solving, so one person's solution to a problem could be different from another's solution. Despite the negatives, I had fun, just skip the DLC level Alf's Escape unless you really have that itch for more.\n\n7/10, for those who like a good puzzle platformer.","July 13, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Nothing of major importance was lost, anything added in was only better, well balanced. Nostalgia in spades. It was like reliving my youth, a very unique experience that I have never come across in gaming.\n\nPlayed the originals on PSX many many years ago. Finished them both and got the good endings, after many hours of tears and frustrations. Definitely didn't get the good ending the first time through.\nIf you liked them, short of slightly different sounds due to copyright, which you get used to quickly, this game is everything you could hope for and more. Quicksaves in Oddysee! Living scenes and great modernised visuals.\n\nI rate it as superior to the originals. It's much more alive, fluid and far more immersive without the loading screens. It was a total visual feast at 10bit 1440p/60fps on a four year old PC: 4.4ghz 2600k/16gb/SSD/stock clocks 7970 (didn't even need to overclock it for maxing out these specs), keep in mind it was coded for 4k..\n\nIf you played the old games I'd reccomend you turn on old school controls.\n\nDidn't have any crashing. Only issue was in the launch version (since corrected) where getting under the fast saws was extremely challenging at high FPS.\nI can't wait to play this at 4k on my new build in the next month. And I can't wait for the remake of Exoddus.\n\nHats off to the devs, you really did well with this one and you deserve every sale you get. Please do not think bad of us PC users - we do pay for games and love them even more.\n\nTLDR: if you liked the originals, you'll very likely enjoy this more. Stop fretting and just buy it.","September 1, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've known about the game since my childhood but never played it. Now that the HD version hit the store, I gave it a shot. But there is one fatal flaw: the gamepad controls. Here's mys experience using a wireless XBox 360 controller (user experience varies depending on gamepad used and on sheer luck) 1. If I use the default XBox 360 controller settings, I can't 'chant', which is an integral part of the gameplay. 2. Setting up a custom controller mapping makes it so that whenever I go into aim mode, Abe automatically turns to the right and stays locked, which means that I can never throw things to the left of me. 3. Using keyboard controlls and overwriting them with a gamepad to keyboard mapping program is dissatisfactory.\n\nSince nothing helps to make the gamepad work and playing a platformer with the keyboard would mean I would be going straight to hell, I can only give this game another shot once the devs fix this egregious problem. Until then, I can't recommend it.","December 28, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

I remember being 11 years old when I first got it, back when begging our parents to buy us a video game was a hard sell. It's very rare to see a nostalgic game redone from the ground up, and yet stay faihfully steadfast to its core. Right down to each individual platform and puzzle. Of particular note, are the cutscenes. Obviously they're FMV's and not rendered with the game engine. Infact, I think they're the original cutscenes from the PS1 game upscaled. And if I'm right, then it really does show how timeless the art design is, since it can stand with games of our current era.\n\nOne thing I have noticed with these nostalgic games, and this is more interesting than it is a negative. These nostalgic titles actually feel shorter than they did when I first played them. Like, I don't remember the escape from Rupture farms being as short as it is, and I'm not sure what it is, whether it's the camera angle, controls, or instinctive muscle memory being triggered again.\n\nRegardless, I can't recommend this enough, whether you're a new player or going on Nostalgia like me. 10/10 would yo yo yo yo again.","August 19, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In order to navigate through the games hostile areas, you must use a combination of puzzle solving and quick reflexes as your character can die very quickly and can only attack through the use of the enviromoment, hypnotising enemies or using grenades and the shrykull ability, and all cannot be used with ease, for example, you can only hypnotise one type of enemy known as sligs and only if there is no sercurity drone preventing you from doing so. as for grenades and the shrykull abiliy you rarely obtain these through out the game and the grenades can only really be used when you are undetected. all these factors give you a unique and challenging experience that most will enjoy.\n\nThe game also features plenty of secret areas which you need to find if you want 100% completion.\n\nWhen it comes to changes between the original and the remake aside from the graphics and the smooth sidescrolling as appose to screen by screen scrolling of the original, you wont find many differences between the two. most areas remain the same as far as I can tell with a few minor changes here and there that dont make any difference to how you solve each segment of the game. The game does add a quick save feature which you obviously dont have to use if you want the game to be as close to the original as possible. there is also a difficulty selection which changes how much damage you can take but before you panic, hard difficulty does replicate the original games one shot and your dead level of difficulty. The game also features a new voice command "all of ya" which simply allows the commanding of multiple mudokens at once\n\nThere arn't really any flaws with the game other than fellow mudokens being difficult to command correctly sometimes and the AI acting weirdly at times.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that offers unique and challenging gameplay then I recommend this game to you.\n\n","October 7, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But no, it stayed true to the retro one I know and love, just with vamped up graphics.\n\nI was quite surprised how similar the layout and the script was. I must say I didn't really think everything would be done pretty much identically but it is. Can't really complain since I loved the original. Still there are 299 mudakons to save now as opposed to just 99 so somewhere they've added stuff. But for some reason I found this one.... less darker?

He stumbles across a secret he'd rather not have found out about, and his mission is to rescue his fellow Mudokons.  Killing a few of his captors along the way doesn't hurt either.\n\nThere is challenge in this game, and I'm pretty sure I picked up the 'Kill Abe 25 different ways' Steam achievement very early on.\n\nThe new graphics really are great, and small changes like finding trapdoors for secret areas, rather than just disappearing behind some barrels were nice touches.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  If you played the originals, this game will remind you why you loved them so much.  If you're new to the franchise, prepare to fall in love with Abe, and his sweet little stich-lipped face.","July 10, 2015","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

First, the platforming sometiems has to be a hair trigger of a difference to make it through and you need a lot of patience to execute some of your movements or you will die. I played with a controller and there were times when I wanted Abe to do a forward jump, only to have him put a single toe on a mine and blow up. The Quick Save feature is also flawed, as while it is handy, you will be using it over and over again for dificult parts so you don't have to go back to a check point; good idea, but there are no save slots, you just get the one quick save. Alright, just have to be smart with your saves then, right? Well, it isn't so easy; you will be quick loading time and time again, which means pausing and gonig to the load option; problem is between resume and load is the quick save button; accidently press that in a moment when you're not dead and bam, quick save messed up. Luckily, the only time you will need to load is after a death or you fudged up a rescue, jsut becareful not to accidently hit quick save in the menu unless you actaully mean to. The deaths in this game are amusing at first, but if you die a lot, sitting through them can be grating; falling down a pit is the worst because you have to wait for Abe to hit the buttom before your checkpoint loads or just load a quicksave while you're waiting, but its still annoying.\n\nThe charm of Oddworld and the puzzle/platforming are still quite exccelent, making you think in new ways to figure out how to deal with a situation or even finding your own way to with enough creativity; it does allow deviations from the set method of problem solving, so one person's solution to a problem could be different from another's solution. Despite the negatives, I had fun, just skip the DLC level Alf's Escape unless you really have that itch for more.\n\n7/10, for those who like a good puzzle platformer.","July 13, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

But with this, the exist to the next level, is not at the far end. And out of the train route, the Elevator, and a little crevis. Some How the Godamm Hole in the wall that wasn't that hard to find was the exist and now you got 36 deaths on your hand.\n\nSo yeah, exists are unclear and unless you want to start the entire Level over which might last an hour its going to pull a ♥♥♥♥ move in not telling you what is the exsit, and what is just another part of the room.\nyou can't go back and you immediately hit a checkpoint when starting, so all those slaves you were going to save are dead forever.\nAgain your going to have to start the whole level over.\n\nBut this in a way is like "Portal"  Its going to take you trial and error and a lot of fails, but when you finally figure it out.
