"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jondr/recommended/393610/","jondr","Jon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jondr/","435 products in account","Surprisingly tense and atmospheric stealth FPS with a quirky sense of humour, sort of like an indie Deus Ex. Hostiles hit hard, discouraging direct fire fights, but giving them a real sense of urgency when they do break out. The stealth *is* a little wonky but works overall. Mostly because toggling between sneak / running / crouch feels a bit clumsy and can scupper you in moments of confusion. Aside from this I've definitely been having fun so far.\n\nAt the time of writing I'm about half way through the level select, on the 5th out of 10 levels, following an hour of play. I guess the game could be quite short if it continues at this pace, maybe 2-3 hours. However the game makes a significant jump in difficulty during level 5, so it may be longer than this. The difficulty shift is accompanied by a slight shift in tone too, one that is both strangely fitting and a little creepy. I'm curious to see where it goes. It also makes me think that the developer got hooked on Dark Souls half way through development, which is no bad thing. I'm not saying it is like Dark Souls though, just a few aspects make me think of the game.\n\nComments on the Steam Hub suggest it will be $8 at launch. I would recommend it at that price, though the possible short length may be something you should consider before buying.\n\nNote: This is a pre-release review written via a Steam key obtained the developer. I originally purchased the game in very early alpha in June 2014 and asked for a Steam key when I saw it was releasing on Steam. I was not asked to review the game.","November 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

I really want to love this game, and this is just temporary constructive criticism\n\nAt the moment, ROOT has a few incredibly frustrating niggles that get in the way of me enjoying its stealth mechanics:\n\n1) THE RANGE!!! Attacks have a range that feels completely inconsistent and forces me to basically grind against any targets that I want to hit. Sometimes even when hugging an enemy my attacks don't connect. If an enemy is aiming at me then my kicks won't connect unless I am aiming at his arms because his chest is too far away even if my hitbox is literally colliding with his. This is very frustrating because it makes me battle with the inconsistency of my moves as much as the guards and levels.\n\n2) The hitboxes feel inconsistent. Headshots count for nothing, and sometimes stealth kills don't register if they are a few pixels below the designated neck point, which happens to be higher the characters camera. These are minor gripes.\n\n3) Sometimes it's simply impossible to know what you are walking into when you cross a door, and the sides of the door are not adaquate for hiding. Sometimes I'll open a door and the guard will be at a point in their patrol where they will see me instantly even if I'm hiding on the side of the door they're coming from. imo the challenge of the game shouldn't come from dangers like this that feel so arbitrary and removed from skill.\n\n4) Limited mechanics for stealth. It feels like stealth doesn't have a ton of width in this game, the main stealth mechanic is basically just positioning.\n\nWhat I do like:\n\n1) The enviroments get  pretty interesting for stealth.\n\n2) Knocking a guard out makes a very satisfying thwack with a great ragdoll thump. Don't underestimate the importance of that.","January 25","false","0.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

With many enemy types that respond to your intrusion differently, it is certainly a game to take a look at!\n\nIn all seriousness though, the multiple paths allowed to be taken with the stealth aspect make this quite an enjoyable ride for a decent amount of time. Could be tough for some, but take it as a challenge rather than otherwise! The artistic style appears simplistic, but you can change the colors of some things to your preference. This design choice also fits the mood of the game.\n\nI will attach the preview video for those that understand a bit better via picture/video.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratrogue/recommended/393610/","ratrogue","ratrogue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratrogue/","601 products in account","My original (thumbs down) review was:\n\n"If I ever had any love for this game, it was killed with the last boss fight."\n\nAnd somehow I still stand by this. If you don't think boss fights are fun (like me), you don't want to play the ending of this game. But there are many aspects in the game I like - for example, it's up to you how you tackle the levels: you can be sneaky, but you can also go on a rampage. A combination is wise, too. Each level is short enough to let you actually enjoy the lack of save/load - it gets intense this way, and challenging. ROOT focuses on this experience, and that's what makes it mostly cool experience.\n\nBut there are also many things I'd like to see changed - the boss fights are the best example. But also the fact that the levels all look quite the same. You can change the wall colors, which is a nice touch, but I wonder why the developers didn't adjust the colors for each level, to make them more distinct. (I also wonder about their choice of standard color. It's a bit ugly.) The controls felt awkward, at least at the beginning, and some keys seem to be superfluous. Enemies see you miles away, which makes sense, because you can shoot them at once, but especially with the small spiders it's awful to shoot them while they're only a pixel high.\n\nI'm also quite sad that there is a lot of wasted potential; ROOT has a lot of objects in the levels, but interaction with them is either meaningless "flush the toilet" or "take and throw it". There could have been more, like traps and bridges, etc. And then there are some scripted events, e.g. a creature climbs up a wall and escapes, and later is never mentioned again.

I find that they come across as unique in modern times. The animations are smooth. *See options menu\n\nMusic4/5\nThe music is suitable for the game. It feels right. Nothing stellar there, but it's good enough.\n\nOptions Menu 5/5\nThe options menu is REALLY well made. The controls are simple but can all be changed here. Most interestingly, the option to change the color scheme of the graphics is included. This is a normally overlooked aspect of the options menu that should help those that suffer certain color blindnesses. Good audio controls.\n\nGameplay 4/5\nThe actual gameplay feels alright. Some kind of cross between FPS and Stealth. Shooting plays a larger part than the stealth, due to how difficult clubbing moving targets is. If you try to stealth the whole game, it will be incredibly frustrating at times. Level design is weird, but that should be intentional here. The AI could be smarter, but is probably at the appropriate intelligence considering the stealthing difficulties.\n\nThere is a story. It's alright. I don't think it's the emphasize of this game.\n\nPrice\nThe cost is fine for the length/quality of game. At the very least, worth it on sale.\n\nOverall, it looks nice and sounds good. If you are looking for a simple but not easy FPS, this is a good game. If you are looking for a HARD stealth game, this is a good game. Some aspects of the stealth feel off, but you can work around those.\n\nI believe this is the first game by this developer.

Don't make the mistake of reading into the word "stealth" too much - at it's core, this game is a hardcore FPS in the vein of early Quake games, but the stealth is added as an option and adds a nice bit of variety to the gameplay. I've watched a couple video reviews and saw that there were some people that never tabbed out of stealth walking, so no wonder it took you 30 minutes to beat the first level. I made the same mistake when I first played it, relying on the stealth way too much, BUT if you combine the stealth options with the twitch shooter elements, the game starts to become far more apparent in how it should be played. I figured this out by accident on my second attempt after getting my ♥♥♥♥ wrecked 4 times playing like molasses, and it completely opened up my options. If I was running short on ammo, I'd go into stealth and club a guard to get some rounds, and if another guard turned the corner, I'd shoot him a couple times, hide, wait for him to come to me, and light him up. Use the cover to your advantage, that's what it's there for.\n\nOverall, I'm thoroughly enjoying ROOT. It's kicking my ♥♥♥ still, but from what I can tell that's the entire point - it's a hardcore FPS, so if you're expecting some COD walk in the park, you're sorely mistaken, and if you're expecting Metal Gear, you're also sorely mistaken. Play the damn tutorial, you can get the "Skip the Tutorial" achievement later.\n\nPro Tip: Expect to die. A lot. Embrace it, enjoy it, adapt to it. It's Nintendo hard, get good.","November 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/recommended/393610/","electrichellknight","ElectricHellKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/","95 products in account","ROOT is a fun and (very) challenging FPS unlike any you've ever played. The biggest thing to remember is that ROOT is neither run 'n gun, or stealth. Rather it is a mixture of both, and you cannot succeed by doing just one or the other. The key in ROOT is to strategize your moves. Think, then act. Don't act, then think. That, and commit to your actions. If you make the choice to enter and clear a room, commit to that choice and don't half-♥♥♥ it. Those are my tips for you.\n\nROOT is definitely a unique game. For one thing, the game takes place inside of a computer system as you, "Edward Summerton" (creative name, developers), attempt to hack your way in. Data and security software is manifested as objects and enemies, and rather than normal textures, objects are shaded in as colors which you can customize entirely to your liking.\n\nThere are three weapons in ROOT. A nightstick, which can be used to silently subdue enemies from behind. A pistol, which is accurate at all ranges but does low damage. And a shotgun, which is (obviously) best at close range but does high damage. Weapon handling is different from most shooters in that there is no recoil, reticle spread, or ironsights, and your shots are placed exactly where you put the cursor. This makes your ability to aim of absolute importance, as you can't simply panic-fire and count on spread to make some of your shots  hit the target.\n\nThis is a game that forces the player to tread softly if they want to survive. Nearly all of the enemies you will face are stronger than you and you must be on the alert, constantly scanning for threats. It is, however, not difficult to hide from these enemies if you memorize their patterns and know what to do. Most of the AIs are exceedingly stupid, and can be thwarted so long as you remain calm and take things slow.\n\nOverall, ROOT is a very fun game that I reccomend to anyone looking for a change of pace in an FPS game. Although bare in mind that it is a frustrating game; you will likely die... a lot. The end boss is especially difficult, but he can be beaten if you persevere. I definitely encourage you to give this one a try, especially if you are bored with the run-of-the-mill shooters, and want something different.","February 17","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action/Stealth FPS ROOT. ROOT was released on Steam on November 16, 2015 by Developer Deep Fried Enterprises and Publisher Digital Tribe.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uotaUCPGw9M\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nNeat stealth/FPS with a twist. Hard, but fun. 4/5 and worth $10 for sure.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nROOT is set in a cyberpunk world, where you are essentially infiltrating a security system in a unique way. THis game can be played the Stealth way, or the Guns-A-Blazing way. However, take note, Guns-A-Blazing (my preferred method) is punished severly. There is NOT much room for error at all. THere are NO health pickups to be found. You're best course of action appears to be stealth, if you have the patience for it. The graphics are actually pretty damn awesome, in my opinion. They do a greeat job of capturing the essence of the game itself. The music is pretty catchy, too. Even when I was frustrated with the game, I was bobbing my head to the tunes. Gameplay, great. Controls, simple. This is simply a solid Indie FPS worth your time and money. Go pick it up if you like FPS or Stealth games at all.IF you don't like stealth as much, you may want to think twice (although I do not, but enjoyed this game greatly). 4/5 and worth the $10 easily.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The game also took a bit to figure out the best way to beat some maps, like learning your opponites movements. I would suggest do a 1 on 1 encounterment instead of doing a 1 on 2 or more. Try and keep your health bar as much as possible, beacause anything can happen near the end.","May 20","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
