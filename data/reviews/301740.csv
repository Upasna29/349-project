"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seekros/recommended/301740/","seekros","Mr.BloodyLucky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seekros/","420 products in account","Having clicked 'No', I will add the proviso that I WOULD recommend 'Castle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover', but ONLY to fans of the 'Castle' TV series! Anyone else should probably avoid.\n\nWhilst I enjoyed the game, that was primarily because, as a fan, I recognised the in-jokes to some of the episodes of the series and the faithfully recreated scenes from the sets of the show.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a bit lacklustre. Most of the game is spent playing the missing objects mechanic whereby you pick out a small list of items from a large screen full of stuff. A bit 'Where's Waldo', but fine, although this does get tedious rather fast. Of more promise are the many little logic puzzle games which are many and varied - most are familiar and simple, but some are a bit more challanging. The only downside to these logic puzzles is that the 'Hint' mechanic allows you to completely skip the games, thus rendering them utterly pointless.\n\nAnd here we get to the big drawback to this game: the 'Hint' mechanic. In most games where hints are given, usually you get actual 'hints' to what to do, but leaving you to continue to work things out. In 'C:NJaNbiC' the 'Hint' machinic leads you around by the hand. Not sure what you should be doing? 'Hint' Go here, do this. Can't solve this puzzle mini-game? 'Hint' Solved. Really, the button should be labelled 'Bored Now' or 'Too Lazy'.\n\nI bought the game with the understanding that there would be no animations, just still scenes, but I was disappointed that there was NO actual voice-acting at all. The entire game takes place in virtual silence, with some barely adequate, low-key synth music to fill the void of all the text boxes as the characters 'talk'. This is a real shame since the game is based on the 'Castle' TV show which has characters with distinct and charming voices, so why not get them doing some voice acting for the game? And the synth music is hardly inkeeping with the music used throughout the TV series, which is chock full of funky current music tracks. I guess the licensing costs too much?\n\nAs already mentioned, there were no animations, it was all character portraits and still scene imagery, but the game would certainly have benefited from animated characters and backdrops. But hey, costs, what can you do?\n\nAnd finally, lets mention length. It's short. I played it through in 4 hours, and that was by doing ALL the puzzles. If I skipped through all the ones I had trouble with, that time would probably have been halved. Considering that the game is made without animation or sound content, could they perhaps not have made futher episodic iterations with new games or mechanics to it? Shame, as that might have made it worth the money, to have further stories to work through, like actually playing a season of 'Castle', with themes continued in subsequent episodes. That would at least have given the game a lift in it's simplistic and obvious storytelling.\n\nWhich leads me to what is probably the biggest issue I had with the game: the story. Without spoiling it, I will say that it was obivous from very early on what the situation was and who the killer was - Ok, so that reguarly occurs in episodes of the show where you can guess who-dunnit, but the story doesn't do anything clever with it, and comes to a boring and obvious conclusion. For a game based on a TV series with pretty decent storylines, and featuring a professional Author, it commits the ultimate sin of 'poor story telling', and that's the final nail in the coffin.\n\nTo summarise: the game has some fun little puzzles and recognisable scenes/characters from the TV series, but lack of good sound, animation and poor storytelling make it very bland, and the short, limited story is too brief, with no hope of any kind of replayability. For a casual game, it's... Okay. Ish. For a point & click game, it's... Poor.\n\nOne to avoid.","December 26, 2014","false","4.7"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","31","33","0","1"

(Thank you, Love.) I set to work playing it last night and into the early hours of today. I had a blast with it. For starters, I am a huge fan of the TV series, and have loved the Mystery & Classic genres as a whole for many years. So in this case, I got to have my cake and eat it too.\n\nThe game does a great job of capturing the essence of the show, from Castle and Kate's respective apartments, the Police Precinct, Morgue, and various other locations along the way, right down to the charming banter of all the cast of characters that we've come to know and love. The plot, storyline, and script are solid, and actually quite believable as the tale progresses and unfolds. The hidden objects are well placed, puzzles are well thought out, and if you get stuck at any point in time, there are helpful hints, skips, and maps to get you back on track.\n\nIf you have just randomly come upon this title, and don't know anything about the source material, fear not! I think there is enough well done mystery here to keep you intrigued.\n\nThe gameplay has NO BUGS that I could find, which is outstanding in and of itself! It also has very few faults, if you even want to call them faults... The music scores/themes are well done. However, they can get a bit distacting after awhile, especially when working on some of the harder puzzles. Simply turndown the volume controls if it seems off putting. The only thing that would have made the game an out of the world experience for me, would have been to have the stars lend their voices to their character counterparts. That being said, I have to congratulate the powers that be, for not giving us any vocals at all,  if the original cast was unavailable or the cost to high....\n\nSimply put this game is fun, intelligent and wrapped in a Castle ribbon.\nWell done!","June 16, 2014","true","10.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/301740/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","I'm a fan of Castle and the dynamic between Beckett and Castle. So, when I saw the game on Steam, I've bought it. I've done two playthroughs: one in 2014 and another one yesterday, just because I needed to refresh my memory for finally writing a review about the game.\n\nThere is a serial killer that is recreating scenes from classic books. Castle and Beckett are on the case, along with Esposito, Ryan and Lanie while Gates is supervising everyone while Alexis and Martha are kinda behind... As you understand, this game is set during season 4, after Montgomery's death but before... well, as they're canon, the Caskett moment, the kiss at the end. Besides, it's the world of the edition that is targeted, hence the title Never Judge a Book by its Cover.\n\nWhile the story could be converted into an episode, the gameplay is the standard one: list of items and puzzles. And while the hidden scenes are easy, the puzzles are really a brain wrecker. They're hard, except for a few. I must admit that it's one of the most difficult games that I had to play and where I skipped a lot.\n\nDespite that, everything from the show is respected: the whiteboard with suspects, victims and clues, Castle's books or pictures, even some other references are in the hidden object scenes: the laser tag game, the writer's vest, the 3XK reference, the coffee.... And while the graphics are classic, they're respectful of the actors: you recognize easily the characters, it's always nice to see a well-represented Stana Katic as she's portraying my favorite character. My only little downside is the French translation. Indeed, you for us can be the you familiar (tu) or the formal you (vous). Castle and Beckett never used the you familiar in the French translation in the show, so, I was kinda expecting "vous" but I've seen some "tu" slipped. Besides, I agree that it would have been more logical to have a "tu" as Castle and Beckett considers themselves as best friends at this point but I don't know why officially, they've sticked to "vous".\n\nAnyway, enough with my whining about language, I'm just sad that the original soundtrack from Castle isn't there. But well, the one in the game is still enjoyable.\n\nIs Castle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover worthy? If you're a fan of the show, yes. If you're an hardcore gamer for casual gaming, yes. If you're a newbie, check Artifex Mundi's titles, they're easier in terms of puzzles, because Castle will probably give you a cold shower. At this price, it's perhaps a little too much.","February 2","true","7.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

There is no voice acting of any sort, which is a bit of a disappointment, and would have made this a "must have" title.  However, I understand that getting the actual actors to read their parts would have been far too expensive for a game of this genre, and at least they didn't try to get impersonators to read for the characters, which would have been worse.  The writing isn't terrible, and it is easy to read the lines with the inflections and personality of the show's characters so that the whole game plays out like an episode of the series.\n\nEven if you are not a fan of the HOG genre but still a fan of the show, this game is worth picking up.  The HOG style lends itself well to the investigatory story style of Castle and as the Hidden Object category is a casual genre, you don't have to be good at any particular gaming skill to be able to fully enjoy this title.\n\nAs far as a Hidden Object Game goes, it's a pretty decent title to play through.  If you are not a fan of the series, the characters really aren't introduced all that well, and the nuances of the characters' personalities wont come through, but those are more added flavor for the game rather than something which would impede understanding of the story as it progresses.  The artwork is crisp and beautifully drawn and detailed making the actual hidden object scenes a pleasure to complete.  The stand alone puzzles are nicely varied, challenge-wise, between hard and easy.  There are a few real brainteasers in there which is a refreshing change from most of the elementary-only challenges that many HOGs offer.  However, the item pickup and placement puzzles are where this game really falls short.\n\nAs mentioned above the hidden object puzzles are well done in this game.  Not only are the pictures easy to see and objects easy to identify what they are ment to be, but there is also the added option of choosing to swap between a word list and a shadow outline of the hidden objects.  I especially like this option, because if it becomes difficult to locate a particular item it gives me the opportunity to get a clue as to what the game wants me to look for before having to resort to the "hint" button which just gives the answer outright.  There are also a few interactive items on each list where you have to figure out little mini-puzzles to get the correct item to show (which are a fun way to make the hidden object scene not just a clickfest for those who can't be bothered to actually find the objects in the scenes).\n\nThe stand alone puzzles are well done also.  Each puzzle has an information tab which clearly describes what needs to be done with the puzzle, as well as a reset tab to start the puzzle over from scratch.  And, if a puzzle just gets too complicated or frustrating, there is always the skip button to bypass the puzzle all together.  As I stated before, this title offers a nice range of difficulty in its puzzles and actually had a few of the hardest puzzles I've come across in this genre.  I found it refreshing that the puzzles are more geared towards adults than the over-simplified puzzles (like matching shapes or colors into their correct locales) that so many of the games in this genre seem to offer.\n\nAnd then there are the item puzzles . . .\n\nThis is the one area where the game really doesn't hold up well.  The item gathering and usage is simply a random mess and, as many simplistic items (like Q-tips and umbrellas) are stolen right from crime scenes, really detract from the story.  It almost would have been better to drop the item-gathering-and-usage style of this genre and just tell a story inbetween the other puzzles than try and make sense of the items you do get and use in the game.  There is far to much pilfering items from one crime scene to tamper with another back and forth travelling in this game.  No one would travel three seperate times to a crime scene at one end of town just to get some mundane piece of tape or basic tool to then drag back to the other side of town and immediately dump off for one double-A battery or another mundane office supply.  It really felt thrown together and was not thought out at all.  Too bad, because this title could really have been a truly spectacular entry otherwise.\n\nAll in all I would give this title a B- or perhapse a C+ for a grade.  It does have it's shortcomings, but it also has some pretty well executed features as well.  This would definitely be a game to purchase when it's on sale.","May 29","true","11.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Dressed partially as an adventure with some surprising game mechanics like, how the interview of the suspects is commited. The HOGs are simple, and at times far too easy.

The problem with this one is that it seems kinda lazy.\n\nMusic is dull and from what I can recall only 1 track.\n\nArtwork (whilst decent for most of it, and an okay representation of the actors in the show) is very minimal, often having the characters awkwardly staring out of the screen instead of at each other in certain scenes.\n\nBut the big flaw was that the final scene/ending of the game had no rewarding feel to it. The music was the same (Ominous for some reason?), the artwork the same, and generally no feedback that you were supposed to feel congratulated for playing though the rest of the game. Not even end credits... which left me thinking that some bug had occured - but I really didn't want to play it again to find out.\n\nWhilst most of the puzzles are okay, some of them lack that realistic logic to them that keeps the world believable. I mean, having to play BubblePop to open a phone? And a few times you get that "Our logic, not your logic!" design flaw. As an example - you're given a jar with a key in, and a hammer. You'd think you could smash the jar with the hammer and retrieve the key... in the real world, and against time, this is what most of us would do - but for some reason here, you need to get the Lid Opener item... If you want me to do that, give me the lid opener and not the hammer then?\n\nAh well, Im sure if you're a fan of the show, all of this this can be forgiven. But as limiting as the genre normally is, I expect a bit higher quality from them. Its a shame as normally I would put this as a low recommendation rather than give it an outright "NO".

There are no bugs or issues I found, the hint system works correctly (as opposed to a couple of similar games I have played recently that just shuffles you forward and backward between two adjacent rooms in a few places leaving you to work it out or find a walkthrough), and the HOG scenes are reasonably naturalistic (no over-hiding of objects in unrealistic positions, or too many anachronistic/out of place items for the location). The storyline is fine and keeps things moving, but nothing too special (note I haven't got around to watching any of the TV series the game is based on, so I didn't get much benefit from the characters interactions, YMMV if you are a fan).\n\nFor me the biggest weakness of the game is the point and click sections in between the rest of the game - while it all works fine and is easy enough to play and you have the hint system if you get stuck on what to do next, most of the tasks you have to do are complete nonsense, illogical and immersion breaking - you will spend a lot of time solving puzzles and searching crime scenes not for clues, but for screwdrivers, fuses, batteries, hammers, oars (to form part of a jury-rigged ladder!), and most bizarrely there is an entire section where you solve puzzles, dig up plant beds and drain a washing machine in order to find $2 to buy a soda to cool down a BBQ to get a pair of tongs.\n\nIn a setting where you are trapped in a murderer's house, or in a tiny village miles from nowhere, or whatever, these sorts of scavenging tasks wouldn't feel out of place as you don't have any choice, but in a scenario where you are in the middle of a city and can travel about at will it make no sense that you spend 75%+ of the time while trying to track down an active murderer rummaging about for things you could buy from the local convenience store, or by having a toolbox in the back of your car. Joint worst for this goes to using a cotton swab found lying around at a previous crime scene in the crime lab (well no risk of contamination of the sample there!), and pulling the lever off the wall in the church which you later use to operate heavy machinery at a construction site.\n\nIf you can look past this though, the game plays well enough, so I would still recommend it if you like the HOG style of game, you just have to try to gloss over the why of most of what you are doing and go with it.","August 31, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games sat there for a few months until I got in an adventure game mood and played all of them in a week.\n\nOddly, my 'adventure game mood' means I don't feel like paying constant attention. If you really can't concentrate, Sinister Stories are generally great with their hints, maps letting you know where to go, and letting you skip puzzles you simply can not be bothered with. Perfect for my need to be distracted but catering to my bouts of mental laziness.  (if you are a hard core adventurist, never fear, you can set the games to difficult)\n\nAnyway, Castle was part of the bundle and was the only one related to a TV show.  Almost from the very beginning of the game I started saying "What?!" and ended up constantly swearing at the absurdity.\n\nThe game plays fine, but what you have to do and collect is ridiculous as part of a Castle storyline. It isn't a matter of suspending disbeliefe, it is a matter of completely disconnecting.\n\n:Possible Spoilers:  For instance, you get a long plank of wood out of a locker in a church basement so you can take it to a *huge construction site* across town, to cross a gap.  You are a fabulously wealthy writer who has go through hoops to pick up loose change in one part of the city, to buy a soda in another part of the city, to pour on a bar-b-q in yet another part of the city.  It's all like that. That's all well and good if you are trapped in a gigantic mansion and brought nothing with you.  It is a bunch of "no" when you have a hefty bank account, freedom to move around a city and a police department backing you up.  I was constantly thinking 'he should just go to the store or have the police bring him this junk'.  Then for extra eye-rolling, Castle has to do all the forensic tests.  I am assuming the case against the murderer is eventually dismissed because the police let a writer test for DNA and run fingerprints.  If this was an episode of Castle, the writers would tested for substance abuse and fired.\n\nIf you like adventure games and don't care at all about its premise, it has all the adventure elements you'd expect.  Otherwise it's unbelievable twaddle -- quickly cobbled together to grab merchandising money.  Unless you get the Sinister Stories Bundle, I recommend giving this game a wide miss.","May 5, 2015","false","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dialogue is bad, the controls are bad, and the puzzles are 90% finding things which you could have just bought from the local hardware store. There's a reason why the majority of these forts of games are set where you are trapped somwhere.\n\nHow bad is the dialogue? I'm talking "It's no coincidence that he was found murdered only days after he was reported missing!" <i> indeed it isn't</i>, Beckett, and what an <i>astute</i> observation. Oh, sorry, I should have covered that as spoiler, so as not to ruin the game for anyone who was unable to make that connection independently.\n\nThere are about 400 kinds of hammer in the game. I know this is a common problem in P&C games, but I would forgive it if just SOMETIMES I could use the same hammer twice. Hammers are re-usable and I'm proud to admit I use the same hammer for nails, seperating frozen peas and <spoilers>smashing cement to retrieve a playing card</spoilers> (?)\n\nThe police in this game operate the exact opposite of how they do in real life. There's one part of the game where you <spoilers> ruin someone's computer at a crime scene to fix the computer at a different crime scene</spoilers>. <i>Excellent</i> police work,\n\nThe evidence processing games are a nice idea, but processing ecidence while still playing as Castle is ♥♥♥♥ed up.

Making the cursor disapear while using an item is only a good idea if you don't need the cursor to be pointed at the target so exactly, so I recomend turning custom cursors off.\n\nI <i>did</i> enjoy the computer fixing using a manual written in riddles with no pictures minigame, but I have a degree in computer science, so I guess that's just me.","June 19, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(i.e. Yes, with caveats)\n\nPlaying this game with no awareness previously that there even was a TV show called Castle probably meant that I missed a lot of the inside jokes/character interplay.  On the other hand, the game was constantly offering to skip dialogue so maybe the game designers didn't consider it to be of high value either.\n\nIn general, this is a Hidden Objects game.  It's dead center in the middle of the genre, playing a lot like a PC Adventure game but with a lot more backtracking and one shot objects to solve specific situations.  It was OK as a Hidden Object game.  (Lots of chaotic jumbled scenes, very few AHA! moments when I suddenly recognized new patterns.)  The puzzles were either fairly simple/straightforward, or extremely tedius where a monkey could solve them, given sufficient persistance and ability to randomly click.  Luckily there was the SKIP/Hint feature in the tedious cases.\n\nThe overall plot was very interesting; but the game had some specific irritant gotchas (for me at least), such as allowing us to use a potentially contaminated Q-tip swap from a crime scene as part of DNA lap work for a different piece of evidence.  There were several instances where it felt like they were trying to play with the lab equipment, but it didn't really add to the overall plot.  (Possibly a reference from the TV show I'm unaware of.)  I really enjoyed the Literatured Themed Murders (Hard Back Killer), but very quickly all the details blurred together and I didn't see how the selected quotes, etc. really added much.  (As demonstrated when they summarized them out of existence on the Evidence board.)\n\nFinal Score:  3/5 Stars.\n\nI would definitely recommend other Hidden Object games ahead of this one.  It felt like this was a product bundle with a known franchise with an OK game.  Don't buy this one for $10.\n\nP.S. I did enjoy the fact that you could view your Hidden Objects search list by both English name, and by visual Silhouette.

Castle, unfortantly falls short in almost every way.\n\nFirst off there is no voice acting from the cast of the show, no voice acting at all in fact.  The story is told through text conversations and the writting lacks any of the humor or charm of the show.  You could replace the characters with any other tv crime drama (or just random cops) and it would be pretty much the same game.  The only thing that comes off as a castle story is the Overly Bizzare case your trying to solve.\n\nThe art is alright.  Characters are reconizable and everything looks nice enough. It gets the job done but nothing about the art stands out or pops like some of the better hidden object games out there.\n\nThe Item fetching is where i really get annoyed.  I'm okay with having to track down a tool to get some item in an adventure game so long as its remotely plausable, but your part of a police inestigative team in this game.  Don't tell me i Have to find the two halves of some sun seal to use on locked chest so i can get a screwdriver to unscrew a computer panel.  Are you telling me the Police don't have a screw driver?  This kind of logic works in a more fantastic setting but not in a contemporary crime drama setting and it just comes off as halariously dumb.\n\nThe puzzles are also annoying as sin.  They feel shoe horned in and are themeatically out of place. Most are frustrating varients of the game Black Out (hit buttons until everything is lit up or facing the same way or removed)  I usally enjoy the puzzles in Hidden Object games but i found myself skipping most of these.\n\nThe hidden object puzzles are handled a little better.  Usally they pop up at a trashed crime scene or Castles apperently messy office.  They fucntion alright but finding some of the objects can be an eye strain.\n\nIf they'd gotten Fillian and some of the other cast to do voice work and had a better script and better puzzles this could have been a great Castle game but as it stands its just a cheaply thrown together cash grab.

It follows mystery novelist turned investigator Richard Castle and homicide detective Kate Beckett.\nApparently it's pretty popular and has won many awards.\n\nI've never seen it. I can't even remember the last time I watched network television. Nowadays I just netflix everything.\nIt's kinda weird that I decided to play through this game then. This feeling of weirdness isn't helped by just how bleah the direction of this game is. Licensed games are a crapshoot. Usually they're trash or have little to do with whatever it is they're licensing. NJABBIC is the latter.\n\nLike I said earlier, I've never seen the TV show, but I'm going to assume that it has capable writers that help bring the characters to life. Everyone in this game has cookie-cutter dialogue, most of the jokes are stuff you've read/heard too many times, and there's just no personality. Even the sub-title of this game makes me feel a little ill. Never Judge a Book by its Cover? Oh... Castle is a novelist..so books..covers..There is a mystery and...BARF.\n\nAesthetically, the game isn't much better. The technology is available, but I think more effort was spent on having the characters only slightly resemble their real-life counterparts. Also no matter the situation, everyone has the same facial expression. People are getting murdered and all of the characters have this perpetual smirk. "Look at me! I'm so smug! I'm solving a murder mystery!" The TV show is apparently really good, but this game gives a really bad impression. To be fair the mystery itself is actually pretty decent. It could be the plot for a solid two-parter.\n\nThis is probably my first foray into the hidden-object/puzzle genre. This resulted in even more weird feelings than originally thought possible. In the very beginning of the game, Castle has to collect some stuff from his den. I walk in and it is the biggest mess imaginable. He's got gloves, shoes, watches, belts, horses, cats, dogs, fruit, vegetables, and all sorts of other crap just lying around. I go somewhere else and it's the same damn thing. Apparently that's normal for the genre? Wow. It's pretty entertaining finding all the hidden stuff, but the massive leaps in logic is...normal for the adventure games I grew up with.\n\nThis game is a master-class in "adventure game logic". Everything you pick up is used once and then discarded, even if it could be useful in the future (like a screwdriver). Instead Castle will find another object that achieves similar results. Some of these puzzles are laughable in their absurdity, like everyday houses having strange locks that require intricate jewelry or random objects. This is some Resident Evil-level ridiculousness. If you ever stop to think about what you're doing in this game, your head is liable to explode.\n\nSPOILERS\nAt one point you have to get some tongs that have fallen in a hot grill.\n-Don't ask how the tongs got under the grates.\n-You have to cool off the grill to get the tongs.\n-This grill is located on a porch, but you can't use a water hose.\n-You have to buy a soda from a machine located in a storage facility.\n-Castle is a successful author who lives in a loft in New York City. His rent must be over $10,000 a month. He doesn't have $2 to buy a soda.\n-He has to solve puzzles to find $2.\n-WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?\n\nThankfully, there aren't any ways to totally screw yourself. In other words, there is nothing you can do that would result in an un-winnable game. If you get truly stuck you can access a handy skip button.\n\nFinally there are the logic puzzles. No hidden objects, no finding things to open other things, it's just you and a puzzle. The puzzles in this game are all pretty good, although a couple of them (wires) it's much faster just to solve via process of elimination.\n\nThat's the extent of the game really. If you're a fan of the show, don't expect to enjoy this game more than a non-fan. It's possible you might even enjoy it a little less, just because of how poorly-written the characters are. Still, if you happened to acquire this game via a bundle and have a couple afternoons to kill, it's not bad at all.\nNow I'm tempted to go through my Steam library and see if I own any other Hidden Object/Puzzle games.","November 25, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocktart/recommended/301740/","rocktart","Rocktart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocktart/","1135 products in account","Not a shining example of story driven hidden object games. There's nothing wrong with the hidden object part of the game, and the adventure part is very thin, you go between the couple of locations and try to use the couple of objects you have. It works, but is a little unsatisfying and there is quite a bit of jumping between locations to do 1 thing, which got a bit annoying. Their are puzzles as well, which are ok and can be skipped if you're stuck.\n\nIf you're interested because of the license then its a bit of a disappointment. The major characters of the series appear, the representations of them are fine but silent as they haven't used the actual cast, or stand-ins, to voice it.\nThe story is similarly ok, not good but not terrible.\n\nOverall a pretty middling game that just gets a recommendation, especially if you can find it at a cut-price.","March 16, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are a bit simplified, but clear and good.  The Hidden Object Game (HOG) puzzles are nicely done, and I can't complain about the voice-acting since there IS no voice-acting (but, that's OK).  At the game level, most of my complaints center around the non-HOG puzzles.  Several of them are ridiculously complex, and one of them (the File Folder puzzle) wouldn't accept my perfectly good solution.  My real complaint with the game lies with the "mystery" aspect.  Basically, the mystery is ridiculous.  By the second "incident," I had a darn good idea who the penultimate target was.  When the red herring swam by, I saw it immediately and knew whodunnit.  So, I spent most of the game rolling my eyes and groaning at how stupid it was.  Still, I got 5.2 hours of acceptable gameplay out of it and its current list price is less than $4 (and I bought it in a bundle for about a dollar).  So, I'm grudgingly giving it a Recommended rating.","October 7, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No music from the show's extensive score?

You'll quickly see how many items repeat themselves over the course of the game.\n\nGet it at a discount. It's just way too short with a single case stretching over five chapters.","May 10","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
