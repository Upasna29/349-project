I did not experience any of the crashing issues reported by other reviewers.  I run a Maingear desktop Computer with an overclocked i7 chip and a 750 Gig hard drive.  However, for what you get the price seems a little steep.  This download does not offer any new Turbine numbers - still no. 18.  Please offer different road numbers in future offerings as well as activities and rolling stock appropriate to the  time period the Gas Turbine operated.  This is one mighty beast and I played the "Through the Storm" activity which is an immersive activity simulating the Gas Turbines descent with a string of covered hoppers from Sherman Hill to Cheyenne.  Keep the Gas Turbine franchise going, offer different road numbers and rolling stock appropriate to the time of the Gas Turbine!","March 26","true","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
