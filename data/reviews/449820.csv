Your goal is to escape the lab by grabbing yourself a pair of employee passes and rerouting the power to the main doors but it's not just the guards that are after you. SCP favourites such as The Old Man and the death-hug loving Carving are among a cast of 25 different terror beasts and objects stalking the halls along with you whose appearances, like the layout of the facility itself, are randomised with each new game.\n\nThere are cheap deaths to be had and it'd be nice if the game paused the action while you were trying to read the background literature but at the price (soon to be free), I can't think of any truly compelling argument not to pick this up.\n\nFull review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF6qKcUOXQY","April 5","true","0.9"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","18","26","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/449820/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","Daughter of Shadows is a puzzle sidescroller that takes inspiration from various SCPs, from the well-known Wiki.\nAs a girl who can mind control any men and then use these men as extra health, use them to operate computer terminals, or to kill women who SCP-029 cannot otherwise affect, your goal is to find two keys and unlock the main facility to be able to escape.\n\nThe game uses randomly generated rooms so you will not always encounter the same things.\n\nThe main draw is the many SCPs included. While there are certainly inaccuracies in how they are depicted and how they act, the game does more right than wrong here. You will need to know about most of them, or have the Wiki open to check, to get the full experience though.\n\nDownsides are obviously the production values. It is a low budget game with not so pretty art and almost no sound. There is no background music and the sound effects all seem very stock.\n\nRecommended for its low price and connections to SCP lore, but if you're not interested in the SCP project then this has llittle to offer that other games can't do better.","April 8","true","6.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

It functions alright and provides rather little content (finished it easily within like half an hour or so?) but it certainly does have replay value.\nAssets look sometimes crude and sometimes out of place as if they were taken from something else, but that said, everything is really FINE for this price tag. No game breaking bugs or anything I could see.\nIt would be nice if you could skip the intro a la the game "SCP Containment Breach" but it really isn't a huge deal.\nMost of your favorite SCPs will be there (mostly from the Series I as far as I can tell) and trying to kill you just as you could wish for, and it is fun to wander around the (admittedly tiny) complex to find some that you haven't seen yet in previous playthroughs. Most of the more dangerous and active ones will start hounding you outside of their containment areas after being encountered initially (except SCP-106 who is there from the start) and there's actually different death screens for each of those that are capable of killing you (although the variety isn't huge by any means).\nThe difficulty is a bit sporadic since you can potentially die in one hit, or instantly from some of the more dangerous SCPs, that is also fine and to be expected.\nAll in all I like the game, but I have to say that SCP-029 here doesn't look anything like you would imagine from the description, and despite being supposedly a formidable threat just by herself, capable of "using any object as a weapon" and apparently possessing dexterity and physical reactions four times higher than an average human; here, she is reduced to being completely defenseless, relying on her converted zombie-like underlings that function as a blend of body armor, ammunition and access cards (it'll make sense once you played it), resulting in the hilarious situations when the enemies can sort of shoot themselves if you convert them while their slow moving bullet was in mid flight towards you.\nEven idle, stationary scientists (non-combatants) are capable of killing you if you repeatedly walk into them (or just once while immersed in light), which I found a bit silly.\n\ntl;dr - The game is functional and pretty enough to look at, gives you some insight in the SCP foundation and allows you to play as a dangerous Keter-type SCP yourself and find out how she interacts with other SCPs. At this price, I'd certainly recommend it, even more so if you can get a discount.\n\nSincerely,\n\n- SCP-1715","April 5","true","0.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

I don't expect them to be very long at that price, but something they all had was a save feature.\n\nIts like a flash game from early newgrounds, I feel it was a first attempt at a game that... shouldn't really go on steam. I don't want to be too harsh because it feels like there was a lot of effort put into making it and I'm sure there's parts that the developer is proud of, the possessing males is a cool idea along with playing as one of the SCP creatures-\n\nI can't get very far in the game as the hitboxes for doors seem to be completely off, I can only enter them by spamming w and walking around the area the door is in. Perhaps the game runs on the canvas system and the ancors for the colliders are messed up...?\n\nI would really like to like this game xD\n","April 6","false","0.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

The game starts off with the SCP Foundation having a power outage and you escape your cell as a result of SCP-106 who brings you to his dimension (he is seen in the popular SCP Containment Breach game).\n\nObjective:\n\nThe main objective is escape the facility. There are several familiar SCPs that serve as enemies such as SCP-173 who will snap your neck (most recognizable in SCP: Containment Breach),a bengal cat and several more, as well as regular SCP guards who will try to take you down. You must gather minions to protect you and those can only be men as that is her power. Essentially it's a survival game, as it's a SCP free-for-all, yet you are the only one that really wants to leave. You'll need to get 2 keycards and activate the emergency power to escape which is randomized on every run. A familiar SCP will also be able to help you escape if you encounter it during a lucky run.\n\nControls:\n\nYou move using A for moving left and D for moving right. W is for going through doors and accessing interactive things such as PCs, signs, etc. S is for sending out your thugs to attack whatever is in front of you. H is for healing if you meet the SCP that can do that. Spacebar is possessing men to act as human shields and your main source of attack.\n\nGraphics:\n\nSimple, yet good enough to recognize the setting and NPCs.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe spawn locations are randomized on each run (you start from beginning every time you die), but room layout can be similar for the rooms every time (some slight changes may occur). The SCPs that you encounter will also be randomized on each run as well.Tutorial is straight-forward that teaches the main mechanic of possession/mind-control.\n\nCon:\nThe only major con that people may find annoying is that you have to go through the tutorial every time you restart, although it takes only like 1 minute if you skip all the talking.\n\ntl;dr\nGood sidescrolling rogue-like SCP game with many achievements that places you into the role of an SCP trying to escape.\n\nScore:\n9/10\n\nNice little indie game with a familiar setting and solid gameplay for a $1.09 CDN. I don't regret the purchase at all! I actually got it for $0.65 (40% sale) which is a steal.","April 4","true","4.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

Even if it's cheap.\n\nThe graphics in this game are the worst I've ever seen. Even at maximum settings they are blurred beyond recognition.\n\nThe sound in this game isn't great either. Throughout I can hear the music, yes, but there's also this wierd hissing/humming/screechign sound which sounds like bad audio compression.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't fun. The place is a labyrinth, I get that. That's fine: lots to explore. But you have no map, and each time you 'die' you have to restart the game. This means you have to go through the intro sequence, making you likely to forget where you were in the first place anyway.\n\nThe controls aren't great either. A lot of the time any of the controls other than A and D feel unresponsive.\n\nAs far as the story goes, the whole SCP thing is fine, but this game doesn't really add much to it. You have some of the contained objects that you can encounter and so on, but it doesn't really feel any more impressive than just reading text about them on the SCP wiki.\n\nA lot of people talk about 'bad joke' games on steam.
