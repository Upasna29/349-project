He's active in the community, listens, and is very social.  +5 cool points for this guy.\n\nDust definitely needs some work, but it does have potential in our giant world of EA games lately on steam.  The graphics are decent, and I'm sure they will get better in time. I can run everything on max with no framerate issues and haven't had any crashes so far.\n\nPros..   Gameplay,  realism, unique controls, terapoly.com forum community, and a great dev.\n\nCons..\nThe steam community and steam forums.. 90% of my time in game consisted of getting team killed by idiots.. Not the dev's fault, just people being... well people.  The steam forums should be avoided at all costs too... Go to his official page if the trolling gets to you on steam's. These are by far my biggest gripes so far.\n\nHaving a black screen and some crazy clacking noise upon death is just annoying to say the least.. This needs to be handled much better than it currently is.\n\nNeeds more servers. You can't play if they are all full or aren't working.\n\nThe explosion effects need work, but I'm sure they are just placeholders. No biggy here\n\nI personally own an AR15 and shoot it alot. That being said.. sounds need worked on alot. I don't feel like I'm firing a rifle with the current sounds in place.\n\nThe map is a bit devoid of life, but it's been 1 day :D\n\nMy final con, which could possibly be a pro with some work.. firing. I have a razer naga and find it extremely difficult to use the middle mouse button to put your finger on the trigger and pull back.  I personally think it needs retooled or tightened up a little since some mice have stiff middle mouse buttons and it make things harder than they should be.\n\nIf it was me, I'd make the middle mouse button a toggle instead of constantly having to keep it pressed down for your finger to be on the trigger. Shooting would be 100% smoother imo.","October 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","67","77","0","1"

The mechanics, while frustrating at times, feel like they have a certain fun in their novelty, and I do enjoy all of the various adjusting and full control that they've tried to implemment in this game. Based on these factors alone, I would be tempted to give this game a positive review; all that being said, I do not give this game a strong recommendation however much I would like to. The positive attributes that D.U.S.T. holds are currently overshadowed by the lack of player-base, the oversimplistic map design, and the general disorganization of layout.\n\nIt becomes very apparent that the game lacks a large enough playerbase to produce exciting matches when the only server containing more than 0-1 players is comprised of 90% bots. This point alone would not generally turn me off to the game; I play many games regularly such as Insurgency, Star Wars Batllefront II, CS:GO, etc. which benefit greatly from the inclusion of bots and remain entertaining when playing matches even entirely comprised of NPCs/AI. But the nature of the bots in D.U.S.T. are simply frustrating. After spending so much time setting myself up (filling my canteen, adjusting sights, slowly travelling across the colossal empty plains, etc.), it is severely enraging to find that I am immediately acquired and killed by a bot from 75+ meters away with god-like accuracy. I understand that this game is intended for a hardcore, simulation audience, but when the average player, or even perhaps an operator in the real world, takes much more effort in the way of aim and could expend an entire magazine before being able accurately hit their target at medium-long ranges, it is severely enraging to find myself targetted and dropped by a bot after immediate, inhuman adjustmentsand  only 2-3 rounds sent my way. This simple gripe would be forgivable in its own right, perhaps it would even be an endearing quality. D.U.S.T. is, after all, intended to be a very hardcore, unforgiving simulation game, however a problem arises when this effect is combined with my other two component gripes with this game: scope of map design and organization of its layout.\n\nThe design of the map in this game is ambitious, something which I generally admire about this project as a whole. Its 4km x 4km in size, a titantic playing area for a first person shooter, especially one without an established publisher's support. This is something I would generally have considered a positive trait, and something which actually drew me in primarily; but it is also fundamentally flawed considering the overall developmental state the game is currently in, a point which I will further explain after establishing my dependent complaint in the map's organization. The general layout of this map, disregarding its size, is quite good actually. There is a central city, positioned in a "bowl" of surrounding hills; American and Russian "control points" are tangent to the North and South of the city respectively and factional deployment areas are located within 50-100m of these points. The central city contains a sizable quantity of various buildings and cover elements which the player is allowed to interact with, enter and utilize in avoiding enemy fire. The control points are each composed of a tall building, a surrounding wall, small cover elements, and a water dispensary to fill canteens. The spawns are comprised of a small amount of cleverly placed sandboxes and trucks which allow you to take cover and find your bearings before heading into battle. I am quite fond of each of these elements to be clear, and I'd add that the relative location of each is ideal; however, an unwelcome situation is created when these elements are placed into such a substantially sized map. The size calls for each of these elements to be placed (I'll add that I am not quite sure of the exact distances as I'm unaware to if they've been recorded) seemingly 100s of meters apart from one another. What I would initially consider an adequate, possibly even accomplished, map design becomes exhausting and irritating considering the fundamental mechanics of this game (which I've noted before are a postitive attribute and even a drawing factor to me personally.)\n\nYou are first deployed in the spawn with an empty canteen and an unadjusted, unloaded rifle. To fill the canteen, you must walk to the water dispensary in the control point area, open your canteen [MMB], turn on the tap [`], close your canteen when its full [LMB], and turn the tap back off [`]; to bring your rifle to a usable state, you need to bring your rifle up [RMB], pull the charging handle [RShift], aim down sights [RMB], adjust your head position relative to your sights [LMB+Mouse movement], and change firing mode to semi or full [Up arrow, Right arrow]. These mechanics are essential to your survival and your abilty to take down hostile targets. They are also refreshing, immersive, involved, and above all else, entertaining. But when these mechanics must be repeated upon each deployment (respawn), they become time-consuming, especially considering the 100m or so journey to the water dispensary, and then the several hundred more meters you must trek to make it into the main town. This repetition is exhausting and takes much too much time away from possible engagements and firefights.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend this game, at this point, to anyone. The game simply does not give enough reward to your efforts when adjusting your gear and making it into battle comprise the majority of time spent playing. I would, however, like to specify that most of these points are intrinsic to the stage of development. This game has significant potential and I would love to see where its development leads. I can even forgive all the negative aspects, there is true thought and merit put into each one, and they only become negative due to the lack of synergy between them. I've taken this time to write such a lengthy and detailed review because I believe that it would be simple (although perhaps not without spending a deal of time) to assimilate these seperate parts into a smoother, better-operating machine. The main problem, the gist of my issue with this game lies in its current map size. A playable 4km x 4km landscape is a great goal to set for completion in the later stages of development, but at this point, with the current "density" so to speak of the map elements, it is simply to large. My main advice to the development team would be to remove all the elements of the map, save the foundation landscape into a seperate file for optimization at a later date, and place the elements into a more compact landscape, perhaps with more cover in the plains of sand between each distinct map location. Once the elements are more reasonably spaced and condensed, I have a feeling that this game will become much more playable, with the various small grievances becoming insignificant. An optional change which may be of use would be to save the player's rifle adjustments between lives. Although this specific change I'll admit may be detrimental to the games spirit, it could reduce time taken between death and reaching your squadmates, and could create a more inviting atmosphere for groups of players looking for a tactical, squad-reliant shooter. The best option regarding this specific idea may be to allow the player to decide whether they'd like their adjustments saved in the settings.\n\nI really do hope that you see this, development team, because I deeply enjoy the fundamentals of this game, and I've only taken the effort to write such a wordy, exploratory review because I love this concept and I'd like to see where you can take it. My lack of recommendation is tied to the current state of the game, and I look forward to when I will be able to recommend this game to every single one of my friends and acquaintances in the near future.","December 23, 2015","false","3.1"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","45","61","2","4"

Once you get the hang of it, it's not really that complicated.\nMost of the keybinds are placed in such a way that it makes sense when you know what you're doing, therefor making the learning curve very steep if you have zero knowledge of how a gun work but once you know those things it just makes sense in some way.\n\nWhile I'm only 20'ish hours into the game I've already experience multiple adrenaline rushes.\nThat one second when you're about to engage in a firefight with someone and everything is in slow-motion, you have to know how and what to do with your gun and I guess that is what makes it so satisfying.\nYOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO THINK WHILE PLAYING.\n\nIn the current state the game isn't about just killing and shooting everyone you see; It's EARLY-ACCES after all.\nYes, you can join a server, figure out how to shoot and have fun for a couple of hours, but that's about it, so if you plan on buying it to PLAY it and not TEST it then I'd advise you to look elsewhere until Terapoly pushes out some updates to make the game more stable, because if you try to play it just to play it, you'll  end up quitting before you learn how to shoot your gun because of all the frustrating bugs.\n\nAs everyone else said please take a tour around Terapoly's forums to better ready yourself before you enter the battlefield of D.U.S.T.\nReview posted on early-access release version 0.2.0.0 - I'll update it as we get updates for the game.","October 21, 2015","true","54.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

You most likely wont leave your teams spawn alive anyways.\n\nDrinking water every five minutes is so over played in video games and im done with it.\n\nWhy does capturing a base take seven minutes!?

The weapon handling is good, its neat and innovative.... but I dont get to use it due to lack of a practical map development.\n\nIf this game is to be sucessful for the next year while its under development, they need to give us some form of instant action so that we can A) Enjoy what parts of the game ARE complete, and B) Start testing combat functions.\n\nDon't make the player spend $15 on this game, 10 minutes reading the manuals, 15 minutes learning the controls, and then expect them to walk for 20 minutes to the nearest base in hopes of combat to wait for 7 minutes to capture a base.... its alpha, let it be enjoyable\n\nIll update my review in a couple of months.","October 20, 2015","false","2.2"," 69 of 126 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","69","126","5","3"

I really like how you fire the weapon.  It forces you to take your time to make accurate shots.  This game has a lot of potential.  Currently the problems I have are respawning.

DUST isn't realistic.\n\nYeah, I said it.\n\nWhat to say...? Dust is extremely disappointing. It's a multiplayer-only game with no community... Which is understandable for an Early Access game. However, the servers won't start without a minimum number of players, which makes the game unplayable. Entirely.\n\nAdd to that a complete lack of educational elements and a control system MIRED with bad design choices (Say what you will, but clicking and then rolling back a scroll wheel is NOT a realistic representation of pulling a trigger.. It's just deliberately -awkward- in a misguided attempt to generate artificial difficulty. What's wrong with pushing a button to simulate pushing a button?!) and you get a fairly unplayable game... And I realise I have no right to complain about bugs in an EA game, but the combination of a complete absence of an 'escape' menu in-game and a four minute respawn time make dealing with one of the many game-breaking issues when a server IS available an exercise in frustration and delays.\n\nOh, and the only map is a giant desert with no cover save for a large, poorly textured compound that seems to be designed exclusively to generate spawnkills. I'm sure there'll be other maps eventually, but still... This is what you're paying for now.\n\nUgh.

Yes it has its bumps and glitches now and many of them make the game pretty uninteresting to play (i.e. running for 10 minutes to get to the objective before you can even fight) but I think that gives the game legitimacy for the realism that it is striving for and will (hopefully) achieve.

There ARE many bugs, weird issues, and wonky UI to work around. There ARE often teamkillers in spawn and the first outpost, and there are not that many people playing at the moment.\n\nThat out of the way, this game looks really promising. For several reasons:\n\n1. The concept is REALLY cool! And what's here right now matches the concept pretty well. You need to load a round into the chamber (left shift), take the safty off (down arrow), and then pull the trigger (in a much more interesting way than normal: press and scroll back on the middle mouse button). And that's just the gun. You also need to use a water bottle to stay hydrated in the desert, move your head to be in line with the sights, and you will most likely die on the second (if not the first) shot that hits you.\n\n2. The community (aside from the teamkillers) is pretty helpful. Everyone's new to the game, but people who understand the controls will often respond to questions posed in the chat on what to do to get playing. And there's a lot of questions asked in chat...\n\n3. (side note) The teamkillers (in my experience) generally just hang around the team spawn, and sometimes the first outpost. All I've had to do to generally avoid them is to sprint away as soon as I spawn, fill up my canteen, and head for one of the three middle bases to start capping the flags.\n\n4. The map is HUGE! I've still never made it to the enemy spawn, because it's at least a 5-10 minute sprint away. That walled tower everyone sees when they spawn is just the first outpost. If you go over the hill behind it, you'll see a huge valley with three unique bases, each of which has a flag to cap. (And yes, the flags work, they just take a REALLY long time to come down).\n\n5. The devs have been decently transparent about what's been happening, and have stated they plan to release some patches very soon (like within the week, as of 10/21/15)\n\nSo, conclusion? If you're willing to take the effort to learn how to work with your equipment, and work around the bugs in a very early access game, then go ahead! Pick up a copy and try it! The devs have only been working on this for about 6 months, as a 2 person team, so the state the game is in right now is actually pretty impressive.\n\nIf you aren't willing to deal with issues that an Early Access game is bound to have (not going to go on a rant...), don't buy it. Yet. Definitly look into buying it at some point. But don't give it a bad review quite yet, when you've already been warned by this and other reviews.\n\n\nTwo last notes:\n\nIf you don't like the 120 second respawn timer? Reloging doesn't take that long (about 30-50 seconds, maybe), and you may have to relog anyway on account of glitches.\n\nIf you want a game to try that incorporates similar realistic physics and gun handling, try the (albeit singleplayer) game "Reciever".","October 21, 2015","true","8.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I will try to avoid crritisizing things that are obviously WIP\n\n\nFirst off, most negative reviews seem to be dorf syndrome - people reacting negatively to the difficulty/learning curve rather than actual problems.\n\n+atmosphere is there - two factions fighting in a barren desert for water. There is a lot of empty space between each area and it's quite... comfy\n-some clunky controls that are there just for sake of inconveniencing - EG having to unscrew and rescrew cap for the canteen, open/close the lid of a compass. The animations are a bit too slow. While the slow speed of using equipment can be a great gameplay mechanic, I don't think it is a good idea to make it frustrating and annoying to use. There's nothing you can do with a closed compass or a closed canteen. Having an extra closed states serves no function other than a filler. It's like having a scene in a movie which does not evolve the characters or drive the plot forward - just useless filler you're better off cutting.\n-/+Lack of generic interaction key - operating taps on water drums requires you to use two keys to close and open it. There's no reason it could not be done with one key. Unless developers are planning to use two interaction keys as part of gameplay\n+never before seen control over your firearm - sure it's a bit clunky(mostly since we can't rebind controls yet) but once you get used to it its miles ahead of Receiver.\n+lack of UI - this makes game both more immersive and interesting since you have to look at the object to know it's state. EG wether a magazine is full or empty.  I do hope however, that we will see an "inventory" where you can see how many items you have left and repack magazines\n-loadout screen is a bit basic - could use the ability to configure what goes into each item slot(pouch)\n+vast scale of map - despite being large (Project Reality scale) it isn't painful to traverse on foot. Moving to an objective only takes a few minutes and you can use that time to keep an eye on it.\n+implementation of water - I do hope this stays at near central importance as of gameplay, since the idea of two ragged armies fighting over basic resources and for their survival sounds a lot more appealing than  generic milsim with two well supplied armies\n+large servers and no matchmaking\n+weapon customisation - you can select optics, barrels, foregrips, muzzle devices, stocks and triggers\n+bold and avant garde approach to weapon controls and firing mechanics - trying to change something that's been standard to the genre since it's birth is admirable. And it works!\n\nOverall it's pretty bared bones now, buggy, not juicy and poorly animated. It still is something new and different.\nHope developers don't ditch this game 20% into the development like most others.\n\n","October 21, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Please remove the scroll mouse button for the shooting button, it really doesn't work very well. Please keep just that one function to the left mouse button.\n\n2.

For starters since many of us are trying to learn the game, can you please reduce the spawn time to 5 seconds?

It has some big bugs which need to be addressed, such as being teamkilled, waiting 2 minutes to spawn and then not being able to spawn.

That is, you have to hold middle mouse button down to put finger in trigger well, then scroll down to fire, all while holding right mouse button down to aim.\n\nRealistically you put your weapon on Fire when you intend to pull the trigger and kill, here its a deed to put on the fire mode you want, you just leave it on fire, I understand wants realism, but keybinds dont make it viable for quick access.\n\nPlayer base full of Trolls, spawned killed 10+ times in just the 1.8 hours I played with maybe 5 people online.\n\nLove the concept.

IT IS NOT A BASIC SHOOTER LIKE COD, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THAT TURN THE OTHER WAY*\n\nNow, onto my review:\nMy review for this game is very simple. It's not simple at all. This game was not made, at least in my opinion, for the masses. I don't expect this game to be as large as say Planetside, but at the same time I don't expect this to be as small as Red Sabre. This game is a moderate game created with one particular gamer in mind, the simulator. I'm talking the people who take more than a tutorial in game to learn how to operate things to the most realistic fashion. People who play DCS and Train Simulator, people who are trying to live a life they don't currently live or may never live. The problem is that it's hard to sell a simulator on a gaming platform, and that I understand. I don't expect everyone to like this game nor do I expect people to want to learn how to comprehend this game. You'll know exactly whether or not you'll want this game by reading the forums and reviews. Don't give this a shot if you THINK you'll enjoy it, because chances are you won't and you'll get a refund. But if you're someone who wants to take MilSim to a level that isn't quite hit yet (I'm including ARMA) then invest and help develop this outstandingly brave simulator.","October 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Could do with arma style headmovement, possibly by shifting some of the weapons controls from the mouse -  though I really am charmed by the complex weapon management.\n\nMy advice would actually be to drop the price even farther, to get a playerbase started, then once you've hit a number of sales, say 1000, put the price back up. It's nowhere near worth even the current sale price, though I do really like it. I just can't imagine I'm likely to be playing it any time soon, as theres no players online. So, yeah.

After that I sat a a loading screen for about 5 minutes while I connected to a bot server. I then spent time wondering why there are 0 players online and only bots.

Then I googled the controls and how to fire a single round. Firing by pressing the middle mouse then scrolling is a pain. I then became dehydrated 2 minutes into the game and found someone so I shot a guy standing there while enemies came up to him.

A RECCOMMENDATION. SUPPORT THE DEV.\n\nIt is early days for DUST so if you are looking for something playable and polished you need to look elsewhere. I recommend this game still, however. I spent $11.99 on the game to support the dev and invest in their productivity. Making games is hard work and when you don’t have a publisher behind you your wallet is going to get sucked dry. You may not feel that Steam is a proper funding platform for a game at this early stage of development, but the dev didn’t pull any punches about how unfinished the game was and there is plenty of footage on YouTube that will show you this before you jump mindlessly on the purchase. I have paid for about a dozen early access titles so I usually know what I am getting into and have not refunded even one of them.

Recommended IF: You like the idea of this game, don't mind it being (quite) rough around the edges, and want to support the development of this game.\n\nI am glad I bought it, as I would like to see it developed further. Overall, the controls are clunky- but if you read the guides it's not very difficult. The game is easier for me to play with a steam controller than it is with KB+M.\n\nPros:\n- More depth to reloading and operating your weapons. Reloading is not just a click and wait. Did you save a round in the chamber?\n- Graphics options are not bad.\n- Customizing your weapon is cool (though somewhat limited)\n- Large Map\n- Fun multiplayer when there are people to play with\n- Recoil Effects and shooting is a blast.\n- Going to jail for Team Killing really makes you want to identify your targets correctly and helps deal with trolling.\n\nCons:\n- Map is empty and lacks diversity\n- Player movement is very 0 / 1 feeling... clunky.\n- Animations need work\n- In-Game sounds need work\n- Basic tasks are not straight-forward enough. ( ~ + 7 + MMB + hold R + left click + ~ to fill water bottle) In game tutorial would help.\n- Bullet ballistics do not seem ... very complex. It hits the reticle pretty much without any adjustment.\n- the AI seems VERY dumb. They just stand there, or just stand there and shoot.\n- Only two weapons, one for each side.\n\nWhat I would like to see is more fluid movement, a smaller, more dense map with less bots (or none)... basically CQB designed for ~8-32 players. Also, make the gun float around the screen to require the use of iron sights / scopes... otherwise however you adjust your head --> sights... it always will shoot at the center of the screen.\n\nTLDR: I look forward to seeing how this game develops. Buy if you want to support the development. In it's current state, it's not worth what you pay for it, but it has a lot of potential... and is worth it if the developer puts some more love into it! I am happy with the purchase.","January 2","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reloading takes a little bit of effort, and hopefully we'll get malfunctions as well occasionally.\nIt's only 15 dollars for a game that when finished could be a smash hit among the ARMA community.\nTeaches people about gun mechanics if they don't already know.\nDev is actually a really good guy, as apposed to most.\n\n-Cons-\nIt's lacking content, but it's also in early access.\nIt takes like 10 minutes to learn all of the buttons.\nLack of community which can also be attributed to early access.\nOther players will kick your ♥♥♥ until you're used to the controls and gain fluidity.\n\n-Overall-\nAmazing game, and I can see it being a smash hit if it continues on it's current design path.","December 27, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And what I mean by this is to try to calculate the times between those things which take them 1 second 5 seconds and or 10 to 30 and so on. For instance reloading a new magazine into a rifle of some specified kind like the dragunov. For the average loader who might have to reload it probably should take them an average amount of time, say like 10-15 seconds. Now I like your Idea of having to give full control to the player very daring of you and so you have brought something that is truely new to the table of gaming. So I will give this game the recommendation it deserves. But consider the averages of times between doing anything in real life as you attempt to in this game. So as an example once again, for a game that will be or perhaps will be based on teamwork and essentially combat oriented you must find an average of balance between the real world and a world based upon computers/machines/(fiction) I say fiction because all games obviously are not life and death situations concerning actual lives in the real world. So with the current pace of the player made controls and characters it just doesn't really simulate how long things would really take in the real world. Now this is of course something that I realize may not be so helpful with tangeble things about the game such as bugs like the throwing of grenades how you sometimes are stuck. But balancing time and animations between real life and essentially a fake one will be very important to bring both into cohesion. So you may or may not have to minus a couple of animations or things to do while your in a combat based zone and or game entirely. Think about it those who are in Iraq or in a war zone today would likely not have to take too much out of their time for ex. aim, shoot, or get from location to location. So as my conclusion I think you would have to do some actual calculations between doing things in the real world to how fast or slow you can or have to do those same things in the closest manner doing them on a keyboard.","March 3","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to upvote it for now, because I think it's really unfair to review it at this point, and I think as gamers we tend not to revisit products we saw that had mixed and negative ratings.\n\nBe forewarned:  I would only pick this title up if you want to support the dev's vision of the game and you want to be an active tester.  At this stage, I'm not sure I'd even call it in an alpha-state.  Right now I'd suggest following this game for a while if, and only if, you are looking for a more in-depth treatment of shooting.  Slower even then ARMA.  If you watch live combat footage then you start to see similarities between it and this game.  There is a significantly slower pace to combat, and initially it will shock casual shooter players, because the mechanics require you to do more than left click to shoot and tap R to reload.  It's slightly awkward at first, but once you get used to the keypresses needed to operate your weapon or supporting gear, it isn't too bad.\n\nRight now there isn't a whole lot to shoot but bots, and not a whole lot to tinker with on the gun bench.  I'm sure that will all come in time.  How much time?
