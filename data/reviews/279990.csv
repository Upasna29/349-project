Maps are definitely less challenging. Apparently this game is directed to beginners. But is that good game? Yes and no. It is a good game if you didn't play first Bridge Constructor. But if you did, there is almost nothing new and nothing challenging here.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you like puzzle games and haven't played other bridge building games before, this is a game for you. Buy it and enjoy it, you will be surpriced how much fun is in bridge building.\nIf you completed first Bridge Constructor game, you will find no challenge here. Buy it on sale only if you want to get all achievements in short time.\n\nLike this review?

It's not good like Bridge Constructor Medieval, but basically you can make the same innovations. The biggest lack: theres is not really a story. You just hop from island to island to build bridges across rivers or valleys. The variousity of landscapes is also very low.\n\nThere are three different goals: 1. build the cheapest bridge, 2. build a bridge that can handle the weight stress test at its best and 3. build a bridge with only allowed materials. Sometimes there is a limit of money or a certain number of elements you can use. Another goal is to make it safe for trucks. Btw forget about the cars. In the end just the trucks count.\n\nSo you play each level 2-3 times to fullfill all goals and then you will notice it's always the same. The bridges with less weight stress are always made out of concrete and cable. The cheapest bridges can be wooden but it mustn't be. And for the material bridges mostly steel and wood is allowed both. Yeah it's challenging but otherwise it can be boring.\n\nAltogether playing this game was mediocre fun but it's OK. In the end there is that notorious facebook achievement which obviously doesn't work for everybody on the first try. That's a bit annoying.","October 6, 2014","true","7.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

The addition of badges in this game are fantastic as it gives you 5 separate goals to complete on each bridge, that you can do individually, giving a bit of replay-ability and problem solving for each bridge.\n\nThere is also a tension/weight meter at the top that displays in real time the pressure on your bridge, which I think is a great addition as it can give you better insight on how/what needs improved on your bridge, and by how much.\n\nOverall I think this is a nice addition to the series, albeit it seems quite shorter than the standard Bridge Constructor. If you are a fan of the series I would recommend the purchase or if you are new to it, I would suggest getting the bundle and playing this one first.","October 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/279990/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","Upsides:\n- Actual learning value in the area of bridge engineering and understanding of mechanical and physical principles. Even if the physics engine is not flawless and the means are very limited, with the basics it offers it's still a lot of fun. Physics-based puzzles are more interesting than mere logic-based ones. It's more exciting to have that connection to real-life engineering, and it's fun to watch the result play out.\n- Lots of freedom. Feels like there's not one single optimum solution. Being given several approaches in which to build a bridge (cheap, sturdy, materials-limited) further increases the range of possible ways to solve the problems.\n- A good bit of creative opportunity apart from the challenges given.\n- No handholding. It expects you to figure out the advanced building techniques on your own, but gives you scenarios and tasks that subtly nudge you in the right direction. So it's more like the whole game itself is the tutorial.\n\nDownsides:\n- Launcher doesn't save the graphics quality level.\n- Steam leaderboards advertised, but they seem to be missing.\n- Advertises an extensive tutorial. As mentioned above, that's really not the case. It's at best a moderate tutorial. (The fact is OK, the false description is not.)\n- One achievement requires you to share a bridge on Facebook. You can manage to get it even if it fails if you keep trying, but this was almost enough for me to not play it.\n- Quite a bit of randomness regarding the results involved, sometimes especially between play sessions. That makes it closer to reality I guess.\n- Not enough musical variety.\n- Only one setting for music on/off, nothing else sound-wise. But, I guess playing one's own music is the best option here.\n- Element highlighing not perfect. It removes the one you're pointing at, but sometimes highlights a different one.\n\nOn a more personal note: I havent's played the regular Bridge Constructor, but I think I wouldn't like it. This is called "Playground" for a good reason. Outside of the context of the challenges that give you medals, the element of scarcity (limited building resources and such) is not present in this game, and I like that a lot. People tend to live what they train/prepare for, and I enjoy living abundance.","October 1, 2014","true","16.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If I had paid money for this I would be incredibly sad, especially at a $10 price point directly from Steam.\n\nFirst Impressions This looks like a bad iPad game written in Unity. Probably because it is.\n\nControls The entire UI is clearly based around a touch screen, with the cursor acting as a glorified finger. You can't adjust sound levels in the game, I had to adjust them in Windows mixer because it screams at you. You can enable/disable the horrible music with a button on the start screen, that is the extent of the options menu. There are only a couple keybindings, and none are really useful except for undo.\n\nFurther Play So after beating the Tutorial missions I wanted to try some of the harder ones. Nope, I have to replay the tutorial missions to get 25 "badges."\n\nBadges Badges are horrible. It's literally impossible to accomplish all of them in one run, and for the two budget-based ones there are one, maybe two solutions for each. It's infuriating how low the budgets are set, you genuinely do have to do it EXACTLY like it wants you to otherwise you go over budget or load.\n\nIf this was a iPad/Android Tablet game it would be subpar. On a computer this is just horrible.

Build a truck-worthy bridge really cheaply, then again more expensive but where no piece is really strained, then again using only X-types of pieces.... eh.\n\nIt just feels too similar to the regular "Bridge Constructor", so I'd recommend getting one, not both.  Better yet, get Bridge Constructor: Medieval...it has a corny "story", better challenges, varying goals/restrictions for each level, and feels more varied.

The steam acheivements are not bad neither and some seem to be funny when you think about it a bit.
