"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/58570/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Next Big Thing, is a point and click adventure game developed by Pendulo Studios. Being released in February of 2011 on both PC and iOS devices.\n\nGameplay in TNBT is your standard point and click action. You can walk around the areas fairly freely, allowing you to interact with objects and talk to other characters in the game. Obviously with all point and clicks the game play is not why you are playing. The puzzles in the game are somewhat entertaining as well, some of them really make you think, but are not so obscure that you have no chance of working them out. I had to resort to a guide for a few of them, but that is more than can be said for other Point and click titles out there.  The game’s UI is one of the better I have seen in this genre, it is very easy to navigate and to select objects and use them in different ways.  Even though the game doesn’t have any sort of in game tutorial, there is no real need for one since it is all so self-explanatory.\n\nThe game has a really nice art style. Whilst the game does have “cut scenes”, this is done in the same style and effect as the actual real time stuff. You can only really tell a difference with the frame rates.  The character animations are all fantastic too; there isn’t one weird looking walk, or strange facial expression to be seen here, a very nice looking game in my opinion.\n\nAs with all good point and click games, you should expect a half decent story, well The Next Big Thing certainly delivers there. I went into the game expecting it to be a sort of political tale, I was wrong.  The plot is set Los Angeles in an alternative reality. The two main characters, Murray and Allaire are both detectives and you set on the assignment to cover a kidnapping and conspiracy.  There is some witty banter between the two characters, and this is what drew me into the game right from the get-go. The dialogue between all characters is all top of the range and I was overwhelmed with how good they all sounded. The story does have a few clichés, but overall it is captivating enough that it kept me engaged right until the end.\n\nThere isn’t a real difficulty level to this type of game. It is only hard if you cannot work out how to progress with puzzles. But like I said above, none of the puzzles are so strange and obscure that you cannot work them out by using a little bit of thinking juice. This is something which I admire in point and click games nowadays and even though some may be a little let down by this, The Next Big Thing is a casual experience.\n\nThe full story took me just about seven hours to get through – for a point and click game I think that is just about the right length, it allowed the game to reach an end which tied up most loose ends, and it leaves you wanting more of the same, without over staying it’s welcome. There isn’t any replay ability sadly since it is very linear.\n\nI didn’t run into any major technical problems during my time playing. The game runs at all resolutions and given that the game is mostly pre-rendered graphics, it can run on any type of hardware (it’s an iOS game so….).  The only slight problem I had, was that the game doesn’t lock your cursor in the game’s window; if this was any other game than a point and click, this would have been a major issue, but since it is a slow paced adventure game I can forgive it there; but honestly in this day and age, these types of issues should be mopped up.\n\nThe Next Big Thing is an absolutely stellar game and one that fans of the genre should really be checking out. The game’s interesting story line and good looking art style, on top of some quality voice acting, you can’t really go wrong with checking this title out.  The price tag of £6, 99 is well and truly on point with the amount of content and quality of it on show as well, so definitely picks it up when you can.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Looking at  earlier titles from the  company i wasn't exspecting too much in ways of gameplay/storyline as these games lacked the reviews that Yesterday had received. I'm not sure if i just wasn't paying attention when they came out, but this was the first i had heard of these titles.\n\nFor a point and click game 'The Next BIG Thing' did not dissapoint, providing a variety of areas and 'puzzles' to last a few solid hours. Being a somewhat indie title i didn't bank on the game being the standard 9hrs but was pleasntly surprized by the games 2-3hr playtime.\n\nSome of the puzzles are insanely complex and require you to either be playing on easy for hints or to have access to a walkthrough (praise google!). As certain items open up key dialogue etc, without the game informing you as such.\n\nOverall the story is rather weird but seems to work rather well with the genre. The game takes a while to get used to and seems to require some prior knowledge of controls as well as some minor character information. These things seemed easy enough to overcome and fill in the gaps yourself.\n\ntldr: This is a very fun game for those who like a good puzzle/adventure/point and click! Also its on sale at the moment for $2.50 and its well worth the price tag.","June 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","1"

Pendulo loves us all.\nFull disclosure: I've had a number of jobs on horror/b-movies, this game was recommended to me by a director I worked with.\nThe Next Big Thing is a very well put together Point-n-clicker set in a schlock B-movie world. with a style and a sense of humour ideally suited to the setting. The story is very good and makes as much sense as anything in that world. Play as 2 very different characters through different chapters, solving puzzles in different ways. The graphics are high quality, well animated, and fit together. Sounds are good, music is good enough to listen to through the game. Dialogue is well acted and natural sounding, so an advantage over Daedalic there.\nThe only downside is that it's now over. It was short, and I don't see myself going back to it again.  The story's done in a few hours, and there's no sequel hook, which kinda limits the bang-for-buck. Look out for it in a sale.","May 12, 2015","true","9.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

If you an adventure and point clicker gamer, this is one for you. A big bunch of crazy dumb monsters, some good jokes and well-made characters and you're in ;o) Some nice puzzle to go through. Some are tougher than others, but all in all it’s not a hard game. You have to be careful to every details in each scenery you’re going through (for instance, some of the things you will notice, that could be useful further in the game).\n\nAlso you will going to play two different parts which make this game more interesting as you will have to deal with the temper of each one.\n\nThe story is well made with some original development during the game.\n\nOverall, it is a game in the vein of Pendulo Studio and what If I may say so, a nice Lucasart revamp. Hope to see some more (like the Runaway saga)!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nC’est vraiment un jeu très marrant! Si vous êtes un joueur de jeu d’aventure en point and click, alors c’est un jeu pour vous. Un bon nombre de monstres idiots et fous, de bonnes blagues et des personnages bien fait et vous y êtes ;o)\nDe bons puzzles à passer. Certains sont plus durs que d’autres, mais l’un dans l’autre, ce n’est pas un jeu très difficile. Vous devez faire attention à tous les détails dans chacune des scènes que vous allez traverser (notamment, pour certaines choses que vous allez voir, cela pourra vous servir plus tard)\n\nAussi, vous allez jouer deux personnages différents ce qui rend le jeu plus intéressant du fait que vous aurez à composer avec le caractère de chacun.\n\nL’histoire est bien faite avec un développement assez original durant le jeu.\n\nEn conclusion, c’est un jeu tout à fait dans la trempe de Pendulo Studio et si je puis le dire, un beau clin d’œil à Lucasart.

What this game does well is the humor and the story, the characters are good and the puzzles range from easy to medium. There was only a couple that I struggled with but one of those was simply because I missed a doorway to another room so it was my own pixel hunting prowess that failed me not the puzzle itself. The downside is the puzzles when easy are so easy that feels pointless making you solve them but I did not feel that way enough times to make this a bad game.\n\nI would recommend this game to adventure game lovers and even those who like a light hearted and humorous short game to play between potentially larger more complex and demanding titles in your library. As adventure games go it is about the right size in length to feel like spent your time enjoying it and not becoming a chore to get to the end. Speaking of the end it was a let down I felt (I won't say why as that would be a spoiler), but I felt it was predictable and could have been better but it does not damage the quality of the enjoyment too much that I had playing this title.\n\nHow much the game is worth is subjective so I can't say it is worth it's price x to other people because everyone values things differently. What I would say is I found it to be worth what I paid which I picked it up on a 50% off sale a while back, I would have even been tempted to pay full price though having played it now based on how much I enjoyed it but I cannot say others would feel the same way. I still find more enjoyment from Daedalics adventure games than Pendulos titles, Pendulos adventure games have a certain charm but my personal preference is Daedalics style. This game is probably my favorite one from Pendulo that I have played in a long time, much better than the Runaway series I feel.","November 26, 2013","true","5.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

The characters are likeable and emotional, and the story is well done, though quite simple at times.\nThe game adds on a variety of ideas that help simplify some of the tediousness that normally stems from point-and click adventures, such as allowing your character to fast travel to a location by double clicking it, instead of having to sit and watch as your character crosses a large space simply to investigate something and skipping faster through dialogue by left clicking. The graphics are well done, in a cell shaded manner, and very aptly portray the emotions of the characters, seeming more so like an animated movie than a game.\nThe characters present are all very unique from each other, though I wish we got to see more of the ones that are so commonly mentioned, such as the Octopus Haring, who is mentioed to be a pretty bad guy. The game could have also done to be a bit longer, with a little more puzzles, and the ending before the final scene could have been a little more fleshed out, but I still finished the game satisfied. The final scene of the game was very well done, and actually caught me off guard.

Recommended for lovers of other games made by Péndulo Studios. Not recommended for all others. You might take a look at the numerous other adventures which have been relased since then. There is a demo version as well, so if you are interested, check that out first.\n\n\nReview:\nPéndulo Studios' “The Next BIG Thing” presents itself as a classic point-and-click adventure. Connoisseurs of the “Runaway”-games will feel right at home. As before, the graphics are well done and nicely drawn. Some animations feel a bit chopped and not very smooth. Hints and hotspots are optional and can be turned off.\n\nThe developers kept their sense of special humour. The frame narrative takes place in a world in which monsters, robots with personality, and humans are living side by side. The introductory sequence shows the two playable characters (Liz and Dan), who are reporters for a newspaper called “The Quill”. Their boss sends them to the monster-movie producer FitzRandolph, who is a monster himself.\n\nAfter getting there, Dan is hardly thrilled by this assignment, as he prefers sports over movies. Liz on the other hand wants to prove herself as a professional reporter and takes the assignment very seriously. The first dialogues between the two are overly clear about the two not liking each other at all. Even their personality could not be farther apart. Here Dan, the eloquent man about town, who could care less about authority. There Liz, being particular about everything and suffering from various psychological traumata as well as personality disorders.\n\nThis marks the probably weakest point of the game, which continues until its end. Some of the characters are bizarre to the extend that an identification with them seems almost impossible. The thoughts and dialogues are rather causing raised eyebrows and disagreement than a smirk. Whereas Daedalic's “Edna Breaks Out” integrated and established the (at least alleged) psychiatric disorder well as an element of the game, it feels overdone and out of place here. Péndulo should have taken a more careful and cautious approach.\n\nDuring the course of the game, the player takes turns controlling Liz and Dan. The sections are pre-set and completely closed; there is no team-approach. The two meet the same characters. Those react, depending on whom they are talking to, differently; though comments or thoughts about the other main character remain sparse. It feels as if there were two parallel storylines. At least the voice actors are professionals and did a good job on sounding convincingly. At least in the English version of the game, characters often start or end sentences with "ayo", which becomes annoying rather quickly.\n\nThe story itself can be summed up rather quickly: FitzRandolph is preparing the mysterious “Next BIG Thing”. Soon it becomes obvious that this is more than a mere motion picture. Liz senses the potential for a front page story and gets drawn in too deep for her own good. Grudgingly, Dan starts out to rescue her. Needless to say, the true “Next BIG Thing” is being discovered in the end – and then the game is already over. At least the ending holds a heart-warming surprise.","May 13, 2014","false","10.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

They've all been corky humorous with likeable characters and excellent artwork. This game follows in the same vein, but have stepped up the wackiness and plot-line compared to the previous games. They might have taken it a slight bit too far in this one, but I still enjoyed it immensely. I found it to be a bit short, which is "dis....concerning", and a bit too easy.\n\nIt seems to me that this was planned to be a first of a new series, as the ending opens up for a sequel. And I find myself hoping that a sequel will eventually show up. But if it does, I also hope that they make it longer and tone down the wackiness just a little.\n\nIf you are into point & click adventure games close to the old school stuff this is a no-brainer. It is cheap and definitely worth your money and time. It should even be possible to get it dirt cheap during a sale.\n\nI can only rate it a 7 out of 10 because of its length (or lack thereof :oP).\n\nHappy gaming\n\nJ3ST3R","November 6, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The puzzles are easy and fun to do, yet there is one that will cause rage-quits in large numbers. Though its shortness hardly justifies the price, it’s a real deal even on a 50% sale: you get a fun and entertaining adventure for your money that won’t disappoint you later.\n\nLong version:\nThe Next Big Thing is one of Pendulo’s many point-and-click adventure titles with the studio’s trademark cell-shaded 3D characters and carefully constructed, astonishing hand-drawn backgrounds.\nThe game is set in another world, where the classic Hollywood movie monsters from the 1940s and 50s are real people who live among the humans. The story follows the adventure of two journalists– a cynical sports-maniac and an enthusiastic and downright loony investigative reporter– fresh on the trail of a new scoop that will eventually leave to kidnapping, brainwashing and of course lots of puzzle solving.\n\nThe style and the story is more cartoonish than horror-like, and this shown in the characters and the puzzles themselves. The latter ones aren’t especially devilish, but there is one that gave many people nightmares and caused many rage-quits and unfinished games. It’s a purely time- and rhythm-based puzzle which is hard to figure out, even harder to properly execute.\nApart from that the difficulty level may only come from pixel-hunting if you chose not to use the item highlight feature, as some of the objects you need to interact with can easily be missed.\n\nAlthough the story is quite good and well-paced, and even the dialogues are well-crafted, the fact that the game is actually a sequel to Pendulo’s 1997 title Hollywood Monsters, and sadly for some reason the developers thought that anyone who plays this game will know the prequel: we learn next to nothing about the world and how it works in the first half of the game, and only small bits are revealed later in optional side-conversations and item descriptions.\nAlso, the game is short, even for an indie adventure game: shorter than their previous three title on Steam (the Runaway trilogy), clocking in about 4-6 hours depending on how much you may get stuck (especially on the aforementioned tango puzzle). The story itself compensates for it, but still, for costing as much as other Pendulo games, the play time feels awfully short in this one.","August 4, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In all, I have probably played dozens (if not hundreds) of both text and graphical adventures over the years.\n\nThe fun in an adventure game comes primarily from the writing in the underlying story and the challenging nature of the puzzles.  Graphical adventures like this one can increase the fun by adding interesting visuals, good voice acting, and music.  The Next BIG Thing hits some of these notes, and either mangles or misses the rest.\n\nThe story in this game could easily be interpreted as racist.  Monsters are allowed to have jobs, earn money, buy homes, run businesses, have human friends, etc., but aren't allowed to hold public office.  The antagonist is trying to change that (albeit in a dishonest manner), and get his people equal rights.  Your characters stop his plan, and seem to feel no remorse for what they're doing.  The story could have been made more palatable with a simple line out of one of the good guys' mouths like "You know, we could have prevented all this if we had just given the monsters equal rights.  He had the right idea, but went about it the wrong way."  (There is even a reference at one point, admittedly within a dream-like sequence, where characters admit to enjoying staged fights between animals and get excited about receiving tickets to a fight.  Does cruelty to animals offend you?  It does me.)\n\nMany of the puzzles in the game make sense and are somewhere in the easy to challenging-but-fun level.  Some of them, however, are very convoluted and make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  If it hadn't been for online walkthroughs, I doubt I would have ever come up with the precise combination of objects to solve those puzzles.  I don't think I'd have ever gotten there even by randomly combining objects in the game.\n\nOne puzzle in particular was very irritating.  There was very little intellectual challenge to it... I'm referring to the Tango puzzle.  You're required to click four flowers, each representing a musical instrument.  When you click one, it starts playing that instrument's part of the tango.  You click the next at the right moment in the first instrument's melody.  If you miss this by more than a fraction of a second, the puzzle resets.  Despite consulting the walkthroughs, only through dumb luck was I able to get them all four clicked at the exact right times.  I hate puzzles like that, and get no enjoyment from them.  (I find the mazes they used to slap into old adventure games irritating for the same reason.)\n\nSome scenes in the game take your "suspension of disbelief" and stomp all over it.  At one point you're told a safe is too heavy to be carried.  Then the solution becomes hauling it around on a folding cart designed to carry cakes, cookies, and pies.  It's not too heavy for that?  The delicate contents of that safe can be tossed out of a flying zeppelin with a parachute attached and reach the ground safely?  And I can take an elevator to the surface, start a motorcycle, drive it into position, and be waiting when the safe finally hits the ground?  Really?\n\nThe dialog in the game has an annoying trait as well.  Characters, for no known reason, start conversations with the word "Ayo" as in "Ayo, Hello, Fred.  How are you today?"  They end conversations with "Aya" as in, "Well, have a good weekend, Ann.  Aya."  This is sort of amusing for the first five minutes of the game.  Do the developers think people really talk this way?\n\nAs for the humor, I don't recall a single "laugh out loud" moment.  I think I smiled at a few things.  Maybe my standards are too high.\n\nUltimately, this isn't a bad game.  It's just... OK.  I'd give it about a 6 out of 10. I've played many adventure games that were more fun (the LucasArts and Scott Adams games come to mind), but I've played quite a few that weren't.  The visuals are excellent.  The voice acting has its moments.  In the end, it's not a game I expect to ever play again.","April 15, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

I will rate it at 6/10\n\nIt was hard to go through a long sitting on this game when I was really tired because it requires a lot of imagination to get the things to work. Once you understands how this game works, you will work through the whole game with not much difficulties.\n\nI have to give credit to the game marker's wit and humour, it was really funny on some parts and a lot of unexpected twists. I bought the game at USD$2.99, so I am happy that I bought the game at this price. For $2.99, this game is a casual, humourous + witty game for an easy day, but not totally EASY :)","October 23, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So foundly I love some of the cartoon styles used in this game. The funny animation and use of character design, plot and verbal fun that can make these games so special.\n\nWell the Next Big this is just like the old style of games - the funny lines and speach are some of the best, this to me is just great.\n\nThe graphics and amination fit in well and nothing stands out of place.\n\nMusic, sounds and speech are top notch. But I did find a few things that just went bleep sound, I would of really liked to have some funny talking when things should not work, or even some more commical sounds.\n\nIt really has some nice puzzle hints, help system, also a double mouse click for fast travel and this is something I have not seen in other point and clickers. Help is so needed with some of the really odd puzzles and item combinations in a few I played.\n\nThe game feels a bit too short and the main characters could always come back, it just seems like one chapter in a life story. But until the next big thing... I think I will see what other point and clickers this studio has to offer.\n\nAnd being on Steam it offers cloud saves, steam play (but no Linux), but no trading cards.\n\n* One slight failure was the annoying random crashes, then you found that you forgot to save because your enjoying it so much - but once you work out how to solve the puzzles, then your quickly complete everything again anyway and remember this time to save.","March 15, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found out that I was not the only one with a such of a setback, but decided to start it again after a few months.\n\nThe storyline is somewhat stupid but it really doesn't affect that much in the level of entertainment of the game. Game is quite funny, and even though the puzzles aren't that difficult, it still gives out several hours of entertainment for a casual game that it is. Because of of the known random crash issues, I recommend you save your game from time to time. If you like point and click adventure games that are not fustratingly hard, this is a good one to try out. There is even spot indicator button, so when you get stuck, you can find out the spots you may have missed, and also a clever clue helper, that doesn't give you direct assistance but gives you something to think about you may have not though of or point you to a right room. Though all of this is something you barely need, because progressing the game is relatively easy when you use some common logic and try out stuff. It's a well built and entertaining piece of adventure game with a reasonable price tag.","January 27","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
