His seemingly tame life takes a turn for the worse after discovering a strange pendant that belongs to his favorite teacher, Ms. Song. Unbeknownst to him, dark forces are at play, and soon during mid-exam, Youngho faints.\n\nAs soon as he wakes up, he finds himself in a twisted alternate version of his school with grotesque figures of his classmates and teacher roaming around its halls. Puzzled by the sudden transformation of his school, he wanders around until he meets up with Yaesol, an aloof young woman with a penchant for secrets. She knows something but isn’t straightforward with Youngho. Yaesol advices him to keep a cool head and that he should begin retracing his steps. It is the only way he will escape “The Coma.” With nothing else to do, he follows her guidance and realizes the cause of all this is closer than he thinks.\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nAll Youngho can do is run and hide. If he brings attention to himself, all he must do is run around long enough until Psycho Ms. Song (The Coma’s demonic version of his teacher) stops chasing you. You can actually get her to chase you for an indefinite amount of time if you keep circling around the two exits of a classroom (it’s funny watching her go!) I found it easier to maneuver around the school when she’s right behind you because most of the time, she’s camping around the spot you need to go to (As long as you keep track of her whereabouts, you can let her chase you, otherwise, you might accidently bump into her.) It can be challenging at times, especially when Song doesn’t leave her spot. At this point, it’s just the waiting game. Listening for her footsteps and growling are her audio cues and wearing headphones will let you know which direction she is coming from. Her chasing segments become repetitive and can disrupt the tension of the game.\n\nThere is an inventory system and thankfully there is a separate slot for key items and consumables. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for you), Youngho has a limit to how much he can carry and I swear, I don’t know how many times I’ve picked up water (it recovers stamina), but it’s too many to count. I never needed to drink water because the stamina bar runs out very slowly and recovers as soon as you stop running. By the time Song stops her furious chase after Youngho, the stamina bar has already replenished.\n\nDebilitating conditions like bleeding and poison is present but I found myself unconcerned by them. Bandages and antidotes are found in the world enough that you may never need to buy them at the store (there is a vending machine to buy all your curative needs). Really, they don’t do much damage and in fact, I played the entire final round of the game poisoned and nothing really happened. The only times I become overwhelmed by my worry is when I run out of healing foods because they’re rare. Unless I just have terrible luck, I almost always bolt towards the cafeteria (the safe zone) and buy a hamburger or chips to keep Youngho all fattened up.\n\nThere is also manual saving, in the form of writing your name on a chalkboard. No auto-saving. NOPE!\n\n---\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of the game, on the scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), I rate The Coma a 4, “the game tries.”\n\nI have to admit, it is unsettling during the beginning when Song is first introduced but after numerous chase scenes of her aggressively swinging her knife at you, you become desensitized of her. It becomes tedious and this is my main gripe about the game. It’s easy enough to avoid her since she always loses interest in Youngho when he hides in a closet or bathroom stall.\n\nAlthough the enemy itself isn’t frightening, the sights and sounds immerses you into this dark, brooding world filled with hostile apparitions waiting to swat at you, hanging corpses waiting to crush you and soft moans and groans waiting to deceive you. I enjoyed the setting of the game and it is small reminder of games like “White Day.”\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nThe graphics of the game is pleasant. It has an anime-style look to it. There isn’t much in terms of graphic options (it’s on the Unity Engine, by the way) and the game seems to be locked at 50 fps. I don’t know why. I’ve just accepted it. I’ve seen it drop to 40 at times but the drops are hardly noticeable (I have a fps counter at all times). For perspective, my specs are specs are GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram…so on and so forth.\n\nI had several crashes. Additionally, I discovered some bugs like the screen turning black but I can still hear the in-game sounds and see the HUD. I had a glitch where Youngho would go to a room, exit and then when he tries to exit/enter other rooms, he teleports back to original room he came out of. For the most part, restarting the game solved these problems. I’m not saying it’s a glitchy game but these are the ones that would conveniently manifest from time to time when I haven’t saved in awhile. Oh, my poor. poor mouse. How abused you must have felt.\n\n---\n\nMy Observations\nI like the story. It is told through interactions with several characters and notes scattered in the world. It’s important to read the notes to understand the minds of the staff and students of Sehwa High School. It ties to the plot of the story. The characters are quirky, especially Youngho himself, with his smooth talking (/sarcasm) and his amusing side comments (/notsarcasm).\n\nIt’s a shame that running away and hiding from Song got tedious in the long run. I had to soldier through the game and at one point, I had to stop because it got very aggravating.\n\nI believe the game might have two endings (?). I will have to play it a second time. I think I left something undone, so you can miss certain events if you’re not careful. I will update as soon as I finish my second run.\n\nLastly, game time isn’t too long. I completed the game at around 6 hours and that’s only because most of the time, I’m hiding and avoiding that stupid hobag Song…yes…hobag! Go ahead Steam! Bleep me out!\n\n---\n\nWrap Up\nEven though I enjoyed the story, some of the game mechanics and bugs that were mentioned really hold me back from fully recommending it at full price. I like it enough to thumb it up but wait for a discount.\n\nThanks for reading!\n---\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n\n- Intriguing story and amusing characters\n- The anime style graphics are pretty to look at\n- Good atmosphere and sounds\n\nCons:\n\n- Enemy chasing segments becomes monotonous, destroying the atmosphere of the game\n- Bugs and crashes that seems to come at the wrong time for me\n\n---\n\nBy the way, if you have the time, watch me fool around in the world of The Coma.\n\nThe Coma: Cutting Class Video\n\nLastly, for more information about The Coma or other news and reviews of other horror games, check out  Scaredtoplay.com [www.scaredtoplay.com]","October 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 81 of 98 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","81","98","7","5"

Well, a good sign that it's a good game.  Perhaps also the "first sign of madness", as they say.  But we won't go there...\n\nSince an eccentric little foray into 2D, Silent Hill-inspired "survival horror" entitled Lone Survivor came out in 2012, a number of other indie devs have attempted to capture a similar charm.  While a couple have come reasonably close - last year's Claire comes to mind - The Coma may finally be a game which equals the inspiration of Jasper Byrne's little "neo-classic" (while also owing a tremendous amount to the "stealth horror" classic Clock Tower, as well as high school horror game Obscure and maybe, just maybe, the more recent DreadOut).  While The Coma does very little which could be considered terribly "new", what it does it does very well.\n\nIt looks great, sounds great, and plays just fine too.  It's scary enough - though it shouldn't stress any of you lightweights TOO much - and it also isn't that difficult really, until perhaps the very end, and might thereby be a rather good introduction to horror gaming for all of you thus far afraid to take the plunge.  It's a fantastic little game which manages to find a balance between "cute" and "creepy" without compromising either, and is perfectly good value given the moderate length and substantial entertainment which it provides.\n\nSure, I could make a few minor complaints.  The maps, for example, could take more cues from the likes of Silent Hill by showing you: a. where you've been, and b. where you can't enter (due to a barricade in a corridor, say, or something blocking a door "from the other side").  But on the whole, this still emerges as one of the more solid horror titles of recent years, and while that's not necessarily saying THAT much - it's been a quagmire of ♥♥♥♥ of late, let's face it - it'll still stand up pretty well in years to come, methinks, not least of all due to the frankly "ageless" art style it's chosen.\n\nNice job, Korea!  You're certainly putting the vast majority of Europe to shame at this particular point in time...keep up the good work!\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","December 13, 2015","true","6.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","2"

Despite this, things could've been worse. No one was trying to brutally murder me and freaky monsters were not hiding in shadows waiting to pounce. Now for our hero Youngho all of the above stands true. His only hope is hiding and gathering as much snacks from vending machines as possible. You will guide our young Korean hero as he seeks the answers to the dark and mysterious universe that is The Coma. Along the way, you will meet other strange inhabitants of this realm. Some who want to help you and others, not so much. What The Coma does well is mix narrative and horror survival in a unique fashion. The scenes and cinematic are presented in a visual style format and suddenly you're running for your life in a dark, well designed, high school. Inevitably you're going to die at some point and this can lead to some frustration if you do not take advantage of the many save spots the game presents you. Save often and save yourself the headache. Other minor gripes like scavenging for goods, can feel more like a chore then fun. More often leading to a quick death and having you repeat the process. Despite these gripes, The Coma is designed very well, it's an intriguing story and the universe seems rich with mystery and murder. The game feels very inspired from anime and the tone matches suit. Our hero bumbles his way through things and somehow just manages to survive. To sum, mechanically the game is very simple, but it makes up for this with atmosphere and drawing you into the universe. Just remember one thing as you play The Coma. SAVE OFTEN!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/fHfAIdDWwNk\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The detailing, the atmosphere, the sounds, all superb.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has the potential to enjoy horror. This game has the detailing(art), the music, the gameplay and the writing to back it all. Some might be like me and go in expecting a new "white day", but what you get is so much more. In saying that, I'll start with something more of a con-ish nature.\n\nThe atmosphere and the killer are both horrifying together, don't get me wrong. There were also things in the enviroment that constantly sent chills. But having more of a variety in scares or ghosts would have been great. We have one killer, a handful of NPCs and hidden ghosts that will damage you upon surprise.\n\nThis is one of few horror games I've encountered that are so open, and yet so rewarding for exploration. There are side quests, little interactions and notes everywhere with history on the world. It's all amazing. Every character has exceptional personality, and some even having potential for the future title.\n\nAnd by future title, A SEQUEL GOT ANNOUNCED OMG YAY <3\n\nCarrying on. There are a total of 5 endings now, one of which being the "True" ending, which opens up for the sequel. Here, I will be reviewing the canon ending. Speaking in spoiler-free conditions, the ending was great. It left many possibilites in the sequel, hinted who the next main character will be and left multiple characters with purpose for the future. We can expect great things. But right now? Get this game, it really is incredible.","December 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Because I want to make it clear this will NOT affect my review/feedback.\nHowever, I do want to give them 2 thumbs up because being in contact with them was nothing but friendly and easy.\n\nAnother important notice is that I do NOT normally play horror titles.\nThey're just not simply for me but this piqued my interest.\n\nNow lets get to it.\n\nStory :\nNot much I can say without spoiling anything but you play a young duder named Youngho.\nHe pulls an all-nighter to study (bad idea) before important tests.\nWithout saying to much, let us just keep it short but pretty much everything goes to hell.\n\nGame itself :\nIt's a 2D korean horror game, run away like a sissy and hide like a crybaby.\nPlain and simply, just book it!\n\nWhen it comes to story and gameplay it seems it has the intention to mess with your head, make you feel lost, confused and it does it well.\nEspecially for me with no sense of direction.\n\nYour best friend is a flashlight (ofcourse it doesnt talk...) when its turned off you're harder to spot and better at sneaking.\nBut that also means an easier time for the thing chasing you to sneak up on you just to give you a lil smooch.\n\n\nIt does give the feel of a visual novel during coversations, a very very bad (as in spooky) bedtime story if you want to punish\nyourself and not letting you sleep.\nI enjoyed that and I got to read ALOT out loud for viewers.\n\nThe run and hide mechanics reminds me very much of games such as Outlast and it clearly works.\nThe game is a big reminder of Corpse Party, with that said I have never played it myself but I know that I am not alone thinking this.\nWould be surprised if some influence didnt come from that game and no shame in it as it got quite popular.\nBut in saying that The Coma is a game in its own right.\n\nIt has the classic exploration where you can aaaalmost go anywhere you want and try to find some goodies whilst listening to heavy panting\nand feeling breathing down your neck.\n\nThe Art in the game is absolutely fantastic, it feels just how its supposed to. It clearly has that anime/asian visual novel look.\nIt never failed to deliver the atmosphere, you would feel the creepy areas. Female and Male characters looked really well the only character that I felt a bit off about was Yungho.\nYungho that just looked a bit off, he looked like a deer in the headlights throughout the whole game and it wasnt because of being scared.\nAlmost looked like constipation was his biggest worry (which is funny because I spent so much time in the bathrooms in game).\nOne of my viewers also pointed out that when out and moving about, Youngho seemed to be lacking a nose.\nBut in saying that all of this made Youngho stand out and even tho I find this model a bit less appealing its nothing I would bash the game overall for.\nIts just my personal preference.\n\nMusic and sound effects also  helped building the atmosphere.\nI like it as far as scary music and sound goes. It fitted really well and that is what is important here.\n\nEven though its a horror, I managed to play the game (and as said I don't do horror games normally)  without much issues.\nI'd say it gives you the horror of being chased, stressed and real sense of urgency to just get the hell out.\nYou just wanted to finish it to make it stop (In a good way).\nClearly as I played from start to finish in one sitting without a single break and it took 7 hours 30 minutes with chat interaction and reading everything.\nThere was no way I was not going to finish this game before sleep so it held my interest.\nEven though I was quite exhausted close to the end there was just NO WAY I was going to give up.\n\nFeedback :\nAs you can all see I truly enjoyed this game but it is in no means in a flawless state.\nDuring my stream people bombarded me with "this game is so buggy" "this game crashes".\nYes, there are bugs and at very few occasions my game bugged out so hardcore I had restart my game and/or load a save.\nNow I might have been pretty lucky but in my book especially coming from indie developers I really cannot complain to much.\nSo I feel that some people in my chat were a bit unfair.\n\nThe bugs I encountered were infact pretty minimal and hardly impacted my gameplay.\n\nWhen I had to restart my game there was a patch waiting for me with bug fixes to download so they are working on the game.\n\nNow my biggest "complaints" about this game.\nIs probably that even though you can run however you want there are a few objectives that makes you run in a kinda repetative pattern backwards and forwards.\nNow this could be because to cause confusion but at the same time it seemed like an attempt to make the game last longer.\n\nOne bug I encountered was when I used the stairs and I just felt through the ground and that was when I had to load a save.\n\nThe things chasing you seem to sometimes (on very few occasions) have a pathing issue where they are pretty stupid and get stuck behind blocks and just continuously\nrun straight into it. Atleast it gave me some time to look at said idiot monster and laugh at them.\nDon't know why this happened, maybe because the distance between me and the thing was to long if it had to run out doors and corridors to get to me.\nEven then I feel like the monster should give up after awhile.\n\nLater on in game there are alot of damage you will take. Pretty unfair damage from poison, bleed etc.\nThis is pretty much right at the end of the game.\nReason to why I call this unfair knowing that I can dodge them is that there are times when you just get through a door and as soon as you entered.\nBAAAM hit by poison. Its unavoidable unless you 100% learn which door to enter and not enter and if this is intended I feel like the difficulty curve is WAY to steep.\nI wish I could say exactly where this happens but I was kinda stressed with a psychotic thing chasing me.\nBut overall I feel like the poison/bleed locations may need to be looked at.\n\nAlso I noticed that one time I got hit twice by a falling corpse (I admit I was stupidly standing there reading a note). So same corpse hit me twice at the same time.\n\nAt the end the save points are pretty darn hard to spot.\n\nAt one point I went into the menu the game bugged out and I couldn't leave it (after the patch). When I tried to turn character in hopes of leaving the menu  with menu up it basically just flipped my screen.\nNow, it is fixable yourself by just clicking something in your bottom menu.\n\nOne bug where my character just stopped didnt want to move anymore. It happend right after going though a door.\n\nReal Talk :\nI am really thankful I got the chance to play this game. I truly enjoyed it and I would infact recommend it.\nSo big thanks and congrats to Devespresso Games, you guys have made a great game in my book and I wish you all the luck with patches/fixes.\nI've seen people saying "Wait until its on sale" and I do NOT think thats fair.  The game is only £6.99 and I think this game is worth that price.\nHowever ONLY if you like these kinda games. Actually heck, if it seems interesting to you why not, its only £6.99.\nGood value for your money especially now during Halloween times.\n\nFrom my experience with Devespresso Games so far they seem very active in their steam community and very willing to fix and listen to players.\n","October 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Audio cues also help a lot in determining whether the killer is nearby.\n\nThere are multiple endings but I couldn't be bothered to replay it again due to how tedious the game is.

The mechanics themselves, while fairly standard, work very well with the story presented and the objectives given to the player are never tedious thanks to how frequently the tone can change from creeping around scared to sprinting and screaming your head off.\n\nAll of that and the incredible symbolism woven into The Coma’s DNA make this a unique and solidly-built experience\n\nFor more info, check out my full video review! :D\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXFtVECPO-I","February 11","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Thought there would be more of the "demons" or possessed entity that could roam around the hallway which can give quite the challenge. There were some flaws during the mid-playthrough where the dialogues can be annoying. Such as, popping up and you got poisoned because it happened when you were right on that poison pods.\n\nMost of the gameplay was going on detours, here and there ( I guess that's common in games.) The first encounter of the "demons" were in fact, terrifying until to the point that it became annoying. There was also a time when the game got glitched that I couldn't proceed to the game as I got teleported to another floor instead of where I was supposed to be. The game's kinda short although the obstacles made it longer.\n\nOne thing that bothers me about the last part,\nSPOILER ALERT: Honestly I kinda hate the part where you had to go through that twisted portals through lockers and all just to go and get that twist ending. I think it would be better if the last bits of the game, as soon as he reached his classrooms, it was seemingly back to normal that he actually failed.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend it but the reason I gave into the positive review and want to recommend people to try out this game is because of the beautiful art into it and I believe this game still has potential to do better some more, maybe through an update? ;)\n\nI'd rate it 6.5/10.

Footsteps, music which kicks in when you're in danger, that bzzzz sound :D 5+\n\nBottom line is that this game absolutely "worth it" and a must buy in my opinion!

Pulling back from memories of Clock Tower on the SNES, and running for my dear life has never been more fun in a 2D style horror. The art style oozes of anime, but it does not at all deter from the scares. In fact, the visual novel style aspect, along with how much dialogue and interactions are available make me look forward to the next time I can speak to a character, or find a new hidden note.\n\nRight now, the only minor complaint I have is the frequency of being chased. Sometimes I just step outside a class room and have to hide only to find that I cannot proceed unless I wait awhile. I guess one can argue this adds to the suspense, but I felt it sometimes pulled me away. I love the background ambiance and sounds you can hear throughout the halls, and just the slight sound of footsteps was enough to make my hairs stand on end.\n\nIf you guys want a fun scary game to play this Halloween, I highly highly recommend this title!\n\nYou can also check out the video below I did of the first 20 minutes if you are not convinced or want to see how the game plays. I also added my own take on the character's voice acting just for fun!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uywOeMIUiL4","October 26, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My first time playing a Korean made game aside from mobile apps like anipang...A good visually appealing art style and ambience to go with it. The setting at a Korean high school is where this game takes  place. With my experience of having lived in South Korea for 3 years before, just playing this game brings back the nostalgia a bit. Though I have never gone to school there as a high school student, I had the priveledge to teach once as a guest for an elementary school, and so my expereince was mainly exploring and delving into the countries lifestyle and culture, as well as making awesome great new friends!\n\nThe game is developed from South Korea itself, and many of the developers don't work at Devespresso full-time yet, as this is their debut game. The horror elements work well enough for this style of game, and there's a lot of reading to be done as it is a visual novel styled game. There is a monster that will be chasing you around the school, which keeps the suspense up.\n\nHere's my playthrough of the game, this is not a critique video or review for the most part as it is a playthrough "Let's Play." If you like this art style type of game with some thrills then definitely buy this game. Checkout my first part to be sure, or checkout those who have given this game a review!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q7G9Qe5hBM\n","November 19, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But surprisgly their was a moment were the game spooked me to the point of me choking on my own saliva. It got so bad I had to stop playing and take a break; I tip my hat to you game.

I watched the playthrough of this game. Yes, I tried it about for about 40 minutes. No, my heart can't take it and after watching through videos I know I DEFINITELY can't handle the stress of being chased around by The Killer, especially since the key to avoiding it requires a good speaker (to avoid the footsteps). That is the WORST.\n\nThat being said, about 20 minutes to the game I have the feeling that this is just the beginning of a series, and seeing the ending I knew I was right. It's a good plan in my opinion, to have The Coma makes its debut and use the profit (if you have any left after production and paying salaries...) so you can put it in the sequel.\n\nI'd imagined that the protagonist and the female protagonist will get together and enter different Comas and save people or something, but what you have now isn't bad at all too, especially since it seems to offer the possibility of different characters playthroughs. Yan Hong (I don't know how to spell her name...) seems to play a central figure although her importance wasn't shown in this first game, and I expect to see her as the MC in the next one. Even characters like Miss Song and Mina seem like they'll play a role in the next game; maybe like playing each of them going through The Coma and work together to eventually... well, no spoilers.\n\nIt's a cool game. The atmosphere is just right, the sound effects are awesome (or maybe I just have super low tolerance against horror sound effects), and while the gameplay can be boring for gamers who are easily desentisized, The Coma is a quality debut of a game. I really look forward to the next one!... Even though I might not buy it since I literally gathered my courage to buy this, and couldn't even endure for an hours...","October 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Several people compared it to "lone survivor" but it had very little in common besides the 2D horror aspect. The game was colorful with a simple but solidly implemented story, and multiple endings which were pretty well implemented. The gameplay was smooth, although I stumbled onto a few very minor bugs. The depth of the game was somewhat lacking. The game was fun, but honestly, it's the kind of game you finish quickly and forget, rather than one I'd remember and recommend to friends.","November 22, 2015","false","7.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

Great look and decent gameplay elements, plus it seems like it's got a decent story. I need to play it more but there are a few gameplay bugs that break the game for me currently.\n\nThe devs seem pretty responsive with the release of the game yesterday so I feel like this will likely be fixed soon. My particular issue is that the use button is not responsive most of the time. Seems like this is something they'll probably find out from other gamers pretty quickly.\n\nI'm a bit bummed at no gamepad support considering this is a Unity game. It's something that is very easy to add (trust me, I work in Unity a lot). So I'm hoping that this will be fixed soon too!\n\nAll in all, provided these issues are fixed soon, I totally recommend this game! Well worth $10.","October 20, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/402630/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","FULL DISCLOSURE: I was given a press copy of this game by the developers, but it will not affect, and has no affected, the way in which I conduct my reviews.\n\nWhat is The Coma?The Coma: Cutting Class; a 2D horror from, South-Korean-based, Devespresso Games. Interesting name for a studio.\n\nWhile viewing screenshots for “The Coma”, as well as when I began playing the game, I was reminded of two other games. To a lesser extent, a game I haven’t played, but that I’ve heard a lot about, called Clock Tower which released on the SNES and, later, the original playstation. The only reason it popped into my head was because The Coma is 2D, and relies on “run and hide” mechanics where you are given no option to fight back, and, from what I understand, Clock Tower is the grandfather of the run and hide genre.\n\nThat’s a pretty loose connection, but the other game was Corpse Party. I’d be really surprised if Devspresso didn’t take inspiration from Corpse Party for this game. The atmosphere is *almost* carbon copied, and I don’t really mean that as an insult to the developers of the Coma, because Corpse Party is a great game. The Coma, like Corpse Party, is set in a school within a terrifying other dimension. And that’s about as far as the the similarities go.\n\nBut this review is for The Coma, not Corpse Party.\n\nPresentationFor the most part, I liked the way The Coma is presented. It’s got that Eastern-Asia style to it (or just anime-style). I will say, that it has carried over some negative anime tropes in the animation. A lot of of the female characters are ridiculously busty, and many of them are dressed pretty sexually. I mean, that’s not to say those design choices are objectively bad, but, to me, it came across as kind of juvenile and lazy in terms of writing. Though, it might not bother you that much, it bothers me a little, but Corpse Party was far worse in the fan-service department for sure, and I still love that game. Other than that, I think the design of the characters is good and varied, the monsters can be pretty freaky, and I particularly like the enviroment design -- it often remained fresh, for me, despite being exclusively set within a school. Plus the performance was perfect, which was really the icing on the cake; I always love it when a game runs buttery smooth.\n\nMechanicsAt the beginning of the game I think the mechanics worked well. It’s kind of an open-world, in that all areas that you access can be re-visited at any time. You even have side-quests which I’ll explain in a little bit. Basically the entire game consists of you wandering around this, pretty much, empty school. You just have to complete objectives, find items, etc. in order to progress. At the same time you are trying to avoid a monster that is stalking the hallways. This is fine when you’re in a relatively small area, and where navigation is pretty easy. I found that the way the monster runs at you in this game was genuinely scary, and I did feel anxious walking around the hallway as I tried to listen for footsteps and breathing to let me know it was near. For this reason, headphones are recommended for this game.\n\nBut this kind of fell apart the later the game went on. Part of the reason for this is the fact the monster doesn’t change all that much. It changed once about 2/3rds of the way through the game, but it’s pretty much the same enemy with a slight re-skin and buffed to do a bit more damage. However most of the reason for the decline in quality, was that as the environments got bigger, they also got more complicated and tedious to navigate. By the end of the game avoiding the monster was a complete chore, and it didn’t help that many of your objectives were structured in the same way: go to point A, go to point B, and then return to point A. There’s a direct negative correlation with my enjoyment and the length of time I played this game. It’s only about 4-6 hours, and I feel that was enough for me.\n\nStoryI think I could’ve looked past the mechanical shortcomings, but the story just wasn’t there. The plot felt really basic; it didn’t go anywhere compelling past “Trying to escape this nightmare”. The only character who received any kind of real development was the main character, and even then nothing really that interesting goes on with him. It just feels like the story is a straight shoot to the end and, most of the time, doesn’t diverge in any meaningful way.\n\nNow, I’m going to give this game the benefit of the doubt; I think the ending I got was not the “true” ending. Or, at least, I really hope it wasn’t. There’s side-quests in the game, and I did all of them bar, I think, one, so I didn’t get the “good” ending. Maybe do some research before you buy, and see if there are multiple endings, because if there isn’t the story is abhorrently bad. The ending I got was so awful that I can only assume it was a bad ending.\n\nOtherwise, there are some pretty funny little references in the writing, even if a lot of the jokes fell flat for me. If you’re a fan of typical anime-style humour, then you may very well enjoy the jokes. There’s a lot of jokes that are based on the main character’s attraction to different women in the game -- it’s that kind of humour.\n\nVerdictI have to say, that for $10 it’s a pretty ok experience. I think that’s a reasonable price for the, roughly, 4 - 6 hours you’ll get out of this game. Though, I think for the majority of people, it may be a “wait for a sale” situation. It’s not a terrible game, and there is certainly some value with the genuine creepiness, but it’s not really mind blowing either. If you’re dying to play it, it’s not a bad deal, but if you’re only “kinda” interested you should definitely wait.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review of this game, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9l6Y3Zus0","October 19, 2015","true","4.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","7","18","3","0"

The devs clearly put a lot of thought into how to organize their school to make it seem like a real place, and then how to turn it into shadowy ruins full of debris and spattered blood. Loads of text descriptions and interactions make up for the limitations of the graphics, and the more horrific elements are just detailed enough to have an impact. Scattered notes provide just enough information to make you want to search for more, even if that means venturing into dangerous territory. It's a shame that the process of making your way through the school isn't more enjoyable . . .\n\nPuzzles\nOpening up new areas and progressing the plot in The Coma tends to take the form of "go to this place and interact with this object," or else "go to one of these places, but we won't tell you which one, so search the entire school until it turns up." At best, this often feels padded, passing through the same areas with the same threats just to do one thing you couldn't do before. At worst, you'll circle around the school over and over, trying to find an unblocked path that isn't haunted by the killer. Which brings me to the worst part of it all . . .\n\nThe Box Cutter Mother****er\n\nAlien: Isolation succeeded in creating a terrifying enemy who stalks you throughout the game, because that game gave you all manner of tools with which to distract, avoid, and even fend off the creature. The Coma only lets you hide in a locker until she eventually goes away. The only way to change her patrol route is to deliberately bait her into following you in a circle, and if she's blocking the only available path, all you can do is wait and wait and wait and hope you can trust the audio cues when you stop hearing her. Perhaps this is an issue on my part, but I couldn't even consistently tell which direction her footsteps were coming from! I often felt like I had no power to actively progress the story until the game decided I'd wasted enough time and waved me onwards. It wasn't even scary anymore, just tedious.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI really wanted to like this game, but it felt like it had no respect for my time. I'm looking forward to seeing what the devs do next, and hoping they learn from their mistakes next time around.","January 5","false","4.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"
