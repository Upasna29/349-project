If I'm brutally honest, I loaded this up expecting to play a very amateur-ish game with little amusement value. I was entirely wrong.\n\nTrove is, in many way, Minecraft with more RPG/MMO features put into it. The graphics are blocky and hugely varied, creating a really colourful and vibrant world. The sounds also fit the game style very well. A lot of the enemy voices are really quite funny, and difficult to decipher.\n\nThe building is somewhat basic, though there are a huge amount of blocks to be unlocked, some rarer than others. I find the way your own plot of land works interesting: there are plots all over the map, more are found in some biomes than others, and you can claim any of them as your own, where your house pops up. Any changes you make to this house stick with it. Then, you can just claim another spot, the other one disappears and your house has moved! It's quite cool, really, and stops the whole real estate issue a lot of games have (ArchAge).\n\nThere are currently 11 classes that all play very differently and have unique pros/cons. The combat is like that of an action RPG, with all abilities from enemies being dodgeable, if you have the reaction speed! The enemy AI is nothing particularly special, they essentially just run at you, but their attack patterns and visuals are different enough to keep you on your toes.\n\nI feel Trove is a bit all over the place with how in depth it wants to be with it's RPG elements. There are lots of stats on your equipment (including magic find, I like!), but very few equipment slots compared to other MMOs. The classes all have really different gameplay, rare for an MMO, but each class only has a basic attack and 3 abilities. It's a little odd, if I'm honest, as though the developers were told to reign it in. I can understand that, but I do wish there was more diversity in choosing your abilities, as it can grow a little stale.\n\nAt first, I thought this was a good first MMO, and I think I will get my 7 year old sister into this, I think she'll enjoy it; however, after level 10, some of the enemies are actually pretty damn difficult. Pre-10 the game is very easy and offers little in the way of challenge, but it soon ramps up. Younger people may actually struggle with this game, but I think a lot of them would enjoy the building aspect, as well as the combat side.\n\nTo sum up: this is a great little MMO with loads of interesting features and fun gameplay. It'd be great for a first time MMO and for children, but offers challenge after the intro (first 10 levels) to keep anyone interested. With friends, it's very enjoyable seeing who can make the funniest looking character. It can get a little grindy after a while, but I would still recommend giving it a go and deciding for yourself.\n\nEdit: I feel I should mention there are long queues. MMOs never keep up very well during the first few days of release, and this is no exception. Expect to be waiting in queues to play for a few days, unfortunately. Hopefully the servers will quieten down a bit in the next few days, or the developers will upgrade the servers to handle the load.\n\nAs of 13/07/2015, the queues are still quite long, they are apparently working on them all the time. Quite frustrating, unfortunately.","July 10, 2015","true","95.0"," 627 of 693 people (90%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","90","627","693","51","23"

Trion is now putting spyware in their launcher. There are no words.\n\nOriginal text below:\n\nThe dev team has got to be one of the most pants-embedded-in-skull backwards i've ever seen in terms of relating to their player base. If you're not one of the VIP-lister big names, you might as well not exist. If you are one of them, prepare to have the game rebalanced around your experience and given lavish rewards constantly just for being teacher's pet. I'm not exaggerating on this one - they recently as of the time of writing (05/01/2016) introduced Contests, where whoever has the most score in X category gets some pretty good prizes at the end of the week. Sounds fun? Well too bad this dev team are like fun mosquitos, because they managed to royally heck it up - mastery is a static statistic that can only possibly go up and catalogues how much stuff you've collected in the game. So those who already have everything get even more stuff, and those who are starting out get the finger.\nOn that statement, i'm once again not exaggerating - one of the first weekly contests was akin to "how many dungeons can you clear". This resulted in hordes of high-end players descending upon the lowest level worlds like a plague of jackass locusts and cleared all the dungeons in a crazed gluttonous frenzy that'd make the zerg themselves soil their carapace. Why is this bad? Because the new players couldn't get any levelling up done because all the dungeons had been one-shot by the high end turd brigade.\n\nNow I know, you could put this one more on the community than the devs themselves. However, I don't believe for one second nobody internally didn't forsee this happening. Are you seriously going to tell me that a dev team which as far as i've seen consists of at least seven people (most likely quite a few more) didn't confer among themselves and think "Hey, we should probably put some kind of limit on this!"? What are they paying these nimrods in, pocket lint?\n\nYou may be noticing a trend here - that new players get the shaft a lot, and that I use the phrase "i'm not exaggerating" a lot. I'm having to throw in these disclaimers because as I type this myself there's still some itching, tickling feeling somewhere buried deep in my brain that tells me "Come on, no one can possibly develop something this stupid.". Oh they can. They can. Did I recall the nerfs to a whole bunch of stuff which has made the game harder than ever for new players to get into, at the profit of the highest-end dev suckup players? Let's list a few!\n\n- Classes, formerly available for an ingame currency you get a small daily stipend of, are now pay-only. You can get five or so for free by jumping through some various hoops, but once you've done that you have to open your wallet and bend over, or leave. This wouldn't be so bad if some classes weren't outright gimped, so it's entirely possible for a new player to make five crappy picks and then just be stuck.\n\n- Dragons, a form of personal progression that grant account-wide power, have been made harder and harder to get. Dragon coins, the ingame currency you need to unlock them, have been made untradeable so you've got to accumulate 300 per dragon all by your lonesome. How do you get them? Hourly challenges, where you've got 20 minutes to clear X amount of dungeons in a specific area... which you get bonuses for if you're in a high level world, and if you're using one of two classes randomly picked from all the currently existing classes. See how that's a problem when you're low level and don't have many classes unlocked? Well unlock all classes, and you ca- oh. Oh dear.\n\n- Content expansions. The new expansion Mantle of Power just came out as of the time of writing, and jesu cristo crocodrillo. I'll get to the myriad of inherent problems with that in a moment. How does it affect new players? It affects them negatively because a bunch of options have been "re-balanced" (read: nerfed into oblivion) around the new high-end content. The knock on effects of this on new players seem to have been totally ignored - the players who already have few options other than "grind more" and "git gud". Double damage emblems which grant you a buff that actually makes you able to kill stuff in a reasonable timeframe got nerfed twice - first the ingame currency cost was raised, and then it got reduced to lasting something like 3 seconds, down from around 7 or 8. Why? Well, because **** YOU, THAT'S WHY. BUY MORE OF OUR STUFF.\n\nThat's just three pointers. I could go on all day, which you're probably feeling like I have already at this point, though in all honesty spending an equal amount of time reading this or playing Trove seems like you'd feel more accomplished after reading this.\n\nNow as I said, the new expansion really shows off how creative the dev teams are. A lot of end game players were complaining that all they really had to do once they got there was grind grind grind. Don't worry, Avarem and his team have you covered! With the new themed elemental worlds to explore, you can do the following:\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT ON THE SEA!\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN LAVA!\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN THE SKY!\n- Fight a zerg rush of boss monsters for a randomized prize that you can only get out of a chest if you brought a key that you can only get randomly from a box that randomly drops, the prize being a gem that you need to level up BUT there's a random chance of failing to level up and smashing the gem into a million bits but don't worry there's an item in our cash shop that can repair the gem and then you can break it again because you had the audacity to try and make progress but don't worry, BEND OVER PEASANT, IT'S WALLET TIME.\n\nThen, there's gems. Ohhhhh boy. Okay. This one's going to take a bit of explaining for the layman's benefit, but at this point you've already read the 500 meters, why not go for the reading marathon? Reading is good for you!\nSo pre-release in Trove the gear system was.. not great. Gear could only be improved so far, so it was possible to get a "bad drop" which would have terrible stats you don't want and you'd be stuck with it unless you want to go find some other thing. If it was a high level drop with bad stats? Too bad for you, grind more. This was rather unpopular and was eventually replaced with the current system where any piece of gear can be forged all the way up from the lowest to the highest quality and you could re-roll the random stats. Get a cool-looking sword with bad stats on it? No problem, just get some crafting materials to muck with it a bit until you've got the stats you want on it and you're good.\n\nNow gems, the new "power yourself up" thing comes out... and they run off the old gear system they scrapped that nobody liked.\nWhat.\nNot only that, but you can't see all the stats on them from the get-go. You have to upgrade them at a not-at-all cheap cost (which can fail and smash the gem as previously stated), at which point you can despair at your wizard being equipped with a physical damage gem ALL ALONG, that you need to pay to remove from the slot.\nDoublewhat.\nI despair to think anyone in the dev team thought they were being clever with this. Folks didn't like it once, they ain't gonna like it a second time with a bit of window dressing on it, genius!\n\nWow, i've actually hit the character limit on reviews. Weird.\nClosing word: I looked up the lead dev's development history. He has worked exclusively on flops, and it shows here. This game had potential, but not with this jerkoff leading the show. Burn the fields, salt the earth, start over - there's not going to be any good gaming to be found here until Trion does that.","May 1","false","464.5"," 568 of 648 people (88%) found this review helpful 133 people found this review funny","88","568","648","133","64"

It just closes my game whenever I try to play it.\n\nAlso, a little side note: Glyph has spyware. They keep renaming it though, claiming they have removed it.

Well, I can make that better for you BECAUSE:\nUS, TRION REVOLVE OUR UPDATES AROUND TWITCH STREAMERS AND YOUTUBERS THAT MAKE TROVE LOOK GOOD!\nBut seriously, you might as well be a pile of rubbish noodles because trion cant give a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nHowever, paying money to get the platinum crown will make trion respect you a little more, knowing they can exploit you. No seriously, they revolve around exploiting money.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Seriously, save yourself some time by not playing this game. They are just getting worse and worse, like ROBLOX. It makes me so sad to see a game with 20/10 potental be ruined by horrible devs.\n\nDevs: These guys are two faced ♥♥♥♥ers. They will smash you to bits if you talk ♥♥♥♥ about their game, but my account got deleted because of this.\n\nALSO: You arent following your own terms, trion. You say you'll recover lost money but GM _____ says that there isnt enough evidence, although the gm checks and I have nothing left, and it says that I wasnt on for like 3 months.

It was a simply fun game that evolved into another good game being destroyed by Trion.\n\nWhy destroyed you ask?TrionWorlds likes to put paywalls in their games (@ArcheAge.) Trion recently pushed update not long ago. (1 week) Which brought to us Power Rank and Paid Classes (Previously these could be earned for free by collecting enough cubits, now you can only pay with credits which require to buy $19,99 pack in order to get 2 classes and so on...) I don't mind Power Rank but, seriously Trion? Paid classes? That's like stealing kid's candy!\n\nWhy it isn't right?Playing Trove was more valuable than now. Power Rank has completely nerfed some Great characters (@Revenant)  They also managed to nerf Revenant to that state that it's Useless class now. (Previously it was so good that you could easily solo U6 before) Classes aren't just nothing. They can be strong, they can easily defeat each biome if upgraded correctly. They also give mastery if you level them up. Making them priced was Trion's big Fail in whole Trove history. Like i said, i can resist Power Rank, i can resist any bad updates, but >NOT< TrionWorlds P2W concept!\n\nI'm now only starting up Trove to get my daily chaos chest and nothing more. This update broke my relationship with Trove and Trion itself. :(\n\nI will change this review if i'm not going to expect another paidwalls in next updates (3 months)\nFor now i'm staying negative. That's your fault Trion. You destroy fun. You lose fanbase... and what? You still don't care!\n\nEDIT #1: TrionWorlds created another P2W update for Trove. This time players will get -500 Cubits (500 Cubits) and Patron will get +50% (1k Cubits) for filling star bar. This game is becoming trash.\n\nEDIT #2: And i got perma banned off Trove discussion. Nice!\n\nEDIT #3: Power of Mantle Head Start shouldn't exist. They should wait and then release it f2p, not just to push it on and make scrubs brag about it. Prices: Simple 14,99 Euro. Fanatic: 37,50 Euro. Maniac 74,99 Euro and they even overpriced it as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEDIT #4: Atleast they buffed up Shadow Hunter. Which is kinda good 'cause nobody uses that class anyway\n\nEDIT #5: Lucky Clovers for 25 Credits. Other stuff for 50 Credits. Welcome to Power Of Money™\n\nEDIT #6: Free HUD update and navigation enchancment(Do i spell it like dat?). Prepare for car update /jk\n\nEDIT #7: Reduced Shadow Item Drop. RIP SL4 ring price. (Applies to Shadow Tower) Watchout for another P2W update!\n\n(Thanks for reading and if you don't agree with me that's fine, everyone has their own opinions on such things)","February 13","false","233.6"," 147 of 166 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","147","166","8","7"

But look at this from a beginner's perspective. They'll have to either pay real money, or grind their arses off to get the mastery ones. The main way I got mastery was from leveling up all the classes. They, however, can no longer do this.\n\nAnother way they screwed us over on this patch is Power Level.\nYou may think "This is great! I know who's undergeared now!" But really, it means nothing.  I can put all my shadow level 4 gear with max pearls for my gunslinger onto my revenant. That would make it a high attackspeed magic damage class, but Revenant is for health and physical damage.  I could also put on my emblem that only gives attack speed and forces you to auto attack. This "Power Level" is absolute garbage.\nWhat they could of done though? Inspect.  That would pretty much let you know IF the person was geared enough to be invited, but no. Now we have to deal with "Power Level" and guessing if they have the right type of gear on.\n\nIf they remove this patch, I will change my review to a positive one, but I doubt they ever will.","February 9","false","104.4"," 224 of 276 people (81%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","81","224","276","22","20"

The rotations are fairly easy to figure out, and so is the crafting and the forging.\nThe weapons, faces and hats are VERY customizable without the trouble of a complicated transmogrifier system.\nAlmost entirely free to play. There is some stuff that you can pay actual money to get quicker, but for the most part, spending actual money is entirely optional.\nSharing system that makes gaining materials pretty easy.\nVERY wide range of classes to choose from, and you can switch between them anytime you want (assuming you buy them with Cubits, anyway).\nCons:\nIf you aren't lucky enough to make it to the end of a dungeon on time, when someone else defeats the boss and opens the chest, your hard-earned loot will despawn.\nSalt. Salt. Salt. So much salt in the community, though most of it is in the Trading chat.\nLONG QUEUE TIMES. RIDICULOUSLY LONG QUEUE TIMES. I get that Trion didn't anticipate how popular their game would be when it launched on Steam, but PLEASE fix this.\nThe gameplay is pretty repetitive, since most of it involves going to dungeons to get your currency and loot. The closest to a quest system available are Challenges, which can only be done once you've hit Mastery Rank 30, and they only happen once every 20 minutes or so. Plus, all you get out of them is flux (one of the main currencies in the game) and Boxes.\nIt's a bit boring if you play alone. Having a group of friends makes everything a lot more fun.\nThese are the only things that come to mind, but I'm sure there's a lot more.\n\nIn conclusion, I DO recommend this game, because it's pretty fun and time consuming. I'd give it about a 7.5/10, but if Trion fixes it's servers then I'd give it a higher rating.","July 14, 2015","true","108.8"," 110 of 138 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","110","138","9","2"

Meaningful content defined as adventure world updates (combat, quests and dungeons), crafting, and building.\n\n[MONEY]\nI also fear that any game that you can spend hundreds ($300+ personally) on isn't enough to get everything. While somehow the devs claim that there isn't any incentive to develop and update a system unless a price tag is directly on that feature.\n\nBut Trove does have incentive to update content and classes. That's what everything else in the cash shop was for. The devs clearly don't understand that though.\n\n[CLASS COST CHANGE]\nClasses didn't need to be pay for only. There was plenty in the store and $20 packs people were buying including myself to keep the game going strong. And those packs are filled with items players made giving devs the free time to make content. The devs didn't even hold up their end.\n\n[FORCED GAME PLAY]\nAnother problem is that Mantle of Power essentially divides the community. Not because of power or even RNG, but because of Shadow Tower itself. We thought Shadow Tower was going to do that before until the community found out how to avoid it entirely since it had nothing to do with the adventure world. But MoP was designed to force it to be an integral part of the game to advance. Its promises of adding more abilities and content is just a cosmetic paint job for both with no real substance.\n\nWe waited a year for the same worlds only with gaps in between dungeons and a gear RNG that makes no sense but to put lucky/rich players in a different league from everyone else.\n\n[SAYING ONE THING, DOING THE OPPOSITE]\nThis leads to the biggest problems which is the devs' two-faced policy. That may be a cruel thing to say but it is an honest criticism that the devs must face. "We don't want too much RNG into the game." Gems. "We want to feel like players are progressing." Nerf then add new stuff to farm to regain that lost power. Actions entirely money driven. Ever since the game went live the team has done an about-face to meaningful content production.\n\nIt has stopped growing and instead added money dependent systems without doing anything substantial as thanks. Remember the content added thanks to dragon caches in the shop? What about making classes credit only? MoP is a result of that, asking you to spend more money not for cosmetics but for numbers that mean nothing.\n\nThey didn't lose money because of these decisions, but because of the lack of decisions to advance adventure world and building content. The things this game was founded on.\n\n[LEFTOVER POPULATION DEPENDENCY]\nYou are losing players from such greedy decisions in every system you add to Trove. To think where we would be if the number of players that Live and Steam added to the game stayed. This would have come to be if the dev team kept their Alpha and Beta momentum and kept advancing the content rather than pack in cash grab only systems. You would have had a large enough population to keep your pockets full while providing more content that is fun to play and not grind intensive. Including new classes and more abilities to former ones.\n\n[RETURN TO A FORM OF RESPECT]\nDespite that gap that dropped your population to a petty fraction, you still have a chance to return to the team that your were in Beta. You have enough money systems to make this game last a lifetime, so cut out the gem RNG and stick back to making money on the $20 packs and cosmetics (that players are making for you) and focus on actual content from here on out. Content development that people were brought into the game for in the first place.\n\n\n[[TL ; DR]]\nThink about how big Trove was in its first Live month and why. Its because of everything up to that point and none of anything that followed. Make your players happy as a priority, because that was how you were making your money.\nAnd kill extreme RNG.","April 23","false","755.8"," 73 of 91 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","73","91","7","1"

To give some context, I remember when the game had 2 classes, the Knight and the Gunslinger, and that was it. Now, onto the review.\n\nLet's get to the things I don't like about the game\n\nCons:\nOMG QUEUES finally fixed :)\nGrindy as hell at max level\nSomewhat pay to win, depending upon your definition of "pay to win". All power is obtainable without paying, but it's a lot faster if you pay, or are a patron. Note, this only really affects max level gearing, and has zero effect while leveling.\nCertain class bugs, like the Knight attack speed bug have been around for months, and still haven't been fixed yet.\nPros:\nPlenty of classes to play as\nPlenty of things to do, even without getting into combat, like Fishing or Gardening, or just sailing around on a boat\nThe in game currency, cubits, are fairly easy to obtain, making it pretty easy to buy new classes without paying real money\nBecause most item skins are made by the playerbase, there's a metric ton of weapon skins, hats, and faces in the game. Seriously, it's downright mind boggling how much the playerbase has generated at no cost to the developers.\nWithout paying, you can make or join Club Worlds, which are basically Minecraft-esque zones where the player can build (solo or with friends) whatever they want in their own instance, be it farming space (like, to grow crops), a football stadium to play with friends, or a giant roller coaster, only limited by your imagination.\nCornerstones are great, in that the player can have a portable house that they can throw anywhere out in the hostile adventure zones, as a "home away from home".\nIn my opinion, Trove has some drawbacks, but is an overall enjoyable game that I would recommend to anybody that wants to try something new, and enjoys both Minecraft and the Diablo series.","July 26, 2015","true","369.9"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","60","72","6","1"

I simply cannot recommend it in it's current state.\n\nThe game itself isn't BAD. It's adventerous, keeps you occupied for quite a while if you have some free time, and so forth. The develpoers, Trion, release WEEKLY updates, which has been keeping me interested every Tuesday morning. The developers are nice, the Livestream Giveaways are fun, and I love seeing new content go into the game.\n\nThe only DOWNSIDES I find within this game are:\n\n- The trailers show "you" with a bunch of cool dragons, hanging out with your "friends". This doesn't happen in Trove, Sadly.\n\n- The community is made up MOSTLY of underage children who solely believe that they're right and everyone else is wrong. Let alone the fact you say ANYTHING in Global chat, someone's bound to get salty.\n\n- Speaking of "Global Chat", you ask a question within this chat, and you have a 99% chance nobody is going to answer. But, if you're that lucky 1% that actually DOES get an answer... it'll be off-topic, wrong, or not in the language you understand.\n\n- So, lets say you get some super cool glittery gold-plated dragon that shoots gleaming, shiny, golden fireballs. Awesome, right? You'd think. You'd believe that folks would gawk and gaze upon such awesomeness and send you three million invites to be your friend. Sorry, that doesn't happen here. Most the folks within this game are too ignorant or careless to even recognise your super awesome amazing golden musical dragon. Not really worth the grind if nobody cares, right?\n\n- On the topic of "Cool Stuff"... the microtransactions within the game are EXPENSIVE. $20 - $30 for any of the decent packs, and upwards of $50 to $100 for the higher end packs... neither of which last for very long. Most of these packs contain a chest, or a "chance" at getting something awesome, instead of actually, physically getting something awesome from the pack itself. Bit of a bummer if you ask me, especially at those prices! PLUS, as I mentioned before... whats the point of trying to get something awesome if nobody cares about it?\n\nIn TL;DR terms:\n\n- Pricey game for not much fame or gain. Lots of work, time, and money for not much.\n\n- Community is very unstable and unreliable\n\n- EXPENSIVE. The Microtransaction packs are a gamble. Odds of actually getting something are very, very slim.\n\nAny questions you have, I will gladly answer.\n\nUpdate: 3/31/2016,\n\nJust played this game after not playing it for a good long time. The "Heart Attack" update on 2/9/2016... oh my god.\n\nPlayerbase tanked hard, barely 5,000 players playing daily. Everything costs money now? What the?! So it's just a money grab now? Whats the point of playing? If I wanted to spend my money on something that "looks nice" (Being, most of Trove's content being purely cosmetic), Ill use it for, like... a car or something.\n\nBeing someone who had faith in the game early on, $500 hard earned dollars spent, and over 400 hours spent. Rest in Peace. :(","December 8, 2015","false","437.2"," 118 of 164 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","118","164","7","31"

Battle packs with exclusive mounts. Collectors pack, ♥♥♥♥ u trion it actually used to be hard to get styles, might as well include a tome and hat to taunt the completionists. Collecters pack, want to build faster, well pay us 2 bucks ♥♥♥♥♥, the only reason to get the pack is for the mount, but noo u had to raise the price to 20 by adding shapestone and primal blocks\n2)  Shadow Towers\nSo hyped up and so lame, its just shadow arenas, but now its "hardcore" no noobs allowed. Shadow towers are pretty much not hard, you just gotta find a good team, and even if u do its still long and boring since most of the bosses dont do any damage to most classes. Most shadow towers are just filed with toxic elitests.\n3) Battle Arena\nNo go ♥♥♥♥ urself, are u ♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me 60 hours and 4 weeks of ♥♥♥♥in battles just to get a one ♥♥♥♥in mount, oh but u can buy the patron and battle arena pack for more rewards, yeah ♥♥♥♥ u trion\n4) Dragons\nRemember when dragons used to be hard to get, lol. They made dragons accessible for all noobs, i mean come on i remember when i was so exicted to get adult azulian, now ugh. You used to meet people via challenges and it was so fun trolling them and leeching.\n5) Noob Friendlyness\nI remember when i saw people with wings and i was like one day ill be like them, now wings are nothing since u get em at mastery 5, and challenges are now at 10 ugh. Oh and remember those super rare radiant weapons, yeah ♥♥♥♥ that now everyone has them even mastery 10s, and of course the shadow towers are once per week, meaning u can just grind em so everyone is on a equal playing field. Also they returned the bloody adventure box mounts for a week so dumb, it used to be rare for someone to have a cookiephant.\n6) Market\nMaybe this is just me but during the times of trade chats u had something to do, now u just put something in and log off. Remember when someone put a stupid deal and everyone laughed at them. Well no more maybe some people will disagree but now theres nothing to do. Also it made mastery a ♥♥♥♥in joke, there are people who are brand new with only 300 hours who are mastery 324, and iam in 1000+ and iam 310.....\n7) Mounts\nIt seems that all mounts are just from chaos chests so ♥♥♥♥♥ boring come on trion do something new fresh, instead of just buying em from the market\n8) Chaos Factor\n1000 dollars spent and u get a chaos coin, is the worst, there are people who abuse this and now have like 60 chaos factor.\n9) The Community\nRemember when u did sky releams and SAs together with ur club, no more, since STs are way to hardcore for random people, and sky releams have basically no rewards. I mean i guess u can grind radiant shards but mosto f my clubs are dead anyways.\n10) shadow invaders\nSO ♥♥♥♥in dumb, u just wait in a box for invaders to come, and hope u get some of the rewards, if challenges were still long it would be ok but no more.","December 26, 2015","false","037.8"," 72 of 94 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","72","94","8","21"

I used to play with with a bunch of friends when this game used to be "okay". It's not what it used to be.\n\nAnd by okay I mean there's the nice minecraft style, you have an area to build a house and your club. You could level up to 20 and upgrade your gears. Collect these cute pets and mounts for higher mastery. But before, the game was so laggy and had a huge queue, if you're lucky you'd get in in 30 minutes. This happened for quite awhile when it came on steam.\n\nNow that I came back from a break, they made it even worse for new players. Rich players are getting richer. They removed one important item to upgrade your gears from vendor, only way of obtaining is if you get lucky as a drop or pay money. All the rich players bought a bunch of them, selling them for 5 times the price and it just gets higher from there. Classes aren't purchasable with Cubits anymore, meaning you have to pay real money to get a new class. You could trade in-game currency with other players for these items, but they are so expensive for a new player.\n\nThe lag, it's ridiculous. You rubberband so much you'd want to quit. The worse thing is they NEVER fixed it. It's always been there. It makes it so much harder to farm anything because you think you reached that cliff when you jumped on it, but you didn't. I don't even need to say anything about the PvP.\n\nTL:DR;\n\nPros:\n- You can be creative and build anything you want like Minecraft.\n- PvP (Capture the Flag)\n- Collectables (Mounts, Pets, Costumes, and more) You get stronger by collecting.\n- Shadow Tower\n- Upgrade System\n\nCons:\n- Company cares about money > players\n- Constant lag\n- Rich players will get richer\n- HUGE GRIND for anything\n- A lot of Downtime\n- PACK$ PACK$ PACK$\n\nI'll admit, the game was fun while it lasted.

YOU KNOW how that story ends. So early on I was looking for a replacement and bought into Trove in the very early pre-alpha stage of dev. The game was cool but it was bare bones and didn't fill the void that Cube World left. Fast forward about a year or more and the devs have pushed the game into a great direction.\n\nPros:\n- plenty of interesting classes to play and easy to unlock\n- plenty of biomes and bosses and dungeons etc\n- has a great "arcade" feel to the game. Via sounds and gameplay\n- lots of customization, beit gear, housing, building in general, mounts\n- very populated server and easy to play with your friends\n- if you enjoy very colorful, vibrant voxel graphics this game is it\n- overall just a fun place to explore and dig and build in\n\nCons:\n- although the f2p model is not terrible it is there and has it limits and effects other parts of the game\n- grind heavy. You will need 100 of x material to craft x and after playing for days/weeks you look down and have 18 of that material. So be prepared to grind for cool stuff like mounts and wings unless you buy from the limited shop selection\n- The game can be too goofy at times. Riding in a lazy boy chair with a disco afro on et. is a little too silly for me. I prefered the Zelda style that Cube World had. Personal preference though.\n- nothing to explore underground. mining is fun but you will find nothing below the surface if you keep digging.\n- some sort of auction house would be nice.\n\nThe game is good. Well worth a test drive. As far as the current voxel market goes, this is #1 for me right now. Never a game that will be my primary but I will always check in here and there and level my candy barbarian.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qHrcbWinCSY","July 9, 2015","true","3.1"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","45","56","5","6"

Yes, there is strong community aspect & some user created content can be awe inspiring. Yes, there are certain really nice game mechanics, like for example your cornerstone - a house of your own that you build & that you can place & relocate everywhere you want with a single button press. Also the music can be dreamy (Neon City <3).\n\nBasically it's good to goof around for a bit, log in daily for a short while and log off. But as far as progression goes it requires a lot of time and repetition. Whether it's crafting, building, unlocking new classes or raising your mastery level - it all takes insane amounts of mats/currency & grind.\n\nSure the maps and dungeons are randomly generated. Sure, the dungeon design is quite fresh and can be very imaginative (or confusing ;). Sure, there are plenty of funny classes to choose from. But most dungeons are short (find boss, kill boss, take loot, get out) and sooner rather than later you learn all the design patterns and the novelty that came with it wears off (especially when you need to farm bajilion of them). Classes are very basic: main attacks - left click & right click, and 2 additional skills only. And they also take long to unlock, so if you happen to pick one that doesn't suit you, you'll struggle on your way to unlocking the next. And even if you pick a fun one, after a while you'll get bored with it, because there is only one way to play a certain class, and you'll be repeating the same combat pattern over and over.\n\nCrafting is done via stations. Each station contains a list of items/things/portals/mounts/stuff you can make. To be able to craft other things, you need to craft other stations. You end up with  several of them placed in your cornerstone and have to remember which allows you to make what (or go through them & all the lists top to bottom, every single time you're trying to make a specific item). Not the most elegant of solutions. Anyway, for some things you'll need hundreds (if not thousands) of materials, that you can obtain by harvesting in the world (right click in build mode, that you can switch to anytime) or by killing stuff, completing dungeons and disassembling loot in via the loot collector. Also some crafting branches you have to level up by making hundreds of items, before you're allowed to make anything decent.\n\nBuilding requires a lot of blocks as well (especially larger guild projects), but actually the building part is the least obnoxious aspect of Trove and doesn't take any extra effort than say Minecraft.\n\nBecause of all the things mentioned above you'll find yourself either running around & right clicking (=collecting) materials from the game world for prolonged periods of time or doing those fast dungeons ad infinitum. Once in a while you'll place your cornerstone in order to maybe craft or build something, just to be reminded of how much stuff you still need to obtain.\n\nLike I said, Trove is good to log in once in a while, play around & log out (especially if you don't care about achieving anything specific). It's a pretty neat time waster if you have no games to play or just don't feel like doing anything else. Unfortunately I have a whole backlog of games I'd rather be playing over this and I'm not blessed with overabundance of time to kill, so I won't be playing Trove anymore.","November 12, 2015","false","14.5"," 75 of 106 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","75","106","2","2"

I am mastery level 110 and greatly enjoyed the game with multiple of my friends.\n\nWith the June update however we all stopped since Trion has ruined the endgame and does not seem to go back on their mistake.\n\nWhat happened that ruined the game?   Challenges got added,  once you are mastery level 30+ you *can*  do challenges. However before challenges came out you were free to play the game however you liked, casually fishing, doing dungeons, exploring etc and still making a small profit out of it.\n\nBut then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked...\nI mean After challenges got added it all changed and unfortunately for the worst. Every first 20 minutes of the hour you have to go to a certain zone and play with a certain class they pick for you instead of the one you enjoy the most ( sure you could play your favorite class but get your challenge points at one third of the normal speed which makes it insanely hard to get the higher rewards ).\nThese challenges give you insane and I mean insane rewards concerning materials and the main currency ( flux ).\n\nEvery other way of gathering flux has been deemed worthless due to this and as a proof of this the prices of everything in the game went up dramatically.  Skins that sold for 4.5k are now sold for 45k,  aka with normally playing the game you'd have to farm 10 times as long while 45k is easy as pie with challenges.\nTo make things even worse the challenges are simply done in a huge zerg since that is more efficient than doing it solo and it's overflowing with leachers and bots.\n\nLong story made short, the economy and community was ruined with the challenge patch.\n\nNow to make matters EVEN WORSE,  this was always a fun f2p game with a cash shop on which I've spend quite some cash and I've heard of people spending over thousands of dollars on it.\nHowever with the latest patch they now added premium accounts that give such insane bonuses such as insane magic find to have way higher chance to find rare items compared to free users and multiple free jumps. There are more bonuses but these alone are already ridiculous.\n\nAll in all I greatly greatly enjoyed this game for hundreds of hours but it's done now unless the pay2win mechanics are removed.  I don't mind throwing cash at skins and fun mounts etc but pay2win is a no go and their lame challenge mode sucks.\n\n\nedit:  you can no longer unlock the classes by playing the game HAHAHA. Oh man this is simply hilarious.  You now have to rely on people buying tradable class-coins with real money and them selling it to you for ridiculous prices.\nI already had all the classes anyway but man this is such a slap in the face for new players.","July 10, 2015","false","491.8"," 405 of 660 people (61%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","61","405","660","45","80"

It really pushes how its like minecraft, but different.\n\n\nThis game is nothing at all like minecraft, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nI've played my share of terrible games trying to feed of of Mojang's (now Microsoft's) sucess, and this game does not belong in that catagory at all.\n\nThis game is most certainly its own beast, and im actually very disappointed that the game's PR department is pushing the game as a 'Like Minecraft, BUT' games.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, its a highly refined MMORPG, full of a varitey of classes, weapons, and more comical items than you could shake a stick at. The biomes in this game are all very memorable, with adorable characters that had me questioning my protagonists' motives. The world is deadly, with portals scaled for difficulty, with increasing rewards as teired world go higher, into the 'UBER' levels and above. Constant new realms are created, making sure that the randomly generated worlds don't become entirely looted and scarce of resources. For a large part of the game, mining is entirely avoidable, except at higher levels where you need to craft entranes (called Adventure Portals) I do wish that there was a quicker method of mining, but i'm fine using the 'mining laser' or bombs to collect my shapestone.  The F2P system is also excellently designed, with premium accounts earning extra rewards for things such as dungeons, and a few exclusive items.\n\n\nAll over all this is an excellent MMORPG action/exploration game. Its very quirky and well designed, with all the in game systems working quite brilliantly with each other. Progression feels slow at times, but is very very rewarding. Lastly, this game IS NOTHING LIKE MINECRAFT.","July 26, 2015","true","17.9"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","38","47","5","2"

A lot of grinding, but not too bad.. could get everything in the $-shop by just playing and grinding. All classes were free, could use Cubits to buy them.\n\nAfter Feb 9th: 0/10, P2P MMO, have fun spending $100 getting all of the classes and $100 per dragon. Have fun waiting 10x longer than before Feb 9th to get Flasks/Emblems. Don't like waiting? Spend another $100 unlocking them flasks/emblems.\n\nTrove: A microtransaction story. Everything is so overpriced that it is hard to justify spending anything on this game, let alone be forced to spend money in order to unlock classes (AKA the most important things in the game). Admittedly, i'd be very angry if I didn't already have the classes unlocked.\n\nThe dragons now can only be obtained by intense grinding because they now require 300 dragon coins which are no longer obtainable via trading. They drop "commonly" from the "LESSER dragon chests" (You can buy GREATER ones on the $ store), but COMMONLY is obviously RARELY because in the 30 i've opened, I have only had one dragon coin loot drop of 3. Oh, but if you don't like grinding.. spend $100 on the GOLDEN dragon egg, which instantly grants you the dragon!\n\nBefore Febuary 9th, the Microtransactions in this game were nothing but an ever present harmless nudge in your side. But after the 9th, the Microtransactions have become a violent shanking in your side with a rusty blade.\n\nStay away from this game until they get their heads out of our wallets.

As far as MMOs go, this is probably pretty good, but it suffers from the same pitfalls that I've heard about of many other MMOs.  I've spent 88 hours playing solo in this game, and for me about 85% of this game was a continuous grind to collect, fish, & craft/grow resources to get the next thing I wanted/needed.  The actual gameplay itself kinda boring, with only 3 skills per class, and the same areas and dungeons repeated over and over again across all levels of the game with just the monsters getting stronger.  Being an MMO, I'm sure there will be additional content slowly added in patches over the next few years, but I don't expect the core gameplay to actually change.\n\nIf you're considering playing this game despite my review, I would strongly suggest joining a club.  Aside from giving you people you can play with, a club can also provde all of the portals you need for later in the game which I would say is about half of the resource grind I encountered.  They might even help out with the rest of the grinding in the game leaving more time for actually playing.  Just don't expect that gameplay to be all that rewarding.","August 3, 2015","false","88.4"," 177 of 284 people (62%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","62","177","284","17","6"

You're a hero (11 Classes currently able to pick 9 on a new character creation) doing quests exploring dungeons getting treasure / dissassembling said treasure which saves the skins to re-use at will making your character fully customizable\n\n2. Minecraft style -- You have blocks which a "block converter" turns into many different style of blocks (regular colored block, steel, ice, glass that kind of thing.) in all colors as well as another crafting station that builds doodads such as beds, lighting that kind of stuff..  Of course you don't really realize this until you put some effort into step 1.\n\nThis game features many different biomes all of which are color coded on your Map(M).  Some pretty mind blowing pre-built block-art style dungeons exist within these biomes  -- I once went inside a "Giant Gingerbread house" in the "candy biome"  which had a bunch of things you expected to be in a gingerbread house if one truely existed...  At one point along my exploration, it forced me to drop down into what i can only assume was a cotton candy maker machine. Finding that I had to drop through the blade of this device to progress, I found myself in an office which was quite the contrast I assure you. Life sized of course so even a chair was much, MUCH taller than I - - Obviously an office though the decor` gave it away.   In the main office room was a Giant Gingerbread Man sitting in his office chair as soon as he saw me he leapt from his chair and tried to beat me up - - Upon killing him I noticed that the wall directly to my left was vaguely see-thru, pressing [TAB] i went into build mode destroyed the wall with a laser beam inside said wall was a survelliance room with monitors along with the boss of the whole dungeon A [Giant wedding cake.]    This room looked very ominous and way different from the office room i was in previous.  There was a map behind the boss --this map matched the in-game map and all the different biomes. It was clear this Evil Cake Monster was trying to take over the world.\n\nPerhaps one of the small yet greatly appreciated things this game has is the ability to make your own house and move it around with you First, find a plot of land (They're randomly generated throughout your open-world) then simply build in the designated area - whatever you want to make automatically saves the minute you place 1 block down. You're limited to a 16x16 plot but it can be as tall or as deep as you want. You simply move your entire house with you by pressing E on a sign. While you explore the open world your home acts like a respawn point; refreshing your health potions, dissasemble gears for parts, upgrade your weapons etc at the appropriate station.\n\n10/10 F2P Game with quests that give coins which you use to craft mounts & unlock more characters. (can swap out class at will once unlocked) Any age can enjoy this game.\nHighly recommend giving it a shot!","July 11, 2015","true","51.2"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","40","53","6","0"

Without being too long-winded, the game simply changed into something that is no longer fun for me.  How you acquire dragons with hourly challenges, the new gem system, and the focus on Patron (subscription status) really turned a fun and casual free-to-play game into a chore where you have to spend money to make meaningful progression.\n\nAt first glance, the Mastery system is nice but after some time it becomes very evident that grinding purchases, with real money and in-game, just to get a higher Power Rank and Mastery level is too tedious for me.  The expansion added new levels to each class and in most games that’s nice.  In Trove, it feels like work now.  Leveling is slow and somehow more repetitive from 20-30 on one class than the 1-20 I’ve completed on eight other classes.  Not to mention, you can only buy classes with real money now.  Class leveling is a major way to increase Mastery rank and thus power.  Not being able to buy them with Cubits is a huge disappointment.\n\nBasically, Trove became more effort than it was worth to me and with that I cannot recommend it.  With so many free and paid titles with more variety, better progression, and solid gameplay it seems like there’s just not room for a game were you have to grind for everything.  Other games offer a more enjoyable grinding experience and many other free-to-play games do not focus on getting you to spend money as much.\n","May 4","false","304.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","0"

They've since removed the option to purchase with cubits and now offer a cash only way to obtain, BUT OH WAIT, "YOU CAN STILL GET IT FOR FREE BY GETTING CLASS COINS FROM PLAYERS" meaning you can spend your time farming flux (which is used for almost everything from weapons to a player currency) to buy a coin off another player. Also the whole idea of power rank is a load of crap. Now you can be locked out of areas because your rank isn't fitting of the requirements. I have friends that are now locked out of higher tier areas just because they don't have all the "allies" to boost their power rank, or joined too late so they can't easily get mounts that will raise their power rank.\n\nTo sum up everything, trion decided Nexon Grade greed was the best way to bring in new players.

Once you play for about a half-hour you have played the entire game.\n\nIt's got some really cool ideas that I haven't seen before, don't get me wrong, but it really needs just more to it. For example, there's spots in all the worlds where you can claim them as your home. Basically you build your home and take it with you into worlds. It can't be widened, but you can build it up extremely high or extremely low.\n\nThe game is also really easily accessible which is nice. It's about a GB in size and there's no party system. You just teleport to your friends and everyone auto shares loot and everything you pick up, even with other randoms that are roaming around.\n\nThat's about all the good parts tho. The combat is just too overly simple to really enjoy after a while. I'd say it's a bit more involved than most MMOs honestly, but with only 3 abilities there's only so much you can do.\n\nThe game really just needs to be less of a grind and give me more reason to have fun and build. I noticed there are "community-dungeons" but there's no way for someone like me to make one. (There is a way, but it's a lottery if yours gets in and not a simple in game option.) In a game like this, everyone should be able to. Have people rate your dungeon and the better the rating the more chance it has to show up.\n\nAnyway, tldr; game is almost good but not enough it needs more to do and more fun to be had. Also the music is really boring and uninspired. It's decent for a free to play game though","July 16, 2015","false","28.4"," 186 of 304 people (61%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","61","186","304","11","21"

The content was there, and I felt no need to pay money to have fun. As I watched the game grow from alpha and beyond I noticed small little hints to the game eventually ♥♥♥♥ing everyone over. For a year that day didn't come. Then they added the market, sure it had it's problems but it was still barely an excuse to call it P2W. Everything changed when the...Nevermind. Basically what it boils down to is that Trion decided it was a great idea to make every class in the game unavaible without dishing out some cash. Granted they give you a few of them for free, but your basically saying that new players can't do anything else in the game, but play the class they chose from 4. New players have no idea what each class does and whether or not it's good or bad. Someone could choose say the neon ninja only to find that 90% of the community will say that that class sucks. It alienates new players so much, and thier only excuse was that they wanted to make the newer classes better. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T! Trion is known for this ♥♥♥♥. They market an amazing game, and once they think we had our fun they just yank it all away and say "PAY UP". The saddest part about this pattern is that people do end up paying them. That's why the games don't shut down. They are so misguided it's just hilarious at this point.

I put a lot of time in trove and enjoyed it... and with that said, it is now one of the worst games I know after the update of February 9th, 2016.\n\nFirst Major mistake was nerfing Valorious Vial, Sure Strike, and Revnant. People had entire builds built around the Valorious Vial (vv) and Sure Strike (ss) such as myself). Making a 15 second cooldown on VV now turned it into the crapiest vial ever. SS, though a mere 1 second nerf, still makes a HUGE difference in overall gameplay... My problem with nerfing VV is this. Valorious Vial was expensive enough that it should have had that good buff of a 5% CHANCE of giving back one flask, that made it hard enough to regen flasks (other than revnant). I had a really hard time regening any flasks at all with my Lunar Lancer who used Sure Strike, I ran out of flasks during multiple boss battles. 5% chance was a small enough chance that Valorious Vial was not overpowered, but still usefull. now, it is IMPOSSIBLE to regen any flasks with VV and SS at ALL unless you are revnant, they nerfed it from being not overpowered and balanced, to useless... it is now one of the worst vials in trove. May I also say that it costs 35K flux, so I think it having a decent buff is okay for it's price. it is a later game vial, so it should be good. Same with Sure Strike, it is 125K flux at the CHEAPEST, it is end game emblem, and I think it shouldn't be made worse. End game gear should be good, and it was balanced in the past, now they nerfed the combo to the point that even as a new player the combo is hardly useful.\n\nFor people who are looking to get this game, VV and SS were both really good emblems and vials of end game, most people built there classes around it. Trove seems to want to do this, take the things people like that are balanced, call them overpowered, and nerf them (a.k.a ruin them).\n\nLuckily I went Lunar Lancer, but I feel horrible for the revnants. Nerfing VV and SS was enough to make any Revnant cringe... but removing 20K HEALTH turned them into a not so good tank. It made multiple people quit, and severly hindered the gamplay of half the tanks in trove, to the point where they aren't able to tank what they used to be able to.\n\nFor people who are looking to get the game, Revnant was a tanking class, while Lunar Lancer is a damage class. Revnant focuses on multiple targets at once, while Lunar lancer is more of a focus on one enemy.\n\nThose are all horrible nerfs they made, but I could have handled that, though I would have severly disliked it, but making it so you have to use REAL MONEY to progress at all did me in, let me explain in FULL detail why this is so horrible. I speak for the new people and people with a small amunt of classes bought before the update. There will no longer be any diversity in trove, everyone will find the best starter class, and EVERYONE will go with the same class. Not only that, but they only get 2(!) class coins free (Trion says you get 3 free, but you have to BUY something with real money before you get the "free" class). Then you can get Chloromancer free by putting some time into Rift which is annoying that you need another game to get a class... Then referral links, which, as most more exierenced trove players know, isn't a fun task to take up. After that, they have to use real money, or grind for weeks to buy one class coin on the market (for mid to late game player, maybe a week). On top of that, You basically have to PAY for MASTERY being as classes were a main source of mastery levels. Most people won't play trove long enough to get much interest because it is now SO RESTRICTIVE once they get there starter class to level 20 they will get bored. But wait, There is more! With this one time offer of a crappy pay to win game, we give you a gurantee that there will be new classes which you can't touch unless you spend $19.99. With that said, no matter what I do, even if I owned EVERY. SINGLE. CLASS... I would have still used all my class coins, and then couldn't unlock any of the new classes unless I paid money. So not only has this update hindered new players, but also late gamers.\n\nFor people looking to get Trove now, this is what this update basically means for you. You no longer have the availability to get other classes, allowing you to try out new classes, so on so forth. You can't make a single mistake with what class you choose, because if you figure out you don't like that one class, you don't get any chance to redeem yourself, in other words, you are screwed, so if you are looking into new classes, wait a while and figure out what each class does before getting it, becuse you only get two free chances now to choose out of 10+ classes that used to be available for free. Before this update, you didn't have to pay to get classes, after a week or so, you could get classes through an ingame currency called cubits. Now, you either grind for 2-3 weeks, depending on how much you play a day, before you get enough flux to buy a class coin on the trove market, or you pay real money to get a class. For those who don't know what flux is, it is a crafting material used in Trove, also now used as an in-game currency, much harder to get than cubits. Also, for people looking into Trove, Mastery is a thing which you gain through unlocking new styles and mounts and things. For fishing, and for just about every achievement you get. Classes were also a MAIN WAY to get mastery, by leveling them up. What mastery does is this. It gives you certian buffs for your stats, some rewards, flux, cubit, and other very helpful and often times necessary things. What this means for you now new players is this. You are going to have to grind for a MUCH LONGER time than you used to, to get the mastery and things you need to have to do well, you will now have to spend a much longer time grinding and doing nothing else in order to be able to enjoy the game later... and I mean months. So you basically are restricted to a select few things you can do unless you pay or grind for months.\n\nSo ya, trove is all in all ruined.... It saddens my heart to see such a good game go down the path of "Pay To Win".","February 11","false","326.3"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","1"

Its gameplay builds on the formula of Cubeworld's, a voxel/3D pixellated visual style (that looks great due to particle effects and lighting), fast-paced combat with usable skills and randomly generated worlds and dungeons. The mastery system gives reason to excessive grinding as well as character levelling and loot. So why am I negatively reviewing a unique and genuinely fun game?\n\nTrion.\n\nF2P and P2PI played this about a month before its exit from beta and Steam release, and the game was very light on its pay2play aspect. Classes and many goodies in the shop could be bought with Cubits (earnable currency), and most premium items were cosmetic or boosters.\n\nSince the Steam release, they've added 4 "content" packs that give nothing but cosmetics and wallet devotion points to Trion and are about to release another called Mantle of Power - while it is a content pack, should its content really be things that the game could've had from the start, without being locked behind a paywall? Things such as a higher level cap, "awesome" abilities, more explorable worlds and WOOP WOOP more cosmetics. EDIT: You had to pay for it of course, but at the very least it was a "Head start" package, meaning if you bought it you got it a weak early. I don't see much point in doing it apart from making money.\n\nOn top of this they made a Patron system. You pay for a subscription for a certain time which is basically a giant ♥♥♥♥ing booster that gives you more items, more rarities, more chests, loot, experience... so you can have fun quicker and gain a big advantage over others.\n\nThe icing on the cake for this section is the fact that, with a recent update, Trion removed the ability to buy classes with Cubits. This leaves a tiny amount to be bought in the shop with Cubits now. Give it a few months and they'll discontinue them. PAY OR DIE\n\nConnectivity and ServersDue to the ambition of Trove and the massive amounts of worlds generated for people, I can see why there'd be issues. What I don't understand is why these issues have persisted to this day.\n\nEvery week there are patches, downtimes etc that can last from 2 hours to a whole day, just to fix and maintain servers. Several times in the past I've been disconnected from Trove to find the forums on fire with complaints.\n\nNot to mention ping and rubberbanding issues. While the addition of European servers upon release helped, I still find that my ping is above 100 and 200 nearly all the time, especially in new worlds and PvP. Enemies teleport, ranged shots visually hit but don't actually connect, you can see why this is a HUGE issue in PvP as well as PvE and Shadow Tower runs where players need to be precise and methodical to fight against the most powerful bosses.\n\nMy Verdict/TL;DRIn my opinion, the base game is fantastic, I must've clocked over 200 hours by now from pre-release and Steam. Unfortunately, the game is plagued with issues and Trion hitting us below-the-belt with more pay2win aspects. They seem to care more about taking money than listening to user feedback and issues.","April 11","false","158.8"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","35","49","0","9"

Finding the next best thing or popping chests and getting rare loot is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe Okay\n\n- The classes are largely the same, and they all have their playstyle basically dictated from level 3. As you play it's just a seesaw of power between your equips and which portal you enter.\n\n- All uprades aside from weapons and equipment are basically cosmetic once you get past starter. Wings, mounts, boats, there's a basic one and then you unlock another by grinding. It's nice because you don't get blown out by other people with super fast mounts, but you DO need to unlock cosmetics to advance your level, and everything else.\n\nThe Bad, or "The Heart of the Review"\n\nThis game is a sugar coated addiction vampire. The bubbly exterior masks a system that encourages you to play, play play and pay, pay pay. It does this exceptionally well, and it's insidious(or good business practice).\n\nIt starts you off with a tutorial that runs you through the basics and then points you towards buying a 'free' thing from the shop. The shop button, incidentally, is 'n', right between 'b' and 'm', which are inventory and map, respectively. Controls are typical WASD/Mouse. That means you're going to be trying to hit b or m blind in game a lot and instead bringing up the store, conveniently, and there are quests that require you look at your map frequently so every mistake says 'hi, did you know we have a shop?' It comes pre-hooked into your steam account so in app purchases are very easy...\n\n...and eventually they'll start to eat at you. Unlocking classes is cheapish, unlocking flasks is cheapish, but all the same stuff will take heaps of hours in game. You can unlock 2 extra classes with ease - after that it's grind city. You can unlock two basic 'fast' pets, but after that you need to grind 200-500 of a bunch of resources to get new ones. Unlocking that stuff, again, is a ton of grind, but it's necessary to get the resources to buy new character classes and other important gameplay items.\n\nWhat's really killer is that the content really doesn't change after the first day or so of gameplay. The numbers get bigger, but 90% of the time it's just a swarm with classes not really using synergy, just trying to overwhelm bosses. If the gear+level tally is high enough you win, if you don't you lose. Some classes are force multipliers but that's really just an incidental effect.

However, it's obviously not; you're at the mercy of the servers' latency. For most games this is a non-issue, as the developers actually invest in decent server capacity. For a frenetic Action RPG where pinpoint accuracy and constant movement is always a factor, latency means everything.\n\nWhile you're out and about adventuring and getting addicted to this game, you're going to experience countless bugs, rubberbanding, lag, lag, and more lag. If an enemy is strafing you, you can hit them directly with a ranged attack MULTIPLE times and they won't take damage because of client/server desync. The same issue happens when clearing a dungeon; after finishing the quest a chest appears that you destroy to get gear. Usually this takes 3-5 attacks, however due to lag and desync you can be attacking a dozen times before the damn thing finally pops. Speaking of attacking, spamming skills can cause your character to be stuck autoattacking on some classes, which may or may not actually do damage. And there are no real options to resize the chat window or filter "local" chat or club (guild) chat. Spam ahoy, and you have to install a mod to be able to get rid of the chat window. Brilliant.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Literally EVERY SINGLE major patch this year the developers have consistently made the game WORSE for new players. That's right, they are actively DISCOURAGING people from playing their game. Classes used to be purchasable with an in-game currency from daily rewards, and now you have to pay money or grind out tens of thousands of the equivalent of gold (flux in this game) and purchase a cash shop item from other players to unlock new classes. This most recent patch made it far more difficult for a new player to upgrade their gear to endgame level. And they always give a different BS reason when in reailty they're just trying to make more money by being scumbags. This is about on par with every other game published by Trion, and it doesn't look like they're going to get better any day soon. Absolutely friggin pathetic.\n\nThe game is incredibly fun and plays great... when it works. Then it gets pretty damn frustrating. If you're not prepared to be frequently frustrated by rubberbanding, desync, bugs, and consistently regressive updates that make the game harder for new players, this is definitely not the game for you. If some of those issues finally were addressed after however many years they've existed, Trove would be an instant recommend. Buuut looks like that's not gonna happen.","April 24","false","248.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/recommended/304050/","wrathinside","Wrathinside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/","21 products in account","The GOOD:\n\n-Very mild farming, addicting, relaxing, seamless. Something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pt6rPDrQqA\n\n-Simple gameplay. There are many things in which a good player can be better than a new player, and you don't have to worry about precise rotation or 3-4 action bars.\n\n-No social pressure. No need to join guilds to do "difficult" content, this MMO is as close as it gets to "the game about you".\n\n-Freedom of construction: houses, clubs, even mods and items that you can create and upload for devs to consider.\n\n-Free to Pay.(no mistake here)\n\n\nThe BAD:\n\n-The Community\nThe first thing you'd want to do - is leave global chat and prepare the ignore gun when it comes to world chat. From scammers to pure trolls to harassers to non-english speakers to imbecile noobs - you will feel as if you are constantly in Barrens Chat, if you get the reference.\n\n-The Spam\nYou will see streamers proclaiming nonsense many times per hour. You will see people spamming heart-a-phone 2-20 times in a row. You will see people open chaos chests and get loot, sometimes bizzare loot - as long as they are in the same channel. That's why limiting yourself only to /world(that you can't leave) is the calm way to play.\n\n-The Casino\nRNG hardly will surprise anyone these days, but Trove brings it straight to the point of Casino. And that's not necessarily with common "paid boxes", it applies to virtually every box there is. A random adventure box can contain 10 flux, or can contain a mount worth... 10-50k flux. A hundred Shadow Caches can leave you with something like 2000 flux or with something like 100k+ flux worth of rare procs. Chaos Chest loot goes between ~200 flux minimum to about 2 million flux maximum(Chaos Coin). Trove of Wonders, the worst casino to date(and the main ingame currency sink) will reward you with ~2000 flux minimum to 8 million flux maximum. And there's more.\n\n\nThe HORRIBLE:\n\n-Forum\nIn a few words, the community-developer communication practically doesn't exist. There are no CMs that would respond, and developers only post if they have overriding opinion on the subject.\nFor example: complaint about streamers > "we are doubling the streamer keys"\ncomplaint about stealth major nerf-fix > "we'll see if anything is out of the ordinary"\nOther than that there are only bans and silence.\n<Edit>\nI've had it with the game and the forum. Third consequtive ban, and if the first two may have been more or less earned for obnoxious attitude, the third one was actually for neutrally discussing the state of the game and of the upcoming update. Beware, if you say "f*ck"(with *) or "prostitut*"(which isn't even censored by the forum) - you are gonna get it. Apparently such level of vocabulary is too much for the Trove's target audience...\nThe update will bring a new level of gear, Stellar, which people(according to devs) estimate to be about the same logic as Radiant(which required 3x Penta and then some). So for one item, you'll need 3 of the currently hardest acquireable items in the game - Radiants. And probably something else.\nPersonally, I'd welcome it. And many veterans would too. But... now I don't really give any f*ck about this game. And new players, who, after weeks if not months of gameplay, still aim to obtain a Radiant... well, that'll cost them some dollars.\n\n-The Streamers\nDo you hate major PvP game streamers, where streamers can go bats*it crazy to get attention? Well, Trion started to promote people by giving them game-affecting rewards. In unimaginable quantities. They "say" that they have a set of rules for these streamers, but nowadays you will be assaulted with dozens of streamers, who are either outright disgusting, or who say outright "come and get a giveaway". There may be one or two fair streamers, and even then I wouldn't be too sure, but the rest are there for nothing, and if you want the rewards, prepare to bot, wait, hope, etc. I think this is the only game that makes watching streams semi-mandatory. No other game has sunk so low.\n\n\n-The Developers\nIf there is a bunch of greedy imbeciles that can rival Overkill Software - that's Trion, or at least Trove developers.\nOver the past month, they have managed:\n-To kill F2P element of classes\n-To kill dragon ascension(major ingame advancement)\n-To kill ingame store\n-To promote streamers to even worse(really) levels\n<Edit>\n-Yes, now they killed challenges. People, who can only do stage 1 - no longer have any good reason to do it. People, who can only do stage 2 - will only get 2\4 caches. People, who can do stage 3 and not really give a damn - will get full 4\4 caches that they might not even need(I personally rushed Lunar in 5 days, and I was "late"). And caches themselves were made arguably worse, because their miniscule flux buff was used as reason to nerf forging...\nSeriously, these devs are downright criminal.\n\n\n-The Target Audience\n\nThose who pay. Everyone else is a waste of server space.\n\n\n-The Servers\Engine\nTalking about the devil - you remember witnessing a 40-man raid in vanilla WoW? Or even before that? How the modem connection and wooden machines could handle it back then, yet make it look... EPIC.\nWell... the most "public" event are these "challenges". What they are - is a lagfest of world loading, lags, rubberbanding, possible crashes, when only about 5-20people are around you.\n\nAnd that's... in a cube world. Not even in some LOTRO...\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I will just say:\n\nAdequate, interested, skilled and willing new players are no longer wanted. The target audience has shifted towards cash payers only. Veterans can survive, being grandfathered and able to accumulate ingame currency, but unless a new player wants to dish a few dozen bucks(for a start) - there is no hope for him. The game virtually became a "freemium".\n\n\nThere is one and one hope only - befriend a veteran. With the advent of the market and inflation of economy, you can waste weeks in low Ubers and imagine some "progress"(having a party helps), or you can "buy into" the game. Problem is - buying into, as "accessible" as it gets - numbers in prices starting from about 100k flux, and the list is long. And a new player, normally, should be really happy to see his first stack of 9999 flux.\nVeterans, for comparison, can get an average 30-40k flux per hour through relaxed farming. If there is a way for you to properly start - do it through the veterans. You can try the streamers, you can try the global, or the clubs - but veterans can "at minimum" - help you get a required "PR" to enter Uber 6 and get drops from there, not to mention experience and challenge rewards. I've helped a few players like that, but I can not say how long I'll stick around.\n\n\nP.S.:\nPlease, disregard any positive review prior to 2016. If not biased, they are very outdated, because in January 2016, I was ready to write a positive review. In just one month, my verdict - they've killed the game. And if you check the forums, you'll see that many players, who have been here forever - will only agree.\n\n\nP.P.S.: Trove-related jokes:\n\n-"Let your imagination.... be free. For everything else, there's Mastercard."\n\n-"What's the difference between a moderator and a lump of dog sh*t? A moderator is right, but the dog sh*t smells good"(c. Scary Movie 4)\n\n-"Trove now is like a prostitut*, the more you pay, the more you get."\n\n-"Trove fan is like a cow. You hit it - it goes moo. You milk it - it goes moo."","February 25","false","380.1"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","28","39","0","10"

The first of it's kind aside from Cube World, Trove is a massive RPG that allows you the freedom to customize the way you play, the way your character looks, and your all-around experience of the game. Trove has improved greatly since its early days in Closed Beta. The course of the game is far more easy to understand, as you now have objectives pointing you in the direction of your journey.\n\nOne of the best parts of Trove is that it is not Cash Shop heavy, and most things can be bought with the in-game currency that is given to you by killing enemys completing quests. Mounts can be found as loot throughout the game, but can also be bought at a reasonable price. Companions, which are pets that will follow you around and attack enemies with you, can be found in the game as loot as well, but you can also buy them in the cash shop.\n\nTrion Worlds did a great job on Trove's "guild" mechanic. Instead of joining a guild full of players, you can join something  called a "Club", which has it's own world and chat for you and your friends to have fun with.\n\nTrove's character customization is also one that deserves to be a lesson to other MMORPG's. You don't have to pay premium OR in-game currency to change the way your character looks. So if you don't like your character's appearance, or you simply want to try something new, it is at no cost to you whatsoever.\n\nThe community is a huge part of the Trove world. Hats and masks for you to wear are mostly made by the community themselves, which can be picked up. Credit is of course given to the person who made the face, and they come up with some pretty creative names for the items.\n\nIf you don't like the way your class plays out, or you simply just want to try your hand at a different class, don't worry. You can pay premium or in-game currency to change your class. Don't like the way the Neon Ninja looks, and want to try your hand at another one, the choice is yours for a small price.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Of course, it's a great game with an ever-evolving community with very active developers who have been very calm during this hectic launch.\n\nI give it a 9/10","July 11, 2015","true","12.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","2"

You were able to archieve things in a reasonable time. The classes were able to be bought with currecncy you gained for logging in daily, which I think was a fair deal. The only thing you needed to pay for with real money was (like in many other games) cosmetics ,things which made things easier for you and some premium mounts which were avaible also from time to time for free-players.\n\nI played this game without spending any penny and in the end i don´t regret. The greedy dudes from Trion rolled out like 3 patches which totally destroyed the game, its currency and they lost many of their members.\n\nLet me briefly give you an insight of what they did:\n\n-There are 12 Classes\nearlier: all avaible after some period of time\nnow: 5 Classes for free rest needs to be bought with real money (or traded via Ingame-Market, but still needs to be bought from someone).\n-Added a Power-Level which made it ridiculous hard for newbies to get a foot on the endgame content.\n-Dragons which were able to be "collected" durring a specific time and which have a serious impact on you Power-Level were now hidden behind a freaking hard grind time\nearlier: 1 Dragon like 1-2 Weeks of time needed the additional earning could be sold to other players which were to lazy to do the missions\nnow: 1 Dragon like 8 Weeks of time needed and less additional stuff gained to sell (which is bad for economy)\nQuote:  "New, limited time, $100 Credit Pack is now on the store. This pack contains $100 worth of Credits and a bonus tradable Golden Lunar New Year Egg, which immediately hatches Selene, the Celestial Storm, with no additional materials required!" -Thats the way grind it or buy it\n\nThis act of total contempt of the community made me giveaway all of my stuff, say goodbye to everyone i had known in this game, uninstall the game and write trion what i thought about the changes. Unfortunately they didnt care and kept going with this monkey business.\n\n\nMy conclusion:\n\nIf you are able to get a time travel machine i totally recommend you to play the game until there will be a patch name "Monkey Business". If you are a ULTRA tryhard and you like masochistical grinding this game is woth a try. But if you like a nice ballenced, fair F2P game with kind devs this game is the wrong attempt. ~ Love you Trion :*, never see you again\n","April 8","false","29.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

The people are friendly, and the gameplay is awesome.\n\nPros:\nFun game\nDifferent things to do:\n-Building\n-Grind(for money or for levels, take your pick)\n-Shadow tower boss hype\nReally different playstyle per character\n\nCons:\nNot all classes are balanced TO the current patch.\n(Some classes seem a bit more op now or more obvious to be a better class)\n(Squishy characters seem to have lost their main use.)\nLittle kids who do not know how to sepll.(Intended)\nMay be overwellming to start funding gear.\n\n\nNeed help?

The developers made strong statements that the game would never become pay to win, or anything similar to this. And over the course of 1.5 years it has improved a lot of game mechanics, they've added many great features to the game, such as Classes, Mastery Rewards, Skilling, Boats, Wings Etc.\nThe game became great, almost as good as it could've been at one point.\n\nBut afterwards it turned downhill, not too long ago it became in my opinion pay to win, you could no longer obtain classes by just doing normal daily quests, they try to push their "patrion" into your face, so that for a small fee (3 euro) you can get Twice or even Quadtruple the amount of goodies than the usual player would. And although that doesn't seem like a whole bunch there's the problem that their "patrion" system is based on time. It is not permanent.\n\nSo can I recommend this game to anyone? Sure, absolutely recommended for some players, that are into the whole money-roll thing that has become a standard in the "FREE-TO-PLAY" industry. But for those that don't feel like spending money on the game shouldn't bother.\n\nI can understand that they need a sort of income. I would love to help, but that's not the only problem that has occured. Recently they have had *MASSIVE* lag and rubber-banding, so until this issue has been resolved I cannot recommend the game to anyone. Ofcourse this does not impact all players, but it does for some. Personally my brandwidth is high above average, but there's still a minimum of 300 ping in my region(and sometimes goes all the way up to 1000). Yeah I think you see my point.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game has suffered, the developers aren't pushing good content, game is broken.\nDon't waste your time on it.","May 17","false","141.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Gameplay is simplistic and requires a tad bit of skill (odd for a game of this type). The grind is real, but fast & fun, and they aren't shy about it. Warning: once you play this game the word "dungeon" will lose all it's meaning. 7/10 would play.\n\nDo you wanna have a boss fight? WELL BOY DO I HAVE THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nThe game knows what it wants to be. Grindy, fast paced, fun. I can only describe the game as anti-competitive; shared xp, exclusive player-specific loot (nonshared lootpool), no party system, the ability to be in multiple clubs at once... which is odd that theyre adding PVP but i doubt it will be a "lose all your gear" affair, so maybe they'll make it fit.\n\nFor someone who has a background in high-intensity, high-APM, competitive gaming; this game brings me back to the days of runescape... but fun and silly. Or the grinde of your average MMORPG... but actually more fun and skillful than just spamming the 1-9 keys. It has just enough skill requirement that some classes are rather fun and keep things interesting, but not enough to be prohibitive to lower-skilled gamers.\n\nThis game SHINES when you play it with friends, and the community is... strange, when viewed from the average FTP game. I wanted to sell something for 50k, and the person only had 20k. I said when they get to 30k, they could have the item, and then they would owe me 20k. I was fully expecting this person to trade for 30k and then run away (which he was in his full rights to as anyone who does a deal like this is clearly insane); but shockingly the next day he whispered me and paid me the 20k oweing. I have witnessed so many people acting true-to-their-word, I'm actually comfortable with giving out small loans to players I have trading experience with. Whether or not release will kill this -truly amazing- community has yet to be seen; but it sure as hell was amazing at the time of writing this review.\n\nFlying around while mining via tactical-bombings while dodging though massive amount of falling lava has a rather high level of enjoyment when paired with some good music. Check out youtube /watch?v=Zy4olECueH0 to see what I mean. Frankly, to me that just looked freekin amazing which is why I captured it after the fact with shadowplay.\n\nThe pay2win isnt flat-out pay2win, unless you pay A LOT! I woundn't be surpirsed if many choose to buy in for a little bump when starting out but trying to buy into lategame is a waste of time. I pitty the fool who purchases a class with credits instead of cubits. Cosmetics is where your credits will actually be worth while (oddly enough).\n","July 10, 2015","true","751.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","16","20","5","0"

Finally a game that absolutely blew away my expectations. Instead of it being some rpg money grab, thats pay to win, We have an absolute gem, in a sea full of fakes. This game, is true to it's name.\n\nLet me tell you this game's loot system is so addicting, for example you may have, in another game with similar rpg elements, seen a weapon and only equipped it because it look's cool. Well in this you can customize the look's of your weapon to resemble an even cooler looking one, with better stat's. So basically the weapon has its same stat's, its damage, melee speed, however if you put any weapon into a loot thingy (I forget the name), makes it a free re-skin to any other weapon you currently obtain. It's very simple. Weapon A, with Weapon B's skin. And you get paid (in-game currencies) for it. Who ever said looting low level stuff, was a bad idea, right?\n\nUpdate: I am addicted, this game is addicting. Update 2: FINALLY LOAD TIMES ARE BETTER!!!\n\nYou know what. This game, gives me hope. It really does, it really defines what a f2p game can be. Honestly, this is what might possibly be one of the best f2p games I have ever played.

Ahhh, time to uninstall. Goodbye, trove.\n\nI'm very disappointed in the older users of this game as well. Or the ones who spend money often. Not because I envy them or anything, but because they seem to have no consideration for the new users. A lot of the older users, or users who spend real money, are rich in-game, so they're blind to the negative effects of the new updates. They say things like "I love this update! It lets me earn stuff that only someone who has already earned all the best emblems/ gear/ etc could worry about! I'm unaffected by the changes, so you should stop complaining! "\n\nThis is how it affects new players. In the very last update, yesterday, they changed the order in which we receive caches from challenges. It originally went like this: Part one gives 2 caches, part two gives 2 caches, part three gives 1 dragon coin. But now it's reversed. Part one give 1 dragon coin, part two gives 2 caches, part three gives 2 caches.\n\nDragons take 4 coins per soul. You need 75-100 souls for each dragon. Dragons give a small bonus to stats. So people want them. So that's why dragon coins are useful. But the first 2 caches giving money out was far better for a noob than getting 1 dragon coin. Why? Because if a noob doesn't even have money to upgrade their gear so that they can survive in the areas the challenges take you, why do they even care about some dragon bonus stats? The dragons require super rare materials that most people end up BUYING with flux, rather than spending 99% of their Trove time searching for. So now, new players are kinda forced put combat on hold, as they have sucky gear, and all they can do is farm for dragon materials to get those bonus stats. So yes, older players benefit by gaining more dragon coins. THEY have time to earn other things. But newer players needed that small amount of money the challenges use to give.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have obtained most of the classes before they were paid. Back then they could be bought with cubit points. (Curency you earn every day by doing a few dungeons.) Because it allows me to complete the challenges as the bonus class, which completes the challenge in a shorter amount of dungeons. But even as the bonus class, I only complete the first 2 parts of the challenge. 40 dungeons... Because 99 dungeons is bull shet. Nobody does that unless they already have gear high enough to quickly kill the highest difficulty dungeons. I've tried it on a lower level, where we don't receive a bonus multiplier. I absolutely destroyed the lower level dungeons, but the time it took to fly to 99 dungeon alone, was too much time to complete the challenge. Each challenge lasts 20 minutes. 99 dungeons in 20 minutes is a godly expectation that only end game professionals can do.\n\nSo now you see that new players are limited to doing the first 5 dungeons and getting 1 dragon coin, but NO caches (Which contained money. Enough money to slowly earn for better armor by spamming the challenge every hour.) Or I guess they could find some way to make freaking 100,000 flux to buy new class coins. Huehue.\n\nThe few friends I've introduced to trove are discouraged from even playing it when they see that it's an immediate grind-fest. There use to be a grace period, where newer players could easily get into the game and start earning money to upgrade their gear, but not now. Now you either begin your long journey to get dragons, or you find another way to leech off of higher players by following them to higher area farming. (I'm guilty of doing this currently. I'm maxxed out, yet still need the help of other maxxed out players JUST to make a few bucks. As in, if i wanted to make a new class and upgrade its armor, it's going to take twice or three times as long as the first character I made before the pay to win updates.\n\nYou can go to hell, Trion/ Trove. I'm only here because I've developed a tolerance for grinding, and gained some knowledge of income methods in-game. But for how long? Probably not that long if every single update takes away a new income method, like it has repeatedly done for the last 3 months... Every update, I find myself trying harder and harder to earn pocket change. Very hard to stay motivated.\n\nSpeaking of having new players leaching off of you, this actually happens to me often as I am farming. A player who is completely unequipped for the difficulty we're at, will follow me around, pretending to help with their puny damage, as we farm away. I sympathize 100%, and have no problem with them. Trove's/ Trion's f*cking greed has put them in this position.","March 2","false","011.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","2"

Not sure if the time I've spent grinding my way through this game will appear above my review or not, but I was one of the lucky few to say they were there when it started. You created an account, hopped over a hole in the ground, and went off on your adventure.\n\nI was a naysayer at first but man, this game blew me away. There were a few things that got monetized, but it wasn't too big of a deal. Just mounts and classes basically, and you could get them with the currency you earn by playing. The community was astounding, most of the content in the game had been created by players. Looking at all the weapons and armor, you could see the individual credited for it's creation.\n\nAfter some time, it was pretty obvious Trion spent much more time figuring out how to make the money and not how to properly code the game. A company needs money to survive and to keep delivering quality content to it's customers and Trion is known for only the first part. They have turned an incredibly addicting game into a paying simulator. Saving up for that awesome class with cubits you've earned by playing? Sorry little buddy, you have to spend money to get the classes now. So not only will the development of the classes be much slower (it already took forever for a new class to come out) but you won't be able to obtain them without spending money.\nhttp://forums.trovegame.com/showthread.php?89417-Trove-Store-Unlocking-Classes\nThere's your link. It's truly upsetting to see Avarem post such a thing and I really see the game dying off because of it.\n\nSome old players who already have everything unlocked will be absolutely loving it, because people like it when they have things others cannot get. And they will insult the people who don't have these things already and claim it's the greatest thing ever. But I can tell you, as an OG, this truly killed any hope of me coming back/continuing to play trove.\nI know Trion, and their reputation for ruining their games (which are actually great by the way) just for money seems not  to be going away any time soon.\n\nThe absolute worst part is the bulk of the players are very young and just don't know when they're being screwed over and they'll only be bashed by the people who have everything when they finally step up and say hey this game sucks because I can't get anything. I will miss it, but I believe this to be wrong. Companies should not to these things to their customers and I truly believe the ratings for this game on steam will plummet for it.\n","March 13","false","0.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","4"

Recently I returned and was shocked to see how low the quality has dropped compared to how it used to be. Its a complete mess being unable to load chunks correctly or it starts the game with  a graphic glitch that makes me unable to see a thing. (I see through the floor and all of the character models are gone). I would have recomended it because its a simple and easy game to pick up for people just looking to play casually. But now Its just a mess I hope the devs will fix these problems soon. But these are not the only problems you must now pay to get new classes. This is a problem for new players because they have to invest money into a game when there used be a system where you could get more classes with a fair amount of grinding. There was a currency known as cubits you could earn it by leveling and ect. But it has been removed and now you must buy the other classes to be able to acess them. Overall this game has went from a 8.5/10 to a 5/10 (for the short amount of time I was able to play it before the glitches)\n\n\nOverall Score\n\n8.5/10 (Good Score) (Trove 1 year ago)\n0/10  (Unplayable) (Trove Now)\nPS.

it means the game is more relaxed than games such as WoW and has a blocky almost minecraft like look.\npersonally my favourite mmo as it is a pretty calm enjoyable experience\n\nPros-\ngame is free, in game purchases are an option, and wont hinder your gameplay if you decide to opt out\n\nalways new content, as you progress through the game, theres always a new challenge, always a new task or item to get or complete. thus making the game never feel empty, with weekly updates helping too\n\ngraphics, the game looks pretty good, with hundreds of clothes and weapon styles that have been player made adding to the large array of unique content not to be seen in any other game (apart from the odd pop culture reference here and there)\n\n\nCons-\nsome grinding can be a drag, its never too bad, it never gets to the point where you're aobut ot have a mental break down, goals are always reachable and fair, but sometimes can take alot of work to achieve.\n\nservers, as the game is still fairly new, you can expect the odd server crash once in a while, and if the servers arent crashing, then they have a tendancy to run slowly, making navigatin difficult as the ground beneath your feet disapears.\n\ncommunity- while note all players are bad, there are a lot of minges, spammers, trolls, scammers about theses days, however with the recent addition of a report spam button the population of minges is decreasing\n\nTrade- pretty much its too easy for new players to get a hold of rare items, the economy is bust at the moment, good for new players, bad for returning or current players\n\n\nsummary-\n\nthe game is fun,free,laid back, at first i was hesitant but now its become a hobby, not an addiction though. if you where thinking of picking up the game you might as well start as of now (2/10/2015) as rare loot, pickups and others things are way too easy to get right now, the game is definatly trying to welcome new people.\n\nso what are you waiting for? go play it!\n\n(written at 2 am, excuse me if i made some errors)\n\n\nEdit- as of 30/12/2015----------------\n\nwith the new PVP update i decided to boot up trove again, after the patcher was finished and i'd loaded in i noticed a new building in the hub world. the building was the dedicated portal holder of the PVP arena portal, i went in, and was met by a very long load screen trying to find a game, upon actually finding a match i was sad to see that there are no mounts, no special buffs from weapons ro dragon challenges or anything, everyones levels are averaged out, so low end players get stupidly high boosts and people with max level characters get smacked down by the devs at trion worlds,\n\nsummary- in pvp its who hits first capture the flag, its slow paced and theres no 1v1 mode for smashing people, theres is also no way to fight others without the horrible level adjustments, meaning you wont be able fight off thousands of noobs with your max characters.\n\nEdit- as of 26/04/2016----------------\n\nso i went into trove again, what a mistake that was, it seems you can only buy classes with real money now, atleast thats what people in global chat where claiming, i wouldnt know, i have all of them.\n\nthen, i see that if you where a top level player, with super high mastery and max character level (42) (power rank around 2k) you are now practically nothing, having to be a power rank of something like 10k to get into the "new" worlds.\n\nside note: if you see people running around on dragons and you want one, good luck, now instead of getting souls from caches as the main way of getting dragons you need to get something like 300 dragon coins which are now only a drop and cant be traded along with about 200k flux, for one dragon, its ♥♥♥♥.\n\nand finally, yes, the "mantle of power" update is coming out soon, and yes it may change some of my claims, but will it fix the game, no, this game used to be amazing for free, now its more for children and those who will spend real money for ingame crap","September 4, 2015","true","340.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.\n-: No storyline, NONE.\n-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.\n-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.\n-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive).\n-: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).\n-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).\n-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.\n-: Does not have very much music.\n-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.\n\nThis game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.","August 1, 2015","false","2.2"," 95 of 173 people (55%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","55","95","173","16","49"

The mechanics like weapons, dungeons, wings, allies, mounts, etc. are made perfectly.\n\n*So what are the bugs and issues in this game?\n\n1. The first one is , itlacks regions.

Putting them in a queue the first time they play will just send them someplace else. Let first time players jump the queue, and then if they like the game they'll be willing to wait the next time.\n\nAlso, get more servers to meet the demand, or you'll also lose the players you already have.","July 19, 2015","false","16.8"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","26","44","2","0"

As there is just a very basic pvp and developers are not willing to improve that late game(as i said about 1 month) is all about playing minecraft in the club world or grinding more for more of your characters. Also as i looked back to the game, after a 5 month break, the only important things they did is that they added the long awaited pvp(like after 1 year wait time) added more dungeons(get used to them in like a week and grinding starts again) and the most important they added more skins, cosmetics, mounts all these cosmetic stuff that doesn't influence even a little the game feeling.\nSo if you just want to play it for a little while go do it, but in the matter of longterm i don't think it's your game.","March 20","false","468.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

You can ask pretty much anything in the global chat, or certain "groups" you can join, and you'll get a response really quickly. I'd recommend watching some streamers and see what their requirements are of joining their group. Usually very big groups with helpful people.\n-Easy to play with friends, you can use your friends list to teleport to your friends easily. Cooldown time can be annoying, but is necessary.\n-The interactiveness in general is AMAZING! Like you can be typing while loading a new map/area, and when the map loads, your chat is still there. Some games just close your chat which can be very annoying. Also, you can have your inventory open with chat, so you can transfer names of objects easily. Overall, very interactive interface.\n-Unique 3 tier leveling system, base level, armour level, and mastery level. Very cool system.\n-A lot of different classes with different play styles and skills. Allows for anyone to find the class that best fits them.\n-Forums where they post updates and reasons behind downtime and what not. Also posts when the servers are back up.\n-A bunch of streamers, where you can win giveaways and what not. Good for starting players, and more experienced players. Can never say no to giveaways!\n-Trove is very appreciative of any content creators. Anyone who designs an object gets like 200 copies of that object, and can give them away or make a ton of oney off of it. Regardless, really nice of Trion Worlds for doing that.\n\nThere are a lot more things, I just don't want to keep on writing. Overall, great game. Now, for some cons.\n\nCONS:\n-Downtime downtime downtime... so much of it. You really need to be patient with this game. They've had downtimes spaning 5 minutes, and downtimes spanning a full day. You never know, they might say its a 2 hour maintenance, but it takes 5 hours. It's very annoying, but worth it for the quality of the game.\n-Can be long wait times to join a new world/map. Teleporting times can also take awhile.\n-Game has froze/crashed for me a few times.\n\nAgain, there are obviously more cons to list, but again don't want to list all of them. These are just the most noticiable one.\n\nWith everything I mentioned above, it is still obvious that this is a great game, and therefore has earned my recommendation for this game.\n\nCheck it out, it's a free game. Won't cause you any harm. :)","August 2, 2015","true","352.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I played from the start of the Steam release up until late May, when I finally called it quits. The game had slowly been getting pickier and pickier with how much progress you can make without purchasing anything (classes, gem boosters/regeminators/etc) and the new players were left in the dust while old veteran players were rewarded just for existing. I had faith in Trion throughout a lot of it, even when classes were switched to real money only, and when the awful gem system was introduced. I put in too much faith. The game kept on spiraling downwards. Timegates, broken updates, it all became a huge disaster.\n\nIt doesn't help to have some gripes with the staff. The whole community was told multiple times that "the first person to find a duplication bug and report it would get 100k credits." if the bug was found and fixed. I reported one, it was found and fixed, and yet I got nothing. Really? I could care less about the credits, but the fact that I was promised I'd get them and didn't is my issue. The least they could do is say "oh hey thanks for reporting that." Instead, I'm ignored and they just continue on with updating more and more, making updates that no one asked for. Want a claim system that only exists to screw over people who forget they need to claim stuff? No? TOO BAD.\n\nIt had potential. Great potential. However, this potential was taken for granted and ruined. When Trion can get their ♥♥♥♥ together, maybe I'll change back to positive. I used to be hooked on this game, but it didn't take much for me to jump off.  Wouldn't recommend it at all until the dev team realizes their mistakes and fixes them. Listen to the community, please. It's not too hard, and it's not too late.","June 5","false","836.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Of corse you can buy through much of the grinding, but everything in the store that costs real money is way overpriced, so don't buy anything. I bought 750 credits for 5 dollars and could buy almost nothing. I saw that extra backpack space was on saale for 50% off, 250 credits for what i assumed was 50 extra backpack spaces, it was missleading and gave me 5 extra slots... Could not really buy much else with only 500 credits so I bought 10 more slots. The game itself is fun, but be prepared to grind, dungeons, mining, other resources. It takes a long time to progress in the game. I have yet to achive highest tier gear or do a shadow dungeon yet so I have not seen all of the game yet, and the economy and trading scene seems like it is healthy as far as I can tell. I am not great reviewer but I felt like sharing my opinion. But back to the buying things with money, even if everything was half the price, it would not be worth it. So unless you are rich and got cash to burn, buy nothing.\n\nEDIT* Queue Position : 1000+.

This is my TL:DR of the game\n\nlearn the game levels 1-10,\n\nspend your time in uber1-uber5 levels 11-20 getting enough gear level/mastery ranks to enter u6\n\nenter uber-6 and make profit - but the game really ends progressively here\n\nThe monsters you kill dont even change in size nor color, it's the same dungeons thousands and thousands of times over. There's masteries and professions and a 'collection' system thats designed to make you feel like therer's infinite progression until you max out but in my small opinion the core gameplay is whats more important, and once youve gotten over the 'holy crap this game is something new and unique', it really starts to feel like youre stuck in a loop until you can afford to financially upgrade your gear.\n\nThe game is built on a structure that isnt at all desgined to be hard (Unless you picked Gunslinger or Neon Ninja, and for the sake of time im not going into class balance but holy fk), but only time consuming. The only thing to do is go find materials to create 'x' or to upgrade shadow levels of your gear. Once youre past using the earlier upgrade materials it's expensive as hell to progress and takes 5 hours+ for ONE tier upgrade (even if you make 3K flux/ hr reliably)\n\nwhat keeps me playing is the club im in is full of ~200 nice/mature/experienced MMO people that make repeating dungeons / repeating mining / repeating shadow arenas at least a bit dynamic and fast, without a group to run with I would have quit already.\n\nI recommend it because the developers are in touch with the community and the promise for the game is there. Club member restrictions need expansion, along with all the other side-aspects of the game. The core is just boring in my humble opinion.\n\nThanks for the read.","July 22, 2015","true","358.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can choose to be a sword wielding tank, a damage heavy character or a spell-toting dragon.  (There are more characters)\n+ Family friendly (lol)\n+ Mounts, pets and wings provide smoother gameplay but doesn't make you overpowered damage wise.

The game is completely pay to win now and the "end game" is horrendous. Trove is barely an rpg. It lacks so many elements for an rpg. You have such a limited choice with abilities for each character. PVP is unbalanced because of some characters having so much utility and damage.  It gets so boring after a couple of hours playing it. After you level every character you have unlocked to max, there is nothing to do at all. Oh boy... the joy of fishing... That is so boring especially in video games. You have to buy packs for so much money... and you barely get anything at all. Leveling up your character or grinding for materials is such a pain and long process.

I have got to say not only has the game changed a lot. it has improved along the way! There are tons of new features, more items and an over all more refined game!\n\nFor the uninitiated, Trove is a voxel based sandbox mmo where you create your character and travel through different worlds completing dungeons, collecting loot/gear to progress your character. There are many classes in the game, and more classes added regularly. Each class can be switched to "on the fly" all you need is a wardrobe.\n\nIn Trove each player gets there own plot of land that they can take with them everywhere they go, all from the start! this land can be customized in anyway you can imagine as long as its withing the size limits. There are also shared worlds for building called Clubs, that act sort of like guilds in other mmos.  Linking all the worlds and features together is the hub. Hubworld is a place most "trovians" pass through regularly to get from place to place, so its always pretty lively.\n\n\nI completely recommend Trove to anyone who is a fan of voxel based games, sandbox mmos, or just getting lots of loot!","July 11, 2015","true","32.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Also it would be really beneficial for the players to shorten the queue time.","July 12, 2015","false","6.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

The game is fun, the different classes lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game. The enemies balance well with the player level, and the game is paced so as to offer the player a reward at intervals that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure. One of the greatest features is the "cornerstone"- your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome.\n\nThe downside is that grinding MMO's require functional servers to enjoy, and the developers can't seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life. In the past two weeks since I began playing, with 48.5 hrs on record, there was not a day that passed  without the servers going down. Disruptions of less than an hour or 2 do not make the forum ( I think the dev's see them as common) but looking at the forum you can see that the server goes down for long periods at approximately 2 day intervals. (http://forums.trovegame.com/forumdisplay.php?21-Server-Status).\n\n\nPros:\nFree to play\nfun biomes to explore\nblock building\nmobile home base\n\nCons:\nServers are down regularly\nEnemies and bosses lack variety\nGame play is repetitive\n","August 4, 2015","false","54.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

First of all it was long time ago since i made a review but ill try to keep it simple for the info that i got so far and Im a Newbie my self in the game i have played for 35 hours and some information might be incorrect and im not even near end game! ^^.\n\nAt the first ppl look at the game... oh sh... its a copy of minecraft... well ITS NOT.\nThe game is basicly allowing you to make a house where you can have your personal stuff like loot and you can spawn your house at worlds with you... you can costumize your own building how ever you want and have working bench and portals and other crafting benches... the house is personal and people can join you and have fun...\nWhat you can do in this game with friends is Going out and Farm monsters and do these Dungeons that is everywhere in the map and gain awesome loot with amazing stats in it. i would say its more like Diablo 3 farming style. you run around in dungeons and get loot and you can share items with others... the loot system is personal but if you find something nice you could take the loot and drop it to a friend if you want to :) and the loot that you get and dont need you turn them into materials for crafting. well i dont really know how to explain it better than this... i would say hey... give it a try and dont read comments like this and just jump into the game and give it a go  :)\n\nThe bad thing is atm the Que Timer, but i hope they fix it really soon... its about 1-60 mins long, some times its really not showing the right time and if it says MORE than 60 mins its just lying to you... so dont trust that it can really jump and just lie that its 300 mins in que. just be patient and youll get in to the game. if you havent played TRION WORLDS game and need an account why not take my link to Recruit a friend link for the game its on my Steam page soon.\n\nAND THE GAME IS FREE GUYS! and NOT a pay to win game. just go for it!\nand i hope you guys understood any of what i just have written above, english is my third language and i hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for taking the time to read it! and write in comments if theres something incorrect what i wrote about the content of the game!","July 16, 2015","true","209.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","2"

Ill tell you this though waiting for trove is like waiting for my favourite anime every week I wait but its totally worth it. So now for my review trove currently is also my favourite game maybe of all time I need to see how things go. Trove is 3rd person voxel mmorpg. Its a game where you can adventure collect loot and materials and ores to build things and level up your mastery and classes theres alot of classes right now and there still updating my main currently favourite is shadow hunter it can sense enemy and see them through walls its shoots arrow throws down stun bombs and has an ultimate arrow ability and a charge arrow abitlity.oh and there are dungeons and if you can beat the boss you get a loot chest and there are hard shadow arenas to beat if you collect parts for a shadow key theres tons of equipment loot and I find my self changing loot every 5 mins. currently theres only pve but there going to add pvp I hope soon because im a huge pvp player and it would be interesting to see how they approach it.(the only problems with this game that keep me from playing it literally is I get disconnected once in a while the que is 40 minutes but im patient and the lag sometimes in the game is brutal I collect a block and mine it but it pops back up and doesnt go in my inventory im sure they will fix this and the game will be that much better! :) 9.4 untill they add pvp, like hunger games its coming!!

There's no avoiding that fact, so if you're one who dislikes the repetition of going to the same dungeons (or lairs) which are almost identical again and again, you most probably will not like this game.\n\nHowever, if you can put that aside, it is actually quite fun. The colours are vibrant, the designs amazing, the weapons customizable, your house movable. It allows for a lot of creative potential. Think Minecraft with Diablo. The creative aspect of building (Minecraft) does not at all interfere with the hack and slash nature of the fighting (Diablo). In fact, they complement each other well when levelling up and progressing.\n\nHowever, with the pros of both Minecraft and Diablo, it has the cons of both. There is no story, and the dungeons begin to repat itself very quickly. You might find yourself trapped in limbo where you are too strong for Uber 2, but too weak for Uber 3. This is where grinding takes place.\n\nTo counter that, friends really help. Get a group of your friends and go hunting, it is really very fun in that aspect. Personally, I think Trove is great for solo play to a certain extent. I don't detest the grinding, but I really think that there should be something else for people to get stronger without the continuous repetition. With friends, it really shines.\n\n7/10","September 26, 2015","true","17.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Will have a further review once they actually add more content to the end-game other than COLLECT ALL THE THINGS.\n\nEdit: Pros are that building is both made much easier/harder than your regular Minecraft-esque game. Long-range mining + shared blocks makes for much easier block-farming for your creations.\nThe multi-jump mechanic + lining up block placements also allows for much larger structures to be made in a shorter amount of time.

(Doesn't have any impact on playing the game, just makes the classes more difficult to get.)\nGRINDING - this game is a grind fest at higher levels.\nGets a bit boring after a long time playing one class. Although when you find a class which suits you, you're good for a long time. :)\nNO pvp. (At least for now)\nSteep learning curve for new players.\n\n----- Some comments and tips: -----\nMax level for a class is lvl 20. Although your level increases as you obtain shadow level gear.\nCurrently I have 4 max level classes: Neon Ninja, Candy Barbarian (sounds silly but it's strong), Dracolyte and Knight.\nMy mastery rank: 87\n----- If you need any help about the game feel free to add me ingame: Zarlath -----\nThere is also a plenty of community guides which can help you with pretty much anything.\n\nThe graphics might look silly and dumb for many people, but remember that it's the gameplay that matters the most. :) If you have spare time i'd recommend investing it in this game.\n\n10/10 for now.","July 10, 2015","true","355.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

It was addicting. Very fun, but with the new updates, it has gone from OK to complete and total Bull. Dragon Souls used to cost 2 Dragon Coins, some Materials depending on Dragon and for your effort you got 3x the Dragon Souls. now they have doubled the Price and made it 4 Dragon Coins per Dragon Sould and you only get 1 Soul. as if changing from the Level System over to the Power Ranking system, which really sucks. You cannot enter as high Realms anymore with your Shadow Level 3 Gear instead you have to be summoned by a friend and then you don't get the loot. so that is total bullcrap. The should have not changed a thing when I started it, cause all they have done now is made it from Play at your own pace, everyone can win, now it has become to Pay to Win, cause when I started, Classes costed credits or cubits, now it's just credits which can only be obtained by buying them through their store. if that is the case, should I spend $100, I better get 1,000,000 of those Credits, cause otherwise it just aint worth it. if you preffer to simply just build and whatever, good luck, cause you still have to farm for the materials. but nothing is made remotely easy anymore. if you had asked me a week or so ago about if you should get Trove, I would have said "yes" without a doubt, cause what they had. was not bad, but better. this new thing for Trove is just awefull.\n\nI know you are probably going to read this and assume I am a nag. Not trying to be a nag or anything. Just telling one simple fact and the fact is, Trove has gone from a crappy Free to Play game that made Minecraft look like Childs Play. Yes we know Minecraft is a "Sandbox" game, but till recently I felt that Trove was a "Sandboxie" game as well, just with more bosses and players. but after playing nearly 200 hours on this game and watching it evolve from what it was to what it is. you might as well buy this game upfront and play Minecraft for free, just saying.\n\nP.S.

They supposingly upgraded the servers a few weeks back, the game should be running more smoothly but only got worst.\n\nYou also have to pay a load of money to expand your inventory, 500 credits just to show the new inventory tab +500 for the first row with 5 item slots. The game requires heavy grinding to obtain some basic resources for crafting equipments.\nTrion, if this is your plan for the game's future, i suggest you guys change the game to "Buy to Play" or require subscription to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shangface/recommended/304050/","shangface","Sylvir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shangface/","15 products in account","TL:DR This game is ♥♥♥, and waaaaay more grindy than warframe. Yea, that's a thing.\n\nThis will be the first review I have ever written. I mean ever. I don't have the care to write reviews. But this game. No, not this game, the developers, Trion (REMEMBER THEIR NAME SO YOU MAY FOREVER AVOID IT) are the most god awful and plainly stupid people I have ever seen run a business. I actually cannot comprehend how they have made a standing for themselves in the game industry. Now, onto the rant about the game itself. First of all, Trove is a great idea. The classes (for the most part) all work well. Each have a niche but not too much of one as to balance gameplay somewhat well (some classes are highly underpowered however but under the right players fingertips still do alright). The game looks pretty cool, it is cube-like but it has its own style. Almost every dungeon and equip is made by players. After this point, the game becomes worthless. First of all, the learning curve is outrageous. The tutorial is only good for the first 10ish mins of the game then becomes horribly useless in that you either know how to progress or you don't. If you can't figure it out, you suffer. Next, theres like 3 actual currenices but the marketplace (auction house sort of) has at least 6 currencies and people really only use one of them which isnt an 'actual' currency. Because of recent updates (power rank and this new way of getting dragons, an integral part of upgrading the gear you need to make the money you need to fix the first update) it is now impossible to earn classes (except for 2 through mastery) and it is far too hard to actually move at a somewhat acceptable pace in the game (for free anyway). This game has become such a money grab (in literally the TWO WEEKS that i have played) that I'm surprised how its servers aren't already down from non-usage. This game has basically pried free to play players off its feet, and flung them out to the deep abyss of pointless grinding. If anyone reading this has ever played warframe, or even heard jokes about grindframe, just know, trove is at LEAST 4x as grindy. Ive put 400 some hours into warframe. I can grind alright. But this game is too much for me at 80 hours. It would be ok if they just never had power rank. Hell power rank alone was ok, it was do-able, but messing with dragons RUINED progression for free to play.\n\nIn review, Trove is cool but Trion is bad, and progression is long unless you have money.\n\nP.S. sorry about any spelling, grammatical, or formatting errors. This is my first review and probably my last if I never find  a development team worse or as bad as Trion.","February 16","false","86.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

After some alpha/beta time it went officially full release and it's popularity got through the roof. It has many factors which will keep many players stay late at night (to get those wings).\nYou would think that after getting those your world will be completely different, wrong mate, it will be completely same so stop f*cking begging for wings it's short process of getting them.Now the next natural part, by the games tutorial-ish quests it is still learning and there is some stuff to understand about the specific part of the quest ''Collect radiant shards'' do people know why it precisely says ''Better get some wings first'' ? Well many don't, to put it simply it means GET THOSE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WINGS BEFORE GOING THERE. Why the hell they would said it otherwise ? I agree that getting the portal is really long process, but to get it you need to collect lots of stuff, 1 of them you get by exploring lands a lot, another is through gardening which gets you closer to mastery lvl where you get wings (see how it all fits together ?) and at last you will also have you mighty hero who is at least a bit ready for everything in there (not much atm but hey they're adding stuff no hate here).\nNext in line is something which doesn't makes sense because it's one of first things you probably do so screw that. After that trivia quest you are tasked to get yet higher mastery rank to be eligible for challenges. Ooooh yes THE challenges which were crashing servers for some time, fixed now #thankyoutrion, now it's pretty much lagfest because of pretty heavy load on servers and if you hope you'll do challenge in easiest world, nah don't even try, you'll wait for chunks to load and experience constant rollbacks (hopefully this will be fixed or something dunno man can have dreams).\nDid you get enough points in challenge to get your dragon caches ? Did you hoped that you open dragon soul, coin or even penta forged ? Did you ? And did you also get a bit of flux and bunch of eyes after horny chest opening ? Then you are fully capable to call yourself a true Trove player.\nNow off with ya and go fish dem old boots ye filthy hub huggers.\n\nIf someone really cared to read through this which im writing cuz im really bored, then kudos to you mate, just wasted a lot of time you could spend playing or something.\nNothing is meant as hate towards developers just pointing few problems if even.\nFinal verdict about the game 8/10 old boots, when servers start to rollback and stuff then it's more like 3/10 but nevermind. This game is really good as rpg, trade simulator, guild-like maker (talking about clubs ofc) and i recommend it to anyone to at least try it. Thanks for reading (or skipping you sissy)","August 13, 2015","true","587.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Many people make jokes that this is cubeworld 2.0, and these are all correct. This game is everything we could've wanted from CubeWorld and more. Tons of exploration, tons of things to do with your friends, and the building potential is outta this world. I can't explain to you how much me, and five other friends of mine have been enjoying this game, if you don't believe me, get it.

There are melee and ranged classes, tanky and dps specialized.\nThis game is not pay to win and hopefully it will stay that way.\nProfessions ( Gardening, Ringcrafting, Runecrafting ) each with its own bonus once you reach max lvl at the profession\nA lot of mounts, pets, wings, boats\nA lot of dungeons and castles - the hardest ones are called shadow arenas and are divided by uber 1/2/3/4/5/6 etc difficulties, each being harder than the previous one.\nFISHING!\nA lot of character customization abilities - helmet, face, weapon, ring. (ENDLESS)\nGreat community\nClubs ( Something like clans or guilds )\nEverything you do in the game rewards you as you gain mastery points which unlock mastery levels and great rewards.\n\nCons:\nYou can pay for classes if you want to obtain them faster. (Doesn't have any impact on playing the game, just makes the classes more difficult to get.)\nGRINDING - this game is a grind fest at higher levels.\nGets a bit boring after a long time playing one class. Although when you find a class which suits you, you're good for a long time. :)\nNO pvp. (At least for now)\nSteep learning curve for new players.\n\n----- Some comments and tips: -----\nMax level for a class is lvl 20. Although your level increases as you obtain shadow level gear.\nCurrently I have 4 max level classes: Neon Ninja, Candy Barbarian (sounds silly but it's strong), Dracolyte and Knight.\nMy mastery rank: 87\n----- If you need any help about the game feel free to add me ingame: Zarlath -----\nThere is also a plenty of community guides which can help you with pretty much anything.\n\nThe graphics might look silly and dumb for many people, but remember that it's the gameplay that matters the most. :) If you have spare time i'd recommend investing it in this game.\n\n10/10 for now.","July 10, 2015","true","355.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

The building system is boring and flawed. The only difficulty is shadow dungeons which take forever to get access to and the grinding is boring to get the items.You cant challege yourself because you are trapped behind a leveling system. The items arent unique in any way because they are all the same.The classes are a short lived and hard to obtain joy. The items that are pay to play are waaaay overpriced.The shadow keys are waaaaaaay to expensive to craft or buy. Pretty much anything can be obtained through enough begging or a weekly log in with tomes. This could all be overlooked if they would just add ANY SORT OF PvP! but no.

Nope.  I thoughly enjoy this game, however 2 issues have come up after launching on steam: login ques and constant disconnects.  The incomeing new player base from steam apparently has overwelmed expectation, and the devs have been scarmbling to fix all the issues.  Already the devs have added new server hardware to decrease login ques, and more hardware is expexted to come on in the coming days.  The constant disconnects have been frusterating, but as of 7/12 the devs have deployed a patch to clear up some of the issues.\n\nTL:DR Game is great, devs working to fix launch problems, if you passed on this game because of login ques give it another chance in a few days when more servers are up.","July 12, 2015","true","124.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Replaced required currency with items that must be collected in mass to even be of use, bosses are harder, weapons are weaker, was time consuming before-hand and is now even more so due to this update.\n\n\nLet me start off by saying this game is... or was... great. It was utterly amazing, the simplicity was addicting and the gameplay was phenomonal for a stand-alone pixelated 3D MMO, especially for an E-rating. You jump in with an assortment of classes, rank up and get better equipment, meet challenging bosses and see astonishing maps and detailing with the best ranking system I've seen yet, leveling can either be an easy or difficult accomplishment and the best part about it is that you can play this came solo and still find enjoyment no matter what.\n\nNow let's touch the dirty parts of this. Before the update there was an easily obtainable form of currency by Mastery Rank 10 called Flux, this Flux is required in mass numbers to do a number of things such as creating equipment, trading with other players, and even creating neccessary items. There was the harder obtainable Dragon Coins, which were used to purchase Dragon Souls, which upon consumption would give you a Dragon Level. Five would be a pet, ten would be a mount, then the mount would level up as you reach higher levels until you reached a full-fledged dragon that could fly, and give you massive stat boosts. The update switched this. Now, the oh-so require Flux can only be acquired through completing 45 dungeons in twenty to fifteen minutes, which this objective is seen after reaching Master Rank 10. Sounds easy, right? Negative, ghost rider. In order to accomplish this, you must be part of the two bonus classes in the objective. The bonus classes are essentially randomly generated, and they grant a certain class the ability to complete a dungeon and get it counted for three. With out this, you are racing between several worlds for fifteen to twenty minutes, killing several bosses (which can be difficult dependant on your area), all the while trying to even get to them from across the other side of the map. Not only this but you also must beat other players to get there, which some of the more experienced have insane speed boosts due to other mounts, and pay-to-play players have a large boost from this. Some might question, "Is this enough to give a bad review, though?" Maybe. However there is more. In the recent update, high leveled items were buffed. Now you may be wondering, "Doesn't that contradict your statement that other players have advantages?" No. This is only for weapons, which do not give you speed buffs. This comes with the problem that the bosses were not buffed, they remain the same difficulty. Completing a Shadow Tower is now even harder than it was, and for those who have not played the game, a Shadow Tower is essentially what you would call an "end-game level". This is for high ranking players, with very powerful weapons. Even with those powerful weapons you must work together. Before the buffing, the bosses were extremely difficult and took several tries to complete, however now it takes a lot more. There's still more to come, however.\n","March 2","false","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yea, that's a thing.\n\nThis will be the first review I have ever written. I mean ever. I don't have the care to write reviews. But this game. No, not this game, the developers, Trion (REMEMBER THEIR NAME SO YOU MAY FOREVER AVOID IT) are the most god awful and plainly stupid people I have ever seen run a business. I actually cannot comprehend how they have made a standing for themselves in the game industry. Now, onto the rant about the game itself. First of all, Trove is a great idea. The classes (for the most part) all work well. Each have a niche but not too much of one as to balance gameplay somewhat well (some classes are highly underpowered however but under the right players fingertips still do alright). The game looks pretty cool, it is cube-like but it has its own style. Almost every dungeon and equip is made by players. After this point, the game becomes worthless. First of all, the learning curve is outrageous. The tutorial is only good for the first 10ish mins of the game then becomes horribly useless in that you either know how to progress or you don't. If you can't figure it out, you suffer. Next, theres like 3 actual currenices but the marketplace (auction house sort of) has at least 6 currencies and people really only use one of them which isnt an 'actual' currency. Because of recent updates (power rank and this new way of getting dragons, an integral part of upgrading the gear you need to make the money you need to fix the first update) it is now impossible to earn classes (except for 2 through mastery) and it is far too hard to actually move at a somewhat acceptable pace in the game (for free anyway). This game has become such a money grab (in literally the TWO WEEKS that i have played) that I'm surprised how its servers aren't already down from non-usage. This game has basically pried free to play players off its feet, and flung them out to the deep abyss of pointless grinding. If anyone reading this has ever played warframe, or even heard jokes about grindframe, just know, trove is at LEAST 4x as grindy. Ive put 400 some hours into warframe. I can grind alright. But this game is too much for me at 80 hours. It would be ok if they just never had power rank. Hell power rank alone was ok, it was do-able, but messing with dragons RUINED progression for free to play.\n\nIn review, Trove is cool but Trion is bad, and progression is long unless you have money.\n\nP.S. sorry about any spelling, grammatical, or formatting errors. This is my first review and probably my last if I never find  a development team worse or as bad as Trion.","February 16","false","86.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It was addicting. Very fun, but with the new updates, it has gone from OK to complete and total Bull. Dragon Souls used to cost 2 Dragon Coins, some Materials depending on Dragon and for your effort you got 3x the Dragon Souls. now they have doubled the Price and made it 4 Dragon Coins per Dragon Sould and you only get 1 Soul. as if changing from the Level System over to the Power Ranking system, which really sucks. You cannot enter as high Realms anymore with your Shadow Level 3 Gear instead you have to be summoned by a friend and then you don't get the loot. so that is total bullcrap. The should have not changed a thing when I started it, cause all they have done now is made it from Play at your own pace, everyone can win, now it has become to Pay to Win, cause when I started, Classes costed credits or cubits, now it's just credits which can only be obtained by buying them through their store. if that is the case, should I spend $100, I better get 1,000,000 of those Credits, cause otherwise it just aint worth it. if you preffer to simply just build and whatever, good luck, cause you still have to farm for the materials. but nothing is made remotely easy anymore. if you had asked me a week or so ago about if you should get Trove, I would have said "yes" without a doubt, cause what they had. was not bad, but better. this new thing for Trove is just awefull.\n\nI know you are probably going to read this and assume I am a nag. Not trying to be a nag or anything. Just telling one simple fact and the fact is, Trove has gone from a crappy Free to Play game that made Minecraft look like Childs Play. Yes we know Minecraft is a "Sandbox" game, but till recently I felt that Trove was a "Sandboxie" game as well, just with more bosses and players. but after playing nearly 200 hours on this game and watching it evolve from what it was to what it is. you might as well buy this game upfront and play Minecraft for free, just saying.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buffalooo/recommended/304050/","Buffalooo","Kekkaroni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buffalooo/","65 products in account","Once upon a time, there was a game called Trove. Trove was a wonderous game, filled with a community who loved to build and work together to clear even the hardest of bosses. Everyone worked to help everyone out, and all was well. Sure, the grind for classes and better gear was sometimes tedious, and we had our fair share of trolls, but in the end everyone had fun.\n\nThen came that fateful day in February. There was talk of Trove moving towards a Pay-2-Win model, and the community had protested it. We didn't want to spend real money to get items that were, in the past, available to us for free. With the increase of prices in the shop, classes no longer being purchasable with cubits (a free currency obtained daily), and the class coins being scalped in the market, Trove lost it's allure. Other players felt the same, and many of us quit. The magic of being able to play a MMO without having P2W features shoved down our throat was amazing, and being able to  pick up and play any class with free currency was great. No real-time crafting costs, no money needed to be spent. Now, Patron (the "membership" status) was being advertized everywhere, as it got you double cubits, which were now worthless to new players because of their limited uses, among other bonuses. Now I hear of a PAID expansion to Trove? Trove was a wonderful free to play game, with purchases being entirely optional. I even ended up buying Patron before the update that pushed a lot of people away because I loved the game and wanted to support the devs. Now, with the new pay to win structure, a paid expansion for features players have been asking for for ages, and the game becoming more grindy and less fun for new players, Trove has fallen off the ranks of great games.\n\nTL;DR Trove used to be good, now it's garbage. Don't waste your time with it.","April 24","false","329.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't run around for more than 5 seconds with being teleported away. On the timed challenges the timer goes down while you are stuck in a loading chunk for minutes. This is the only game out of all the ones I have played to do this. As well as that the gameplay is extremely repetitive and you will get bored of it after the first 3 dungeons. The main gameplay is just grinding, even at the start of the game. There is PVP but the classes are extremely inbalanced and winning is just having the most Lunar Lancers on your team. Also they charge you $15 for a few cosmetic items. If it wasn't for those Trove would be a great game but unfortunately it isn't.","February 13","false","81.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonicChocobo/recommended/304050/","DemonicChocobo","DemonicChocobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DemonicChocobo/","220 products in account","I've played Trove since a little bit before its launch, and it's always been a bit hit and miss for me. In the early days, at worse it had a lot of great ideas with poor/careless execution. This slowly degraded to just being mediocre ideas with poor/careless execution, and eventually, to just plain awful ideas.\n\nOverall, Trove is a game about farming for things for the sake of farming for things. Your goals are basically set by your current desires, and the ultimate goal is to get all the things. It's a very pure and simple skinner box and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this if it's what you're after.\n\nThere is also a sandboxy construction element where you can build your own home or form a guild with a persistent sandbox mini-world, but it's still very limited and there are MUCH better games you can be doing that on.\n\nAs for the gameplay, combat is quite shallow and very repetitive, but there are a lot of classes that all play quite differently and this can keep you going for quite a while, because you want to see what all the classes are capable of.\n\nExcept this became a lot harder with an update which made the classes unpurchaseable from the Store using Flux, the game's primary type of earnable currency. You can still buy Class Coins(Normally purchased with premium currency from the Store) from other players for a hefty price, but then they also made earning Flux more difficult in that same update.\n\nYes, they paywalled the most compelling aspect of what was an otherwise monotonous endless grind, and this quite frankly disgusted me to the point of quitting. I actually own quite a few of the classes, enough to keep myself entertained for quite a while if I was so inclined, but I just couldn't keep playing knowing they did something like this. I'm genuinely curious how long new players will be stuck playing a class before they can afford a single Class Coin, and feel really bad for them.\n\nFor the sake of full disclosure, I quit back in January. The only reason I'm writing this review now in March is because Trove popped up in the Steam front page and I was like "Oh right, it's that one game I got so disgusted with that I uninstalled and completely forgot about until now."\n\nEither way, it doesn't look like they've changed the class system back so I absolutely cannot recommend this game.","March 4","false","263.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Replaced required currency with items that must be collected in mass to even be of use, bosses are harder, weapons are weaker, was time consuming before-hand and is now even more so due to this update.\n\n\nLet me start off by saying this game is... or was... great. It was utterly amazing, the simplicity was addicting and the gameplay was phenomonal for a stand-alone pixelated 3D MMO, especially for an E-rating. You jump in with an assortment of classes, rank up and get better equipment, meet challenging bosses and see astonishing maps and detailing with the best ranking system I've seen yet, leveling can either be an easy or difficult accomplishment and the best part about it is that you can play this came solo and still find enjoyment no matter what.\n\nNow let's touch the dirty parts of this. Before the update there was an easily obtainable form of currency by Mastery Rank 10 called Flux, this Flux is required in mass numbers to do a number of things such as creating equipment, trading with other players, and even creating neccessary items. There was the harder obtainable Dragon Coins, which were used to purchase Dragon Souls, which upon consumption would give you a Dragon Level. Five would be a pet, ten would be a mount, then the mount would level up as you reach higher levels until you reached a full-fledged dragon that could fly, and give you massive stat boosts. The update switched this. Now, the oh-so require Flux can only be acquired through completing 45 dungeons in twenty to fifteen minutes, which this objective is seen after reaching Master Rank 10. Sounds easy, right? Negative, ghost rider. In order to accomplish this, you must be part of the two bonus classes in the objective. The bonus classes are essentially randomly generated, and they grant a certain class the ability to complete a dungeon and get it counted for three. With out this, you are racing between several worlds for fifteen to twenty minutes, killing several bosses (which can be difficult dependant on your area), all the while trying to even get to them from across the other side of the map. Not only this but you also must beat other players to get there, which some of the more experienced have insane speed boosts due to other mounts, and pay-to-play players have a large boost from this. Some might question, "Is this enough to give a bad review, though?" Maybe. However there is more. In the recent update, high leveled items were buffed. Now you may be wondering, "Doesn't that contradict your statement that other players have advantages?" No. This is only for weapons, which do not give you speed buffs. This comes with the problem that the bosses were not buffed, they remain the same difficulty. Completing a Shadow Tower is now even harder than it was, and for those who have not played the game, a Shadow Tower is essentially what you would call an "end-game level". This is for high ranking players, with very powerful weapons. Even with those powerful weapons you must work together. Before the buffing, the bosses were extremely difficult and took several tries to complete, however now it takes a lot more. There's still more to come, however.\n","March 2","false","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gems on the other hand, have a chance to break (which can be fixed with an item of which you can get in the shop with daily currency which is better used elsewhere anyways) when upgrading and will often just use up resources instead of gainig a level, Overall, it just seems as if the developers wanted to milk the game dry, instead of slowly grow/develop progression.\n\nGems have also seemed to cause an interference with leveling, as, at least for a character that is not very well geared, it is hard to progress without proper gems, and it is impossible to get more gem slots unless you level your character. Also empowered gems are pretty hard to get without spending money or already being geared, and there is always the chance that the gem would have the wrong damage type on it, making it almost useless for your character.\n\nMy advice to the devs would be to at least let gems be traded so that at least if rng ♥♥♥♥s someone big time he can still have some use of the gems he farmed for like hours/days, or at least make it so that players can at least choose the damage type of their gems; anything to reduce this awful rng carnage brought by this expansion.\n\n\n\n","May 8","false","222.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulMinds/recommended/304050/","SinfulMinds","~*Master of Sin*~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulMinds/","7 products in account","Trove used to be an excellent game it had everything u could want out of a game sure the grinding was hard and you didn't really get a decent reward for your efforts but, you weren't forced to do anything. You could build and get to higher level worlds with realitive ease you could join clubs and enjoy the comunitity, but now that comunitity is very much broken. The game has become pay to play those who can pay quickly trump those who can't. People on this game used to be kind and helpful to each other now it's every man or woman for themselves. Shadow tower which was a team effort to gather supplies and gain things you couldn't get on your own has been ♥♥♥♥ on; those who gain the higher level items whether by extreme amounts of grinding or paying for the quick, and far less metally painful way, can quickly run through the tower by themselves and brag about the things they can get and receive. In pts there was an odd economy but it worked; for ages the left the pts servers up for anyone above level 20 which was the max level at the time to use it and test things but recently they decided that keeping pts open 24/7 wasn't giving them anything so they put heavy modifactions of pts making it almost a game of it's own where only the smartest at finding loop holes survive. The once fun and enjoyible game is dead only the selfish are left on trove. I saw many arguements on the forms of trove's web page during the change and many of them did make any sense but since they were from what was left of the normal live players I guess i could understand. I asked one person how people would get some of the rarer mounts or classes now that it would be pay to play? They said people would put stuff on the market for others... This didn't make sense to me so I asked would people really buy extra for others? You really think they would? They said people would have extra stuff... But how can you have extras now? Even if you were luckly enough to get two of the same mount it's unlikely you will be able to sell it for any decent price. And if you want to do anything as simple a building in the game you have to run around trying to collect recipes.\n\nAverage day trying to get started on building:\nYou wanted colored blocks to build something fun :D? :) to bad you have to level up so you can go to skyrealm... whats that you don't have a skyrealm portal? Thats to bad you have to make a club to use any you make or try and get into a club with one :)... :D you got the portal now? Nice now go through any go look for a dungeon! oh... wait you don't have high enough mastery for wings ;( to bad... guess you have to go try these worlds first and try to get your mastery up... your gear isn't high enough for decent grinding? Well then go grind the lower level world you only get a couple flux for each item you fight to get but thats not a problem right :)? It's been a few hours hows your gear going :D? Only up to relic? ;( to bad all the recipes r uber level you won't have a good time if you go like that you should get at least shadow level 2 even for uber 1... It's been a week did you get it? :D You did?! Great! Now go look for recipes in uber 1... can't find any? Try uber 2 then... you got it :D? Good get as many as you can for those first wings :3! You finally got the wings after a week and a half :D nice! Lets get going then! Wait the game updated and now you can't even get in to skyrealm D;? What you need a high power rank how do you get that? ... so new recipes mounts or leveling.... well leveling is near impossible you can't get new classes you have to pay for those and mounts were nearly impossible to get anyway so that leaves... recipes... you say you already got all the recipes except the seasonal ones? Weeeell if you give me $100 I'll give you the stuff to level up your gear making things easier on you... you don't have $100 well ;(... I hope you like grinding :3 bye bye!\n\nAnyone who wants to can come play creativerse with me it's completely free unless you want fancy blocks and it rewards your efforts giving you as much as you give it my server is called last light arena anyone is welcome to join.","June 3","false","427.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The last update made it so you have to pay real money to get classes after the first 3.  Yes, I'm aware that the coins can be bought on the market, but 60k Flux (cost at the time of writing this) takes up to 3 weeks to gather (at least for me).  This doesen't really affect me personally, seeing as I have all but 4 of the classes, but it's a huge limitation to new players.  I can forsee the class diversity in the game taking a dive after about 6 months, once all the new players realize their limitations and standardize on one "best" class to play.  Also, for those that would come in defence of this decision, I ask you: what do you think happens after a core component of a game gets locked behind a paywall? That being said, this game might have been worth your time, but I feel that Trion is slowly killing it.\n\n*Update*\nChallenges now drop lesser dragon caches.

Before Trove I Thought CSGO, G-Mod And Arma 3 Were The Best Games I've Ever Played.... I Was Wrong. I First Looked At The ScreenShots Of Trove, Thought Meh Looks Bad, And I Didn't Feel Like I Would Get Into It So I Ignored It. After About A Week After Its Release On Steam I Was Pretty Bored With No New Games To Play. (I Use To Play A Lot Of CSGO) SO I Was Like Why Not Try Trove, If I Dont Like It I'll Just Uninstall It. First Hour Or So. Ok Not Bad I'm Liking The Shadow Hunter (My First Class). I Get To Max Class Level(20) And I'm Hooked To The Game. I Can't Stop Playing It Now. I've Been Playing For About 2 Weeks Straight The Date I Have Written This Review And I Cant Stop Playing It Now. At First I Didnt Have Any Friends Playing Trove. So I Started My Own Club, And I Was Having Tons Of Fun With My Club Members And Everything But It Was Still Not Extremely Fun. I Eventually Got A Few Friends To Try Tove Out. They Ended Up Enjoying It Also. So We Started Playing Together. From That Moment The Game Went From 6/10 To 9/10. It Was Almost One Of The Best Games I Have Ever Played. After Some Time More And More Of My Friends Were Getting Trove. Which Meant Larger Groups To Dungeon And Do Shadow Arenas With. And Around That Time My Club Kicked Off And Started To Really Grow. It Got Up To ~80 Members. Which Was Pretty Impressive To Me Since I Never Joined A Club Before Hand To See How A Good Club Is Run. Then From That Point Onward This Game Became The Best Game I Am Yet To have Played And Its Going To Be Hard For A New Game To Come Close. There Is So Much To Do In This Game That You Will Always Have Somthing To Do Everyday. Wether It Be To Get To A Certain Mastery Level, Get A Class To Max Level, Or Get Shadow Weapons From Shadow Arenas To Get Radiant Weapons. There Is JUst So Much To Do And More Is Coming, I Cannot Wait To See Whats To Come. In The End I Would Rate This Game 11/10. If You Are Yet To Play Trove I Would Highly Reccomend You To Atleast Download And Give It A Try. It Does Not Take Very Long To Download And Even Less To Uninstall If You Didnt Like It. If You Are A Fan Of MMORPG Games Such As WOW,Diablo,GW2,etc You Have No Excuess To Not Try This Game Out.\n\nThe Only Cons I Can Think Of Are:\n\nThe Recent Sudden Hotfixes/Patches.\n(They Are Pretty Anoying But If You Get A Max Level Class(20) You Unlock The PTS(Public Test Server) Which Is Up During Live Server Downtime.\n\n(This Game Is Just 3 Weeks Out Of Beta, And The Devs Are Putting A Lot Of Time And Effort Into This Game Even Though It Is A Free To Play So The Sudden Hotfixes Are Understandable)\n\nAlso I Know A Lot Of People Who Tried This Game In The Past Hated The Queue Wait Times To Get In The Game Which Were About 30 mins. Guess What... Its History, No More Wait Time At All.\n\nThats Really About It. Like I Said Before Atleast Give It A Try, Who Knows.... You Might Get Hooked.","July 31, 2015","true","332.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It was nice that there wasnt too much grinding, it was great and intuitive that your items were what mostly depended on your power and level, not just exp. Let me now tell you what RUINED this once new and explosive game. (BTW if you are a new player I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game. Maybe play it for the experience because when you get to at least u4 and gem RNG you'll want to end your life.)\n\n\nPVP\n\nHoly guacamole dont even get me started on Class Gem Pirate Captain and darn tooting Ice Sage with instant ability cooldown. At first, I much enjoyed ruining peoples lives as an ice sage. I thought it was hilarious. Then I came across teams with 2-3 ice sages and wanted to end my futile existance. I've quit PVP because of one class. I dont find it fun to enrage people with freezing anymore because I now know what it's like to be on the butt end. Sorry to all whom I froze because I lost all chill (pun intended) when it happened to me.\n\nGEMS and POWER RANK\n\nWant to know how to increase power rank or get to u9? The answer is gems. It used to be farming a bit and upgrading gear, but now your shadow 5 and radiant gear is barely HALF of your Power Rank. This makes me sad. What's even worse is that the RNG on gems is totally freaking ridiculous. A shadow gem (better than relic/resplendant) can have MUCH WORSE stats than a Relic/Resplendant can. Sure, it MIGHT (that is a very very unassured might) have better Power Rank, but still, you'll have to GRIND and GRIND for Gem Dust to upgrade gems just so you can upgrade more to get a tiny bit more Power Rank. This game didnt used to be grinding. It was only softcore farming. RIP all players trying to get over 1200 PR in a short time.\n\nNEW PLAYERS\n\nThere arent any. If you're a new player then congrats. You looked at this game and probably said "This looks like a cute little softcore RPG! I'll try it out!". I'm so sorry pal. Trove is now a HARDCORE GRINDING RPG THAT ONLY LOOKS CUTE. ON THE INSIDE TRION IS SECRETLY THE GOSH DARN ILLUMINATI (whose servers are on Pluto btw. Trion is a Plutonian name is you didnt know) AND THEY WANT YOU TO PLAY AND PAY AND SPEND ALL YOUR CASH ON GEMS SO YOU CAN HOPE YOU GET GOOD ONES BUT THEN DONT AND HAVE TO PAY TO WIN ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nDear Trion,\nDude. What the hoot.\n\nP.S. You've taken a good juicy pinapple of a game, eaten it and then ♥♥♥♥ it out and left it to rot. Tbh, you're almost as bad a Kabam (My lord that was harsh...)\n\nFrom,\nAn extremely angry player whose spent too much time and money on it >:(\n\nGET GUD TRION AND STOP LEECHING THE POPULOUS' CASH FLOW","June 5","false","308.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a lot of classes that you can pick from and they all share the same inventory and house(called cornerstone in game).\nAt the time of this review the servers are a bit unstable but that is to be expected with the huge growth this game has received over the past weeks.\n\nThere is a lot to do in the game ranging from solo questing dungeons to doing shadow arena(kind of like a raid) with a bunch of friends and a good profession system with; ringcrafting, gardening, fishing and crafting.\nDuring events in real life, there are events ingame that reward festive mounts and pets.\n\nBasically this game is good, try it out.\nIf you do, I recommend getting at least one class to level 10 and doing a shadow arena and then make an opinion about this game\n\n8/10 very good game.","July 25, 2015","true","29.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game currently has 11 classes\n\nCandy Barbarian: The tank of the game who uses 2 melee weapons\n\nDracolyte: the pyro of the game, has amazing aoe attacks and can become a dragon!\n\nNeon Ninja: Does backflips and goes invisible, What more could you want?\n\nKnight: A worse version of the the candy barbarian, but with a ability that can fully heal you\n\nFae Trickster: Does huge amounts of damage while dodging most attacks, but if you get hit your Dps turns into a potato\n\nGunslinger: Shoots guns, can run away fast and jump very high\n\nTomb Raiser: Summons skeletons to fight for him and can become a ghost\n\nBoomeranger:  Only class in the game able to use 2 types of weapons, a sword and a bow (not at the same time sadly). throws bombs and boomerangs\n\nPirate Captain: Makes cannons and decoys so you can pelt enemies with a slow gun\n\nShadow Hunter: Uses a bow to do huge amounts of damage to a single enemy while making traps\n\nIce Sage: Uses ice attacks to slow down enemies and deal minor damage at the same time\n\n\nNow The Pros And Cons of the game\nPros\n. Amazing game play\n.Balanced classes\n.

The gameplay is awesome, the gear you loot look absolutley riduculous and funny, you can change yor class anytime you want-for a price, though, and Trove is one of the very few games that uses the free-to-play model correctly, making the in-game purchases an option, and not mandatory. Although, I have 1 slight nitpick: sometimes the game gets to oaction packed, especialy when your fighting and boss because you fight bosses in small, confined rooms. After say, 2 minuets of fighting, the room will be absoulutey filled with explosions and fire. I also have 2 suggestions, maybe they could add in structures that aren't duungeons. Like maybe, towns with npcs. Maybe you could place your base at the town, and you could trade with the npcs. Or maybe they could just add a singleplayer mode. I know, i know, the game is an MMO, but there are players like me who travel alone, and never use the trading system at all. Currently, the closest you have to a singleplayer world are the game's "club worlds" worlds where only you and anyone you have on your friends list can access. But I would like the game to have an offline experience just in case any players don't have any friends, like me, or if online server goes down for maintenence. If we had an offline singleplayer mode, players could still play the game while waiting for the servers to be back up. Overall, Trove is an excellent game that you will sink hours into conquring dungeons and getting better, more ridiculous looking gear. If your looking for a singleplayer experience you won't find that here. You will find dungeons that were conquered by other players, and you will run into other players. But if you don't mind other players, or you ave a couple friends who own the game themselves, then get the game.","July 11, 2015","true","70.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was a grind for power and items, but it was fun enough to keep me around. You could pay money to shorten the grind or to make your character look special, but it has always been too much money for what you get IMO and you could get by without spending.\n\nRecently they've made the grind infinitely long to achieve most goals, and they've moved some items behind the paywall. But their prices remain too high. So you basically have to dump a bunch of money into it to get anywhere, or you grind toward fewer goals that now have no end in sight.\n\nThey took a big step in the P2W direction. I understand that they are trying to make money, and it's their right, but I'm positive they would've made more and lost fewer players by going about it differently.","March 4","false","229.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I saw update after update come in and things seemed to get better with a few downsides. After months of inactivity, I decided to play it again, it was still okay with new classes and just things in general. It was about the time trove was added to steam and it was super easy for new players to get otherwise rare items and I wasn't really put off about it, but then the update in january basically screwed trove completely. Drilled in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with garbo. It is currently unplyabe in its state. New players just give up, it weakened veteran players and it more of a money grab at this point.

Oh, you are new? ♥♥♥♥ you, pay me!\n\nHere's the long.\nThe reason I cannot reccomend it anymore (mostly for new players) is because of changes made to the game around the time of this review. Classes in game can no longer be unocked with cubits (currency earned from grinding). Instead classes must be purchased with money, which is going to affect new players the most since they will be stuck playing out as a single class, which for their sake I hope they chose wisely. Mabey if they like the game enough they will buy a new class, but it will be hard to enjoy a game where you are stuck using something you regret choosing, no? If you have enough in game resources, you can buy a class coin (unlocks one character) for a hefty fee from another player. New players wont be able to afford these class coins. Another thing that has changed is the acquisition of dragons. The update was supposed "to make getting a dragon easier", lies. It is now more difficult to get a dragon as they must be crafted with a hefty(er) amount of resources, unless you would like to pay money to make things feasible.\n\nI understand that running a F2P online game takes money, what i cannot stand is when corporate does not come out with the truth behind decisions. If a game cannot sustain itself with its current marketing structure, just say so and explain that this is the reason new financial implementations are being added. Do NOT decorate the playerbase with colorful rhetoric and dry PR statements saying "this is to make things better for YOU!" Doing this makes people look like greedy parasites with only financial gain in mind *cough* starts with T and ends in N *cough*, and I for one do not wish to give my money to such people. Pay to support good people and the good work they do? Yes, absolutely. Line their pockets with the scalps of chinchillas? NO!\n\nIf you want to try this game, look up each class and determine which one you will enjoy playing as the most. Just be aware that this game just got VERY grindy in two main aspects, and is likely to get even more so in the future.\n\nAvarem be praised! (he does the in game announcements, hence the "skygod" title others and I have given him)\nscrew the devs\n\nEDIT: Well... look what the game has come to. I warned the playerbase the moneygrabbing would get worse, and they said "no, this is just to support the game" and "this game takes money to run". Well I'm fairly certain those players have since said ♥♥♥♥ it and abandoned the game as I did so long ago.","February 20","false","447.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This games used to be good. About 10 months ago It was all great. Until Glyph made this game basically P2W. Its still playable and fun, just you'll have to do a ton of grinding that isn't really necessary. Also, the reason why im giving this game the thumbs down is because in the newest update, a spyware was installed into the launcher (Trion). It basically views everything you do and could possibly save passwords and info. This is a kick in the balls and a ♥♥♥♥ move on Glyph and Trion's part. I can't trust the game nor company(s) anymore.

Trove is not Free to Play its now Free to Try:\n\nTove has released an update where now, you can only buy classse with credit you buy with "real money" to get a class or you buy tokens with "real moeny" to buy a class. Or you could just grind 80k flux (in-game money) so you can buy them off the market IF there even there. Witch for new players, would take beyond a long time if not impossible.\n\nThere is a small amount of building and farming dungeons and leveling your starter character will be all you can do for a long time. because the market requires mastery levels witch you gain beyond slowly to get A mastery point or you can gain it by getting classes. oh wait...thats not a thing anymore.\n\nThere is pvp, market, towers, and dungeons, along with grinding. Pvp, the market, and towers, require about 10-15 mastery points witch you could get easily but now its almost impossible. So that leaves you with grinding dungeons and a small amount of building.\n\nIf you didnt already have classes or if you dont have an easy, fair, way to get 80k flux, you cant buy another class unless you want to use "real life moeny" witch most people just cannot do like me. All togeather, This game is going to kill their "new player base" and some other people will quit because they have nothing new to look forward to.\n\nI got to play it and i have most all the "good" classes and I will enjoy this for a little bit longer. But if they dont take a step back and allow for players to get classes in-game, this game might just slowly die out.\nThis game is now Free to Try.","February 9","false","86.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But now I think it's just a meh game...I don't know  what it changed but I don't feel the same way about trove like i used to before... And now for my simple review :)\n\nPros  Good Gameplay\n\nGood Classes(btw #dracolytebestclassever)\nJust three ability and one passive but still the abilities are really well made and each class has his own very unique style. Good job on that\n\nAlot of Farming\nGrinding,Grinding,Grinding...So much grinding that you will spend hours in dungeons fighting monsters but you better have some friends or this will get repetitive.\n\nCons Trion Worlds\nWonder why this is a problem?Because this company always ruins their games!Start with a good game with no p2w ellements, then give us good updates and then add p2w and ♥♥♥♥ updates...\n\nPacks.\nReally the packs that you can buy for trove is just to steal us money from our pockets but still people don't see that and he keeps buying...\n\nThe Heart Attack Edition(Update)\nYou may wonder:"Why a update is in the Cons section?" Well let me tell you...THE GAME TURNED P2W! Before this update you could buy classes with cubits and now Trion says:"♥♥♥♥ we need more money let's put classes just to buy with credits so players can give us more money. I'm sure people will not get mad..."Well I'm mad and I think that really ruined the game...\n\nThe chat in the game\nReally I remember when this game was in closed alpha and everyone was so nice. Literally you asked for help and someone actually helped you.Something that you didn't knew just asked for help and people helped you...\nBut now people are so annoying and not helpfull. Some days ago my friend asked for help and people just maked fun of him but thankfully some guy helped him. I know that there are still good people on this game but for now i'm gonna leave this has a con.\n\nThe downtimes.\nReally waiting 4 to 8 hours just for a update?!?!?Come on you can improve that!\n\nFinal Verdict: 6.5/10 Great game but what Trion is doing to him is just bad.With the new P2W update I think this game will shortly die.\n\n\n","February 16","false","124.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Game went full KOREAN MMO , NEVER go full Korean !\n\nTo even get to start of end game it will take you weeks of grinding , thats the content pre patch . After you reach Last updates endgame then you will hit the wall so hight that you wont see the end of it for months and months . The ridiculous enchanting system will make you waste HUNDREDS of hours to even get half way up that wall , the other half you wont see unless you spend money . The amount to spend wont be 10 or 20 $ it will take hundreds of $ for atempt to get top items since there is RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG .\n\nSo the grind in this game competes with the grindiest games you can find .\n\nThe question is "Is it worth the grind ? " .\n\nANSWER : HELL NO . There is litteraly 0 end game content .\n\n1 . Map , end game zone or how ever you could call it in this game is copy / paste on every single zone in game .\nWhat that means is : You started game in zone 1 , you enter zone 2,3,4,5,.... and its litteraly same map , mini dungeons , enemyes Except on some of them textures are slightly darker .\n\n2 . The Suposed RAID dungeon is for MAX 8 players . There are 4 bosses that have like 2-4 skills , basicly bigger world mobs . Those 4 bosses got 3 difficulty levels , just COPY / PASTE just with higher stats . Thats it 4 bosses FOR MMO .\n\n3 . PVP . I doubt you can find more broken / unbalanced pvp in any MMO. On top of that , remember the thousands of hours you spend on getting gear ? Yeah you cant use it in pvp . PVP has basic stats , basicly no customization .\n\nPROS: You can build amazing things , RLY you can do everything you can in minecraft . ♥♥♥♥ IT just play minecraft instead .\n\nTL:DR - Game competes for place of the most grindest MMO . No PVP , No RAID dungeons , NO END game content . Almost as good as minecraft.","April 22","false","347.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

No pay to play, but you can if you want to (not that i advise it at all)\ngameplay is easy to learn, but harder to master.\n\nCons: lacks creativity quite a bit. now you may argue that is not the case, but just LOOK at it. It is basically minecraft with common RPG ideas. we could of AT least had a skill tree for our classes, but no, they decided it was better to have only 3 different abilities to use. The gameplay is STRAIGHT farming. all you do is kill, get loot, put loot in loot collector, repeat.\ni mean, you could have made it more unique, but because they took all their game mechanics from minecraft, they lost all creative capabilities that came with the mechanics. In minecraft, you swing a sword repeatedly by hitting the same button to kill, not much different here. the fact that they had to resort to using minecraft as a foundation for their game hinders their ability to expand upon it. If you want a decent RPG. look to skyrim and others. while this may be free, games like skyrim will be worth the price. But if you dont have money to spend that's ok too, try out warframe or other games (im going to try alot of them and see which is the best for me, i recommend doing the same). Sure warframe only has four powers per warframe, but there are 18+ frames so far, all of which are free, and most of them not that hard to get and a lot less farm. not to mention warframe powers are usually epic, from charging through enemies and sending them flying, to turning invisible and assassinating them! but as to whether or not this game or that game is good, the only way to know for sure is to try. The only reason i stopped playing was because i saw someone say in their review that somewhere in troves terms of use it says that if you pay for something in the game, for instance: cubits, etc. then they have the right to keep the your card information to use when they please, and was also claiming they took 1,000$ from them, whether this is true or not i do not know, but that comment was soon deleted (likely by trove if they have that ability). whether true or false i do not know, but it is still enough to deter me from playing this game again.","September 10, 2015","false","81.9"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","32","61","0","3"

Or a sandbox buliding/crafting mmo with rpg elements and combat.  Either way if you don't mind voxelized graphics and you're a fan of a genre you're most likely going to enjoy it for some time.\n\nWhile I do recommend trying this game out, it has a pretty big flaw which shortens its replayability in my opinion:\nTrove has a huge crafting list and literally thousands of customization options for you blocks, decorations, character equipment parts etc., I'd say this game is pretty solid in terms of 'explore, mine, craft and be creative'-thing. But when it comes to combat and RPG features - it's rather lacking. While there are plently of classes and skill mechanics are polished, each class only has 3 skills(and a class passive) which are unlocked almost immediately and... that's it. There are no talents, no item-modified special effects, no skill changes of any sort. And while equipment stats are randomized, the options are pretty limited.\n\nI like the game so far. It offers great variety but unfortunately it lacks depth.\nI just wish there was more of 'RPG' in Trove.","July 15, 2015","true","15.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The "Heart Attack Edition" update. (Pretty thoughtless and inconsiderate naming scheme, don't you think? Clearly they haven't had one themselves. Unfortunate. More to the point:\n\nThe Heart Attack update is God-awful. It has RUINED Trove. List of valid reasons why:\n\n- 3 classes: You can only get a total of 3 classes until you HAVE to pay real money, which is bad, HORRENDOUS even, since different classes are the only thing that'll keep you coming back for more.\n\n- The developers IGNORE player feedback: All of it! Nothing is being done to polish this update. Maybe respect 80% of the player's wishes and revert the game to its previous state to prevent going out of business.\n\n- New random missions: This has worked well in other games I've played, but in Trove it's total f****ing BS. For example, one may be like this "Clear 6 dungeons in the Peaceful Hills biome". Easy, right? Wrong. After that one, you have to clear FOURTY(40) dungeons in that same biome, which is IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n- Power Rank: Each piece of gear now has a "power stat". This stat doesn't affect anything, but it prevents you from going into a more difficult area. If you're like me, example; level 12 Neon Ninja, level 8 equips: weapon, hat, face, you won't be able to go to the harder dungeons which you USED to be able to go in, which means NO MORE DECENT exp, and you will NEVER find better gear than that lower level stuff you have.

Trion took a loved artstyle, gave it a new life, and made something a lot of people have enjoyed.\n\nBut then the devs got greedy, and like most F2P titles that I've HEAVILY enjoyed in the past, they've hurt the playerbase with the worse possible update they could dish out.\n\nWhen I first shared Trove to my friends, I made note that one of the most awesome things Trion did was make the game F2P with microtransactions that only affect how your character looks. Unlike a lot of F2P titles that furiously try and milk the community.\n\nIf I was making this review 2 weeks ago, I could give it a thumbs up and recommend it. But as of today, and finding out how greedy they've become, I can do no such thing.\n\nI give this game a thumbs down, and can no longer recommend it to any of my friends.\n\nThis is why we dislike microtransactions.\nThis is why we hate greedy game devs.\nThis is why we can't have anything nice.","February 19","false","382.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It still lacks that energy that will leave players hanging on and keep playing. Trove has expanded a lot since the pre-alpha stages, in terms of its UI, game mechanics, classes, and open-world generation. The character classes has adopted the same style as Firefall, where all the classes can be earned by collecting the Cubits (daily-earned currency) and redeeming them. If you're those who loves to collect the collectibles, maybe this game is good for you to continue in search of the items.\n\nWhat's interesting behind the leveling system in Trove is that, the max Level that can be leveled is Level 20. But to move beyond Level 20, you need to obtain Shadow items, refining it, to further increase this capped level. Where maybe things starts to quite grinding as it goes further. Nevertheless it's not just about the leveling, but there is also Mastery system, where each items you collected or actions you have done in Trove accumulates into this system. So it is beneficial to focus on Mastery first.\n\nTrove has a marvellous open-world generation, that you continue to explore the Uber-worlds. I'm sure none of the worlds are similiar in any sense, since it's a mega world with various biomes merged together. Besides fighting dungeon, you can also actively participate in the Club or Cornerstone, architectural building of blocks. Some of the creative worlds can be seen in forums, like Mario World or Pokemon's Pallet Town. Trove also been always very active in their server maintenance, every Tuesday. They have come out with numerous events and limited period items that allows players to hunt and collect these items.\n\nFor network wise, it is still playable for Asian players. Although you will experience a little bit of slow response in preloading of objects. Especially Trove sends objects in chunk that loads the next few segments of land, that is in your camera view. This is very adaptive, as Trove adopts the world generation feature. Similarly for dungeon when it comes to boss-battle, it is preloads it for just that instance, so don't worry about dying out.","October 27, 2015","true","196.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The devs still are trying to make a game about collecting stuff harder and harder for people to do by lowering drop rates or increasing the amount of stuff you have to do inorder to get said item in the first place. Dragons the main selling point of the game they thought people were getting to easly (Note it took me about 40 hours to get with buying the souls just to get 40 souls) harder to get by raising it to 100 souls for the current dragon with a drop rate of only 10% to less. that means if you want a dragon you either buy it or you spend the next 100 hours farming them out for no more than 20mins at a time. They have 8 more dragons slated to be added so this seems to be you only get a month to the 100 souls before you have to wait anohter year to do the chellenge for that dragon again.

Think of it like cube world, but it's actually being worked on and kinda complete (AHEM LOOKING AT YOU WOLLAY) I've already sunk 90 hours of my life in it, so that's fun. It gets really grinding in the later levels, but adventuring is really fun. You never really know what you'll run into, like pirate ships in treasure isles.

It is one of the few Free to Play games out there that allows you the ability to have a great time and find and use awesome items, without having to pay any actual money to get anything cool (though you can choose to pay actual money, if you so desire). The art style is rather charming and fun to look at, and provides a beautiful environment wherever you happen to be (until you destroy the land while collecting resources for crafting, of course). You have to create an account to play, which is quick and easy, and as soon as you're in you are free to do what you want. The leveling, crafting, equipment, and class systems are all very well balanced and make every milestone you hit very rewarding. Trove is certainly not the greatest MMORPG out there, but it is incredibly fun, it's free, and playing with your friends (or even random people you meet in the game) is easy and very fun. Definitely a must-play for fans of RPG's of all skill levels. A very solid 8.5/10.","July 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Now sit back and read this Wall of China esque text.\n\n\nThis review goes in to depth of Trove\nBasic Details\nTrove is a Sandbox massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed and published by Trion Worlds. The game was released on Microsoft Windows on July 9, 2015.\nOn Launch Day, the game was launched with issues of queue wait, in response the admins to restart the servers three times. Some players were also unable to join Club Worlds or login to the game, But eventually they fixed that issue and the game was much more enjoyable after that point.\n\nGameplay\nThe player assumes the role of a Trovian of multiple classes, There are 13 classes within Trove. Currently, these are The Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, the Knight, and the Revenant. Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied.\nMost classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be "Roamer" classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore.\nEach Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have in built cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat. Each classes mechanic is unique and allows for a variety of play styles.\n\nCornerstone\nThere are houses, They are very mobile via signs. These are called "Cornerstones" they are homes of a Trovian where they do their basic things like crafting, forging and Loot Collecting and the other sorts. Other Trovians can walk in to your Conerstone and use your things, But not take your items. The Cornerstones are not like Safe Havens, Monsters of the world can walk in to your Cornerstones.\n\nCharacter Customization\nI know most of you people like having costumes and stuff on your characters, Your Trovian's can have that too! Any Weapon, Hat or mask that is placed in the craft station known as the Loot collector, will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the players library allowing the player to choose to use that items image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally any item which is destroyed in the loot collector also provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting.\nPlayers can also alter their characters' face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, penalty or cost, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone.\nThis allows for great variety as each player can customize their characters appearance to a high degree.\n\nGame Environment\nThe Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals.\nThe Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing.\nEach world zone contains various biomes that focuse on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others.\nEach biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone.\nThe biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeon's shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome.\nEach dungeon contains a single 'mini-boss' who upon defeat rewards the player with a large amount of experience, and causes the spawning of a reward chest. The chest contains 1-3 items which are usually the matching quality of the zone but have a small chance to be of higher quality as well as various other resources useful to the player.\nThere are also large dungeons which appear less frequently than normal dungeons and can have 2 'mini-boss' encounters each with their own reward chest and one main boss encounter who is significantly harder but has significantly better rewards.\n\nClubs!\nClubs are like Guilds, But they have their own world! The Club world is a zone without dungeons or enemies and is meant to be a central meeting area for members of the club. The Club leader and any other member of sufficient rank can freely build within the zone and can place items normally only placeable within player built homes. Additionally there are some items which can only be placed in Club Worlds.\nPlayers can instantly travel from anywhere within the game straight to their club world.\nClub chats allow members within a club to chat to each other. The club chat is accessed through typing "/c#" in chat\nInitially the Club world consists of a small island complete with grass and trees. The Island is surrounded on all sides by a unique biome called the Sea of Regret which, when entered, is harmful to the players. However, players can built and deploy devices which, when activated, can convert areas of the sea into additional land mass. This allows players to increase the size of the Club World as desired.\nPlayers may join up to a maximum of 5 clubs at any one time.\n\nCommunity\nThe Community is generally very nice and helpful to new players, But to those who spam the chat asking stuff like "HOW DO I CRAFT!?!?!" will just get Ignored and Reported for Spam. So if you want to ask people stuff, Don't spam.\n\nHow i rate the game?\nThis game is honestly a 8.6/10 in my opinion, I love the game, The game is very fun and has a lot of replayability.","November 16, 2015","true","223.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you start out as a free to play you can actually enjoy playing the game for a while without being annoyed by the micro transactions. Although the game does make the purchasable packs add fun to the game, you can get by with only spending max 5 dollars, and that's if you want over 6 hours out of a free to play MMO. The game is pretty well developed as far as the game itself, although network issues are persistent during huge updates or DLC sales. If you want the game described in a nutshell, its WoW, Minecraft edition. The game has so much potential as far as more multiplayer features such as PvP or giant raids on bosses for loot. Everything you get in the game Is relatively satisfying as well. So far there are few gameplay options, but a ton of different variations of each such as different classes, loot, mounts, pets, building, and clubs. For only being around for roughly 3 months this game is phenomenally fun and I would recommend that anybody who enjoys MMOs should seriously try it out. Another very critical aspect of this game's community is the customer/gameplay support. They respond very fast and almost seem as if they weren't 100% copied from a bot who really couldn't give a #@%$. I hope Glyph continues what they do for I see this game becoming a huge success for MMO fans everywhere. Verdict: 93/100 - Crazy awesome potential and can and will play for hours.","October 17, 2015","true","115.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was also the THIRD. I arrived at my grandma's house at 3:33. She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: "Be right there!"- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: "If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!" I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.\n\n\nSo, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house.\nthen at three oclock three of my cousins came to pick me up in three cars and it took them three knocks to the head to wake me up at three oclock in the morning. I woke up and had three weet bix and three spoons of sugar, then i went to school three boys approached me at three end of school, they said "HEY GEDDOH I KNOW DIS DUDE ITS DA SAME YONG ♥♥♥♥♥ DAT KICK US OUT OF SCHOOL" all three of them looked me in the eye with three forks EACH!. Fools tried to stab me i socked them in the eyelids (SMACK SMACK SMACK) pulled out my shank and shanked all three of them three times alarming three students beside me i shank all three of them then take three steps to three teachers that were also alarmed(and armed) teacher number one tried to punch me three times as i dodged him three times stab them all three times with the edge of ma shank\n\n\n(RYME TIME!)\nSMOOTH MOOVE!

It also has really amazing character customization options, as well as the ability to make your gear look like other items of the same type, so if you like the stats, but not the look, you can get the stats and a better looking item at the same time. This game also becomes difficult. From the beginning, the game doesn't hold your hand, the most tutorial you get is a text box in the top right of the screen, which allows the player to roam free until they wish to do the thing the box tells them to. Another thing this game does well is the dungeons. The dungeons in the first few level worlds are very short and simple, very easy to complete, and still overall very enjoyable. When you get to the harder dungeons, however, is when they really start to be interesting. The dungeons have very creative designs, and because of the many different types of enemies, there are many different types of dungeons. In each biome, there's a large dungeon, which is harder and longer, but provides better loot.\n\nThis game, does however, have it's flaws, as any game will. While the crafting ui was very easy to use and it works well, gathering the materials to craft things is very VERY time consuming. For example, I have a club world for my friends and I that has a sea of deep regret, which kills you when you touch it. But I wanted to put another biome in place of that. I then gathered enough resources to build a terraformer crafting station, which requires 75 infinium. Infinium is very rare, at least it was at the point in the game I was at. I crafted it, and then realized that I had only crafted the STATION. I still had to gather more ingredients for the actual terraformers. So I figured I'd start looking at the recipes and found out that for ONE TERRAFORMER to create ONE BIOME I needed THREE HUNDRED INFINIUM. It took me about an hour to gather 75 infinium, why did I still need that much more?\n\nBut this game is overall very enjoyable, with good dungeon-based gameplay, good loot that can be customized to look like better looking loot, good character options, and a very good club system, which is similar to guilds in WoW. If you're a fan of MMORPG's this game is definitely worth your time, especially because I don't even tend to like MMOs and still enjoy this a lot. And before I forget, I must say that I am a robot pirate captain with a squirrel on my head, a monocle on my face, a gun that looks like a pirate hook, and a mount that just happens to be a velociraptor, AND a house that slightly resembles McDonald's. This game is really freaking awesome.","July 12, 2015","true","108.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The game has a pretty awful queue time right now. Expect to wait around 30 minutes or more if you're unlucky.\nOnce in the game it can have some pretty wild lag spikes and very often you have the familiar minecraft block lag.\nThe community side of the game is... weird.\nIt's like it's an MMORPG without any of the expected features, such as different chat tabs (you have to manually write in commands).\nSure, it is a lot like Minecraft, and a lot of people would expect nothing more from this kinda game, but it just feels very out of place this time.\nI spent almost an hour looking for a club to join, but I was very confused with what a club was and how I would join a club. I asked around, and no one answered. I got my answers (sorta) from wikis, tried to contact several club members and still failed to join a club.\n\nConclusion: Pretty sweet little game, but is seriously crippled when it comes to community management... or whatever you'd call it. Still I'll recommend it, 'cause it's free and I'm too damn nice for my own god damn good.","July 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a free game. Yes, it does have micro-transactions (shock horror, the developers need money for their work) but the balance is extremely well executed and my temptations to make inigame purchases have mainly been due to the fact that I feel a little guilty for playing such a great game for free. The battle system is thought out and very playable, and the build mechanics are just about perfect. Personally I quite like the art style but I'll admit it's not the prettiest pear in the basket. The co-op is great fun and fluid and I'm quite looking forward to the upcoming pvp arena. Overall this game is free and what are you waiting for?

You level up gain better gear do harder dungeons and raids, and the big advantage here is that its really easy to get into and play with others.\n3)The loot is shared/instanced and i mean all of it, even while mining! This ofcouse makes team play even more fun, and people go on mining togheter, doing dungeons etc...\n4)Crafting progress - The game has 3 proffesions you can progress with ( runecrafting / Ringcrafting / Gardening ), and probably more to come.\n5) Building - I never got into minecraft but from watching youtube videos about it and comparing to this game i think they are on the same level at the least.\n6) Its size is really small!

So I'll go over the Pros and Cons with you and what I also expect to change;\n\nPROS:\n+11 classes to choose from, all varying in playstyle, appearance and feel.\n+Easy to switch classes on the fly, no need for alt characters and all levels contribute to mastery level which is just another bar entirely to get more stuff and cosmetics for your account\n+Arcade like feel that is incredibly light hearted and doesn't take itself seriously\n+The Cash shop is not p2w but Cosmetics that are key. Almost all cosmetics can be traded with one another. The only thing that can't be bought with the free in game money or traded is Chest slots, which could also be bought using free credits from the mastery system (But honestly if you know what you're doing and know how to get around that Chest slots aren't needed anyway)\n+Constantly updated with content and events\n+Content is also easily digestible in bite sized pieces. You can play for about an hour and feel like you're not missing much\n+Each class is designed for soloing in mind\n\nCONS:\n-As of recently the Dragon event has kind of broken the player Economy of using Flux by making 20 minute challenges on the hour drop caches that have insane amount of flux and eyes. It's manageable still but it has significantly skyrocketted prices\n-This was also bound to happen because aside from upgrading Flux is near worthless for anything else. It needs to be added to more recipes\n-Classes do not have much variation within their own class, for example; there's no way to make anything other than a tanky Tomb Raiser that's any good. So every class has a predetermined set up of allies and emblems that will work the best for them\n-The grind is real, if you want to access the "end game" content, which is U5-U6 Shadow Arenas and worlds; you will have to grind for a lot of flux and hope for Twice forged+ souls. And Penta Souls, which is the last things you need to upgrade your gear to max shadow to make radiant only ever seem to drop from the challenge caches.\n-Servers are still a bit wonky from the initial steam release. Queue times are a bit much from everybody logging in at once. This is to be a bit expected as before last week we didn't even have any other servers save for NA.\n-Because there's no fixed economy things fluctuate from person to person. What's worth 1k to one person may be worth 3-4k to another. Naturally this just involves a bit of patience and bartering as well as watching prices.\n\nOverall, Developes have expressed concerns for the Servers, the flux crash as well as the overarching content and they are working round the clock to try and make things right. Avarem has an ear for the community and usually listens to people's qualms and complaints.\n\nTL;DR it has a few kinks to work out but it's a very free and fair game and don't expect this review to always be like this","July 11, 2015","true","57.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrozenGreed/recommended/304050/","FrozenGreed","Greed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrozenGreed/","250 products in account","This game is at its base, a dungeon fighter. you go from place to place finding dungeon in an open world to go through and fight. Some are small and simple, others are large and complex, at the end of them you fight a boss and collect loot from a chest which you can equipt to your player. there are many biomes and each has their own items, dungeons, enemies, and terrain.\n\nAs of writing this there are 11 classes and you get two at the start of playing, the knight class, and one of your picking out of all but three classes. All items can be obtained without buying anything in the game, either by saving up cubits (the games free credit that you earn by playing daily or by doing quests) or by trading with other players (mainly using flux, the game's main upgrade meterial)\n\nThe game, while looking like most voxel based games feels unlike many. The closest thing I could compare it to is Cube World and that's still in beta and not updated very much(twice a year it seems), this game is updated quite a lot and have a decent support.\n\nIt is an MMO but it's easy to get with friends, playing with friends is easy and helpful, item-drops are client side so there is no item stealing like in other MMOs, there is to be a PvP added in the steam release but i've not tried it so I can't say anything about it.\n\nEach class can be leveled up to level 20 but can have a higher level depending on the gear they have on, they can all be bought with cubits meaning you can get any and all without paying a dime. There are multiple "portals" to diffrent worlds based on a classes level, novice for 1-3, adept for 4-5 expert for 6-7 and master 8-10, after which there are 6 uber portals made as a hard mode, each world increases the amount of biomes as well as dropping better items.\n\nAnother feature is the mastery system. For every 100 mastery points you get you gain a mastery (this never changes), which also gives you bonuses such as added health, damage, items, gear, and even Credits (the games paid cedits). Once at mastery 30 you can do missons that will give you items boxes,(the type of boxes will change over time) and everything out of them is good, trust me. The max mastery is 200 as of now.\n\nThe ways to get mastery points is pretty much anything but to name a few; collecting items you don't already have, leveling up, getting new pets and mounts, fishing new fish, and much more.\n\nOne more thing i'd like to add is is once you get to uber worlds you can start doing shadow arenas. these are hard but very rewarding, giving you top gear once beating them, to get into them you must use a shadow key at a shadow shrine which you can craft by getting enough shaddow gems and key key fragments, each uber world will have a harder shadow arena and a team is recommended (everyone gets a share of the win so don't worry about that)\n\nThat's all, have fun and good Luck, My ingame Name is FrozenGreed if'd you like to add me.\n\nalso if you found this useful and try out trove, it'd help me a lot if you use this code when you sign up X9ED7C9WWQQKR3DJPH3Y","July 9, 2015","true","130.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've seen the game progress in deveolopment, and can happily say that I am more than content with what it is today.\n\nTrove is, in my eyes, an Adventuring Game with an emphasis on Collection.  Collect mounts, boats, sails, allies, weapons, styles, hats, masks, classes, and materials.   Trove offers Runecrafting, Farming, Building, and Ring-forging for activities other than killing things.   Trove obviously draws inspiration from Zelda, and old-school dungeon crawlers.\n\nThe game is a solid experience, even without paying a dime, which is hard to find for an MMO these days, especially a Free-to-Play one.\n\nI reccomend giving trove a try, it's a VERY small download, and it's free.  If you decide you like it, hit me up in game and I'll be happy to help get you started.

Lemme Explain\n\nThe dungeon system may be a little repetitive but its worth it because the loot you gain from it pushes you to go on and see and do more dungeons,\nThe areas/biomes are great in the way it differs with the ore and items and even enimes found there. Some have a happy atmosphere and others have a gloomy atomsphere, it make for all the better adventuring\nThis game is great when it comes to Co/op and playing with friends, being able to make a club world,and a friend club helps  you communicate and have a good time with them.\nLeveling feels odd in the way its stacked, I'm a big fan of it, yet it still feels a bit odd.\nCombat does feel like spam clicking at times, but being able to use abilites help out (despite only being able to use 2, if you count the M2 ability)\n\nOver all this game is a blast!

So I'll go over the Pros and Cons with you and what I also expect to change;\n\nPROS:\n+11 classes to choose from, all varying in playstyle, appearance and feel.\n+Easy to switch classes on the fly, no need for alt characters and all levels contribute to mastery level which is just another bar entirely to get more stuff and cosmetics for your account\n+Arcade like feel that is incredibly light hearted and doesn't take itself seriously\n+The Cash shop is not p2w but Cosmetics that are key. Almost all cosmetics can be traded with one another. The only thing that can't be bought with the free in game money or traded is Chest slots, which could also be bought using free credits from the mastery system (But honestly if you know what you're doing and know how to get around that Chest slots aren't needed anyway)\n+Constantly updated with content and events\n+Content is also easily digestible in bite sized pieces. You can play for about an hour and feel like you're not missing much\n+Each class is designed for soloing in mind\n\nCONS:\n-As of recently the Dragon event has kind of broken the player Economy of using Flux by making 20 minute challenges on the hour drop caches that have insane amount of flux and eyes. It's manageable still but it has significantly skyrocketted prices\n-This was also bound to happen because aside from upgrading Flux is near worthless for anything else. It needs to be added to more recipes\n-Classes do not have much variation within their own class, for example; there's no way to make anything other than a tanky Tomb Raiser that's any good. So every class has a predetermined set up of allies and emblems that will work the best for them\n-The grind is real, if you want to access the "end game" content, which is U5-U6 Shadow Arenas and worlds; you will have to grind for a lot of flux and hope for Twice forged+ souls. And Penta Souls, which is the last things you need to upgrade your gear to max shadow to make radiant only ever seem to drop from the challenge caches.\n-Servers are still a bit wonky from the initial steam release. Queue times are a bit much from everybody logging in at once. This is to be a bit expected as before last week we didn't even have any other servers save for NA.\n-Because there's no fixed economy things fluctuate from person to person. What's worth 1k to one person may be worth 3-4k to another. Naturally this just involves a bit of patience and bartering as well as watching prices.\n\nOverall, Developes have expressed concerns for the Servers, the flux crash as well as the overarching content and they are working round the clock to try and make things right. Avarem has an ear for the community and usually listens to people's qualms and complaints.\n\nTL;DR it has a few kinks to work out but it's a very free and fair game and don't expect this review to always be like this","July 11, 2015","true","57.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hadn't been following this, heard of it, or anything like that. I opened steam, saw it, saw it was free, right amount of boredom, and gave it a shot thinking I was about to play yet another take on Minecraft that'll entertain me for an hour or two before moving on. Here I am a day later waiting in an hour queue on a Monday morning just to play this game. If only it wasn't summer and kids were still in school... :D\n\nPros:\n- Excellent class/battle/dungeon/rpg system\n- I'm a ninja, and it plays.. like a ninja. Plenty of cool classes to pick from.\n- Although I don't ever use it, I started off with a mount.\n- Love the item/craft system. I'm only lvl 7 or so and I've already found so many random, unique item drops.\n- Break down items to obtain its style so you can always have what you thought looked the coolest\n- Neat house/cornerstone system. Bring your house wherever your adventures take you.\n- It's free.\n\nCons:\n- Waiting in a queue to play (Not a big deal, but it's hard to find something wrong with the game so far)","July 13, 2015","true","68.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You level up gain better gear do harder dungeons and raids, and the big advantage here is that its really easy to get into and play with others.\n3)The loot is shared/instanced and i mean all of it, even while mining! This ofcouse makes team play even more fun, and people go on mining togheter, doing dungeons etc...\n4)Crafting progress - The game has 3 proffesions you can progress with ( runecrafting / Ringcrafting / Gardening ), and probably more to come.\n5) Building - I never got into minecraft but from watching youtube videos about it and comparing to this game i think they are on the same level at the least.\n6) Its size is really small!

Just wish they made a character, or class, where its skills heal, shield, or give boosts to itself and allies around, but thats what emblems are for. Since I am one who loves playing support characters, I would love this game more if they had one on what I just said before, At first glance, I thought it was going to suck, and that was going to be childish but nah, its great. Plays over 103 hours on this game and have not regret it. Just hoping they will come up with an update where you can do PvP; whether it be 1v1 or club v club.

It still lacks that energy that will leave players hanging on and keep playing. Trove has expanded a lot since the pre-alpha stages, in terms of its UI, game mechanics, classes, and open-world generation. The character classes has adopted the same style as Firefall, where all the classes can be earned by collecting the Cubits (daily-earned currency) and redeeming them. If you're those who loves to collect the collectibles, maybe this game is good for you to continue in search of the items.\n\nWhat's interesting behind the leveling system in Trove is that, the max Level that can be leveled is Level 20. But to move beyond Level 20, you need to obtain Shadow items, refining it, to further increase this capped level. Where maybe things starts to quite grinding as it goes further. Nevertheless it's not just about the leveling, but there is also Mastery system, where each items you collected or actions you have done in Trove accumulates into this system. So it is beneficial to focus on Mastery first.\n\nTrove has a marvellous open-world generation, that you continue to explore the Uber-worlds. I'm sure none of the worlds are similiar in any sense, since it's a mega world with various biomes merged together. Besides fighting dungeon, you can also actively participate in the Club or Cornerstone, architectural building of blocks. Some of the creative worlds can be seen in forums, like Mario World or Pokemon's Pallet Town. Trove also been always very active in their server maintenance, every Tuesday. They have come out with numerous events and limited period items that allows players to hunt and collect these items.\n\nFor network wise, it is still playable for Asian players. Although you will experience a little bit of slow response in preloading of objects. Especially Trove sends objects in chunk that loads the next few segments of land, that is in your camera view. This is very adaptive, as Trove adopts the world generation feature. Similarly for dungeon when it comes to boss-battle, it is preloads it for just that instance, so don't worry about dying out.","October 27, 2015","true","196.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a wonderful but horrible game. It has SO much potential, but it really ruined the game with the simple grind system it has.\n\nWhen I first downloaded the game, I thought it was going to be one of these pay 2 win mmorpgs. I was right, however there was a whole another level where it failed. Well I'll first start off when you go in the game. You are given a class token which you can unlock any given class in the game. Getting to the good part, the classes are pretty neat, like the boomeranger can use boomerangs to stun their enemies and finish them off with a bomb of rabid chickens. Yeah... The graphics are great since many computers can run this game and my friend with a really low-tier computer can run this game 60 fps no problem.\n\nNow..getting to the bad parts.\n\nWell, this game has a HORRIBLE GRINDING MECHANIC. IT MAKES ME SO MAD HOW MUCH POTENTIAL THIS  GAME HAD BUT THEY RUINED IT BY IMPLEMENTING THIS. To further explain this mechanic, the whole game is just going into dungeons and going back out. You might think this, hey these dungeons are pretty cool maybe their like the ones in World of Warcraft where you go in do a couple inside the dungeon and beat these huge npcs! Well...no World of Warcraft...is World of Warcraft.  Trove...is well ♥♥♥♥. The dungeons are literally killing mobs and killing the boss over and over and over again. THERE ISNT EVEN A TON OF VARIETY WITH THESE DUNGEONS ITS LITERALLY ALMOST THE SAME EXACT THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\n\nThe game is fun for a while and exploring the new biomes in dungeons and the occasional shadow dungeon which is rly fun. But after 3 hours of playing the game.... its ♥♥♥♥. But is there any quests? No...cuz its ♥♥♥♥. How can there be no quests??? Cuz its ♥♥♥♥. But its free isn't it? Well yeah...but its pay to play, if you want to be really good. Flasks that are in the game give you these over powered powers like getting health off hurting a enemy or giving a shield that makes you invincible for a long time.\n\nNow....for the spells. Most of the classes that have spells only have 3 SPELLS. 3 SPELLS. AND THE OTHER 2 CLASSES HAVE 4 SPELLS....THATS HOW SIMPLE THIS GAME IS. Now if you want to play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for yourself, go ahead its free and you can feel the pain I had when playing this game.\n\nUntil the developers add quests, more variety and things to do in this game I will not recommend this game... at all.\n\nPlease don't even waste space for this game until its fixed and in the meantime invest your money in a good mmorpg,\nH3X","February 10","false","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is very social, you can play with a group of friends each taking a different class, or even solo if you like to. The pixel graphics are no problem at all, and even if you reach the maximum level there's still an unending amount of goals you can reach! The best thing about this game is that, even though there are missions to complete, you make your own goals! You can decide to do whatever you want and be whatever you want, you can be a strong solo tank who can also work with a group or a support ice sage which people will want you to help them. There are an unlimited amount of possibilities on this game! The most amazing part of this game is the social interaction, you can join different chats for every subject e.g. you can use '/join trade' to join the trade chat if you wanna buy or sell something! The game has a large community of players which are all friendly! If you decide to play this game, i hope you enjoy your experience as much as i have","July 27, 2015","true","136.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
