This means if you find a cool location, you can tell others where it is. They'll be able to find, see and experience it themselves.\n\nIt is  turn-based (huge + for those like me that suffer from tendonitis (carpal tunnel syndrome)).\n\nThe world is infinite -- really!  No caps on level, and no 'end of the world' to fall off of or bump into.\n\nIt has permadeath - only way I play.\n\nVery active developer, updates are released frequently, along with new features.\n\nThere are certainly more I have not listed here.\n\nI highly recommend giving it a try\n","May 5, 2014","true","843.8"," 92 of 106 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","92","106","0","5"

I'm a great fan of RPG's and roguelikes and Malevolence definately scratches both\nitches. I also love when games are unpredictable and you don't know what to expect on\neach playthrough.\n\nThe game is very old school with some innovative modern touches, the world all\nthe players play in is truly infinte with each player adventuring in the same version\nof the world but discovering areas other players haven't been to yet. When players\ndiscover new areas with online functionality it's possible to claim locations so if other players adventure to the same place it will say who claimed the location. Other online functions are planned and the game has a great community sharing gameplay experiences and finds.\n\nAll the loot, quests, dungeons and the world are procedurally generated but the dungeons and world are the same for everyone once an area as been discovered so if players find really cool/difficult dungeons they can share the coordinates and challenge others to clear the dungeon.\n\nTravel in such a vast world is by Griffon and once players have enough gold they can leave the starting area and explore freely going to places far away that have not been discovered by anyone else.\n\nSomething else I love about the game is the emergent nature, things just seem to happen to throw spanners in the works and problem solving is often required to complete a quest or dungeon.\n\nThe best way to play is permadeath with the gamma turned to zero so the dungeons are truly very dark and torches are essential. With the lights down low exploring can be very intense and I find myself getting drawn into the game. Permadeath also means your name is entered onto the leaderboard so others can see how your adventures are going.\n\nFinally I have to mention the dev team who are the icing on an already delicious cake, updates come frequently and the forums are a hotbed of ideas and player posted challenges which will only grow as the games audience widens. I've seen the game progress from a basic dungeon crawl to something very special indeed and if you value fantastic gameplay and love retro rpg graphics and enjoyed the golden age of RPG gaming then perhaps Malevolence is for you.\n\nI certainly recommend it and wish it all the luck in the world as it goes live on Steam.","May 6, 2014","true","122.4"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","57","64","0","0"

While you will never see another person in the game with you, if you are online while playing the game you will be able to interact with other players in a number of ways, for example the permadeath ladder where you can compete against other permadeath players, the claiming system where each major part of the world (Such as cities, dungeons and so on) can be claimed, and upon other players visiting that spot, they will see that you were there first.\nSome online functionality is even a bit more secretive and should be discovered in-game.\n\nThe combat is turn based and gives the player the option of using melee, bows or spells, or mixing them to make a more balanced character.\nThe equipment is procedurally generated, not just the looks of weapons but also effects and values of armor, weapons and spells.\n\nAside from that there is an array of quest types (The quest system is still being expanded upon), special epic loot for those that brave the deepest of dungeons and take on the dungeon boss, various guilds to join and much else.","May 6, 2014","true","37.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

I grew up playing the old ones- I think the first might have been Wizardry 1 on my Apple IIc iirc.  Malevolence has the feel of those games but it really isn't one of those games.  Ultimately, for me at least, the core being of Malevolence is that it is infinite and has an infinite number of ways to kill you.  In almost all cases I abhor scaling in RPG's but it works for Malevolence- in fact there is really no other way it could work that I can think of.\n\nI heartily recommend this game for anyone who relishes a challenge that could potentially never end.  I really, really like this game despite some of the bugs that exist now (none of them show stopping for me).  Alex has done a tremendous job and continues to develop and support a labor of love.\n\nThis is not a 'AAA' title and that is for the best.  So if you are looking for infinite Oblivion/Skyrim this is not it.  Malevolence is it's own beast and doesn't make any allusions to being something it is not.\n\nProst!","May 11, 2014","true","26.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

That was around 2 years ago and I gotta say that this game has made incredible progress in that time. The game is in a finished beta state, fully playable and totally infinitely huge, actually beyond huge, there is no limit. There are unlimited locations to explore, no level cap, I cannot express how much I really enjoy this game. And to think it was thought up and created by one man, with help from a select bunch of testers. The game is amazing and definately worth the money, if in doubt try the demo first. Now this isnt graphically superior, or story rich, but it is definately engaging and will keep one playing a lifetime if they wish. Currently I just bought the Steam version of the game and it displays something like 12 hours played, but that is in 2 days. I have easilly spent 200+ hours since my initial purchace and I am not ever bored, level up, re-gear, go fight more mobs. There is a difficulty scaling and certain dungeons are just more difficult than others, too tough? Go fight a different place. There is no lack of dungeons.

If you have a valid argument against what I say here, leave it in the comments. When you blindly mark reviews down it discredits reviews that would have otherwised helped somebody.\n\n\nThere was a TON of potential in this game, but the creator's vision is flawed. I'm walking through a town and I can't even see the wall at the end of an alleyway because the render distance is so small. They've said it needs to be that way in order to do this and that, but it really just ruins the immersion. They sacrificed many potential gameplay options in order to pay "homage to the 90s era FPRPGs."\nOlder RPGs are great. They have depth and variety, unlike the current games that pander to the lowest common denominator. The creators should have taken these great old things(which they did), and make a game with a current engine that could also support enhanced gameplay.\nLong story short, there have been improvements and detriments to gaming, and I thought this game was going to take the great parts of both eras and make a game as deep as they used to be while improving by way of using modern technology.\nbtw- Most of the things they say they are missing because the game is "a homage," are actually missing because their engine(which runs poorly because they chose a larger world over improved gameplay) can't handle it. Or because they simply won't put in the time to implement them(and keep in mind this game got like 500+% of the funding they originally asked for, so that is an unacceptable excuse).\n\n\nI wanted to like this very badly, but I just can't. If you want to play a game that plays and feels like it's from decades ago, get an actual one from decades ago(legitamate advice, those games are great). This (sometimes even intentionally)fails to improve on those ones, so there is no point in spending your money on it.

I want to make it very clear I have played only enough to make sure that it worked on my old computer. That was in the first half of last year.\n\nI waited to start a playthrough of the game until the update adding those major systems was released, as in my estimation the procedural bosses and magic system were a huge part of this procedural game. I have not started a playthrough yet, as these features have not been released to Steam's early access players yet and are only available to certain community individuals. (I am unclear as to which individuals were granted access; it is my understanding that there is a separate community elsewhere, started earlier, that has some sort of EARLY early access).\n\nCommunication with the Steam community is filtered through a small group of elite testers / community members that are also the only ones with access to the current beta. I purchased the game with the understanding that I'd have early access to the content that is published as being worked on, but instead it is only available for private testing. Please do not mistake the large number of news posts listed as being updates that have been made to the version on Steam.\n\nAccording to the folks that are in communication with the developer, as soon as those with access to the beta have finished testing it, we'll have access to the stuff they've already tested. I have no reason to doubt this.\n\nI can not recommend this game as an early access purchase because it is not clear to purchasers that content added to the beta will not be made available to all early access purchasers. Based on Steam's "Yes / No" recommendation system, I must mark it as a "No." I firmly believe this game will be worth purchasing in its final version, but I do not recommend purchasing this as an early access title, due to the limited beta access given with purchase.","January 15","false","0.5"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","5"

Keep that in mind.  Even at this early stage, the game is incredibly fun.  It's a first-person roguelike set in an effectively infinite procedurally generated world.  Although the world is not regenerated every time you play, the fact is that the size of the world means that you'll never run out of unique lands and dugneons to explore.  Gameplay is actually relatively simple.  But because there's no tutorial, and a lot is left to the player to figure out for himself, it can be frustrating until some things 'click'.\n\nThe game doesn't have any true classes, but you'll differentiate yourself based on how you kill monsters, and the spells that you cast,  the traps that you disarm, as well as, by your gear.\n\nAt this stage, the game only has a few different kinds of monsters, a few different kinds of quests, 2 kinds of dungeon themes a couple of minigames (one for removing traps, another for gambling at the tavern) and a number of different facilities in towns you'll visit (including shops, temples, a fighters guild, mages guild and Thieve's guild and two different kinds of fast transports.\n\nIn spite of the incomplete nature of the game, and a few bugs (including some stability issues), the game is very fun to play.  I find myself wanting to just see if I can get to the next level, clear out al of the monsters on my current dungeon floor, or kill just one more goblin or imp in order to complete a quest.

When I say infinite, the world is literally infinite, infinite towns, infinite dungeons, infinite quests, infinite dungeons and so on and so forth something that has never truly been done before. I have always wanted an RPG that ends only when I decide it is time to stop playing and I love the fact and idea of just getting lost in a world and go to places that nobody else has ever been to.\n\nThe game has a feature where players can claim locations, where if you are the first person to find a location you are forever known as the first person to ever discover that location. Dungeon can contain a total number of anything from 1 to 10 floors, with the further into a dungeon you go the more dangerous and tough it becomes but the better the rewards are with each dungeon containing a mega chest at the end with powerful goodies in it. I find it one of the most addictive games I have played in years with it just being a case of one more floor or one more quest and what feels like only 5 minutes turns out to be actually several hours later.\n\nIt is currently in Early Access and in Beta stage of developement, but despite that it is amazing stable. Never before have a played a game in Beta as stable as this is. There are still a lot more features to be implemented into the game and if the game is as addictive at this stage, come V1.0, I might as well kiss my social life goodbye.

I'd ONLY recommend getting the game if you have a pretty good gaming PC.\n\nGraphics: Not state of the art by any means, but stay true to what exactly the developers are trying to achieve with this game.\nFor people with older/less expensive PCs there is a low detail mode, which I can't say I really like the look of, but at least it's there.\n\nSound: Fantastic music; especially the piece in the loading screens while waiting to enter towns. The sound effects also stay true to the feel of the game and sound similar to what you'd expect in the 90s. You'll hear monsters grunt and groan as you make your way through dungeons and it really adds to the atmposhere of the dungeons.\n\nGameplay: Turn based. Each map is marked by a squared grid. Each movement uses a turn. Pretty simplistic, and really easy to pick up and play.\n\nDungeons: By far the best part of the game; this is what the game is all about after all. The dungeons are dark and eerie, requiring a lit torch to see where you're going. They range from small narrow corridors with many twists and turns to great halls filled with pillars. The dungeons of Ahkranox are also incredibly dangerous. You're never too far from some sort of monster, or even worse, a trap!\nYes, traps play a big part in the dungeons. They range from explosion and poison traps to boulders and spikes, and if you're not careful, they just might be what kills you. When a trap is in your vicinity, your purple gem will glow and you can search by clicking in front of you and attempt to disarm it.\nMonsters also require some thought as to how you'll approach them. You'll hear their groans and when you get close your green gem will glow. Whilst combat is simple, it still requires some thought. You know the monster is there, but can't always see whether it's only a little imp or a man stomping ogre.\nDungeons also have secret passages which are indicated by your red gem glowing. You just simply click the correct wall and it opens up.\n\nLoot: There is tons of loot in this game. From new weapons to books to potions to troll pubes. (or something like that)\nLoot can be found both outside dungeons and inside. It can be obtained from barrels, chests, crates, monsters, urns, tables, and so on. As for monsters, you'll often debate whether or not the loot is worth the risk.\n\nDifficulty: Malevolence is an incredibly difficult game overall. However, it is only really as difficult as you make it for yourself.\nEverything comes down to being prepared, forward thinking, being careful and knowing when you're beaten. You really are your own worst enemy in this game.\n\nPermadeath and Leaderboards: By selecting permadeath, your save data is deleted when you die. (obviously) But when you play a permadeath character, there's a chance that if you can survive long enough to reach a certain level, that you'll make the leaderboards.\n\nLand Claiming: Any time you find a new area you can hit f11 and see who who discovered the area first, or claim any already unclaimed land. The world is infinite, so there's always a chance that you can put your own name to something.\n\nIn short: If you're looking for an immersive, challenging dungeon crawler with a retro feel, this is it. It's already fantastic to play and can only get better with time. :)","August 24, 2014","true","27.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The meaning behind everything is ultimately up to the player. As a result, the world may feel a little emptier, but to me it feels more mysterious and makes me feel more alone and free.

However, expect...\n- Badly scaled monsters, due to monster difficulty being decided by your current area and your level rather than spawn location (you can kill monsters by running back to outside the town gates and then just blocking all monster hits)\n- Long load times (There's a music jingle that plays if you enter a town... only once it actually ends you can play again... the jingle is about 30 seconds long, I think)\n- More loading (overworld is divided into 20x20 grid sections. Or 25x25. Whenever you enter a new section... the game has to load. So when you're travelling from A to B, or just exploring, you'll constantly be pulled out of your immersion)\n- Bad graphics ("you might have to tweak them to get a good result" = don't buy unless your monitor's native resolution is 1024x768 or 1440x900 - because otherwise, game will look bad. Especially trees.)\n- Bad viewrange (~20 tiles, or about 100 meters). You know how there's towers and castles in this game? Yeah, well, you can 't see them until they're in a section next to your section. Meaning that if a castle takes up most of a section, you can't see it until you're 25-30 tiles away from it (about 125 meters). So when you cross a section border, POOF castle.\n- NO in-game tutorial. There's one on the menu, but it's easily missed as it's at the bottom of the screen, far away from "continue game" and "new game". What do the gems mean? You don't know, nobody tells you and without knowing that you will DIE. Red = secret area, green = monster, purple = "important object". Which is a town, a dungeon, or a trap. Oh yeah. To exit a dungeon, step off the exit tile, look at it from an adjacent tile, AND CLICK THE LADDER/TRAPDOOR. Again, this had to be looked up online, after I fled from a monster, and found out that I'd easily have been able to escape, but because I was now pinned to the exit tile, I couldn't. Because my character can't stick his arms straight up to pull a ladder down.\n\nIn short:\n- You don't get much information\n- The game is hard because you don't get much information, not because of there actually being things you have to overcome.\nHowever, if you don't find the above listed issues a problem, then this could be a game for you. Because of the game does deliver on the things it promises.","May 11, 2014","false","7.1"," 38 of 67 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","38","67","0","12"

But as someone who has been following its production for years since the Kickstarter, any fans of Legend of Grimrock (or its grid-based predecessors) owe it to themselves to check this out.  It feels instantly familiar--in no small part because it follows first-person grid-based RPG conventions in expected ways.  But the Roguelike element of its procedurally generated worlds makes this essentially the first game of its kind since Dungeon Hack(!), and Ahkranox has an overworld as well as dungeons to explore.\n\nThis game almost feels like a potential alternate development path for the Elder Scrolls series; like if Bethesda had made Daggerfall and said "hmm, we cannot keep making these enormous game worlds with better technology...I know!  We will have the COMPUTER make them!"  So yes, this game is kind of like Indie Roguelike Morrowind, which is indeed praiseworthy.\n\nNow, of course, about the 0-person team thing--the art and sound quality is pretty uneven for this reason.  But if you are playing games because you love them, not because you want to be impressed by the money that went into them, then you can likely overlook this.\n\nBesides, in some ways it instantly takes me back to my own gaming childhood to hear my character spouting hokey dialogue about the environment in a voice probably recorded with a cheap microphone in someone's basement.  But you can tell the person doing the dialogue was loving it, which still puts even the voice acting on par with some big-name games from even 10 years ago!","March 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

This is also a great game for those of you who like to read about the lore of the world with many great books you find while you adventure. This game will also appease those of you who like to loot horde and organize your inventory since there is a plethora of armor, weapons, ingredients, potions, & many other miscellaneous items.  This was made even better with the recent introduction of the infinite bank space to store all the loot you find.  I do have to note that this game can be extremely hard and unforgiving at times so the save function will be your friend since you will die many times.

It is that cool.","November 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

Some people would say ALPHA, but I don't care about this.\n\nI backed this game very early on Kickstarter. I liked the idea of an infinite world and the possibility to experience your own adventures. I started playing without the permadeath option, but turned this option on, once I understood how the game worked.\n\nWhy permadeath as an option, many people ask. Because a few people don't like permadeath, and for those this option was made. There are some features in the game even some upcoming features were it is essential to have this feature turned on.\n\nI like the game for the little things, the details, like the minigame to disarm physical / mechanical traps. The goblin dice game in the taverns, the statues in the dungeons ... nah I don't you that, you have to find that out for yourself.\n\nThe game is fantastic, but it will be even better, once you joined the great community behind it and met the awesome people who made this game possible. The story behind the game, the work, life, heart, sweat and effort put into this piece.\n\nThe lore (books) in this game and the music and sound effects are just amazing.\n\nYou will have banks in the next update, to store lorebooks, ingredients to craft potions, spells and enhace weapons.\n\n\n","January 18, 2015","true","151.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Sadly it is let down by the extrraordinary length of time the creator has taken to complete it. 12 months on, it is virtually no nearer to finishing than it was when it was first released as an early access game.\nMy advice would be to wait until it is completed, and to see reviews, before buying this game.","January 10, 2015","false","7.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","1"

Wait until they release "completed" version. There are numerous reasons already listed by other reviewers. Just barely playable and updates come once every few months.

You probably won't.\nThere's not much here really. I obviously misread the reviews because the online features are not there as of now.\nIn the sum it's a playable ALPHA like a proof of concept or something.\nAt the moment there is the exploration of dungeons, restocking in the city and repeat.\n\nGameplay is or will be a mix from Might and Magic turn-based RPGs like MM3 and Daggerfall (The Elder Scrolls 2)\nAll weapon or character portraits look awful even compared to those old games like they were made in MS paint. I hope those are placeholders. Loading screens are decently pretty (and loading takes long like the latest Might & Magic).\n\nThis might one day evolve into a (good) game but that's still far on the horizon.\n\nI will update this review in about a year or so.\n\nAs of now you should only buy if you want to support the devs, there's not much plying the game.","March 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

No, but there are few first person RPG's. This is why i recommend for M&M fans. First of all, the loadings takes a ethernity. Second, the character stats are very ambiguous. Thrid. The insta kill traps + ethernal loadings turns some quests very annoying. Mainly if you have to clear a dungeon and there are few enemies left in dungeon. All dungeons fells like the same in terms of design, but there are few first person RPG's. This is why i recommend the game.
