But is it worth it?\nWell, this one is a tough one.\nI'll tell you of my experiences and judgement and let you decide.\nAlso, I'll be featuring a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nFor the petrolheads: Don't expect a lot of depth into the cars, yes, it has a body designer, but to be fair, it's fairly simplistic, sure you can smack some bits (there aren't a lot, at all, i'm afraid, this is early access though, so it might change) onto premade shells which you can lengthen/shorten a bit, yknow, basic editing. The placement of stuff is wonky though, I've had a very hard time placing wheels for instance, and you have to tell it to mirror parts (err, since when are there asymmetrical cars? ANYWAYS...)\nYou can also "design" the car's chassis, engine and gearbox, although not much in depth. If you don't know jack sh*t about cars, don't worry, there's a fully automatic assist there to do the work for you, not like there's a lot of work though. For example: the engine designer, basically you can decide what sort of engine (inline 4? V8?) What fuel, and the emphasis and quality of the engine. That's it? Well yeah, pretty much.\n\nFor everyone: Soo what is this game about then? Automotive economy, my dear friend. If you're interested into the economics of selling cars, then this game is for you. You're basically the CEO, making the head decisions, with quite some micromanagement to have fun with. Be warned though, this game can be a pretty tough nut to crack and get started, since there's no tutorial, and the world of economics isn't really, y'know, not a place filled with people just hugging eachother, not even on easy mode. As far as I've seen it's pretty in depth with the market: where to build your company, how far to deliver, pricing (obviously), work environments,... Plenty of stuff to awaken your inner capitalist and earn some money.\n\ntl;dr: This game is more about economy, rather than designing cars, although there is some.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with the emphasis on car design, I'd sincerely suggest checking out Automation, which is in early access too, just not on Steam yet.\n\nConclusion: If you have some spare cash laying around and you like economy, and you like some cars: Then this game should give you a good bang for your buck. If you dislike economy though, you're honestly better off avoiding this game.","May 30, 2014","true","2.2"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","64","71","0","0"

If not, well still take a read, there are more to this game than meets the eye.\n\nMost tycoon games try to be simplistic to address a larger spectrum of buyers but not GearCity. Sure you could use the automated tools and have a great time but the details that the game allows you to dig through if you chose to manually design your engine, gearbox and chassis are uncommon to this genre of games and surely are a great addition.\n\nSimply put, GearCity is a turn-based tycoon where you have to design a category of car by designing three basic components: chassis, engine and gearbox. The development can be too detailed for some people as some other comments suggest but in a recent update a wizard system has been implemented that makes the game accessible to everyone. The game also provides a stock-exchange system, a detailed offer and demand by area, by city and best of all, a historically-correct model of the car industry.\nThis is not to say that the game is perfect yet, this is an early access with its bugs and crashes but I am optimistic this little gem is going to be on my list of all-time favorites.\n\nProsThe articles section of the magazine are my favorite part, where they write a report about your recent car. It needs a bit more textual variations but it is definitely my favorite part.\nDesigning the components in advanced mod is great fun, more so than designing the car itself. You can even get a license and just produce other cars.\nDetailed components description that are informative and not intrusive. The level of research in this game is nice.\nWorld map with major cities divided by continents with preferences to specific car-types while the cities have evolving population-count, personal income and demographics.\nHistorically-correct gameplay. After you learn the basics, take the long run and start a game from 1900. It won't be easy for historical reasons (material prices, low tech and low car demand). Also keep the Great Wars on if you dare...\nRacing section that allows you to put your best car or engine head-to head with the industry leaders. Don't expect cheering and stuff but it seems that the racing section also helps your research section which is an ingenious addition to the genre and a very realistic one.\nManaging your factories and branches on the map is really nice but slightly too hard to be done individually. Luckily it is on the list of things to receive a major makeover in the coming months.\nConsNo shortcuts. If after designing a dozen cars you just feel like skipping this one, well you won't.\nThere is still a lot of ironing to do especially regarding crashes and interface but the dev is really helpful and hard at work making this happen.\nClarifications about other CommentsThe comments about the hard parts are outdated, the recent update made an easier way to design components.\nWhile the game does crash randomly, it has a discreet autosave feature and it launches in less than 20 seconds on an average computer. While this is still not a good solution but it doesn't make the game unplayable. A hint is to always save after making a big change.\nIn ConclusionI have rarely been that sure about a game except in cases where it was about Civilization or Skyrim and those are big companies and the games have a lot of graphics while this is an indie with mostly numbers in misfit boxes. If that doesn't tell how impressive the core of this game is, nothing would.\n\nI will be updating this review as the game progresses.","January 30, 2015","true","31.5"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","49","49","0","1"

It is therefore safe to assume that I'm quite attached to this project and would recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the automotive industry, management games and simulations or - better yet - both of these fields!\n\nOf course, the presentation of GC may be considered somewhat old-fashioned or even obsolete by today's usual gamer crowd, but one would honestly have to ask, what could actually be improved? This IS a management simulation after all, should tables and menus be made 'prettier'? Would that add to the player's 'enjoyment'? I certainly believe it does not. Recent games that exhibited at least partial similarities, such as GameDev Tycoon, often feature simplified, cuddly, though arguably 'artsy' looks to mask what is essentially a very hollow gameplay 'husk'. GC is the polar opposite - it may not look like much, but it sure as hell has 'substance' - and that is what finally makes a good game and keeps players coming back. The designed vehicles themselves could surely be improved upon - but remember that this game was not funded at all for a long period of time, so concessions had to be made somewhere. The vehicle design is merely a 'gimmick' in current versions anyway and therefore not of great importance. Most elect to skip the design phase entirely - as this is, I would admit, the only point where the presentation fails and may certainly look 'cheap'. But do not let this keep you away from exploring this wonderful game further.\n\nThe gameplay itself, the fidelity of the economic simulation, the extent to which vehicles can be designed and customized are all aspects that other similar games (and probably the gaming industry in general) are severly lacking.\nAdd to to this the extensive and easy-to-use modding capabilities of the game (Want real company names and compete with Ford and Porsche? No problem, 5 minute job - Want to add new engine types, vehicle categories or your favorite racing series? No problem, done within minutes!) and you've got a real winner on your hands. It should also be mentioned that the games primary developer is almost constantly available on the official forums and open to any and all kinds of suggestions, many of which are actually implemented. Bugs that are reported are also fixed in a matter of days. Having bought a staggering amount of early access games in the past years, I honestly have to say that I have never before seen this type of commitment and responsiveness from any other developer and that alone should suffice as a reason to make this tiny contribution to such an outstanding project that stands out as a modern pinnacle of grown-up and sophisticated gaming in a sea of mediocre and forgettable games.\n\nRecommended 100%.","September 30, 2014","true","359.8"," 46 of 47 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","46","47","0","0"

There is a part of this experience that has to exist in your mind and imagination because its not gonna be shown in HD graphics. That being said, here is what I think of it:\n\nI am both an Auto Mechanic in real life, and just a general fan of mathematics and physics in general. This is the perfect type of game for me. I absolutely love the full control, you can chose to build a car with a single cylinder, 2stroke, dirtbike engine in to your tiny little sport car, or you can put a gigantic V12 in your work Van. There are no "invisible walls" here so to speak, this game allows you to make your company and your cars in literally any way you darn well feel like. The awesomeness of this concept... however... also makes the game quite hard. There is no handholding, your entirely on your own.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have ADHD, dont like reading and math, dont want to spend time learning a difficult learning curve, or you just simply dont have a very high IQ score (no offense, some people just arnt nerds like myself) then STAY AWAY, you will not like this game.\n\nIf you really love cars and engine design, and also love a good challange with ABSOLUTELY ZERO restrictions placed on the creativity of your mind in both Engineering choices and Marketing choices, you will love this game like I do. The dev is a single person who has put much love into this project. Give him some support guys. At this price, there is no reason not to click the buy button. Its totally worth it. I promise.

I love it.\n\nGear City is a game of rare complexity and strategic depth, that will apppeal to those of us  that enjoy both overseeing the big picture but also micromanaging the detail... there are plenty of spreadsheets and charts to mull over. I can see it staying on the hard drives of players of Civilisation, Football Manager, OOTP, EU4 amongst others, for a long time. I suspect it will also become a modders delight.\n\nThere is so much to consider, forget developing chassis, engines and gearboxes for a moment, even the way you visually design your car will make a difference, as a more aerodynamic shape and a smaller vehicle size will have an impact on your vehicle performance. You will need to balance design, marketing, sales, manufacturing and production and a multiplicity of models and marques tailored to your target markets.\n\nIt is unashamedly complex and as you come to grips with it, it can be roleplayed in many different ways. instead of building an economic juggernaut and driving the competion out of business, try building a prestige marque in a niche market and survive.\n\nThe designer is extraordinariliy (and I do mean exraordinarily) prompt and courteous to queries and suggestions in the forums. He might even sleep occasionally, though I can't confirm that.\n\nIt is still far from perfect, for example, screen navigation is clunky, necessary information can be difficult to access, reporting is insufficient and hardly a treat for the eyes, there are occasional system crashes.\n\nBut whilst still  in early access, and a diamond in the rough, it is nevertheless already recognisably a diamond.

There is a lot to like, but one of my favourite things is that you have so much freedom in terms of how you design the major components (chassis, engine, and gearbox). It's up to you whether you want to build a big V8 muscle car, or a compact 4 cylinder with a high revving engine.

My biggest concern is that the interface could be more streamlined and user-friendly.

The game even takes many major world events into consideration. (Which tend to impact your sales.)\n\nI could go on and on... Why am I telling you about Detroit?

You design a car with almost "Spore-like" graphics and the rest is a series of sliders and click options.

GearCity has brought back the joy of the classic car company tycoons (in particularly, the excellent Motor City which clearly inspired the creators of this game).\n\nI can't stop playing the game. It brings in all the concepts of car design - gearboxes, engines and chassis designs, coupled with the actual body design - and allows for that in depth nitpicking of details that were sorely missing in those old car company tycoon games. Those who played Motor City will remember how annoying it was to try and figure out what cylinders and how much HP they're looking for at any given time - well, no more. You can create the engine from scratch, define your desired HP, torque, displacement - everything! Then, make sure you get a tranny to match.. don't want a pickup tranny on a sports car engine...\nThe options are plentiful, the different designs are excellent...\n\nThe economic simulation is pretty good. There's hitches and glitchs and sometimes things happen that you're not really sure why (like having a high-quality Sedan selling for an inexpensive price in a high-demand area and getting below mediocre sales) but by and large it works well\n\nThe interface acts a little sticky sometimes and that's the only real complaint I have.

Why?\n\nBecause I love the possibility to micromanage many aspects, like the design of a new engine or complete vehicle or the monthly adjustments to get my production on pair with demand, but also the possibility to put some things on automatic, like the staff wage system, or use the big fast settings, like global pricing for some of my cars.\n\nThe game has many aspects one can but must not use, like the parts contract system. You can try and sell some licences of the engines, gearboxes, chassis or even complete vehicles you developed - or you can try and get a licence from another company for your own actions.\nBut you must not. It's optional and I actually don't use it because I don't like the idea somebody else using my great parts.\nSame goes for the stock market. You can gamble and try and make a Dollar or two - or you can sell your own stocks for quick money or even try and take a competitor over, getting all their parts, vehicles, designs and of course factories.\n\nAt the end it's obvious this is not a graphics blockbuster. The graphics are there to show you what's going on - and they fulfill this very well. The office changes as time developes with nice artwork and everything else is fine for what it should represent. I like this minimalistic and easy style in other games like Hearts of Iron, too.\n\n\nWhat basically made me write this review at the end of the day is not the game itself. It's the developer. He answers in his forums as well as here in detail and often on the same day, he invests time into his answers and even looks at uploaded savegames if there's a question or suggestion or bug report.\n\nI paid 11.99€ during a sale and I believe this is a very good price. If you're into this sort of games and if you like the game, even the normal full price is a steal for the amount of time you can sink into this game and the feeling you supported somebody who, at least that's my impression yet, deserves it.","January 8","true","238.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

So know you are getting an early access product. It is changing rapidly and your saves probably will not survive.  The UI needs some work, and is not as user friendly as it should be.  It is also a pretty niche game. If you liked Enlight Software's Capitalism series, you should like this. Don’t like spreadsheets or graphs in games?

This early release title doesn't have the annoying usual craptastic Early Release Curse of rampant bugs and a leftover taste in your mouth wreaking of ''unfinished title'' and ''Lackluster experience''.

You control a new start up from scratch, you pick a location, and you basically become the next big thing IF you are smart about it. Create full fledge vehicles from scratch. You are able to design everything from various bodies to low powered engines on through thousand horsepower monstrosities. You are given enough indicators to actively follow trends, set production lines, push and pimp your promotional duties, buy out other companies, play the stock market with other companys, open your company for bids, and even run your own race team.

As a player of both those sandboxy type games where you build things and tycoon games, the concept seemed irresistably attractive. About a week ago I saw this game pop up on steam and bought it.\n\nSo does GearCity live up to my dream-spawned ideal? In a lot of ways, yes it does.\n\nI'll get the problems out of the way before continuing, noting here that the game is currently in early access and hoping these problems will be resolved by further development. The U.I, although very thematic, is often clunky. Menus cover menus, reports must be shuffled through in order to gather the info you're after, etc etc. As far as I'm aware there is no 'favorites' or like system to make this less of an issue. The way menus and sliders behave is often also a bit tedious; closing if you move your mouse off the end on some, for example.\n\nThe vehicle customization at the moment is also a bit on the bare bones side. While you do have an excellent variety of techical features and resultant stats to play around with (probably all you can really want when it comes to how your car will work short of putting the thing together yourself like a construction toy) the actual process of modelling your vehicle is just that- modelling. Like getting a one-colour clay model, shaping it a little, and sticking little parts into it. A few minor improvements (such as the ability to paint on textures from a swatch) would really help out here. Another improvement would be the creation of an easy to use (ideally accessible from the vehicle creation screen) model exchange allowing you to download models when you can't be bothered to customize your own one but still want to sell a pretty car.\n\nThere are also bugs and occassional crashes, however this being an early-access build these are to be expected. In any case, most of the bugs are minor annoyances while you hardly lose any progress in the rare crashes provided you keep the default autosave frequency. Another minor annoyance is the high typo frequency and occassionally muddled grammar, but I'm sure this will be fixed easily enough.\n\nNow on to the good bits.\n\nOne of the most important things in a good tycoon game is market modelling- do the customers act realistically in it? What about your compeditors? Gearcity handles at least the customer side better than any other singleplayer game I've ever played, and does a fine job on compeditor AI too. Customers don't just pick the lowest priced car in a category- they respond to quality (with extra weight given to the most important attributes for the type of car), marketing and company reputations aswell. The only deficiency I'll pick out here is that the game enforces perfect competition pretty strictly- you can't, say, call up one of your compeditors and try to fix prices with them, but its a minor gripe given that most price fixing doesn't involve phone calls and this sort is perfectly possible within the game.\n\nIndeed the economics in this game is first-class through and through, with over a century of global changes in inflation and purchasing power modeled accurately. So accurately, in fact, that the big changes in the automotive industry such as outsourcing don't just happen deus ex machina but occur naturally in much the same manner they did historically- and you find yourself participating without even relising it! I'm not sure if the tax modelling is quite as good as it could have been; taxes don't seem to vary with the same historical fidelity as other variables (Was the trading income tax rate in Ireland in 1900 really 12.5%? I thought that started in 2003...) and I've found no evidence of tariff boundaries so far. However given the mountain of research already embedded in this game's economy, this is not a major issue.\n\nThat there exists an 'issue' of the Irish tax rate circa 1900 is in fact symptomatic of a greater advantage of this game- it is deep in a very real way. Not deep as an epic character drama like so many adventure games try to be- deep the way a movie is deep- but deep in the way a game should be. It doesn't force you down any pathways but instead gives you a world to play in within the boundaries of being a 'car tycoon' game. Its a bit daunting but also tremendously liberating, and that is the most fun thing about this game. At its heart its a tycoon sandbox where every automotive and consumer of the last century is your plaything.\n\nThis level of depth, however, could easily be a curse. It's all well and good building a top notch simulation, but that counts for nothing when its hard to interact with. When you have few levers to meddle in things, no way to know what's actually going on- etc etc. GearCity however deftly dispells this curse by giving you a really impressive variety of ways to look at the game world you inhabit. Digital functionaries produce reports covering every facet of your company and market, you can find out every exacting detail of the automotive retail industry using the world map. The U.I. can be hard to navigate, as I've mentioned, but the game becomes immesurably better once you've got your head around it.\n\nOne final point, for an early access game there is plenty of content on offer and it is of a very high quality. For me, at least, this game was worth the asking price as is.\n\nSo do I recomend GearCity? Yes, yes I do.\n\nLast night I woke up wanting a decent pirate sandbox...\n\nEDIT: One final thing I'll add, having had the game for a while now. The developers are very good about producing regular content updates, which is less than I can say about a lot of early access titles. Furthermore their level and style of community engagement is exemplary. Not only is the lead developer probably the most active poster on the games' forum, listening to every query and piece of advice, but the direction of development has been influenced significantly (and in very positive ways) by community feedback. This game is a perfect example of what early access can achieve when its working well, and I've never seen the approach done anywhere near as well by anybody else. The game also has a real 'labour-of-love' feel; the devs are clearly very enthusiastic about their subject matter; you get the sense they want to play the finished game as much as the rest of us do.\n\nIf you trust only one development team this year by throwing your money after an early access promise, trust these guys. If trust can be earnt by the behaviour of a development team on a first project like this, they've jolly-well earnt it.\n\nBuy this game all ye budding tycoons!","June 10, 2014","true","423.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You've got to look past the clunky, old school UI...and the "what the heck am I supposed to be doing" confusion at the beginning... and you find a fun, deep game.\n\nYou construct your cars by designing chassis, engines, and gearboxes...as simple as selecting icons and adjusting sliders. For each part you get to pick from various layouts and determine what areas your engineers will focus their efforts. Your choices are just a click or drag, but are critical to success. You are balancing customer desire with the cost to make your product. You've got to determine where to build factories, where to put up your branch offices to push sales, how much to spend on marketing, and how to divide up your distribution. You've got to price your vehicle right for the target demographic, city, body style demand, and current competitors' products.\n\nYou'll catch yourself saying "just one more turn" so you can modify your I4 engine, run a new model year on your popular sedan, or break into a new market.

So, what do i mean by lack of polish? Firstly is the terribly buggy tutorial system, after 4 attempts to complete it, and it breaking for one reason or another, i decided to try and give it a go on my own and see if I could learn 'on the job'. In most management games, this would be tricky as is, given various nuances to these types of games, but in Gear City it was a good 20-30 minutes i'll never get back, trying to navigate the horribly laid out GUI. Add on top of this various small bugs (reliability at 127/100, cars not shipping to dealerships despite being in range and having excess production etc.) and, at the moment I can't really recommend it, despite an otherwise enjoyable time playing it.\n\nIn summary, an excellent premise but I get the feeling the size and depth of the game has somewhat swamped the lone developer.

Yet it could be an unpolished gem just waiting to be cut to size.  Right now still full of bugs and a bit clunky at times it still has the most potential of any economic/managerial game on steam at the moment.  The only other games of its ilk all focus on game development.  Right now it is still a weed growing in a desert but eventually it could be something special.  Only time will tell.\n\nIf uncertain I'd suggest waiting until 1.22 because a lot of promised items should be completed by then.  Things like easier to use R&D.  R&D is this games biggest strenght while simultaneously being its biggest weakness.  You can spend hours building the "perfect" car only to realize that you can never recoup your costs because you've built something that simply can't sell at a price point necessary for profits.\n\nThis is a game that I will continue to return to after every update as I believe in the developer.","February 11, 2015","true","44.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Whether you're a gearhead or just like games based around business, this game is going to provide you with endless enjoyment.\n\nWhen starting you're offered four different dates from which to begin, each one representing significant eras of motoring. When choosing my favourite start date, 1900, you're able to progress right through from the birth of automobiles right through to the modern age, evolving and adapting to suit a rapidly changing consumer base.\n\nYou start as a very bare bones company with a very small factory capable of pumping out around two to three hundred cars per month in a single city and your task is - well - whatever you want it to be really. The lack of a set goal allows you to carve your own path, you could attempt to mimic the practices of Henry Ford and provide affordable cars to the masses, or you could make far more high-end specialised cars targetted at a smaller market but at a higher price.\n\nIt's very clear that the developer has put a lot of effort and love into this game and continues to do so. The game world is very detailed, even going so far as to demonstrate a realistic evolution of demographics as time progresses. The details are what sets this game aside from all the others.\n\nDesigning the automobiles themselves is an incredibly satisfying process. There are two modes available, the first mode "Assisted" holds your hand through the process and helps target components or vehicles suited for a specific body type, whilst still giving you enough creative freedom that the creation feels like your own. The second mode "Advanced" gives you absolute freedom to do whatever you want, allowing you to create miracles or fail spectacularly. The level of customisation available is not only enjoyable but results in a grand sense of achievement when you do manage to develop a creation that sells particularly well.\n\nIf I haven't already made it clear, I'd recommend that everyone at least try this game. It's an absolute bargain considering how much work has gone into it and has proven to be one of the most enjoyable titles in my library. You won't regret it.\n","July 14, 2015","true","154.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game gives players a canvas to engage in business strategies as well as their own creative imagination for design, all without going too deep into the tedium of mass micro-management.  The game still has a few rough edges here and there, but nothing that takes away from the full operation and  enjoyment of the game.

I opened a factory in Vietnam due to the labor being dirt cheap, I took out a bank loan and did an IPO for my company so I could maximize R&D for the car with out going bankrupt, and when it finally came time to build the car I settled on a high volume seller...compact cars in Europe. This car had me almost bankrupt already with all the investments I made, but I had built a vehicle that was leagues ahead of the competion so naturally the sales for this car just exploded. A few years selling this car and I had so much money that was able to close my cheap Vietnam factory and open a factory in London. I murdered the competition for compact cars in every city I opened a branch in. When I reached the year 2020 I had 60 billion in cash and a company valuation of 500 billlion dollars, I was the lead engine supplier in all the race categories I could compete in and my cheaply priced cars were built so damn well that they rivaled cars of 10x the price...and it all started with a few million dollars, a sweatshop factory, and an average little car.

You choose a starting date, a name and logo for your car company, how many competitors you want, and then choose your headquaters from a swathe of global major cities. From there your job is to design and manufacture cars, from designing the chassis, motor, and gearbox to designing its body with as much detail as you want. Once you've mastered the art of designing, manufacturing, and marketing profitable models, the game gives you the freedom to take your company in whichever direction you wish; from designing cheap cars for the masses, to luxury sports and super cars, to even vans and limousines. It's your choice what you produce, how you produce it, and what image your company will have.\nThe game really excels in its customisation and micromanagement, especially with its R&D interface. If you wanted to design a V2 motor (for no reason), paired with an equally sexy 1-speed gearbox that allows for forward and... nothing, you can do that. If you decided to beat your competition in the 1900's by showing up their 4-6HP compact cars with a 96HP compact car (or pickup truck, just to put salt in their wounds), you can do that too. Alternatively if you feel cheap, uncomfortable, no-power rust-buckets are the way to go, then this game gives you everything you need to make that happen. I personally enjoy developing new powerful motors, excellent chassis, and powerful gearboxes for my line of sports cars, then incorporating this technology into my new sedans whilst developing ever more powerful engines for my next line of sports car.\nFor an early access game, this game is loaded with engaging gameplay to keep you occupied for hours. The game does get very challenging from 1914 - 1945, as you must face the uncertainty of maintaining a profitable company when Europe decides to blow itself up in WW1, gets depressed in the 1930's, then starts blowing itself up again from 1939. This is where the game could do with some improving in my opinion, as the game forces you to idle production, close down factories and branches, and simply wait out the entire duration of all the conflicts of the first part of the 20th century; whilst hemorrhaging money with little to do. I would love to see the implementation of government contracts (which I believe is coming), to convert your factories to producing vehicles for the war. It currently makes no sense to me that when war breaks out, all factories (in Germany at least) reduce their production to 0. Imagine if Kaiser William II said "Right we're at war! Let's close down all the factories." I'd find the game much more playable if I could develop cheap, useful, and reliable trucks, or maybe tanks to help the war cause. This would give you something to do, rather than wait whilst watching your company bleed to death.\nAll in all, this game is great! It gives you the tools and creative freedom to live out your dreams as a car manufacturer, designing whatever you've always wanted to. The game is still in early access right now, so there are some bugs to be squashed, and some creases to iron out, but is still remarkably playable, and intensely enjoyable. I am very much looking forward to updates to come! Bring on the war contracts!","July 9, 2014","true","186.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

What I want to speak about is the game developer. Eric and his approach is the reason I like this game.\n\nI saw Gearcity in some kind of Steam sale. Saw that it supports Linux, checked the HW requirements (I'm playing on my 10 years old laptop with integrated Intel graphics, i915 driver) and headed to try the demo from the dev's website. That's how it all started.\n\nI ran accross a problem with texture sizes - my graphics simply didn't support them. I have reported it to Eric and I had new files to try the next day. Needless to say that they worked. This has repeated once more and now in the 1.19.1 build there is only one file left that causes trouble on such an old HW that I have. I can play the game since Eric provided me with all that I needed. The file would be probably included in 1.19.2 release.\n\nI want to thank Eric for keeping in contact with the players of his game and for thinking of the really old HW users. There is apparently no need to run the game through OpenGL 3 or even 4, because it's not about graphics. There are not many games/developers that think this way. I have many games in my library that has unnecessary HW requirements for the graphics they have. This is not one of them and that's why I recommend it.\n\nAbout the game itself. I have bankrupted only twice so far (well, I have played only two games). The game looks pretty complex to me and pretty hard to get into - keep in mind that I haven't any experiences with economic/simulation games. The setting of this game (car company) looks good to me. I like the designing new cars part of the game and I still have to learn how to profit.\n\nI think this game will make it high on my favorite list in the future. I suppose it would reside somewhere near OpenTTD and it will be the game I would like to return to.","February 9","true","12.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

By assuming that a potential buyer of this game should be interested in cars, this feature will satisfy the buyer, I think.\n\nFinance\n\nThe financial algorithms of GearCity is well designed.

People actually bought them, and it got positive reviews from the game's magazine reviewer. 11/10, would build crappy Soviet cars again.\n\nNow, in seriousness, this game is very fun to mess around in and play with making different kinds of cars. Designing cars is made fairly straight forward, but rather in depth, too. In it's basic form, building a car requires developing an engine, transmission, and chassis. Then you put those three together with a body to make your car. There's a basic editor that lets you set some simple parameters and it generates an engine/chassis/transmission based on those, and an advanced editor that lets you get into the nitty gritty of bore sizes, stroke length, etc. Same for designing the actual car, you get to select a body style and a specific body, them make some edits to it in the editor. You also get all kinds of sliders to play with for quality, luxury, varous development focuses. It's also fun to try and make a contract, it can be a little tricky. For one of them, I just happend to have stuff already developed that would fit the bill, the only trick was messing around with the development sliders for the car to get enough MPG to meet the requirement. This game can be a real time suck, and has that "one more turn" feel to it. I've found myself saying at midnight, "just a couple more turns to see how well my new car sell." A little while later, and the clock says 3am. The only negative things I have to say are that the sliders are kind of finicky, and sometimes the text seems to not show up quite the way it should. The in game tutorial is also kind of lacking and fiddly, and it doesn't cover the deeper aspects of the game. But since it's early access, I'm sure the dev is working on those things for future releases. For an early access game, it is very functional, somewhat polished, and playable/fun. Props to the dev, too, for being active in the forums listening to people and keeping us up to date. If you are on the fence about this game, don't be. Pick it up and give it a try. If you like cars, or strategy games, or both, you will enjoy this game.","February 15, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I wish I could say I will be playing it, but for me.  It needs more.  But I have to say what everyone elses does...THIS IS EARYL ACCESS.  It aint done yet.  This game DOES seem to have a solid foundation for design, and the AI in the econmoics, business and indusry seems solid.  What I didn't like is the slow pace and the "turn" type of simulation vs. an RTS type game.  It really just stopped me in my tracks from going forward and getting more into it.  I loved the design and the analytical style of the game.   Just needs to have something in it to keep it moving.  I still recommend this game because its cheap right now still and I believe when its done and polished, it will be a fun game.

I like to make nice cars with good profit margins, then see competitors with huge sales and then I design a super cheap car to take the sales crown. Then I find myself with top sales and very little profit :(. It's fun to try different approaches and persue different definitions of success. This is not a graphics heavy game, but being a business sim it doesn't need to be. I do have some gripes (managing R&D with production is cumbersome, many ratings are hidden until you've already developed a vehicle, lots of important info is lacking causing development to sometimes be a guessing game, effects of time, new body styles etc. are unclear) but from what I've read the developer is addressing many of them in the next update. There are stability issues and some things that need to be fleshed out but this is an early release, so it's expected.

Many things, particularly contracts, are unclear as to what you're actually supposed to be doing and about what's actually happening.\nThe interface is extremely buggy; on most designs, I can't apply any accessories besides wheels and headlights, as for whatever reason the rest of the components appear invisible or aren't placing correctly.\n\nAt least half of the adjustment sliders seem uselessly redundant. There's a slider each for narrowing and widening parts by a certain degree; why not just have one slider that starts in the middle and narrows OR widens parts? It makes no sense.\n\nThe camera in the body designer has an utterly abysmal movement-based directional lighting system.\nWhy not make it bright all-around by default? Having shaders for something like this is completely unnecessary and just a blatant annoyance, as it adds unnecessary amounts of fiddling with the camera and lighting system to highlight the area you want to design.)\n\nWheel-wells on almost all of the models require a lot of tweaking and resizing to fit the wheels in so they don't clip through the body or the fenders, which, again, feels like it adds unnecessary fiddling. The wheels don't even snap to the center of the mount points, which should either be something you could toggle on and off, or left for the game to decide placement on.\n\nOn top of all these issues, it's not able to hold my attention for very long as its complexity makes it hard to get invested in, which coupled with the limited explanation of game concepts just makes it frustrating.\n\nI wouldn't recommend GearCity until it becomes more complete, fleshed out, and easier to use.

It's not. Yes, I am aware it is an early access game.\n\nDesign chassis, using ridiculously outdated slider interface. Design engine to fit chassis. Design gearbox to fit chassis. Design car by putting these things together and sticking on some wheels, mirrors etc. Doesn't really matter what you put where, it has no impact on the final product. Set a reasonable price, and now you are selling cars. Repeat this process over and over until you are bored.\n\nGraphics and sound are horrible and outdated and very little has improved since the beginning. There was still placeholder text instead of artwork all over the place last time I played. I honestly wouldn't mind the horrible graphics if the gameplay made up for it, but it doesn't.\n\nOn the plus side, the dev seems a nice guy and is active in forums, which was the reason I thought it was worth trying at this point.

The refund feature.\n\nI am a huge petrolhead and usually enjoy anything to do with vehicles. I have played a few car tycoon type games before and enjoyed them. I have been looking for a modern one for a while and stumbled across GearCity.\n\nIt looked fantastic, It probably is if you can get past the utterly useless UI and the fact that half the features don't seem to have any bounderies or common sense. First attempt at making a car. 80s Subcompact car, I think great easy start, no first thing I have to do is stick on the wheels and tyres... I get given giant moon buggy tyres that are bigger than the wheel arches on the car for some reason and spend the next 5 minutes playing with the stupidly vague slide bars trying to get the tyres to look like normal car tyres inside the wheel arches and have the front and back look about the same.\n\nWondering why the ♥♥♥♥ whoever designed this game thought it was a good idea to make even the tyres a struggle to deal with. Most games I am sure "pick wheels" followed by "pick size", and "pick colour" would suffice. Never mind I think it was 7 slide bars that half of them don't seem to do anything.Same issue with the headlights, pick some very 80s square headlights, place them on the car and they stretch and warp all over the place and end up looking like stickers rather than part of the car.\n\nAfter giving up on trying to get an even ok looking car I go ahead and start building them. I think I set them up to ship to dealers, I think I paid for advertising. Found lots of information on my "competitors" cars and could compare them to each other... No idea how to compare my car to what they are selling.\n\nEventually realise that I have built just over 100 cars, not sold one. No idea why, but at this point I gave up. I had spent 92 minutes not enjoying myself. the only bits I enjoyed was the design engine, chassis and gearbox sections, and even they could be inmproved massively with a few simple dropdown menues to pick simple things like engine configuration and cylinders.","January 10","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's a hodgepodge of menus and making sure you didn't forget something, or learned some bizarre menu sequence you weren't aware of, or had some checkbox clicked so the appearance of the menus are consistent.\n\nThis game is a pure nightmare.  You know the coding horror logo?  That.  That is this game in a nutshell.\n\nI have never regretted buying a game as much as I've regretted this one.  I have zero hope the dev will ever grasp exactly how to generate a UX which is gives the player a pleasant learning curve.  It's a brick wall.  "Come - hit your head on the brick wall again" the game pleads with you...

I don't know what the population wants:  trucks, minivans, etc.  I don't know how to look that up if its there.  I also don't know much about cars, but I was hoping there would be some auto help for the actual building of the cars.  It looks like upgrading and managing this game would be tons of fun, but I can't sell cars or even turn a profit.  I've been playing simulation games for years so I am amussing this is due to my basic lack of knowldge of cars.  This is disappointment and I think there does need to be some way around it.  Hints or basic help would be more than welcome as I haven't given up yet!\n\n","November 22, 2015","false","10.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","3"

As other mentioned, the game is rich in ideas but poor in realization. I thought it was a good idea investing in the game since the developer seams a nice and active on his board... Still the gameplay should be refined a lot more and the game seams trying to do too much for a "one man's work". The guy should have at least a small team to realistically get everything he's trying to achieve done in a reasonable time, instead he's trying to do this all by himself, so in the end this game costs too much and will never be the small gem it was meant to be.\n\nIn the end the developer should definitely show some humilty and understand that asking this much for this game it's not right. With that money he should definitely hire a couple of guys helping him making a COMPLETE overhaul of the Interface, and rethink a couple of features from the start, since as for now they seem completely out of place or unnecessary. He seem to have a strong grip on the coding behind the game, and he clearly has a bright idea of what the game should be, but he simply can't do it alone.\n\nNote that the game holds still many great features and many great ideas. I would give this game a\n\n5\10\n\n, and enything else except the UI reach a perfect and balanced gameplay experience this rating i'll change.\n\nEDIT:\nIn the end the developer gave me some answer and amply demonstrated that i was wrong on his behalf; he even personally gave an explaination of the economy behind the development of this game, which is something rare and precious. I was probably wrong saying that he should demonstrate more humilty, and you should read the discussion to get a personal idea out of it. Sadly i still feel that the game is not very playable at the current state, and i'll keep playing it hoping that the situation changes.\n\n\n---------------\nITA\n\nRECENSIONE BASATA SULLA VERSIONE 1.19\n\nIl problema principale riguarda il prezzo: Per 15 euro questo gioco non offre abbastanza. Come hanno osservato anche altri, il gioco è pieno di idee ma povero in realizzazione. Ho pensato fosse una buona idea investire su questo gioco dato che lo sviluppatore sembrava un bravo ragazzo e molto attivo sul suo forum... Purtroppo il gioco dovrebbe essere raffinato maggiormente, e quello che il gioco prova a raggiungere sembra troppo per il lavoro di uno sviluppatore solo. Lo stesso dovrebbe avere almeno un piccolo team per riuscire realisticamente ad ottenere quello che promette in tempi realistici; invece sta cercando di fare tutto da solo, e conseguentemente il gioco costa troppo e non diverrà mai la piccola gemma che sarebbe dovuto diventare.\n\nPer concludere lo sviluppatore dovrebbe dimostrare un po' di umiltà e con i profitti del gioco assumere uno o due persone che lo aiutino a rifare da capo l'interfaccia e a ripensare completamente poche altre cose del gioco che necessiterebbero di venire ristrutturate poichè superflue o del tutto inutili. Sembra chiaro che abbia una idea chiara su quello che vuole ottenere dal gioco, e sembra essere molto competente in programmazione, ma da solo non può farcela.\n\nDa notare che questo gioco contiene molte belle idee e molte features ben realizzate. Se dovessi dare un voto finale a questo gioco sarebbe di\n\n5\10\n\ntenendo conto che qualora lo sviluppo portasse ad una esperienza di gioco perfetta ed equilibrata, questo voto potrebbe cambiare.\n\nEDIT:\nAlla fine lo sviluppatore ha fornito molte risposte interessanti che hanno dimostrato come mi sbagliassi sul suo conto; ha persino fornito informazioni sui costi di sviluppo del progetto, che è una cosa rara e preziosa. Purtroppo la mia opinione generale sull'esperienza di gioco non cambia, ma terrò d'occhio lo sviluppo e in caso cambierò opinione.","January 16","false","52.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","17"

It's clear that he will do his best to make this a good game.\n\nCouldn't finish designing a car\nMany other people clearly have, and have been able to run the company as expected.  At this point (and hopefully it changes in the future) you have to fully complete a design of a car before you can save the design itself.\n\nThe first couple of times I tried, I got very close.  I got to the point where I liked the car I'd designed, but wanted to come back and tweak it a bit more so I saved the game. When  I returned, the car was gone.  I asked the question in the forum and was told that the process of designing needs to be complete until you can save the car.\n\nAnother couple of times, about halfway through the game force closed on me.  While there is a problem with shading causing force closing, both shadows and shading were off when this happened to me the last time.\n\nThe very last attempt at designing a car, the headlights simply would not be placed on the car.  For some reason, the headlights appeared in the middle of the car.

This is one of those moments where I feel proud to change my recommendation and give this a thumbs up.\n\nWith a proper (though not complete...yet) in-game tutorial, a world map to speak of with all the bells and whissles you'd expect, a proper R&D facility that actually shows you what you're working on and the addition of an assisted developer mode(s) this game is beginning to look more like a game and less like a beaurocratic haven.\n\nHaving played through the tutorial, which is basically some pop-ups that ASSIST you rather than a scenario with all sorts of limitations, I actually found myself enjoying the game.

Following all tutorials, which at this point are meager and throw you on a track you can hardly get off of, I still found it to be more of a chore than an enjoyable game.\n\nI never got around to hitting the race track, since the company keeps going bankrupt long before the first car is actually built, so I won't comment on that. But the design and construction of a car is overly complex and feels more like your filling out forms or playing in Excel than a game. There is no result to the world other than some words in a paper and...more forms...so you can't look out your office window and see your cars roaming the streets.

This is a game I have wanted to be made for years! I played Capitalism 2 where you could make a car company, but all you could do is set up supply lines and shops, no car design, no in depth creation.\n\nThis game is truly unique, with the customisation you can perform on vehicles and car parts, and though I know there's much more that can be done, such as different body kits, choosing tyres (compounds etc, not just choosing the visuals) and being able to see and design the interior. I also feel that a more dynamic body, that forms around headlights etc.\n\nThere are spelling errors, and the painting and lighting for the cars is a bit...meh, but I feel that there's so much left to be squeezed out of this game, and when it's finished, I wouldn't be surprised if I hit 100 hours, because this is one of my favourite games at the moment!\n\nNote to Dev: Great job, just don't stop, keep the momentum!","May 29, 2015","true","78.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heck, I still play it from time to time. For those of you who don't know, it is old game in which you run a car company, starting in the early 1900's. You must design, manufacture, distribute and advertise cars. Not only that, but you must also research new equipment, new designs, and tailor your cars and prices to each individual market. No big deal, right?\n\nSuch things as wars, economic recession/depressions, and oil crises all play a part in what kind of products are needed and where. As time went on, and the demand for cars increased, production had to follow suit. Massive amount of money had to be invested in increased factory sizes, not to mention sales offices to help sell your cars in greater quantities.\n\n\nGear City uses a great many of these concepts, and then takes it a step (or two) further.\n\n\nLike Detroit, there is a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to make your company profitable. The nice thing about Gear City is the difficulty adjustment. If you feel that you're not being challenged, you can modify a new game to suit your needs. Less starting money, greater economic fluctuations, etc, etc. If you have a tough time starting a profitable company, you can make things a lot easier.\n\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game, though I would only do so for people who have plenty of patience.\n\n\n\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","80.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
