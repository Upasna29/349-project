"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/8800/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","I have played "Civilization III", "IV", "II" and "V" (in that particular order). "Civilization V" is my favourite, but "Civ IV" has also a lot to offer and it's worth playing not only for nostalgic value. Everything what I'm saying relates to "Beyond the Sword" expansion and I highly recommend to purchase all the expansions, because, without them, the game is incomplete and you have limited mod and civilization options. (Actually, I don't understand, why people play vanilla versions. For "Civilization" games, it's usually like this: they release an incomplete game with some gameplay faults, which is substantially improved with following expansions – not only in terms of content, but also in terms of mechanics. I believe this will be the case with Beyond Earth, as well.)\n\nHere are some things that "Civ4" does have that "Civ5" doesn't, and things that "Civ4" is better at (well, imo, at least):\n\n+ More customisation options (e.g., no limitations regarding how many civilizations could there be per map size; an option to assign leaders to different civilization, for example, Ghandi as a leader of Russia).\n+ By far better interface (except, for one thing - when you are offered research/tech choice, you need to make decision right away - you can't examine your empire first. You can change it afterwards in the same turn, but, anyway, it's not very convenient). Apart from that, it's more easy to review the overall state of your progress. For example, howering over a tech gives you a detailed explanation of what you can achieve with a tech (units, wonders, bonuses for discovering first, etc.), why it's important and where it leads. Also, in "Civ4", there is the option to see the network of global politics or what a particular leader thinks of other leaders or what he wants or is willing to trade. I also prefer "Civ4" icons over "Civ5" icons.\n+ Unit appearance is different for each civilization and religion (and not just in terms of colour). For example, Korean swordmen will have different swords than European swordmen, a Buddhist missionary will have a different outfit from that of a Christian missionary.\n+ Cool wonder animations.\n+ Civics (ideologies) are available much earlier in the game, you can change them more easily and they are not linked to culture points. In "Civ5", many of the civic system functions are transfered to relligion system.\n+ Map trading\n+ Cultural victory is actually a feasible option contrary to "Civ5", where it is possible only in rare occasions.\n+ Inbuilt World Builder (In "Civ5" it's available only from the "Workshop")\n+ Workers can build forest preserves (that add happiness)\n+ The rather unique "Afterworld" scenario and "Final Frontier" mod (which both feel like and actually are completely different games – full-conversion mods, if you like).\n+ Vassal states (you can push other leaders to become your vassals).\n+ No lag on large maps, since it is a much older game and requires less system resources.\n\n+/- Random events instead of city state quests\n+/- Workshops and windmills are tile improvements instead of buildings.\n+/- Religion doesn't have that much impact as in "Civ5". But it does have a considerable impact on diplomacy.\n+/- Culture bombs work in the same way as great general citadels.\n+/- Different great persons may discover different technologies.\n+/- Corporations - spread them like relligion and each corporation will have different effects. "They are mechanisms that can add substantial production to a city, at the cost of higher maintenance costs. Thus, in essence they convert gold into other basic goods (food, hammers, science, and culture)." [From Wikia]\n\nHowever, there are some aspects in which "Civ4" falls behind "Civ5":\n\n- Square tiles. Hexagon tiles are far better for strategical gameplay and layout.\n- Unit stacks. I know that I will be condemned for this and for a while I missed the stacking option in "Civ 5", but, when I got used to it, I must admit that one unit-per-tile limitation actually improves the gameplay a lot. With this limitation it matters much more where you put your units. You can manage your army more easily. The city placement has a bigger impact on your attack/defence strategy. And, finally, if you play smart, you can save more of your units (sometimes even win the game without loosing any unit), whereas in "Civ4" you are bound to throw your units into the battle as cannon fodder. "Civilization 5" feels like chess in that matter. And I prefer it that way.\n- Ranged units (Archers, Crossbowmen, etc.) don't have a "ranged attack" option. It is available only for siege weapons ("bombard").\n- No city states. I actually like how city states provide bonuses, quests and influence the diplomacy. I think it's a better mechanic than influence points. Although, on the other hands, AI leaders in "Civ5" are completely irrational, their attitude sometimes doesn't make any sense and there is little you can do about it, whereas in "Civ4", you can at least change your civic/relligion or influence those of the AI leader.\n- "Civilization 4" is harder than "Civilization 5" (although it might be a good thing for some players). In "Civilization 5", I feel comfortable on "Emperor" and with a bit of luck I can manage "Immortal" on smaller maps, whereas I struggle on "Noble" in "Civilization 4". Perhaps, it's because I haven't played "Civilization 4" in years and hadn't developed any strategy when I did.\n- Technology trading. This actually makes the game rushed, unbalanced and it's much harder to make that technological gap between you and AI players. Although, there were moments, in "Civ5" multiplayer, when I wished there was this option. But, now, I see that research agreements are actually a much more balanced mechanic. Luckily, you can turn "technology trading" off in "Civ4".\n- "Civilization 4" pushes you to expand early (as mush as possible). "Civilization 5" pushes you to build army early (expansion is less crucial than in "Civ4)". I don't like any of the two, but, I think, that the fact, that AI civilizations are expanding so rapidly and that you need to keep up, makes "Civilization 4" unbalanced - it's hard to maintain positive stats and to manage the cities and units. In "Civ5", you can win with less units, less initial cities and the overall pace is slower, which allows you to build your empire in a more balanced way. "Civilization III" had the same problem btw.\n- No "Steam Workshop" support. But you can still use 3rd party mods.\n\nThere are probably some more differences that I've forgotten, but, in the end, I would like to say that "Civilization 4" is a great game and offers many things its successor lacks. For that reason it's worth purchasing even today – not only for a nostalgic value, but also for the different and fun experience it offers.\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10\n\nAlso, my personal feeling is that "Civilization 5" is better in its strategical aspect, whereas "Civilization 4" is better in its "God game" aspect – just to fool around on easier difficulties.","December 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","36","36","0","5"

I have a lot of trouble getting into most 4X games, even turn-based ones, but what I think makes this game far better, than, say, Galactic Civilizations 2, is that it's complex enough to give rise to various strategies, game styles and outcomes, but you're still presented with enough detail that you can look at your civilization, its cities and its individual units and find out exactly why they're unhappy, or unsuccessful, or unprofitable.\n\nGames like GalCiv2 hide the formulas that govern your civilization under the hood, and playing them ends up feeling more like SimCity than Risk or chess: you simply find yourself responding to events as they happen, without a clear understanding of how your actions will affect even your own civilization. Civ4 throws that sort of design out completely--it's detailed, but not ridiculously so (like, say Master of Orion 3, where you feel like you're playing a spreadsheet), and knowing that its design is good, it doesn't feel obligated to hide the details.","November 25, 2013","true","176.6"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","1"

Tons of civs to choose from, and a huge civilopedia providing a wealth of knowledge about them. The civs are all well balanced, and there are tons of maps types to choose from. You can easily create your own maps as well, though it can be time consuming. A lot of fun to play with friends, just be sure to turn random events off because they will make the game go out of sync. Has some flaws, like the random events in multiplayer, and the fact that the CPU is pretty much pre ordained to hate you and try to kill you no matter what. Maintaining friendships with CPUS is very difficult. The most annoying thing in the game is when you have a very high percentage to win a battle and you lose. That small percent is there, so this does happen occasionally, and it can be quite dsheartening. Not at all a game breaker though. I recommend playing with friends for a more challenging experience.

While Civ 3 remains a complete mystery to me, I can say I have played all the others, and this one is by far the best I've played.  You might say "what about Civ 5?", but I highly prefer it to Civ 5 for several reasons (unit stacking ***Figure out how to use collateral damage people***, tech/espionage/culture slider, much more micromanagable empire, better system for unit and city maintenance, far superior espionage system, more interesting promotion dynamics with military units, unrestricted leaders, non gimmicky leader traits, non gimmicky religions, far superior map option, way less annoying barbarians, way less buggy multiplayer, etc etc etc...)\n\nI have dumped hundreds of hours into this game on steam (untold hundreds more on my non steam copy) multiplayer on the steam servers just last year and still have no fatigue of this game.

Games are long and difficult, leaders are very animated and expressive and the soundtrack is utterly fantastic (Netherlands and Greeces theme are such smoothing tracks). The leader variety is slightly greater than Civ V (but Civ V has more civs with more unique abilities), and each leader has two traits, like Abraham Lincoln is Philosophical and Charismatic while Montezuma is Aggressive and Spiritual, for the most part these traits are fairly balanced, but there are a few expeditions of just play bad traits (Protective is infamously underpowered).\n\nEach Civ also has their two "uniques", unique units and unique buildings, unfortunately I don't really see these often being huge game changers with a few expeditions like Englands Redcoats, Ethipoias Omoro Warriors or Sumerians Ziggurats, this is probably cause the games combat is by far the worse aspect of it, units stack meaning most depth and strategy can be replaced with simply rushing enemies with strong melee units and hope to win, hope you built a lot of archers!","November 27, 2014","true","228.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","7"

Civ IV is a classic. After some of the frustrations with Civilization III following the majesty of Civ II, IV felt like a return to form for the series.  It has a lot in common with III, of course, but it made the game feel epic again.  It also resolved some of the awkward controls the series was known for, and added a few intriguing features.  In particular, religion, corporations, and civics (borrowed from Alpha Centauri).\n\nWhat BTS gets right is amazing. There is a lot of depth to the decisions being made, and it can be a complex game if you want it to be.  The civic system lets you fine tune your own custom government (a theocratic police state with a free market?  Go right ahead!), with the rewards and penalties mixed, like in the classic Civs.  The diplomacy is vital to the game, and the AI's opinions of you actually matter, and can be influenced.\n\nWhere it gets it wrong tends to be the tedium and the stacking mechanic.  Civ III and IV suffer from a design oversight that became a mechanic, called 'stacks of doom" in which not only could an army be overpowered by playing upwards of 30-40 units in one tile, but such play became essential to win.  The city attacking and defending mechanics also leave something to be desired, as they are intended for stacks of doom.  The gameplay can be tedious compared to Civ V, many turns can pass without anything happening.\n\nBut it's also more satisfying when you get to victory in this game.  And there are more victory options in Civ IV: BTS than any other Civ game, including early game victories such as religious.\n\nThis game was so good in its time that even today the Civ fans are divided between Civ IV and V, with many fans preferring this game over the new version.  I do consider it a matter of preference, as I play both.\n\nLast of all, certainly not least, Leonard Nimoy narrates this game in a Leonard Nimoy fashion.  It fits the game perfectly.","June 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I am a long-term veteran of Civilization 4, owning a physical non-Steam copy for 10 years now. If Civilization 5 was a game that needed to be saved by DLC, this is a game that is taken to new heights by its DLC.\nBeyond the Sword comes with many interesting new mechanics that do a lot to vary gameplay and encourage a more tactical mindset. What resources are important to me? How will my city's starting position affect me in the late game? Is it worth it to create an overseas colony?\nThe renewed Espionage system is a blast, though for my money it's too easy to discover enemy spies.\nAdvanced starts and the new scenarios are also a lot of fun.

There are so many wierd, wonderful and awesome things you can add to the game, whiether you want to be historically accurate and/or add fantasy+sci-fi elements to it, there is so much choice for the player.\n\nThis is CIV games at its finest.

Along with the easy-to-mod capacity, and some of the best listed in the scenarios section, this makes the game an awesome play-through, again, and again, and again. With different nations, and world settings, as well as ways to win, eveyr single play through is different.

I don't know about Civ5, but the 4th is surprisingly bland gameplay wise (bts is just a gimmicky add-on). The combat is mindboggling weak, not even to par with ancient Call to Power 2, which I find generally better from Civ4.\n\nYeah, you have upgraded graphics, leaders that mostly are fine, but the lack of content is - again - surprising, especially in civics and combat aspects. Espionage is a chore, the growth mechanic is irritiating, religions/corporations don't really matter much, technology is boring.\n\nOf course it's fun to play up to the certain point, it's not a bad game, but personally I would rather launch Call to Power 2 once more, which decades ago handled combat better and Civ up to this point can't simply implement obvious improvements offered years ago by CtP2.\n\nMaybe I will try some mods or Colonization, but I'm fed up for the moment.","March 14, 2015","true","66.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

A little bit of single player.\n\nPositives: The most important thing for a strategy game is of course the strategy.  This game has a very impressive amount of depth.  I like that who you choose as your world leader matters, and that each one tends to feed into a different playstyle.  I like that there are various ways to win, including many non-violent ways.  You can not only win through military force, but also through technology or culture.  This is just a very cool concept for a strategy game.  But it's not just that the concepts are neat; they are also well executed.  It feels like the game is pretty well balanced, and that there are many legitimate ways to play.  Now, I'm not very familiar with the meta game, so for all I know in the competitive scene mulitary may be the way to go.  But for casual playing, it feels like there's a wide variety of ways to play, and that's mainly what interests me.\n\nAlso, Leonard Nimoy lends his voice to this game.  That's a huge positive for me!\n\nNegatives: While the graphics are perfectly serviceable, sometimes I feel they come acrossed a bit dopey; especially the cartoonish portraits of the world leaders.  This game is turn based, and while I enjoy that style of slow and methodical gameplay, some people may not appreciate that as much.  This weakness can be magnified if you play with the wrong people... it can be annoying when one person is taking a really long time to act every single time.  The in-game music is very timid and fades into the background, it didn't do much for me.  Sometimes it creates a nice ambience, but a more memorable soundtrack would have increased my enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall: It's one of the best strategy games around, as far as I'm aware.  Certainly one of the best I've played.  If that's what you're looking for, then you've come to the right place.\n\nAbout my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  Overall score, and soundtrack.  Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance.  The meaning of each number are as follows:\n\n0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece\n\nCivilization IV's score:\n\nGame Rating: 7 (Great)\nSoundtrack Rating: 4 (Mediocre)","July 26, 2015","true","97.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As soon as it was available, it was a must-have purchase for me.\n\nCiv IV is a sublime strategy in the truest sense of the word. Spanning over 6000 years of human history, you'll start with a single settler forming a tribal village. Dozens of hours later you could be sending a fleet of warships to control oil deposits in the north pole, taking control of the global market with a corporation monopoly, or ordering a charge of knights in a futile last strike against an Aztec airbase.\n\nIt's a game that provides multiple ways to win and even several options to get to each of those conditions. You will compete against up to 18 other nations using diplomacy, warfare, exploration and luck to establish an empire. You will need to stake a claim on finite global resources, defend your borders, make friends and defeat enemies. Spread religion and corporations to control the masses and bankrupt your ememies. Deploy spies to see enemy troop movements or sabotage their reserach and production. Build great wonders to boost your cultural impact. Difficulty is easily scaleable and 'tweakable', providing a fantastic challenge. Perhaps you will triumph...and perhaps you will meet your end at the hands of Mahatma Ghandi's nuclear arsenal. One thing is for sure...you will have many, many replays of this game.\n\nTHEN there are the scenarios - various historical or fictional settings that tweak the rules and gives special conditions. See if you can spot the mod (inclided with the game) that inspired their later offering - 'X:COM Enemy Unknown'.\n\nIn Short: The greatest strategy game ever made*- there'll be no need for friends, jobs or even sunlight anymore with this baby. The only reason you should not be buying it is because you were reading this review. But it's over now...so go guy it!\n\n*This includes the more recent title 'Civ V' -- a competent game, but inferior in my humble opinion.","June 16, 2011","true","161.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are in fact atrocious compared to the newer Civ 5, and even Civ 3, with its 2d isometric graphics and heavy reliance on shades of brown. But as any fan of the TBS-genre will tell you; graphics are secondary to everything else.\n\nYou may ask yourself "why invest in Civ 4 when Civ 5 and BE is out?". Well, apart from having better graphics and adding (and taking away) certain features, there aren't many differences between these games. Some of the most important differences (or improvements as some will call them) are the limitation on movement and stacking in Civ 5. One may argue that limitations compared to older versions are negative, but the point would be moot when faced with "the stack of doom". So yes, at first glance, the newer games are better. There are however saving graces for Civ 4: Plenty of advanced and interesting mods, as well as a (more) stable multiplayer, the latter of which is laughable in Civ 5.\n\nBeyond The Sword\nBtS is arguably the largest expansion to any of the Civ games, and a must-have if you want to use mods, as most of them now require it to work. It adds quite a few new features, including, but not limited to:\nTen (10) new civs, as well as 6 new leaders for existing civs.\nCorporations: The religion of business.\nRandom events: FUN\nLots of new game rules and options, to help customize your experience.\nIn conclusion: If you like the civilization-games, but don't care about graphics, or don't like the limitations of Civ V, or like Civ but want it to be more advanced with certain mods, or just want to be able to play multiplayer for more than 10 minutes without having problems; i would suggest grabbing Civ IV with BTS as soon as possible.","August 25, 2015","true","192.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is, without a doubt, the best 4x game ever made.  That's not to disparage earlier greats in the genre, but Civ IV (particularly the BtS expansion) takes the concept to an extremely high form that would have been unthinkable on any earlier hardware.  The game play is deep, and with dozens of unique leader trait combos, several paths to victory, randomly generated maps, and tons of user mods, infinitely replayable.\n\nThe only downsides of this game are its failure to use hexes, failure to have a genuine 3d (as in globe) map, and a particular game mechanic in the combat system that makes crushing the AIs fairly easy when facing even remotely even odds.\n\nThere are religious, technological, corporate, political, cultural and military paths to victory.  Each civilization has both a unique unit and unique building, and each leader a unique set of two personality traits that affect gameplay significantly.  The game can be played on small maps, or gigantic.  It can be played in a quick speed - finishing in a couple hours - or in "marathon" speed, a game that can take several days to finish.  There are barbarian hordes that will smash your early civilization, and randomly generated events and quests to vary each game.\n\nIt's so infinitely replayable in fact, that I am going to stfu, and go start a new game right now...","February 21, 2014","true","249.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A religious zealot? A Trader? A Cultralist? A Warmonger or Someone Everyone else hates a little bit less than your biggest rival?\nPROS.\nThere is NO set stategy to win this game, and you have to be able to adapt to a developing world.\nSoooo many choices of what to build, research, Influence, destroy.\nCONS.\nOther Human players (Either Suck at this game or don't understand it)\nSpies were better in warlords.\nCity Govenor will prioritise scientists over other great people, Its really annoying.\n\nWar is NOT the only answer. i've won many cultrual, space, world/religious leader victories and never killed a single unit even with aggressive AI On Immortal. You bribe others to go to war for you!\nDont get me wrong i like a good war but if its not in your interests or you have nothing to gain avoid it.\n\nPeople complain of broken deplomacy and stacks of doom.\nOn lower difficulties, deplomacy is Frustrating, as you'll be way in advance of the AI and it'll demand unreasonable trades and requests, that you WILL refuse, and as a result so and so declares WAR.\nOn higher difficulties the trades and demands are still weighted towards the AI but its NOT AS ridiculous and you're more inclined to take them.\nYou CHOOSE your friends. You CANNOT please Everyone.\nAs for 'stacks of doom' catapults rip them too pieces.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nLAN = amazing, a real challenged if you opponent is good.\nONLINE = lots of issues.\nStaging room is fairly vulgar due to the same few people.\nRagequits all too common.\nMultiplayer is poor but Only due to the ameturism of your opponents, and i'm yet to actually see a winner of a game.\nNearly all of the players you come across are fairly weak and use the same stategy again and again.\nPick the Romans, get iron, build pretorians and go to war. its the same with any other race that gets an early unit that owns.\nNobody will allow tech trading as its "unfair" apparently, Truth is, that warmongor who set up the game doesn't want a challenge of facing longbows early.\nUsually someone states they have infantry in x amount of turns and everyone else quits saying "good game, you win, i forfeit" even though i was 8 turns from a cultrual victory. Not that i'm bitter about it or nothing but it was only 1390ad and i was 8 turns away from Victory that no-one saw coming, and was then robbed of it. 2hrs of my time for nothing.\n","February 19, 2014","true","556.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The only way I could ever find a way to win in civ iv was space race.

So I made a list. Here goes:\nCiv V\nNo more stacks of death (you cannot stack units)- you must actualy be strategic when it comes to how you wage war: no more "meh army bigger than ur army. i win."\nBetter graphics (if that matters to you: I could care less)\nGame is more basic\nReplaced gov types with culture branches... not sure which one I like more.\nMade culture/domonation victories winnable. The only way I could ever find a way to win in civ iv was space race. I'm still lost when it comes to deplomacy.\nCity states: Single NPC cities that you can befriend or cature.\nThey replaced the square tiles (from which you could move 8 directions) with hexes (from which you can move 6 directions).\nlarger tech tree.\n\n\nCiv IV\nthey took away religion in Civ V! I loved the concept of religion, in my opinion they should have built upon it.\nThey took away sickness! I loved the concept of bla bla bla ^^^\nThey made it so that cities no longer become unhappy indivigualy, now the entire nation becomes ♥♥♥♥♥y at once. I liked the old way much better.\ncheeper\n\nSo there you go. Hope it helped.\n","January 16, 2014","true","184.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But they all suffer from the same problem, random game crashes. It's frustrating and annoying and if you load a save after a crash (game has stopped working), it'll crash at exactly the same spot. Start a new one, may or may not crash or may crash at a random time. Nobody knows why. Also, if your save is greater then 1.3 megs, you'll never be able to load it. And when it's nearing that, a crash is coming soon. Curse of 32-bit applications. Until the Civ games get out of the stone age and move to 64-bit........\n\nOtherwise, I like this over Civ 5, you can stack lots of units (last game, had around 25 units in a stack). Civ's don't care if you found cities next to them or not, or how many.\n\nYou can build spies and unleash them on your enemies, destroying  everything from improvements to poisoning water.\n\nYou can aquire other Civ' cities thru culture, instead of war.\n\nThe more religions you have, the better, unlike Civ 5's religion intolerance to other religions.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, that is when it's working correctly and not dumping you to the desktop..","September 7, 2015","true","138.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The reality is that in Civlization IV vanilla, defence is kind of possible, but needs a LOT of effort and is not ultimatly worth it because your score point generation falls off the map while producing military units you will not use to take a capital/city.\n\nHowever, in BTS this is even worse because defence is not even possible. You must research knights to counter catapults? wtf. The research is only like 1000 years apart. The only stategy available in Civ IV is: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! If that is how I wanted to play then I would play a fricken RTS. (Real Time Strategy) Like AoM, Warcraft III, or Starcraft. The fact that this grind for military units is the only way to play makes all other parts of the game more like a dissapointing minigame you pursue while everyones LotR size hordes hump eachother in the field. If you pursue a science victory you essentially are achieving a military victory, but decided to make a spaceship while your nukes were in transit to your enemies loved ones.\n\nSo, once again I state: A strategy game with one strategy is not strategy game at all. Don't really want to be identified as a Civ V fan boy, but yes they fixed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in Civ V and you can actually enjoy 5 different victory goals. (if you buy all the expansions that is, otherwise the vanilla game is the same meatgrinder of military units you wait on, while you fap or look at reddit) So, do not buy this game unless you want to have stacks of units slap eachother until one loses the strength to go on.\n\nIf you still want to buy this game, buy it on {LINK REMOVED}www.♥♥♥.com for a $6 steam code intead of fricken $30-35 on steam, or what ever its up to now with the Civ VI announcement.\n\nI am sorry Leonard Nimoy.","May 19","false","21.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I think Civs are just getting worse on each number. They should repair and improve the old ones instead. Still a good game, but feels like you do not even have to play it, as the game gets either so big that it is awful to micro, and it feels the ages and technologies and whatnot are just passing by. So if you have an enemy, you could basically choose to attack him with axemen or invent the Internet and visit Mars. Then you would have destroyed your enemy and lost to all others, or you would be stuck with your enemy and developed.

Mostly, I played the multiplayer. There were three of us, me and two of my friends, usually against two or three AI. I could trust one but there was so much paranoia between me and the other friend that every game we played, most of the time I ended up taking him out or nuking him at least. He would literally sell his soul to the devil to gain a single relationship boost, which is why I never wanted to trade with him. But as I said, the game WAS amazing. I would have recommended the game a few months ago (Don't think update was out then), but with the latest update, the multiplayer is SO laggy, I'm considering uninstalling my game. For my friend Cole's birthday, I got him 20 bucks so he could finally play the game with us (which he wanted for a while but never had the cash), and so he bought it. But we haven't played more than 30 minutes worth with him just because of the lag. I don't know what caused all of the lag, but it was a terrible terrible thing. I'm glad the servers are still up but for me and my friends, there's no point now. I did get my money's worth and I don't regret getting the game, but as much as I hate to say it, I wouldn't recommend anyone getting it now if they want to play it with friends.","July 30, 2014","false","332.2"," 7 of 35 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","7","35","0","1"

Most of my frustration comes from the design of the interface, the unit selection, the movements, the need to assign something to your city every time it finishes a job. I just lose the track of my troops, because of the many automatic camera movements, and I have not the biggest empire and army yet. It is also very disappointing how the units fight each other, with a close up animation, which have about 3-4 variations, and sometimes I do not know why I cannot destroy a squad of even powered rifleman with my own. It is complex, but sometimes it is hard to find the information that is needed to understand the situation.\n\nMy Score: 7/10","June 12, 2014","false","5.0"," 6 of 46 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","6","46","0","0"

I suspect less man hours were put into planning some land invasions.  Beyond the Sword is the expansion pack that made everything about Civilization IV better, plus is necessary for some of the really good mods outs there such as Fall from Heaven.\n\nSo, I am certainly going to recommend it.  It is a strategy game that got a lot right.  The gameplay mechanics encourage expansion, but simultaneously impose reasonable limts.  New technologies can alter the way the game is played, making a very different strategic picture through railroads, airplanes, and democracy.  The religion mechanic adds great flavor and some interesting gameplay.  Diplomacy is easy to understand, but hard to exploit.\n\nThere are some flaws.  Get to far behind and you've lost, even if it takes another 100 years for the axe to actually fall.  The end game becomes a bit to grindy with units becoming to common.\n\nStill, the hundreds of hours I've spent playing this game is a testament to both its addictiveness and its quality.","December 5, 2013","true","200.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great people generation fails, Great prophets are the only thing I seem to get, and I would like to have a custom history system, to view my games like real history.

I can say with certinty that the AI is much harder in this game. In previous games I could win on the hardest settings. In this game I lose on the easy settings. This can get frustrating as you can easilly sink at least three hours into one game and lose.

This game is complicated and the expansions only make it more complicated. The appeal here is to a player who has an intellectual bent, who likes a game experience that takes its time and requires considerable attention to detail. Turns can take upwards of 15 minutes on a larger map with dozens of simultaneous factors to keep in mind.

Beyond the Sword adds ten new civilizations (examples: Korea, Byzantine, Holy Rome), 5 new leaders (examples: Lincoln, Stalin), some scenarios from modders of Civilization IV (including the fantastic Rhye's and Fall of Civilization, or RFC), and gameplay additions that make the game funner and more addicting than the original Civilization IV. RFC is amazing. In RFC, you can choose a civ, and play as them, in world history. You can also change history - for example, the Germans winning World War II, or the Mongolian Empire reaching from Africa to China. I have to criticize, though, that, if you want to play as, say, the Americans, I am pretty sure you have to select another Civ and play as them until 1775. But other than that, RFC is good!

It looks pretty old too, but you can get better textures out there if you need it. This is not game about being "wowed" anyway, so whatever. RNJesus happens to visit you during a few combat dicerolls too, if you know what I mean.\n\nWhat it does have is the classic Vanilla Civ IV gameplay, refined by all the expansion packs, which means it has a ton of content of all sorts (civs, leaders, wonders, buildings) and a few added game systems such as espionage.\n\nIf you wanna experience the megalomaniac thrill of being the emperor of a budding civ, expanding, teching and trying to outmanoeuver some vile AIs, you're gonna like it.

The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth "civilization simulator." You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I’ll just stop here.\n\nOne of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I’ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you “get haxed” and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes “who can have the most units crammed into a tile.” Your (and your opponents’) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you’ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.\n\nThis expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye’s and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it’s as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen. You won’t regret spending the money to buy this, especially when it is on sale.","January 2, 2014","true","57.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Civilization IV, beyond the sword improved upon the already solid foundation of Civilization IV. Beyond the sword with its diverse number of nations, diverse technologies, and many new ways to win including such things as the early (ish) diplomatic victory of the Apolostic Palace wonder, where instead of just general popularity religious popularity and religious zeal was a key factor in your victory. On top of all this Civilization beyond the sword has an excellent mod called "Realism Invictus" being devolped to this day still for it that i have personally played and fell in love with.\n\nin short summary, Civilization IV had great balanced gameplay, and while some civilizations had been and are better than others the random map scenarios help to balance things out and really i've never felt defeated just because of the civilization i was given, you can make any civilization work and the technology tree and the culture and the politics of the world you inhabit all flow together elegantly and never conflict with anything you wish to achieve with your civlization. Civilization Beyond the Sword fleshed out that elegant weaving of fabrics and made it a vibrant cloth, giving more technologies and more diverse civilizations adding more to the already great mixture. It gave you more of the civilization you wanted and deserved. Then the player-made contributions add the icing on top of the cake adding a new layer of depth and experience that continues to grow to do this day.\n\nIF YOU ENJOY HISTORY EVEN SLIGHTLY, CIVILIZATION IV BEYOND THE SWORD IS THE GREATEST SELF-SERVICE YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF.

In addition to the 'Great Generals' units of Civ IV Warlords, BtS expands on the importance of Espionage, and the introduction of the 'Corporations' allows players a 'second attempt' at 'religion', but with more devastating economic effects.\n\nSimply put: If you're not a twitch gamer, but a strategic gamer who likes deep, encompassing games, then this game is for you.","July 18, 2014","true","74.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you see this on sale with civ iv (which you need as BTS is not standalone) pick it up for the pure nostalgia feel.

I suspect less man hours were put into planning some land invasions.  Beyond the Sword is the expansion pack that made everything about Civilization IV better, plus is necessary for some of the really good mods outs there such as Fall from Heaven.\n\nSo, I am certainly going to recommend it.  It is a strategy game that got a lot right.  The gameplay mechanics encourage expansion, but simultaneously impose reasonable limts.  New technologies can alter the way the game is played, making a very different strategic picture through railroads, airplanes, and democracy.  The religion mechanic adds great flavor and some interesting gameplay.  Diplomacy is easy to understand, but hard to exploit.\n\nThere are some flaws.  Get to far behind and you've lost, even if it takes another 100 years for the axe to actually fall.  The end game becomes a bit to grindy with units becoming to common.\n\nStill, the hundreds of hours I've spent playing this game is a testament to both its addictiveness and its quality.","December 5, 2013","true","200.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halo_reach/recommended/8800/","halo_reach","XBOX1 MASTER RACE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halo_reach/","14 products in account","Best expansion for the best PC game out there. The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth "civilization simulator." You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I’ll just stop here.\n\nOne of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I’ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you “get haxed” and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes “who can have the most units crammed into a tile.” Your (and your opponents’) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you’ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.\n\nThis expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game.

Every aspect of the game is intresting and their is plentiful hours to enjoy. I for one think that the dynamics of religion and neighbouring civilizations really express how you can shape the world around you within the game. The degree of managing individual cities drawed me in the most, I loved how you can specialise various cities to produce military units, reasearch and gold. Not to mention the fact that you can excel in technology were your empire has tanks and modern infantry while your rivals basic unit is a musketman. Also making other civilizations my puppet states was a loving feature everyone can enjoy too. The soundtrack is also enjoyable also as it made me a slight fan of classical music even though CIV IV practically introduced me too it.\n\nRegardless this game deserves a 9/10 and I think everyone should try this game at least once even if you don't like strategy.","March 26","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had my eyes on this game ever since I played Civilization III on my friend's computer (and lost epicly). This game is really a cornerstone of strategy games, you will spend 100s of hours just wanting to play one more turn, and to lead your Civilization to victory. The learning curve here is steeper than it is for Civilization V, but you will get a full strategy experience that is very satisfying (even though Civ V BNW is very fun, it can't match the depth of Civ IV).","August 7, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Civilization IV, beyond the sword improved upon the already solid foundation of Civilization IV. Beyond the sword with its diverse number of nations, diverse technologies, and many new ways to win including such things as the early (ish) diplomatic victory of the Apolostic Palace wonder, where instead of just general popularity religious popularity and religious zeal was a key factor in your victory. On top of all this Civilization beyond the sword has an excellent mod called "Realism Invictus" being devolped to this day still for it that i have personally played and fell in love with.\n\nin short summary, Civilization IV had great balanced gameplay, and while some civilizations had been and are better than others the random map scenarios help to balance things out and really i've never felt defeated just because of the civilization i was given, you can make any civilization work and the technology tree and the culture and the politics of the world you inhabit all flow together elegantly and never conflict with anything you wish to achieve with your civlization. Civilization Beyond the Sword fleshed out that elegant weaving of fabrics and made it a vibrant cloth, giving more technologies and more diverse civilizations adding more to the already great mixture. It gave you more of the civilization you wanted and deserved.

Every aspect of the game is intresting and their is plentiful hours to enjoy. I for one think that the dynamics of religion and neighbouring civilizations really express how you can shape the world around you within the game. The degree of managing individual cities drawed me in the most, I loved how you can specialise various cities to produce military units, reasearch and gold. Not to mention the fact that you can excel in technology were your empire has tanks and modern infantry while your rivals basic unit is a musketman. Also making other civilizations my puppet states was a loving feature everyone can enjoy too. The soundtrack is also enjoyable also as it made me a slight fan of classical music even though CIV IV practically introduced me too it.\n\nRegardless this game deserves a 9/10 and I think everyone should try this game at least once even if you don't like strategy.","March 26","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have installed it on every computer I have owned since it came out. The Steam play time reflects that I played from my CD-ROM copy of CIV 4 complete until recently when my install discs became incompatible with Windows 10. I feel that the Civ 4 gameplay is the most balanced and addictive of Civ 4 series games, with strong ai, diplomacy, building, expansion, religion, commerce, and war all providing great depth that makes playing just one more turn addictive. In my opnion, only the great Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri has comparable all around strengths and innovations for its time, Moreover, Civ 4 has given me unparalleled replay value because it is the most modable Civ game.  Besides the usual tweaks of the vanilla game on can find in Civ 5, Civ 4's structure enabled the creation of many complete overhaul mods that transformed CIv 4 with new gameplay and graphics, including historical, fantasy, and sci-fi mods. For example, in my opinion, the Civ 4 fantasy mod, Fall From Heaven 2, remains of one of the best 4x strategy fantasy pc games ever made.\n\nCiv IV, however, does show its age when compared to more refined interface of Civ V. Civ 4's maps of square titles and battles with stacks of units on the same tile, also give a less sophisticated first impression. However, when I compare the gameplay between Civ 4 and Civ 5, I find Civ 4 AI is usually more challenging, sophisticated, and strategically effective than in Civ 5, with regard to both combat and non-combat activities alike.\n\nInstall Civ 4 complete (Civ IV, Civ IV Warlords, and Civ IV Beyond the Sword) and join the addiction!\n\nNote: I have reviewed Civ 4 and its expansions as a single game.\n","April 10","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Square tiles, not those obnoxious hexagonal ones, also the amount of bugs compared to the newer games tends to cero.\n\nThe only bad points I find in this game are how difficult it is installing mods, no steam achievements, and there's a point in the game when it's only about making more and more tanks.","April 18","true","85.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the average gamer, you could say.\n\nMy gaming experience started with Dune 2, followed by the Settlers, C&C and Red Alert. I found nothing as interesting and addictive since then. You may know what I mean.\n\nAnd then I got sucked into Civ5 2 years ago. I've never played a TBS, only RTS. But I really loved it. Now I learned that CIV6 is scheduled for later this year, but at the same time I learned that some hard-core CIV fans prefer CIV4 over the later versions.\n\nI wanted to know why. And now I so do! If you are like me, you will love CIV4!\n\nWhat do I mean? I mean if you prioritise the plot of the game, the depth of the scenario over the graphics, this game is so for you (not that the graphics is bad!)\n\nIf you actually want to think whilst playing, if you like complexity, if you enjoy devising long-term strategies and short-term tactics, you will love CIV4.\n\nHave fun!\n\nP.S.
